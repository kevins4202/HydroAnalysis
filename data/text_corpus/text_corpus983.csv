4915,karst pathways and fluvial pathways control hydrology in shallow fluviokarst basins and numerical modelling of fluviokarst is seldom reported in this study we developed a combined discrete continuum fluviokarst numerical model by simulating surface river routing in stream swallet sources and sinks epikarst storage and dynamic transfer matrix bedrock interactions and closed conduit phreatic flow we applied the model to the cane run royal spring basin in kentucky usa model evaluation indicated that spring discharge alone inadequately constrained model pathways and uncertainty instead multi objective calibration integrating riverine discharge and well head data from multiple locations assisted in identifying sensitive parameters p 0 05 multi objectives improved representation of stream cave connectivity and limited prior knowledge biases of the system but was computationally expensive with 168 h required on a high performance cluster results provided evidence for a mature fluviokarst basin with well defined fracture conduit network and phreatic aquifer residence times of karst pathways vary by five orders of magnitude ranging from less than one hour in vertical swallets 12 7 h in longitudinal conduits 12 7 days in the vadose zone and epikarst and 142 7 days in the bedrock matrix results suggest arrival of source waters to the subsurface systems is disconnected in time from the springflow response model simulations show a dimensionless vertical to longitudinal conveyance ratio helps predict swallets linking the fluvial and karst systems transferability of the developed model and other karst models is discussed relative to availability of information for karst basins keyword fluviokarst 1 introduction many hydrologic pathways are possible in shallow fluviokarst basins because both fluvial and karst processes exist fluvial control of pathways includes runoff generation and routing of surface water whereas karst control of pathways includes density and size of sinkholes and subsurface fractures for dynamic storage and transfer of groundwater further hydrologic connectivity between fluvial and karst pathways is facilitated by in stream fluviokarst swallets which act as vertical conveyors connecting surface and subsurface waters at rapid timescales see fig 1 the concept of the many potential hydrologic pathways of fluviokarst has taken shape in recent years phillips and walls 2004 husic et al 2017a 2017b however the complexity of pathways and their uncertain connectivity adds difficulty to predicting water budgets and pollutant fate numerical modelling of fluviokarst hydrologic processes provides one method to help fill knowledge gaps for fluviokarst numerical modelling of karst basins receives some criticism because models can easily become data starved over parameterized or contain deficiencies in model structure e g hartmann et al 2014 chang et al 2019 nevertheless numerical modelling results can be useful and defendable when the model is appropriately scaled represents known morphology and processes in the basin has a wide variety of data and considers all acceptable solutions during model evaluation hartmann et al 2014 to remedy potential karst modelling pitfalls it is helpful to study watersheds with extensive datasets when karst models with increased complexity are used to address knowledge gaps of processes we develop a combined discrete continuum numerical model for mature fluviokarst that simulates connectivity between surface streams and karst groundwater pathways combined discrete continuum models have been developed for karst systems in recent years these models include distributed subroutines and discrete element components the distributed subroutines follow process based modelling of the groundwater domain and solves the governing equations with numerical methods hartmann et al 2014 the discrete elements are applied to solve the governing equations for flow through discrete conduit networks chang et al 2015 qiu et al 2019 kavousi et al 2020 for example chang et al 2015 and kavousi et al 2020 apply modflow cfp with conduit flow process subroutines to simulate groundwater drainage to conduits qiu et al 2019 applied the process based adaptive watershed simulator plus community land model paws clm and treated karst conduits as subsurface open channels draining the surrounding rock matrix to our knowledge few if any studies develop a fluviokarst specific combined discrete continuum numerical model the model herein accomplishes this task by coupling three sub models an upper groundwater model divides the groundwater domain to sub basins and then distributes each sub basin vertically a lower groundwater models solves the governing equations for discrete fractures swallets and conduits a surface stream model simulates the fluvial system aboveground and interacts with karst swallets unique features of the fluviokarst model include the numerical treatment of swallets located in the stream corridor and the numerous conditions for which they can exist i e filling overtopping swallets reversing flow emptying discrete elements for fractures swallets and conduits and coupling the timescales of water through the three sub models to simulate both surface streamflow and groundwater flow across pathways stream routing epikarst flows vadose zone transport fracture flow and conduit flow consider fluid continuity and transport formula controlling each process zimmerman and yeo 2000 jain 2001 niswonger et al 2006 tritz et al 2011 rooij et al 2013 chen and goldscheider 2014 the model is evaluated quantitatively and thereafter discussed regarding multi objective calibration needs data inputs and parameterization needs and computational costs we apply our formulated numerical model to investigate fluviokarst hydrology including aquifer structure hydrologic pathways and in stream swallet features knowledge of aquifer structure for fluviokarst can add understanding of the spectrum of karst matrix and its features such as characterizing fracture conduit permeability and rock matrix permeability e g matthäi and belayneh 2004 hydrologic pathways in fluviokarst are hypothesized to show their imprint on springflow analogous to karst basins with little to no fluvial influence for example karst hydrologists often separate springflow into quick intermediate and slow flow pathways baedke and krothe 2001 kovács and perrochet 2008 fiorillo 2011 but extension of these concepts to fluviokarst basins is less clear in stream swallet features are a defining morphology of fluviokarst basins and in stream swallets are hypothesized to pirate surface streamflow to karst aquifers during some conditions and reverse flow from the aquifer to the surface during other conditions chen and goldscheider 2014 hensley et al 2014 however investigation of the in stream swallets is seldom reported which is likely due to difficulties in collecting measurements around the swallets and numerically coupling streamflow models with swallet flow and fracture conduit flow models to summarize the objectives of this paper were to i develop and evaluate a numerical model for shallow fluviokarst and report the model s input and calibration needs advantages and limitations and ii use the model to investigate fluviokarst hydrology including aquifer structure hydrologic pathways and in stream swallet features discussion of these goals provides the sub headings for the discussion section of the paper 2 model formulation the fluviokarst model simulates the hydrologic pathways defined and depicted for fluviokarst in fig 1 some pathways are one way pathways such as runoff and fracture overflow to the surface stream while many of the pathways are simulated to occur in either direction depending on hydraulics such fractures recharging the rock matrix or the rock matrix discharging to fractures the fluviokarst pathways and their possible directions are shown in fig 2 to accomplish the pathway simulation the formulation includes a surface stream model an upper groundwater model a lower groundwater model and numerical optimization the model formulation assumes external inputs to the model either from measurements or independent models including fluxes for soil water percolation to the epikarst runoff and lateral flow to the surface stream network and runoff and lateral flow entering land surface sinkholes see model workflow schematic in fig s1 the model formulation is currently limited to shallow epigenetic fluviokarst and we do not account for hypogenic recharge 2 1 surface stream model the surface stream model is formulated to route water through the stream network and account for water exchange with the lower groundwater model via fluviokarst swallets located in the stream corridor see fig 1 stream reach continuity is 1 dv str dt q str u p q sur q trib q lat q swall i n q str d n where v str is the volume of water stored in a stream reach q str u p and q str d n are water transferred in and out of the reach q sur q trib and q lat are lateral inputs to the stream from surface runoff tributaries considered external to the network and lateral soil flow respectively q swall i n is exchange between the surface stream and the lower groundwater model and the swallet flux is shown as a sink in eq 1 but can be a source term for swallet reversal q sur q trib and q lat are model inputs q str u p and q str d n are formulated using mannings equation and jones formula to account for non uniformity in the model chow 1959 jain 2001 q swall i n is input from the lower groundwater model 2 2 upper groundwater model the upper groundwater model simulates water storage and transfer for the epikarst unsaturated rock matrix and saturated rock epikarst continuity is 2 dv ep dt q perc q ep v q ep f where v ep is the volume of water stored in the epikarst t is time q perc is soil water percolation input to the epikarst q ep v is water transfer out of the epikarst to the vadose rock zone and q ep f is water transfer out to the fracture network q perc is a model input and q ep v is solved for in the vadose zone routing q ep f is modelled using the formulation of tritz et al 2011 and occurs when an activation threshold height is exceeded as 3 q ep f h ep h epth n ep δ t 1 f o r h ep h epth e l s e q ep f 0 where q ep is water discharge per unit area h ep is the height of water stored in the epikarst h epth is the threshold height when epikarst water will be routed to the fracture network and n ep is the epikarst porosity using the formulation of eq 3 an overflow is activated when the threshold is reached in the epikarst layer this approach is conceptually consistent with the model by tritz et al 2011 the epikarst transfers water vertically to the rock matrix i e vadose zone below but also includes a threshold such that water can overflow to the fracture network this is consistent with a near surface layer that is interconnected with fractures lateral flow is not considered explicitly however the fracture network grid is three dimensional and in a given time step immediately removes overflow to the fracture network vadose rock matrix is represented as a variably saturated granular rock entering from the epikarst and exiting to saturated rock multi layered water content is formulated with richard s equation assuming flow is gravity driven so the diffusive term can be removed simunek et al 1998 niswonger et al 2006 and formulating hydraulic conductivity with the brooks corey function as 4 d θ dt d dz k θ 5 k θ k s θ θ r θ s θ r where θ is the volumetric water content z is the vertical soil depth k θ is the hydraulic conductivity as a function of θ k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the rock mass θ r and θ s are is the residual and saturated volumetric water content of the rock mass and is the brooks corey exponent the product of the groundwater cell area and the hydraulic conductivity solved for at the boundaries provides fluxes from the epikarst to the vadose zone and vadose zone to saturated matrix i e q ep v and q v p a saturated rock in the upper groundwater model is used to represent the presence of aquitards that produce perched water tables and continuity for the saturated rock is 6 d v pa dt q v p a q pa f where v pa is the volume of water stored in a perched aquifer q v p a is vadose zone input to the perched aquifer and q pa f is the exchange flow between the perched aquifer and fracture network the latter is formulated with darcy s law as 7 q pa f k s dh dx where dh is the difference in elevation of the saturated rock head and fracture network head dh and q pa f are negative when the fracture head is higher than the perched saturated rock and dx is the flow path distance and is a function of spacing between fractures 2 3 lower groundwater model the lower groundwater model simulates water storage and transfer for the fracture network swallets the conduit network and the lower saturated matrix the fracture network is represented as plate like void spaces in the rock and continuity is 8 dv f dt q sink q ep f q pa f q f c q f m q over where v f is the volume of water stored in the fracture network q sink is water transfer entering the fractures via land surface sinkholes q f c and q f m are transfers out of the fracture network to conduit and the lower saturated rock matrix respectively although both terms can be negative in eq 8 indicating sources rather than sinks and q over is fracture network overflow manifested as seeps and hillside springs in karst terrain q f c is formulated with the cubic law for fracture flow snow 1969 long et al 1985 bear et al 2012 zimmerman and yeo 2000 as 9 q f c ρ g 6 μ dh dx n b 3 where ρ is water density g is gravity μ is viscosity dh dx is the hydraulic gradient and nandb are fracture density and aperture q f m is formulated with darcy s law similarly to eq 7 q over is formulated for the condition when the hydraulic head of the fracture is greater than the epikarst threshold height h f h epth because this indicates both the epikarst and fractures are full as 10 q over q ep f h f h epth 3 n b δ t 1 the fluviokarst swallets and phreatic conduits are represented using a network of subterranean pipes approach jeannin 2001 shoemaker et al 2008 rooij et al 2013 chen and goldscheider 2014 swallets and conduits are formulated as equivalent diameter tortuous cylindrical segments and continuity is 11 d v s dt q swall i n q s a s 12 d v c dt q c u p q s a s q f c q m c q c d n where v s and v c are the volume of water in the swallet and conduit segments q s and a s are the swallet velocity and area and q c u p and q c d n are the upstream and downstream fluxes to the conduit segment q swall i n is defined in eq 1 and is formulated with a weir equation e g gupta 2016 when the swallet is not full when the swallet is full the free surface of the stream is the swallet head q swall i n q s a s and is solved for as part of the lower groundwater model in eq 12 q m c is exchange between the lower saturated matrix and conduit and is formulated with darcy s law similarly to eq 7 the swallet conduit network is formulated using the nodal approach as 13 δ e f s c l s c τ s c d s c q s c 2 2 g where δ e is the energy difference across a swallet s or conduit c f is the friction factor d and l are diameter and length of the segment and τ is tortuosity of the swallet or conduit the lower saturated matrix is formulated similarly as the upper matrix as variable volume storage with a lower permeability than fractures and conduits white 1999 hartmann et al 2013 and continuity is 14 d v m dt q vadose q m c q pump where v m is the volume of water in the matrix 2 4 numerical formulation the numerical formulation uses a combined discrete continuum approach the groundwater surface water basin is divided to spatial grids surface stream networks swallets and conduits are modeled discretely the epikarst fracture network unsaturated zone and saturated matrix are modeled as continuums at each time step the surface stream model upper groundwater model and lower groundwater model are solved following the method in fig 3 the surface stream network is solved at each time step using flood wave routing considering non uniform flow jain 2001 and surface inputs from runoff and lateral flow transfer with the lower groundwater model is solved either using weir equations or solved in the lower groundwater model depending on whether the swallets are partially full or full respectively the upper groundwater model is solved for each groundwater cell considering input from soil percolation the model calculates the number of vadose layers in the vertical so the cfl condition will not be violated and solves the richards equation through iteration for the discretized cells e g simunek et al 1998 niswonger et al 2006 output from the upper groundwater model include exchanges for epikarst to fractures and saturated matrix to fractures and these fluxes are inputs to the lower groundwater model during each time step the lower groundwater model simultaneously solves a system of equations setup across all discretized groundwater cells for each time step with inputs from the stream model and upper groundwater model for each cell the system of equations includes an equivalent porous medium approach for the fracture network equations in each groundwater cell snow 1969 kresic 2010 a similar continuum approach is used for the saturated matrix in each cell and the discretized swallet and conduit nodal approach is solved across all groundwater cells optimization solves the system for conduit swallet matrix and fracture fluxes static pressure heads in the fractures conduits and swallets without boundary conditions and the potentiometric surface of the saturated matrix in some time steps optimization is aided by boundary conditions for the swallets when they are full conduits that daylight at springs and a land surface elevation as a maximum fracture head when seeps and hillside springs occur optimization of the lower groundwater model uses the trust region with dogleg method with 1000 numerical iterations dennis and schnabel 1996 the algorithm starts with initial guesses for unknowns to define a point in the spherical trust region that adjusts size at each iteration the initial guesses at the first time step are set intuitively then the results assisted in defining the initial guesses for successive time steps the tolerance is set to 1x10 6 during optimization method and is set to one for the two norm of the optimized solution 3 model application 3 1 study site the cane run royal spring fluviokarst basin in the inner bluegrass region of kentucky usa was the study site for model application the study site was chosen because the basin classifies as mature fluviokarst with many morphologic features of epigenetic karst shown in fig 1 occurring to some degree there exists many published datasets for model setup and calibration collected from tracer tests flow gaging lidar mapping electrical resistivity mapping well data collection downhole videos acoustic measurements of caves geologic and soil surveys water budgets and water quality measurements cressman 1967 spangler 1982 thrailkill and gouzie 1984 cressman and peterson 1986 thrailkill et al 1991 drahovzal et al 1992 taylor 1992 paylor and currens 2004 zhu et al 2011 currens et al 2015 sawyer et al 2015 tibouo 2016 husic et al 2017a 2017b 2019a 2019b bandy et al 2019 and the basin is located just 10 km from the kentucky geological survey s headquarters and the university of kentucky the cane run watershed fig 4 is gently rolling topography with sinkholes across the landscape paylor and currens 2004 the land use is agricultural and much of it is horse farm pasture and urban suburban ukcafe 2018 the climate is temperate mat 13 0 0 7 c map 1 170 200 mm the soil is silt loam 40 of the watershed has shallow surface slopes 0 3 50 has moderate slopes 3 6 and 10 has steeper slopes 6 cane run creek is a surface stream originating in lexington kentucky and flows northwest the stream and tributaries share most of its drainage area with royal spring groundwater basin 58 km2 through swallets that connect surface water to the underlying karst aquifer feeding royal spring 60 swallets were surveyed in cane run creek see fig 4 the swallet equivalent diameters at the streambed range from 10 to 100 cm flow pirating by the swallets causes cane run creek to be dry for 90 of the year husic et al 2017a royal spring karst groundwater basin is formed in middle ordovician aged limestones with interbeds of thin shales thrailkill and gouzie 1984 cressman and peterson 1986 epikarst features are visible throughout the watershed in naturally exposed karren as well as roadcuts husic et al 2017b limestone members formed with high clay or silt content locally act as aquitards and were previously mapped e g the cane run bed brannon member cressman 1967 miller 1967 macquown and dobrovolny 1968 water flow from the fluviokarst features and limestone bedrock converges to a phreatic conduit 15 to 20 m below the ground surface that flows northwest and surfaces at royal spring thrailkill et al 1991 paylor and currens 2004 zhu et al 2011 evidence from resistivity measurements well drilling directly intersecting the conduit and base level elevations suggest the conduit profile follows a bedding plane approximately 14 m below cane run bed thrailkill et al 1991 landrum et al 2013 royal spring 243 m a s l mean discharge is 0 7 m3 s 1 conveys perennial flow from the phreatic conduit currens et al 2015 3 2 model spatial domain and inputs the model spatial domain see fig 5 was constructed using inputs detailed in tables 1 and 2 collected from measurements in the field geospatial data and geology reports available data used included sinkhole maps aquifer boundary maps land use maps stream flow network maps soil maps topography models mapping of stream bathymetry and geologic cross sections and conduit profiles the surface watershed fig 5a was constructed using the digital elevation model and sinkhole maps were input to provide sinkhole locations and mapped drainage areas stream cross section and longitudinal dimensions were input using analyses of a 0 5 m topographic model in stream swallets were input using a 20 m buffer around the stream network masked over the sinkhole geospatial model swallet dimensions were input using data from a field survey puckett 2015 the soil layer covering the limestone bedrock was mapped using digitized soil survey data the epikarst layer was constructed immediately below the soil layer and the epikarst thickness was input using results from soil electrical resistivity landrum et al 2013 the groundwater basin boundary followed a model constructed using groundwater tracer studies taylor 1992 paylor and currens 2004 the limestone bedrock layer and its fracture network were constructed below the epikarst layer and extended below the primary conduit fig 5b the geometry of fractures and density of fractures across the bedrock were left as parameters in the model because our existing resistivity measurements could not resolve these characteristics the cane run bed aquitard was input based on geologic maps and survey data analyses of stage recordings from wells in perched aquifers and borehole logs the primary conduit that daylights at royal spring was input to follow a bedding plane approximately 14 m below the cane run bed for most of its length until the local anticline near the spring fig 5c the elevation of royal spring was used as a maximum conduit elevation discretized spatial inputs included see table 2 number of watershed surface cells conduit lengths l c conduit elevation z c groundwater cell area a cell stream bed height relative to conduit h pa epikarst bottom height relative to conduit h f m a x maximum lateral distance for fracture and matrix flow d x max number of groundwater wells number of stream reaches stream bed width b stream bed slope s and bankfull heights h bkf a number of additional inputs were specified using literature the discharge coefficient for weir flow c w into the swallet while the swallet is not full was selected based on reported broad crested weir coefficients gupta 2008 the value of the brooks corey exponent was assumed to be equal to the value used by brooks and corey 1964 in the brooks corey equation the residual moisture content θ r in the unsaturated zone was assumed to be zero as suggested by simunek et al 1998 to reduce the number of model parameters the pump rate in each groundwater cell was the product of the pump rate parameter and the number of active wells in the groundwater cell identified using a geospatial dataset inputs for surface runoff surface routing and soil water percolation were estimated using the soil water assessment tool or swat neitsch et al 2011 swat s deep aquifer percolation fraction rchrg dp was set to 1 to negate the shallow aquifer and prevent baseflow to streams since these processes are simulated in the stream and groundwater code this approach is similar to the work by malagò et al 2016 where swat surface fluxes were used as inputs to a karst groundwater model meteorological inputs were available from the bluegrass airport noaa id usw00093820 3 3 model parameterization the numerical model was parameterized using 19 parameters see table 3 groundwater parameter ranges for flow in limestone were considered the initial range for the matrix porosity n m was selected based on values for limestone bedrock in karst aquifers williams 2008 the range for saturated hydraulic conductivity of the limestone bedrock k s was selected based on minimum and maximum values of hydraulic conductivity reported for limestone bedrock by domenico and schwartz 1998 the range for epikarst porosity n ep was selected based on values suggested in epikarst literature klimchouk 2004 williams 2008 the maximum value in the initial epikarst fracture threshold height parameter h epth was selected based on the estimated maximum thickness of the epikarst layer landrum et al 2013 we used active wells in the watershed and pumping rates for the region to help parameterize the pumping rate we mapped the active wells the locations of all wells in the groundwater basin were identified using a dataset provided by the kentucky geological survey groundwater data repository this set of wells was filtered to only include active wells see figure below and fig s2 in the revised paper then we parameterize pumping on what was reasonable to come from the wells in reference to pumping rate data in central kentucky this range of rates and number of active wells provided the initial range for the pumping rate parameter in the model see table 3 the maximum pump rate was selected based on high end values of reported pumping rates from wells in the greir member carey and stickney 2005 swat run parameter ranges for surface hydrology inputs were generated from swat using 25 different acceptable model runs detailed in al aamery et al 2016 and al aamery et al 2018 swat was calibrated using swat cup sufi2 algorithm abbaspour et al 2007 the algorithm is simulated and then retains acceptable model runs i e r2 0 6 from these acceptable runs we chose 25 runs to provide the largest possible ranges and account for uncertainty propagated from swat through the fluviokarst model additional karst groundwater and surfacewater parameter ranges were also specified the maximum value for fracture density n was selected based on reported fracture densities common in epikarst zones and the minimum value was selected based on lower end values reported for karstified limestone bedrock klimchouk 2004 the range for fracture aperture b was selected based on a range of fracture apertures that resulted from a karst evolution model worthington and ford 2009 the range for manning s roughness coefficient n were selected based on values for clean straight reaches to very weedy reaches chow 1959 the initial range for the flood wave coefficient k s was selected based on the maximum theoretical range identified in jain 2001 the initial ranges for friction factors f c f s were selected based on the range of friction factors appearing on the moody diagram moody 1944 the value for conduit tortuosity τ c was assumed to be within the ranges of conduit tortuosity reported for looping cave systems and water table cave systems by jouves et al 2017 ranges for both the fracture lateral distance adjustment factor d x f and the matrix lateral distance adjustment factor d x m were assumed to have a maximum value of one corresponding to the centroid based distance for each groundwater cell and a low value corresponding to a lateral distance approximately equal to the height of the groundwater table initial ranges for conduit and swallet diameters dc and ds respectively were based on measurements reported in husic et al 2017a and puckett 2015 the range of perched fracture flow threshold hpa th was specified from a low value to a maximum depth of bedrock above the aquitard we tested the aquitard s sensitivity using different low hydraulic conductivities for the aquitard however this had no impact on the results therefore the aquitard is treated as impermeable the three dimensional fracture network crosses through the aquitard therefore the perched aquifer at the lower portion of the vadose zone only drains through the fracture network when an aquitard member is present this model parameterization was based on the concept that the fractures in the bedrock extend through limestone members formed with high clay or silt content but diffuse flow through the surrounding rock matrix is zero 3 4 model simulations model simulations were performed using matlab r2017a on an institutionally shared high performance computing cluster with 9000 processor cores 35 tb of ram and 1 3 pb of high speed disk storage preparation of geospatial inputs pre processing and post processing of results was performed using arcmap 10 4 1 arcswat 2012 version 10 4 19 swat cup version 5 1 6 2 and matlab r2017a on a pc with intel xeon cpu of two logical processors with 3 60 ghz and ram of 64 0 gb 3 5 model calibration validation sensitivity and uncertainty analyses fig 6 details the calibration and validation procedure multi objective calibration was carried out using four stations including 1 springflow at royal spring usgs 03288110 adjusted for a raw water intake upstream of the weir 2 streamflow stage data and a stage discharge curve at the surface stream outlet husic et al 2017a 3 a monitoring well directly intersecting the primary conduit and 4 a monitoring well intersecting a perched aquifer the steps of model calibration were to i reduce the initial parameter space using an optimization algorithm and visual inspection of results and ii find optimal parameter values that met objective criteria including traditional statistical measures and visual fit sobol sequencing was used to generate the parameter values for sets of 1000 model runs to refine parameter ranges saltelli et al 2008 and the sufi2 optimization algorithm and visual fit was used to adjust parameter ranges abbaspour et al 2007 in stage 2 optimal parameter fit was found by generating 10 000 parameter sets using sobol sequencing and the refined parameter ranges from semi manual calibration the karst model ran for the time period from january 1 2010 to may 1 2019 using the first year of simulation as model spin up five years for calibration and four years as validation for simulations on a monthly time scale moriasi et al 2007 recommends nash sutcliff efficiency nse 0 5 and absolute percent bias pbias 25 as acceptable performance criteria model simulations on higher resolution time scales e g hourly are known to have lower values of performance metrics when compared to performance of the model when data is aggregated for a lower resolution time scale engel et al 2007 moriasi et al 2007 therefore model hourly runs with nse 0 2 and pbias 25 for spring discharge and nse 0 2 and pbias 25 for streamflow were considered acceptable also the p factor and r factor were evaluated following the method of abbaspour et al 2007 the p factor is percentage of data bracketed by the 95 prediction uncertainty measured at 2 5 and 97 5 percentiles and the r factor is the ratio of the average distance between the two percentiles divided by the standard deviation of corresponding observed variable both global and local sensitivity were performed because literature suggests the importance of both approaches saltelli et al 2008 abbaspour et al 2007 ceriotti et al 2018 for example ceriotti et al 2018 showed joint application of local and global sensitivity analyses was needed to characterize the importance ranking of model parameters and hence propagation of uncertainty in their subsurface water model further in our work the modelling platform was new and we needed to understand the relative role of each model input ceriotti et al 2018 so local sensitivity helped provide justification of the linkages global sensitivity was measured using a multiple regression model this was chosen based on the ease of performance and a lower number of model simulations required to calculate the sensitivity the multiple regression model regresses the parameters values sampled by the sobol sequences against the values of the objective functions t tests were used to identify the significance effect of each parameter on the objective function abbaspour et al 2007 model performance was assumed to be sensitive to parameters with a p value less than 0 05 local sensitivity was investigated to test the influence of the 19 parameters on simulating the four objectives including spring flow streamflow and piezometer heads in the perched aquifer well and conduit well the parameters were changed one at a time on the bases of 25 75 150 and 200 parameter values for the parameters found in the most optimal model run the decision of influence versus non influence was based on the percent bias metric and visual inspection of the results the local sensitivity results were built using the observations from 10 01 2012 to 10 01 2013 only because we have all observations for the four stations for this period model uncertainty as measured by evaluating the mean and standard deviation of acceptable model runs for each time step additionally the average distance of the 95 prediction uncertainty 95 ppu was evaluated the 95 ppu was constructed using the 2 5 and 97 5 quantiles of the simulated values across all acceptable model runs for each time step abbaspour et al 2007 3 6 model results model evaluation results showed the model s ability to simulate four calibration objectives including stream flow spring discharge the groundwater level for the perched aquifer and the groundwater level for the deeper aquifer results showed the model in general performed well for these four objectives see fig 7 and parameters in table 3 when acceptable runs were included in the results i e ns 0 2 and absolute pbias 25 for the 4 stations for the model evaluation from the 10 000 simulations in the final production run when compared to literature the model performance is good to very good objective function values from our hourly model runs are comparable to objective function values of daily streamflow models considered acceptable gassman et al 2007 the objective functions for spring discharge for our best model run surpass the satisfactory values subjected by moriasi et al 2007 for models with a monthly time step watershed scale models have significantly reduced performance measures when using a shorter duration time step gassman et al 2007 moriasi et al 2007 which further substantiates that the model performs well uncertainty assessment also showed acceptable performance of the model fig 7 the average thickness of the 95 ppu p factor was 0 27 0 18 0 62 and 0 41 for spring flow streamflow perched aquifer well and conduit well respectively according to abbaspour et al 2007 p factor of less than one is sufficient to decrease uncertainty and the p factor values of the hourly timestep model satisfies this rule the observed spring flow was contained by the 95 ppu r factor during 20 18 40 and 20 of the model timesteps for the four stations the values of the r factor are lower than what is recommended for models with a daily timestep abbaspour et al 2007 and the reason is attributed to the hourly time step of the model applied here and the potentially the low quality of some observations the observed spring discharge at the royal springs gage is downstream from where abstractions are made by the georgetown municipal water and wastewater service spring discharge data was adjusted for these abstractions however some error still exists the streamflow data recorded some biases that needed to be removed using visual assessment also the well data were collected at one point in the groundwater cell whereas a dense monitoring well network would be more desirable additionally the recommendations made by abbaspour et al 2007 are for models with a daily timestep and as previously mentioned recommended levels should be lower for models with an hourly time step sensitivity analyses showed that 14 out of 19 model parameters were sensitive to at least one of the four calibration objectives see table 4 water discharge at the spring was sensitive to four parameters for global sensitivity and 5 for local sensitivity nevertheless piezometric head at the conduit well was sensitive to 12 parameters when considering both global and local sensitivity analysis it is important to note the goodness of fit for the multiple regression in table 4 where r2 and r2 adj are within 5 of one another for each objective function these two measures are superior for the conduit well which make the results of sensitivity analysis in this station more reliable sensitivity analysis results also showed that the performance of simulated streamflow was sensitive to 10 of the 19 model parameters when considering global and local sensitivity analyses table 4 sensitivity of fracture aperture fracture density saturated hydraulic conductivity and matrix porosity on flow at the surface was not expected and suggests the subsurface karst at least partially impacts flow in the creek the perched aquifer piezometer height was sensitive to 7 out of the 19 parameters for global and local sensitivity analyses soil water percolation and runoff simulated with the swat ensemble did not show sensitivity on the four response variables simulated with the fluviokarst model the depth of water percolated from the soil to the sub surface ranged by as much as 35 to 31 of the ensemble monthly mean during june for the 25 simulations and the depth of water percolated annually ranged from 13 to 5 the ensemble annual mean the runoff depth ranged from 6 to 25 the ensemble monthly mean during june for the 25 simulations and runoff depth ranged annually ranged from 11 to 19 the ensemble annual mean however these ranges were not statistically significant for sensitivity of the surface and groundwater fluxes simulated the reason is attributed to the pre calibration carried out for swat so that runoff and soil transfer parameters were consistent with acceptable model runs reported for this region al aamery et al 2016 2018 ensemble average pathway results for the 9 years of simulation suggest that while both karst and fluvial pathways are important royal spring exports most of the water 63 from the coupled surface subsurface system whereas the surface stream outlet drains less 26 the remaining water balance 11 is pumped from the aquifer for human consumption or agricultural uses water exiting at royal spring consists of drainage transported by the fracture conduit network annual average sources of water to the fracture conduit network are dominated by recharge from soil vadose zone and perched aquifers 70 with lesser amounts from previously recharged water stored in the rock matrix 18 landscape sinkholes 9 and in stream swallets 3 water at the surface watershed outlet is dominated by runoff overflow during events time series results of hydrologic pathways see fig 8 show how each pathway imprints on the net shape of the spring and stream hydrographs but at different timescales storm pulses and slower percolation of water from the near surface aquifer are easily observed to imprint the hydrograph results in fig 8 storm pulses cause daily fluctuations of fracture flowrate and spring flowrate time series reflecting delivery from the swallet and sinkhole features slower percolation cause weekly to monthly time series structure of fracture flowrate and spring flowrate reflecting delivery from soil percolation vadose zone and perched aquifers fig 8 the slowest contributor to the time series structure is the rock matrix the rock matrix is shown to fill during storm events and wet periods via the fracture network and soil percolation this is seen in time series results as qf m is positive during storm events in fig 8g the rock matrix then drains and discharges to the fracture network during dry periods as is shown in fig 8g when qf m is negative during dry periods imprint of individual pathways also reflects their residence time residence times in karst pathways vary by five orders of magnitude table 5 ranging from less than one hour in vertical swallets 12 7 h in longitudinal conduits 12 7 days in the vadose zone and epikarst and 142 7 days in the bedrock matrix time series of the fracture conduit flow and springflow are identical highlighting the well defined fracture conduit network that dominates spring discharge 4 discussion 4 1 multi objective calibration and model advantages and disadvantages our model evaluation results suggest the need for multi objective calibration for the fluviokarst numerical model developed in this study using the model formulated and applied here we suggest including calibration of streamflow springflow and potentiometric surfaces of perched and deep aquifers sensitivity analyses of the model showed cumulatively 14 out of 19 model parameters were sensitive during calibration table 4 the sensitivity results offer confidence the acceptable model runs were providing a reasonable depiction of the subsurface rock structure and water pathways however using just one objective in calibration likely is insufficient for example global sensitivity analyses showed only 4 out of 19 parameters were sensitive when only springflow at royal spring was considered if the model was calibrated only with springflow the resultant parameterization may be sufficient for estimating springflow however the underlying aquifer structure and its pathways would be questionable review of the literature shows karst models sometimes use multiple model responses during calibration such as springflow and potentiometric surface via well stage pétré et al 2019 while more often karst studies only use one response during calibration such as only springflow or only groundwater level candela et al 2009 tritz et al 2011 ali et al 2012 doummar et al 2018 ou et al 2018 few karst or fluviokarst studies to our knowledge use surface water flows springflows and potentiometric surfaces in calibration and highlighting this importance for fluviokarst is one contribution of this paper recommendations for karst modelling previously suggested multi objective calibration using water chemistry and water isotopes hartmann et al 2014 our results extend this multi objective recommendation to surface and subsurface stage and discharge when information about fluviokarst pathways and aquifer structure are sought after one advantage of the fluviokarst model is its capability to simulate connectivity between surface stream hydraulics and cave hydraulics via the in stream swallets results suggest the model s utility for future fluviokarst basins when pathways connectivity is sought after the numerical structure and its optimization simultaneously simulate surface stream hydraulics unsaturated flow cave hydraulics and the connectivity between the surface and subsurface via the in stream swallets the benefit is the model outputs the potentiometric surface of perched and deep aquifers and flow results at the spring the stream and flowrates for the connected features these results for both water discharge and the potentiometric surface will be useful for applications of the model to predict downstream water delivery and water storage a second advantage of the model was our ability to omit prior biases of how the system might be behaving a priori we anticipated reasonable contributions to the spring hydrograph from sinking streams the fracture network and the saturated rock matrix as well as the behavior of swallets to pirate surface streamflow to the subsurface conduit our prior biases were based on previous karst literature that tends to emphasize the three end member concept in a number of papers e g pinault et al 2001 white 2002 worthington 2007 long 2009 and the optical nature of the swallets as sinks during our field reconnaissance nevertheless we recognized the potential for the fracture network or rock matrix to dominate subsurface flows as detailed in some papers matthäi and belayneh 2004 and the potential for flow reversal of fluviokarst features chen and goldscheider 2014 hensley et al 2014 including one named estavelle in our system thrailkill et al 1991 therefore we used a wide range of prior parameterization to consider all potential storage zones and transfers contribution to karst transfer phenomena optimization of the model structure allowed an un biased parameterization of the 20 pathways by using the multiple objective functions and sobol sequences the lack of bias in compartments is reflected in the spring water residence time that is deconvoluted across five orders of magnitude table 5 one disadvantage was the numerical model s computational expense simulation time for production runs was approximately 168 h on the computer cluster using 1 000 cores with 4 tb ram this has a monetary expense of approximately 15 k usd the computational cost was high due to simultaneously solving the system of non linear equations for the lower groundwater model via the trust region with dogleg method with 1 000 numerical iterations per model time step see methods section dennis and schnabel 1996 we tested other numerical techniques including line search optimization but we found no decrease in computation time and less accuracy future research might investigate further programing efficiency of our code but nevertheless computational costs will continue to be a disadvantage for process based models of fluviokarst systems another disadvantage was the numerical model s cost for input data in the model application the streams and karst conduit were well characterized from previous tracer tests lidar mapping electrical resistivity mapping well data collection isotope tracer studies data driven water budgets and routine long term and event based water quality measurements this prior information made setup of the model domain feasible however this vast array of data may not be available for other fluviokarst study sites 4 2 investigate fluviokarst aquifer structure pathways and in stream swallets modelling results of aquifer structure suggest classification of the basin as relatively mature fluviokarst with defining features that include in stream swallet features a well defined fracture conduit network and a shallow phreatic primary cave these features add to discussion of karst morphology and its hydrologic behavior in the context of features mentioned by others drysdale et al 2001 white 2002 massei et al 2003 phillips and walls 2004 herman et al 2008 husic et al 2017a 2017b the in stream swallet features provide connectivity between surface stream and subsurface flow and these features together with the presence of both a fluvial network and karst network demonstrate the fluviokarst classification phillips and walls 2004 the well defined fracture conduit network is evidenced by the high fracture matrix permeability ratio 105 to 108 from model optimization which places the system in the regime of fracture flow being important for subsurface karst drainage matthäi and belayneh 2004 this leads to a classification of the system as a mature karst aquifer with pronounced dissolution and multiple levels of porosity including turbulent conduit flow fracture flow and darcian flow white 1999 hartmann et al 2013 the karst spring is supplied by a primary phreatic conduit and characteristics of phreatic systems are adverse subsurface gradients controlling cave hydraulics and springflow drysdale et al 2001 white 2002 massei et al 2003 herman et al 2008 husic et al 2017a the dominant hydrologic pathways in the fluviokarst basin show analogy with groundwater flow in many karst basins more generally with some modification fig 9 shows the springflow together with i swallets and sinkhole flowrates entering the fracture conduit network from the surface ii soil epikarst and perched aquifer water entering from the upper groundwater model and iii rock matrix flowrate entering from the lower groundwater model these three flowrates in fig 9 are analogous to triunal transfer including quick intermediate and slow flow mentioned in karst studies e g pinault et al 2001 worthington 2007 long 2009 the pressure response of these three flowrates are felt immediately at the spring because the fracture conduit network is mature and the conduit is phreatic the activation and deactivation of pathways to the fracture conduit network shifts the pressure response and changes the shape of the spring hydrograph including inflections or sharp change in the recession gradient the pressure response of this fluviokarst aquifer is corroborated by other karst studies such the concept of stored water being pressed out of conduits on the rising limb of the hydrograph e g hartmann et al 2014 and the piston effect during extreme events e g lastennet and mudry 1997 milanović 2014 we point out the pressure response is immediately felt at the karst spring in fig 9 although the arrival of quick flow from swallets and sinkholes does not occur until later for example average transit time through fractures and conduits is approximately 22 and 13 h respectively see table 5 the pressure response of mature and phreatic fracture conduit networks suggests some modification when interpreting hydrologic pathways impact on springflow in fluviokarst basins similar to those in this study our modelling evidence supports the spring hydrograph as a four component sources including a pressure response exporting previously stored water arrival of underground runoff at the spring arrival of percolated soil and epikarst water at the spring and arrival of rock matrix water at the spring the arrival of these components is disconnected in time from springflow inflections because the system is phreatic hydrologists often interpret spring hydrograph inflections to indicate shifts in the origin of water from aquifer zones with differing porosity transfer and storage characteristics talarovich and krothe 1998 baedke and krothe 2001 pinault et al 2001 worthington 2007 fiorillo 2011 hosseini et al 2017 xu et al 2016 for example inflections in recession curves are reported to reflect a shift from runoff in the caves to water draining fractures to water draining rock matrix fiorillo 2014 xu et al 2016 scientists might consider modifying this interpretation by considering potential for disconnect between the pressure response and arrival of different source waters in stream swallets directly connect the surface stream network to the karst aquifer and the role of these features is unique to fluviokarst our modelling results suggest the in stream swallets only pirate flow from the surface stream to the karst subsurface and flow reversal does not occur for this system the overall impact of the in stream swallets was rather small and the in stream swallets are responsible for just 3 of water arriving at the primary spring the net influence is owed to the relatively small diameter of the in stream swallets and the average swallet diameter was just 26 cm for fluviokarst we define here a vertical to longitudinal conveyance ratio cr to describe the conveyance of water through the vertical swallets relative to the longitudinal conduits we define a dimensionless conveyance ratio as 15 c r i 1 n d s i 2 i 1 m d c j 2 where the diameters of n swallets and m conduits can be considered for the fluviokarst system cr equaled 0 3 for our optimal model run highlighting the small influence of swallet vertical conveyance relative to the conduit longitudinal conveyance for this system as further discussion we used our numerical model to investigate how changes in the conveyance ratio impacts contributions of the in stream swallets to springflow we set up hypothetical model simulations where swallet diameters and conduit diameters were varied to study the influence of the conveyance ratio on in stream swallet contribution to springflow swallet diameter was varied from 13 cm to 104 cm and conduit diameter was varied from 83 cm to 330 cm results in fig 10 show changes to the conveyance ratio shifts contributions of in stream swallets to the total annual springflow by nearly an order of magnitude we qualify that the exact numbers for percent contribution of swallets to springflow found in fig 10 is an artifact of the specific features of the study site and the model s parameterization nevertheless the order of magnitude influence of the conveyance ratio on in stream swallet contributions should be highlighted for fluviokarst swallet diameters and conduit diameters are extremely difficult to measure in the field especially for networks of swallets and phreatic conduits despite our field efforts the diameters were kept as parameters given our uncertainty surrounding the variables we point out the importance of estimating and parameterizing swallet and conduit diameters for investigating fluviokarst basins researchers might work towards improving methods for such estimates and for example tomographic methods serve as one potential tool 4 3 discussion of model transferability and its alternatives to other karst basins the model formulated and applied in this study allows us to discuss our new karst model more broadly in the context of existing karst modelling alternatives thereafter we discuss the applicability of transferring this model and other karst model alternatives to karst study sites with varying degrees of information as a brief review to provide context karst models are classified as distributed models reservoir models or hybrids of the two hartmann et al 2014 knöll et al 2020 ollivier et al 2020 distributed models refer to process based modelling where the domain is divided to groundwater cells and the governing equations are solved for flow in one or more directions using numerical methods e g doummar et al 2012 chang et al 2015 qiu et al 2019 kavousi et al 2020 reservoir models refer to storage discharge equations where one or more linear or nonlinear transfer functions are applied to represent flow from the total basin or decomposed zones i e quick intermediate slow flow transfer zones e g husic et al 2019b some authors refer to reservoir models as lumped models e g hartmann et al 2014 however we avoid this term because lumped is also used to indicate process based models averaged across basins or sub basins in hydrology singh 2012 discrete elements have been added to both distributed and reservoir model structures including discrete elements suggests knowledge of the conduit network structure throughout the basin more often discrete conduits are included in distributed structures chang et al 2015 qiu et al 2019 kavousi et al 2020 although discrete conduit modelling can also be coupled within a reservoir structure for the broader groundwater basin e g husic et al 2020 the model formulated and applied here classifies as a combined discrete continuum cdc fluviokarst numerical model and shows some characteristics of existing karst models as well as unique modelling features the model here is cdc fluviokarst because the upper groundwater model divides the groundwater domain to sub basins and then distributes each sub basin vertically the lower groundwater models solves the governing equations for discrete fractures swallets and conduits and the surface stream model simulates the fluvial system aboveground and interacts with karst swallets unique features include the numerical treatment of swallets discrete elements for fractures swallets and conduits and coupling the timescales of water through the model simplified features are the one dimensional vertical treatment of the upper groundwater model and treating these sub basins as three dimensionally distributed would be possible in future work and global parameterization of hydraulic conductivity and rock porosity in the upper groundwater model and further distributing these parameters could be possible if additional borings were collected throughout the groundwater basin the transferability of the model presented herein as well as other karst distributed model and reservoir model alternatives to karst study sites relies on the degree of information available and in turn leads to response variables of varying detail the karst modeler is charged with representing the groundwater basin given the degree of geomorphologic data the modeler can add a discrete network of conduits fractures and their connectivity to the surface as subsurface data becomes available from well drillings dye tracers and resistivity measurements without such data specifying a discrete conduit network leads to increasing conjecture and in turn increasing model complexity and modelling results that are not defensible for discussion purposes we classify this information spectrum as known or reasonably assumed information about i the primary springs only ii springs and swallets and iii springs swallets primary conduits and fractures reservoir models without discrete elements provide a reasonable karst modelling choice when the known information for the basin is flow at the primary spring husic et al 2019b showed a four reservoir model outperformed one two and three reservoir models when primary spring discharge was predicted the multi reservoir structure captured the flow signal reflective of multi porosities believed or known to exist in the husic et al 2019b study results were limited to residence time and time distributed flowrates associated with each reservoir distributed model simulations without discrete elements are also possible in some cases when primary information is only available for the spring however multi continuum distributed models will quickly lead to overparameterization unless at least some information is known about the matrix structure and results of such distributed model results are viewed as theoretical e g hartmann et al 2014 we suggest the fluviokarst model with its cdc structure and other similarly formulated cdc models are too complex when primary spring information only is the response available reservoir or distributed models with discrete elements added are possible albeit increasingly hypothetical when known information exists for springs and swallets such as primary springs secondary springs in stream swallets and landscape sinkholes kavousi et al 2020 used permutations of discrete conduit structures when only swallet and spring information were available and applied model evaluation criteria to arrive at the most plausible discrete conduit structure additionally the autocorrelation and cross correlation structure of swallets and springs can be used to infer the conduit structure in karst systems e g massei et al 2006 which in turn can lead to construction of discrete conduit swallet networks nevertheless results of conveyance rates and conduit dimensions become increasingly hypothetical for discrete conduit swallet networks unless swallet spring datasets are spatially dense we suggest the fluviokarst model herein and similar cdc models be viewed as hypothetical when applied when only swallet and spring datasets are available discrete networks built in to cdc models such as the model presented herein become increasingly applicable to basins where information of conduits and fracture structure and responses variables as well as spring and swallet datasets are available a known or reasonably assumed conduit swallet network allows the modeler to construct a subsurface stream or pipe network at the onset with a network defined the modeler can discretize continuum using geologic information e g presence of aquitards changing rock type using physical considerations similarly to watershed hydrology modelling as shown here multiple response variables from springs surface flows and swallets and wells in fracture dominated and conduit drainages add leverage to parameterizing cdc models in turn conveyance results from different hydrologic pathways become increasingly believable for these reasons we suggest the model herein and similar cdc models are most applicable to karst basins with data available to define conduit swallet networks as well as data from multiple locations and features to be used for model evaluation 5 conclusion our model evaluation results suggest the need for multi objective calibration for fluviokarst numerical modelling using only a single response variable i e springflow resulted in model sensitivity to only 4 out of 19 model parameters multi objective calibration with streamflow springflow and potentiometric surfaces of perched and deep aquifers showed sensitivity of 14 out of 19 model parameters offering greater confidence the acceptable model runs depict the aquifer structure and hydrologic pathways advantages of the fluviokarst model contributed herein are its capability to simulate connectivity between surface stream hydraulics and cave hydraulics via the in stream swallet and the model s ability to omit prior biases of how the system might be behaving disadvantages are the numerical model s cost for input data and the model s computational expense production runs required 168 h on the cluster using 1000 cores with 4 tb ram modelling results suggest classification of the basin as relatively mature fluviokarst with in stream swallet features a well defined fracture conduit network and a shallow phreatic primary cave these features produce hydrologic pathways classified as triunal transfer however the arrival of source waters is disconnected in time from the springflow response the pressure response of mature and phreatic fracture conduit networks suggests some modification when interpreting hydrologic pathways impact on springflow in fluviokarst basins similar to those in this study karst hydrologists might consider modifying their interpretation by considering a four component model that includes the disconnect between the pressure response and arrival of different source waters the disconnect might be consider pathway residence time and for example our results suggest pathways vary by five orders of magnitude ranging from less than one hour in vertical swallets 12 7 h in longitudinal conduits 12 7 days in the vadose zone and epikarst and 142 7 days in the bedrock matrix in stream swallets directly connect the surface stream network to the karst aquifer and the role of these features is unique to fluviokarst we define a dimensionless vertical to longitudinal conveyance ratio and investigation shows the ratio helps predict swallet behavior an order of magnitude influence of the conveyance ratio on in stream swallet contributions is found for this fluviokarst basin given the sensitivity of the conveyance ratio we suggest advancement is needed for measuring swallet and conduit diameters credit authorship contribution statement

4915,karst pathways and fluvial pathways control hydrology in shallow fluviokarst basins and numerical modelling of fluviokarst is seldom reported in this study we developed a combined discrete continuum fluviokarst numerical model by simulating surface river routing in stream swallet sources and sinks epikarst storage and dynamic transfer matrix bedrock interactions and closed conduit phreatic flow we applied the model to the cane run royal spring basin in kentucky usa model evaluation indicated that spring discharge alone inadequately constrained model pathways and uncertainty instead multi objective calibration integrating riverine discharge and well head data from multiple locations assisted in identifying sensitive parameters p 0 05 multi objectives improved representation of stream cave connectivity and limited prior knowledge biases of the system but was computationally expensive with 168 h required on a high performance cluster results provided evidence for a mature fluviokarst basin with well defined fracture conduit network and phreatic aquifer residence times of karst pathways vary by five orders of magnitude ranging from less than one hour in vertical swallets 12 7 h in longitudinal conduits 12 7 days in the vadose zone and epikarst and 142 7 days in the bedrock matrix results suggest arrival of source waters to the subsurface systems is disconnected in time from the springflow response model simulations show a dimensionless vertical to longitudinal conveyance ratio helps predict swallets linking the fluvial and karst systems transferability of the developed model and other karst models is discussed relative to availability of information for karst basins keyword fluviokarst 1 introduction many hydrologic pathways are possible in shallow fluviokarst basins because both fluvial and karst processes exist fluvial control of pathways includes runoff generation and routing of surface water whereas karst control of pathways includes density and size of sinkholes and subsurface fractures for dynamic storage and transfer of groundwater further hydrologic connectivity between fluvial and karst pathways is facilitated by in stream fluviokarst swallets which act as vertical conveyors connecting surface and subsurface waters at rapid timescales see fig 1 the concept of the many potential hydrologic pathways of fluviokarst has taken shape in recent years phillips and walls 2004 husic et al 2017a 2017b however the complexity of pathways and their uncertain connectivity adds difficulty to predicting water budgets and pollutant fate numerical modelling of fluviokarst hydrologic processes provides one method to help fill knowledge gaps for fluviokarst numerical modelling of karst basins receives some criticism because models can easily become data starved over parameterized or contain deficiencies in model structure e g hartmann et al 2014 chang et al 2019 nevertheless numerical modelling results can be useful and defendable when the model is appropriately scaled represents known morphology and processes in the basin has a wide variety of data and considers all acceptable solutions during model evaluation hartmann et al 2014 to remedy potential karst modelling pitfalls it is helpful to study watersheds with extensive datasets when karst models with increased complexity are used to address knowledge gaps of processes we develop a combined discrete continuum numerical model for mature fluviokarst that simulates connectivity between surface streams and karst groundwater pathways combined discrete continuum models have been developed for karst systems in recent years these models include distributed subroutines and discrete element components the distributed subroutines follow process based modelling of the groundwater domain and solves the governing equations with numerical methods hartmann et al 2014 the discrete elements are applied to solve the governing equations for flow through discrete conduit networks chang et al 2015 qiu et al 2019 kavousi et al 2020 for example chang et al 2015 and kavousi et al 2020 apply modflow cfp with conduit flow process subroutines to simulate groundwater drainage to conduits qiu et al 2019 applied the process based adaptive watershed simulator plus community land model paws clm and treated karst conduits as subsurface open channels draining the surrounding rock matrix to our knowledge few if any studies develop a fluviokarst specific combined discrete continuum numerical model the model herein accomplishes this task by coupling three sub models an upper groundwater model divides the groundwater domain to sub basins and then distributes each sub basin vertically a lower groundwater models solves the governing equations for discrete fractures swallets and conduits a surface stream model simulates the fluvial system aboveground and interacts with karst swallets unique features of the fluviokarst model include the numerical treatment of swallets located in the stream corridor and the numerous conditions for which they can exist i e filling overtopping swallets reversing flow emptying discrete elements for fractures swallets and conduits and coupling the timescales of water through the three sub models to simulate both surface streamflow and groundwater flow across pathways stream routing epikarst flows vadose zone transport fracture flow and conduit flow consider fluid continuity and transport formula controlling each process zimmerman and yeo 2000 jain 2001 niswonger et al 2006 tritz et al 2011 rooij et al 2013 chen and goldscheider 2014 the model is evaluated quantitatively and thereafter discussed regarding multi objective calibration needs data inputs and parameterization needs and computational costs we apply our formulated numerical model to investigate fluviokarst hydrology including aquifer structure hydrologic pathways and in stream swallet features knowledge of aquifer structure for fluviokarst can add understanding of the spectrum of karst matrix and its features such as characterizing fracture conduit permeability and rock matrix permeability e g matthäi and belayneh 2004 hydrologic pathways in fluviokarst are hypothesized to show their imprint on springflow analogous to karst basins with little to no fluvial influence for example karst hydrologists often separate springflow into quick intermediate and slow flow pathways baedke and krothe 2001 kovács and perrochet 2008 fiorillo 2011 but extension of these concepts to fluviokarst basins is less clear in stream swallet features are a defining morphology of fluviokarst basins and in stream swallets are hypothesized to pirate surface streamflow to karst aquifers during some conditions and reverse flow from the aquifer to the surface during other conditions chen and goldscheider 2014 hensley et al 2014 however investigation of the in stream swallets is seldom reported which is likely due to difficulties in collecting measurements around the swallets and numerically coupling streamflow models with swallet flow and fracture conduit flow models to summarize the objectives of this paper were to i develop and evaluate a numerical model for shallow fluviokarst and report the model s input and calibration needs advantages and limitations and ii use the model to investigate fluviokarst hydrology including aquifer structure hydrologic pathways and in stream swallet features discussion of these goals provides the sub headings for the discussion section of the paper 2 model formulation the fluviokarst model simulates the hydrologic pathways defined and depicted for fluviokarst in fig 1 some pathways are one way pathways such as runoff and fracture overflow to the surface stream while many of the pathways are simulated to occur in either direction depending on hydraulics such fractures recharging the rock matrix or the rock matrix discharging to fractures the fluviokarst pathways and their possible directions are shown in fig 2 to accomplish the pathway simulation the formulation includes a surface stream model an upper groundwater model a lower groundwater model and numerical optimization the model formulation assumes external inputs to the model either from measurements or independent models including fluxes for soil water percolation to the epikarst runoff and lateral flow to the surface stream network and runoff and lateral flow entering land surface sinkholes see model workflow schematic in fig s1 the model formulation is currently limited to shallow epigenetic fluviokarst and we do not account for hypogenic recharge 2 1 surface stream model the surface stream model is formulated to route water through the stream network and account for water exchange with the lower groundwater model via fluviokarst swallets located in the stream corridor see fig 1 stream reach continuity is 1 dv str dt q str u p q sur q trib q lat q swall i n q str d n where v str is the volume of water stored in a stream reach q str u p and q str d n are water transferred in and out of the reach q sur q trib and q lat are lateral inputs to the stream from surface runoff tributaries considered external to the network and lateral soil flow respectively q swall i n is exchange between the surface stream and the lower groundwater model and the swallet flux is shown as a sink in eq 1 but can be a source term for swallet reversal q sur q trib and q lat are model inputs q str u p and q str d n are formulated using mannings equation and jones formula to account for non uniformity in the model chow 1959 jain 2001 q swall i n is input from the lower groundwater model 2 2 upper groundwater model the upper groundwater model simulates water storage and transfer for the epikarst unsaturated rock matrix and saturated rock epikarst continuity is 2 dv ep dt q perc q ep v q ep f where v ep is the volume of water stored in the epikarst t is time q perc is soil water percolation input to the epikarst q ep v is water transfer out of the epikarst to the vadose rock zone and q ep f is water transfer out to the fracture network q perc is a model input and q ep v is solved for in the vadose zone routing q ep f is modelled using the formulation of tritz et al 2011 and occurs when an activation threshold height is exceeded as 3 q ep f h ep h epth n ep δ t 1 f o r h ep h epth e l s e q ep f 0 where q ep is water discharge per unit area h ep is the height of water stored in the epikarst h epth is the threshold height when epikarst water will be routed to the fracture network and n ep is the epikarst porosity using the formulation of eq 3 an overflow is activated when the threshold is reached in the epikarst layer this approach is conceptually consistent with the model by tritz et al 2011 the epikarst transfers water vertically to the rock matrix i e vadose zone below but also includes a threshold such that water can overflow to the fracture network this is consistent with a near surface layer that is interconnected with fractures lateral flow is not considered explicitly however the fracture network grid is three dimensional and in a given time step immediately removes overflow to the fracture network vadose rock matrix is represented as a variably saturated granular rock entering from the epikarst and exiting to saturated rock multi layered water content is formulated with richard s equation assuming flow is gravity driven so the diffusive term can be removed simunek et al 1998 niswonger et al 2006 and formulating hydraulic conductivity with the brooks corey function as 4 d θ dt d dz k θ 5 k θ k s θ θ r θ s θ r where θ is the volumetric water content z is the vertical soil depth k θ is the hydraulic conductivity as a function of θ k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the rock mass θ r and θ s are is the residual and saturated volumetric water content of the rock mass and is the brooks corey exponent the product of the groundwater cell area and the hydraulic conductivity solved for at the boundaries provides fluxes from the epikarst to the vadose zone and vadose zone to saturated matrix i e q ep v and q v p a saturated rock in the upper groundwater model is used to represent the presence of aquitards that produce perched water tables and continuity for the saturated rock is 6 d v pa dt q v p a q pa f where v pa is the volume of water stored in a perched aquifer q v p a is vadose zone input to the perched aquifer and q pa f is the exchange flow between the perched aquifer and fracture network the latter is formulated with darcy s law as 7 q pa f k s dh dx where dh is the difference in elevation of the saturated rock head and fracture network head dh and q pa f are negative when the fracture head is higher than the perched saturated rock and dx is the flow path distance and is a function of spacing between fractures 2 3 lower groundwater model the lower

via land surface sinkholes q f c and q f m are transfers out of the fracture network to conduit and the lower saturated rock matrix respectively although both terms can be negative in eq 8 indicating sources rather than sinks and q over is fracture network overflow manifested as seeps and hillside springs in karst terrain q f c is formulated with the cubic law for fracture flow snow 1969 long et

water basin is divided to spatial grids surface stream networks swallets and conduits are modeled discretely the epikarst fracture network unsaturated zone and saturated matrix are modeled as continuums at each time step the surface stream model upper groundwater model and lower groundwater model are solved following the method in fig 3 the surface stream network is solved at each time step using flood wave routing considering non uniform flow jain 2001 and surface inputs from runoff and lateral flow transfer with the lower groundwater model is solved either using weir equations or solved in the lower groundwater model depending on whether the swallets are partially full or full respectively the upper groundwater model is solved for each groundwater cell considering input from soil percolation the model calculates the number of vadose layers in the vertical so the cfl condition will not be violated and solves the richards equation through iteration for the discretized cells e g simunek et al 1998 niswonger et al 2006 output from the upper groundwater model include exchanges for epikarst to fractures and saturated matrix to fractures and these fluxes are inputs to the lower groundwater model during each time step the lower groundwater model simultaneously solves a system of equations setup across all discretized groundwater cells for each time step with inputs from the stream model and upper groundwater model for each cell the system of equations includes an equivalent porous medium approach for the fracture network equations in each groundwater cell snow 1969 kresic 2010 a similar continuum approach is used for the saturated matrix in each cell and the discretized swallet and conduit nodal approach is solved across all groundwater cells optimization solves the system for conduit swallet matrix and fracture fluxes static pressure heads in the fractures conduits and swallets without boundary conditions and the potentiometric surface of the saturated matrix in some time steps optimization is aided by boundary conditions for the swallets when they are full conduits that daylight at springs and a land surface elevation as a maximum fracture head when seeps and hillside springs occur optimization of the lower groundwater model uses the trust region with dogleg method with 1000 numerical iterations dennis and schnabel 1996 the algorithm starts with initial guesses for unknowns to define a point in the spherical trust region that adjusts size at each iteration the initial guesses at the first time step are set intuitively then the results assisted in defining the initial guesses for successive time steps the tolerance is set to 1x10 6 during optimization method and is set to one for the two norm of the optimized solution 3 model application 3 1 study site the cane run royal spring fluviokarst basin in the inner bluegrass region of kentucky usa was the study site for model application the study site was chosen because the

groundwater basin 58 km2 through swallets that connect surface water to the underlying karst aquifer feeding royal spring 60 swallets were surveyed in cane run creek see fig 4 the swallet equivalent diameters at the streambed range from 10 to 100 cm flow pirating by the swallets causes cane run creek to be dry for 90 of the year husic et al 2017a royal spring karst groundwater basin is formed in middle ordovician aged limestones with interbeds of thin shales thrailkill and gouzie 1984 cressman and peterson 1986 epikarst features are visible throughout the watershed in naturally exposed karren as well as roadcuts husic et al 2017b limestone members formed with high clay or silt content locally act as aquitards and were previously mapped e g the cane run bed brannon member cressman 1967 miller 1967 macquown and dobrovolny 1968 water flow from the fluviokarst features and limestone bedrock converges to a phreatic conduit 15 to 20 m below the ground surface that flows northwest and surfaces at royal spring thrailkill et al 1991 paylor and currens 2004 zhu et al 2011 evidence from resistivity measurements well drilling directly intersecting the conduit and base level elevations suggest the conduit profile follows a bedding plane approximately 14 m below cane run bed thrailkill et al 1991 landrum et al 2013 royal spring 243 m a s l mean discharge is 0 7 m3 s 1 conveys perennial flow from the phreatic conduit currens et al 2015 3 2 model spatial domain and inputs the model spatial domain see fig 5 was constructed using inputs detailed in tables 1 and 2 collected from measurements in the field geospatial data and geology reports available data used included sinkhole maps aquifer boundary maps land use maps stream flow network maps soil maps topography models mapping of stream bathymetry and geologic cross sections and conduit profiles the surface watershed fig 5a was constructed using the digital elevation model and sinkhole maps were input to provide sinkhole locations and mapped drainage areas stream cross section and longitudinal dimensions were input using analyses of a 0 5 m topographic model in stream swallets were input using a 20 m buffer around the stream network masked over the sinkhole geospatial model swallet dimensions were input using data from a field survey puckett 2015 the soil layer covering the limestone bedrock was mapped using digitized soil survey data the epikarst layer was constructed immediately below the soil layer and the epikarst thickness was input using results from soil electrical resistivity landrum et al 2013 the groundwater basin boundary followed a model constructed using groundwater tracer studies taylor 1992 paylor and currens 2004 the limestone bedrock layer and its fracture network were constructed below the epikarst layer and extended below the primary conduit fig 5b the geometry of fractures and density of fractures across the bedrock were left as parameters in the model because our existing resistivity measurements could not resolve these characteristics the cane run bed aquitard was input based on geologic maps and survey data analyses of stage recordings from wells in perched aquifers and borehole logs the primary conduit that daylights at royal spring was input to follow a bedding plane approximately 14 m below the cane run bed for most of its length until the local anticline near the spring fig 5c the elevation of royal spring was used as a maximum conduit elevation discretized spatial inputs included see table 2 number of watershed surface cells conduit lengths l c conduit elevation z c groundwater cell area a cell stream bed height relative to conduit h pa epikarst bottom height relative to conduit h f m a x maximum lateral distance for fracture and matrix flow d x max number of groundwater wells number of stream reaches stream bed width b stream bed slope s and bankfull heights h bkf a number of additional inputs were specified using literature the discharge coefficient for weir flow c w into the swallet while the swallet is not full was selected based on reported broad crested weir coefficients gupta 2008 the value of the brooks corey exponent was assumed to be equal to the value used by brooks and corey 1964 in the brooks corey equation the residual moisture content θ r in the unsaturated zone was assumed to be zero as suggested by simunek et al 1998 to reduce the number of model parameters the pump rate in each groundwater cell was the product of the pump rate parameter and the number of active wells in the groundwater cell identified using a geospatial dataset inputs for surface runoff surface routing and soil water percolation were estimated using the soil water assessment tool or swat neitsch et al 2011 swat s deep aquifer percolation fraction rchrg dp was set to 1 to negate the shallow aquifer and prevent baseflow to streams since these processes are simulated in the stream and groundwater code this approach is similar to the work by malagò et al 2016 where swat surface fluxes were used as inputs to a karst groundwater model meteorological inputs were available from the bluegrass airport noaa id usw00093820 3 3 model parameterization the numerical model was parameterized using 19 parameters see table 3 groundwater parameter ranges for flow in limestone were considered the initial range for the matrix porosity n m was selected based on values for limestone bedrock in karst aquifers williams 2008 the range for saturated hydraulic conductivity of the limestone bedrock k s was selected based on minimum and maximum values of hydraulic conductivity reported for limestone bedrock by domenico and schwartz 1998 the range for epikarst porosity n ep was selected based on values suggested in epikarst literature klimchouk 2004 williams 2008 the maximum value in the initial epikarst fracture threshold height parameter h epth was selected based on the estimated maximum thickness of the epikarst layer landrum et al 2013 we used active wells in the watershed and pumping rates for the region to help parameterize the pumping rate we mapped the active wells the locations of all wells in the groundwater basin were identified using a dataset provided by the kentucky geological survey groundwater data repository this set of wells was filtered to only include active wells see figure below and fig s2 in the revised paper then we parameterize pumping on what was reasonable to come from the wells in reference to pumping rate data in central kentucky this range of rates and number of active wells provided the initial range for the pumping rate parameter in the model see table 3 the maximum pump rate was selected based on high end values of reported pumping rates from wells in the greir member carey and stickney 2005 swat run parameter ranges for surface hydrology inputs were generated from swat using 25 different acceptable model runs detailed in al aamery et al 2016 and al aamery et al 2018 swat was calibrated using swat cup sufi2 algorithm abbaspour et al 2007 the algorithm is simulated and then retains acceptable model runs i e r2 0 6 from these acceptable runs we chose 25 runs to provide the largest possible ranges and account for uncertainty propagated from swat through the fluviokarst model additional karst groundwater and surfacewater parameter ranges were also specified the maximum value for fracture density n was selected based on reported fracture densities common in epikarst zones and the minimum value was selected based on lower end values reported for karstified limestone bedrock klimchouk 2004 the range for fracture aperture b was selected based on a range of fracture apertures that resulted from a karst evolution model worthington and ford 2009 the range for manning s roughness coefficient n were selected based on values for clean straight reaches to very weedy reaches chow 1959 the initial range for the flood wave coefficient k s was selected based on the maximum theoretical range identified in jain 2001 the initial ranges for friction factors f c f s were selected based on the range of friction factors appearing on the moody diagram moody 1944 the value for conduit tortuosity τ c was assumed to be within the ranges of conduit tortuosity reported for looping cave systems and water table cave systems by jouves et al 2017 ranges for both the fracture lateral distance adjustment factor d x f and the matrix lateral distance adjustment factor d x m were assumed to have a maximum value of one corresponding to the centroid based distance for each groundwater cell and a low value corresponding to a lateral distance approximately equal to the height of the groundwater table initial ranges for conduit and swallet diameters dc and ds respectively were based on measurements reported in husic et al 2017a and puckett 2015 the range of perched fracture flow threshold hpa th was specified from a low value to a maximum depth of bedrock above the aquitard we tested the aquitard s sensitivity using different low hydraulic conductivities for the aquitard however this had no impact on the results therefore the aquitard is treated as impermeable the three dimensional fracture network crosses through the aquitard therefore the perched aquifer at the lower portion of the vadose zone only drains through the fracture network when an aquitard member is present this model parameterization was based on the concept that the fractures in the bedrock extend through limestone members formed with high clay or silt content but diffuse flow through the surrounding rock matrix is zero 3 4 model simulations model simulations were performed using matlab r2017a on an institutionally shared high performance computing cluster with 9000 processor cores 35 tb of ram and 1 3 pb of high speed disk storage preparation of geospatial inputs pre processing and post processing of results was performed using arcmap 10 4 1 arcswat 2012 version 10 4 19 swat cup version 5 1 6 2 and matlab r2017a on a pc with intel xeon cpu of two logical processors with 3 60 ghz and ram of 64 0 gb 3 5 model calibration validation sensitivity and uncertainty analyses fig 6 details the calibration and validation procedure multi objective calibration was carried out using four stations including 1 springflow at royal spring usgs 03288110 adjusted for a raw water intake upstream of the weir 2 streamflow stage data and a stage discharge curve at the surface stream outlet husic et al 2017a 3 a monitoring well directly intersecting the primary conduit and 4 a monitoring well intersecting a perched aquifer the steps of model calibration were to i reduce the initial parameter space using an optimization algorithm and visual inspection of results and ii find optimal parameter values that met objective criteria including traditional statistical measures and visual fit sobol sequencing was used to generate the parameter values for sets of 1000 model runs to refine parameter ranges saltelli et al 2008 and the sufi2 optimization algorithm and visual fit was used to adjust parameter ranges abbaspour et al 2007 in stage 2 optimal parameter fit was found by generating 10 000 parameter sets using sobol sequencing and the refined parameter ranges from semi manual calibration the karst model ran for the time period from january 1 2010 to may 1 2019 using the first year of simulation as model spin up five years for calibration and four years as validation for simulations on a monthly time scale moriasi et al 2007 recommends nash sutcliff efficiency nse 0 5 and absolute percent bias pbias 25 as acceptable performance criteria model simulations on higher resolution time scales e g hourly are known to have lower values of performance metrics when compared to performance of the model when data is aggregated for a lower resolution time scale engel et al 2007 moriasi et al 2007 therefore model hourly runs with nse 0 2 and pbias 25 for spring discharge and nse 0 2 and pbias 25 for streamflow were considered acceptable also the p factor and r factor were evaluated following the method of abbaspour et al 2007 the p factor is percentage of data bracketed by the 95 prediction uncertainty measured at 2 5 and 97 5 percentiles and the r factor is the ratio of the average distance between the two percentiles divided by the standard deviation of corresponding observed variable both global and local sensitivity were performed because literature suggests the importance of both approaches saltelli et al 2008 abbaspour et al 2007 ceriotti et al 2018 for example ceriotti et al 2018 showed joint application of local and global sensitivity analyses was needed to characterize the importance ranking of model parameters and hence propagation of uncertainty in their subsurface water model further in our work the modelling platform was new and we needed to understand the relative role of each model input ceriotti et al 2018 so local sensitivity helped provide justification of the linkages global sensitivity was measured using a multiple regression model this was chosen based on the ease of performance and a lower number of model simulations required to calculate the sensitivity the multiple regression model regresses the parameters values sampled by the sobol sequences against the values of the objective functions t tests were used to identify the significance effect of each parameter on the objective function abbaspour et al 2007 model performance was assumed to be sensitive to parameters with a p value less than 0 05 local sensitivity was investigated to test the influence of the 19 parameters on simulating the four objectives including spring flow streamflow and piezometer heads in the perched aquifer well and conduit well the parameters were changed one at a time on the bases of 25 75 150 and 200 parameter values for the parameters found in the most optimal model run the decision of influence versus non influence was based on the percent bias metric and visual inspection of the results the local sensitivity results were built using the observations from 10 01 2012 to 10 01 2013 only because we have all observations for the four stations for this period model uncertainty as measured by evaluating the mean and standard deviation of acceptable model runs for each time step additionally the average distance of the 95 prediction uncertainty 95 ppu was evaluated the 95 ppu was constructed using the 2 5 and 97 5 quantiles of the simulated values across all acceptable model runs for each time step abbaspour et al 2007 3 6 model results model evaluation results showed the model s ability to simulate four calibration objectives including stream flow spring discharge the groundwater level for the perched aquifer and the groundwater level for the deeper aquifer results showed the model in general performed well for these four objectives see fig 7 and parameters in table 3 when acceptable runs were included in the results i e ns 0 2 and absolute pbias 25 for the 4 stations for the model evaluation from the 10 000 simulations in the final production run when compared to literature the model performance is good to very good objective function values from our hourly model runs are comparable to objective function values of daily streamflow models considered acceptable gassman et al 2007 the objective functions for spring discharge for our best model run surpass the satisfactory values subjected by moriasi et al 2007 for models with a monthly time step watershed scale models have significantly reduced performance measures when using a shorter duration time step gassman et al 2007 moriasi et al 2007 which further substantiates that the model performs well uncertainty assessment also showed acceptable performance of the model fig 7 the average thickness of the 95 ppu p factor was 0 27 0 18 0 62 and 0 41 for spring flow streamflow perched aquifer well and conduit well respectively according to abbaspour et al 2007 p factor of less than one is sufficient to decrease uncertainty and the p factor values of the hourly timestep model satisfies this rule the observed spring flow was contained by the 95 ppu r factor during 20 18 40 and 20 of the model timesteps for the four stations the values of the r factor are lower than what is recommended for models with a daily timestep abbaspour et al 2007 and the reason is attributed to the hourly time step of the model applied here and the potentially the low quality of some observations the observed spring discharge at the royal springs gage is downstream from where abstractions are made by the georgetown municipal water and wastewater service spring discharge data was adjusted for these abstractions however some error still exists the streamflow data recorded some biases that needed to be removed using visual assessment also the well data were collected at one point in the groundwater cell whereas a dense monitoring well network would be more desirable additionally the recommendations made by abbaspour et al 2007 are for models with a daily timestep and as previously mentioned recommended levels should be lower for models with an hourly time step sensitivity analyses showed that 14 out of 19 model parameters were sensitive to at least one of the four calibration objectives see table 4 water discharge at the spring was sensitive to four parameters for global sensitivity and 5 for local sensitivity nevertheless piezometric head at the conduit well was sensitive to 12 parameters when considering both global and local sensitivity analysis it is important to note the goodness of fit for the multiple regression in table 4 where r2 and r2 adj are within 5 of one another for each objective function these two measures are superior for the conduit well which make the results of sensitivity analysis in this station more reliable sensitivity analysis results also showed that the performance of simulated streamflow was sensitive to 10 of the 19 model parameters when considering global and local sensitivity analyses table 4 sensitivity of fracture aperture fracture density saturated hydraulic conductivity and matrix porosity on flow at the surface was not expected and suggests the subsurface karst at least partially impacts flow in the creek the perched aquifer piezometer height was sensitive to 7 out of the 19 parameters for global and local sensitivity analyses soil water percolation and runoff simulated with the swat ensemble did not show sensitivity on the four response variables simulated with the fluviokarst model the depth of water percolated from the soil to the sub surface ranged by as much as 35 to 31 of the ensemble monthly mean during june for the 25 simulations and the depth of water percolated annually ranged from 13 to 5 the ensemble annual mean the runoff depth ranged from 6 to 25 the ensemble monthly mean during june for the 25 simulations and runoff depth ranged annually ranged from 11 to 19 the ensemble annual mean however these ranges were not statistically significant for sensitivity of the surface and groundwater fluxes simulated the reason is attributed to the pre calibration carried out for swat so that runoff and soil transfer parameters were consistent with acceptable model runs reported for this region al aamery et al 2016 2018 ensemble average pathway results for the 9 years of simulation suggest that while both karst and fluvial pathways are important royal spring exports most of the water 63 from the coupled surface subsurface system whereas the surface stream outlet drains less 26 the remaining water balance 11 is pumped from the aquifer for human consumption or agricultural uses water exiting at royal spring consists of drainage transported by the fracture conduit network annual average sources of water to the fracture conduit network are dominated by recharge from soil vadose zone and perched aquifers 70 with lesser amounts from previously recharged water stored in the rock matrix 18 landscape sinkholes 9 and in stream swallets 3 water at the surface watershed outlet is dominated by runoff overflow during events time series results of hydrologic pathways see fig 8 show how each pathway imprints on the net shape of the spring and stream hydrographs but at different timescales storm pulses and slower percolation of water from the near surface aquifer are easily observed to imprint the hydrograph results in fig 8 storm pulses cause daily fluctuations of fracture flowrate and spring flowrate time series reflecting delivery from the swallet and sinkhole features slower percolation cause weekly to monthly time series structure of fracture flowrate and spring flowrate reflecting delivery from soil percolation vadose zone and perched aquifers fig 8 the slowest contributor to the time series structure is the rock matrix the rock matrix is shown to fill during storm events and wet periods via the fracture network and soil percolation this is seen in time series results as qf m is positive during storm events in fig 8g the rock matrix then drains and discharges to the fracture network during dry periods as is shown in fig 8g when qf m is negative during dry periods imprint of individual pathways also reflects their residence time residence times in karst pathways vary by five orders of magnitude table 5 ranging from less than one hour in vertical swallets 12 7 h in longitudinal conduits 12 7 days in the vadose zone and epikarst and 142 7 days in the bedrock matrix time series of the fracture conduit flow and springflow are identical highlighting the well defined fracture conduit network that dominates spring discharge 4 discussion 4 1 multi objective calibration and model advantages and disadvantages our model evaluation results suggest the need for multi objective calibration for the fluviokarst numerical model developed in this study using the model formulated and applied here we suggest including calibration of streamflow springflow and potentiometric surfaces of perched and deep aquifers sensitivity analyses of the model showed cumulatively 14 out of 19 model parameters were sensitive during calibration table 4 the sensitivity results offer confidence the acceptable model runs were providing a reasonable depiction of the subsurface rock structure and water pathways however using just one objective in calibration likely is insufficient for example global sensitivity analyses showed only 4 out of 19 parameters were sensitive when only springflow at royal spring was considered if the model was calibrated only with springflow the resultant parameterization may be sufficient for estimating springflow however the underlying aquifer structure and its pathways would be questionable review of the literature shows karst models sometimes use multiple model responses during calibration such as springflow and potentiometric surface via well stage pétré et al 2019 while more often karst studies only use one response during calibration such as only springflow or only groundwater level candela et al 2009 tritz et al 2011 ali et al 2012 doummar et al 2018 ou et al 2018 few karst or fluviokarst studies to our knowledge use surface water flows springflows and potentiometric surfaces in calibration and highlighting this importance for fluviokarst is one contribution of this paper recommendations for karst modelling previously suggested multi objective calibration using water chemistry and water isotopes hartmann et al 2014 our results extend this multi objective recommendation to surface and subsurface stage and discharge when information about fluviokarst pathways and aquifer structure are sought after one advantage of the fluviokarst model is its capability to simulate connectivity between surface stream hydraulics and cave hydraulics via the in stream swallets results suggest the model s utility for future fluviokarst basins when pathways connectivity is sought after the numerical structure and its optimization simultaneously simulate surface stream hydraulics unsaturated flow cave hydraulics and the connectivity between the surface and subsurface via the in stream swallets the benefit is the model outputs the potentiometric surface of perched and deep aquifers and flow results at the spring the stream and flowrates for the connected features these results for both water discharge and the potentiometric surface will be useful for applications of the model to predict downstream water delivery and water storage a second advantage of the model was our ability to omit prior biases of how the system might be behaving a priori we anticipated reasonable contributions to the spring hydrograph from sinking streams the fracture network and the saturated rock matrix as well as the behavior of swallets to pirate surface streamflow to the subsurface conduit our prior biases were based on previous karst literature that tends to emphasize the three end member concept in a number of papers e g pinault et al 2001 white 2002 worthington 2007 long 2009 and the optical nature of the swallets as sinks during our field reconnaissance nevertheless we recognized the potential for the fracture network or rock matrix to dominate subsurface flows as detailed in some papers matthäi and belayneh 2004 and the potential for flow reversal of fluviokarst features chen and goldscheider 2014 hensley et al 2014 including one named estavelle in our system thrailkill et al 1991 therefore we used a wide range of prior parameterization to consider all potential storage zones and transfers contribution to karst transfer phenomena optimization of the model structure allowed an un biased parameterization of the 20 pathways by using the multiple objective functions and sobol sequences the lack of bias in compartments is reflected in the spring water residence time that is deconvoluted across five orders of magnitude table 5 one disadvantage was the numerical model s computational expense simulation time for production runs was approximately 168 h on the computer cluster using 1 000 cores with 4 tb ram this has a monetary expense of approximately 15 k usd the computational cost was high due to simultaneously solving the system of non linear equations for the lower groundwater model via the trust region with dogleg method with 1 000 numerical iterations per model time step see methods section dennis and schnabel 1996 we tested other numerical techniques including line search optimization but we found no decrease in computation time and less accuracy future research might investigate further programing efficiency of our code but nevertheless computational costs will continue to be a disadvantage for process based models of fluviokarst systems another disadvantage was the numerical model s cost for input data in the model application the streams and karst conduit were well characterized from previous tracer tests lidar mapping electrical resistivity mapping well data collection isotope tracer studies data driven water budgets and routine long term and event based water quality measurements this prior information made setup of the model domain feasible however this vast array of data may not be available for other fluviokarst study sites 4 2 investigate fluviokarst aquifer structure pathways and in stream swallets modelling results of aquifer structure suggest classification of the basin as relatively mature fluviokarst with defining features that include in stream swallet features a well defined fracture conduit network and a shallow phreatic primary cave these features add to discussion of karst morphology and its hydrologic behavior in the context of features mentioned by others drysdale et al 2001 white 2002 massei et al 2003 phillips and walls 2004 herman et al 2008 husic et al 2017a 2017b the in stream swallet features provide connectivity between surface stream and subsurface flow and these features together with the presence of both a fluvial network and karst network demonstrate the fluviokarst classification phillips and walls 2004 the well defined fracture conduit network is evidenced by the high fracture matrix permeability ratio 105 to 108 from model optimization which places the system in the regime of fracture flow being important for subsurface karst drainage matthäi and belayneh 2004 this leads to a classification of the system as a mature karst aquifer with pronounced dissolution and multiple levels of porosity including turbulent conduit flow fracture flow and darcian flow white 1999 hartmann et al 2013 the karst spring is supplied by a primary phreatic conduit and characteristics of phreatic systems are adverse subsurface gradients controlling cave hydraulics and springflow drysdale et al 2001 white 2002 massei et al 2003 herman et al 2008 husic et al 2017a the dominant hydrologic pathways in the fluviokarst basin show analogy with groundwater flow in many karst basins more generally with some modification fig 9 shows the springflow together with i swallets and sinkhole flowrates entering the fracture conduit network from the surface ii soil epikarst and perched aquifer water entering from the upper groundwater model and iii rock matrix flowrate entering from the lower groundwater model these three flowrates in fig 9 are analogous to triunal transfer including quick intermediate and slow flow mentioned in karst studies e g pinault et al 2001 worthington 2007 long 2009 the pressure response of these three flowrates are felt immediately at the spring because the fracture conduit network is mature and the conduit is phreatic the activation and deactivation of pathways to the fracture conduit network shifts the pressure response and changes the shape of the spring hydrograph including inflections or sharp change in the recession gradient the pressure response of this fluviokarst aquifer is corroborated by other karst studies such the concept of stored water being pressed out of conduits on the rising limb of the hydrograph e g hartmann et al 2014 and the piston effect during extreme events e g lastennet and mudry 1997 milanović 2014 we point out the pressure response is immediately felt at the karst spring in fig 9 although the arrival of quick flow from swallets and sinkholes does not occur until later for example average transit time through fractures and conduits is approximately 22 and 13 h respectively see table 5 the pressure response of mature and phreatic fracture conduit networks suggests some modification when interpreting hydrologic pathways impact on springflow in fluviokarst basins similar to those in this study our modelling evidence supports the spring hydrograph as a four component sources including a pressure response exporting previously stored water arrival of underground runoff at the spring arrival of percolated soil and epikarst water at the spring and arrival of rock matrix water at the spring the arrival of these components is disconnected in time from springflow inflections because the system is phreatic hydrologists often interpret spring hydrograph inflections to indicate shifts in the origin of water from aquifer zones with differing porosity transfer and storage characteristics talarovich and krothe 1998 baedke and krothe 2001 pinault et al 2001 worthington 2007 fiorillo 2011 hosseini et al 2017 xu et al 2016 for example inflections in recession curves are reported to reflect a shift from runoff in the caves to water draining fractures to water draining rock matrix fiorillo 2014 xu et al 2016 scientists might consider modifying this interpretation by considering potential for disconnect between the pressure response and arrival of different source waters in stream swallets directly connect the surface stream network to the karst aquifer and the role of these features is unique to fluviokarst our modelling results suggest the in stream swallets only pirate flow from the surface stream to the karst subsurface and flow reversal does not occur for this system the overall impact of the in stream swallets was rather small and the in stream swallets are responsible for just 3 of water arriving at the primary spring the net influence is owed to the relatively small diameter of the in stream swallets and the average swallet diameter was just 26 cm for fluviokarst we define here a vertical to longitudinal conveyance ratio cr to describe the conveyance of water through the vertical swallets relative to the longitudinal conduits we define a dimensionless conveyance ratio as 15 c r i 1 n d s i 2 i 1 m d c j 2 where the diameters of n swallets and m conduits can be considered for the fluviokarst system cr equaled 0 3 for our optimal model run highlighting the small influence of swallet vertical conveyance relative to the conduit longitudinal conveyance for this system as further discussion we used our numerical model to investigate how changes in the conveyance ratio impacts contributions of the in stream swallets to springflow we set up hypothetical model simulations where swallet diameters and conduit diameters were varied to study the influence of the conveyance ratio on in stream swallet contribution to springflow swallet diameter was varied from 13 cm to 104 cm and conduit diameter was varied from 83 cm to 330 cm results in fig 10 show changes to the conveyance ratio shifts contributions of in stream swallets to the total annual springflow by nearly an order of magnitude we qualify that the exact numbers for percent contribution of swallets to springflow found in fig 10 is an artifact of the specific features of the study site and the model s parameterization nevertheless the order of magnitude influence of the conveyance ratio on in stream swallet contributions should be highlighted for fluviokarst swallet diameters and conduit diameters are extremely difficult to measure in the field especially for networks of swallets and phreatic conduits despite our field efforts the diameters were kept as parameters given our uncertainty surrounding the variables we point out the importance of estimating and parameterizing swallet and conduit diameters for investigating fluviokarst basins researchers might work towards improving methods for such estimates and for example tomographic methods serve as one potential tool 4 3 discussion of model transferability and its alternatives to other karst basins the model formulated and applied in this study allows us to discuss our new karst model more broadly in the context of existing karst modelling alternatives thereafter we discuss the applicability of transferring this model and other karst model alternatives to karst study sites with varying degrees of information as a brief review to provide context karst models are classified as distributed models reservoir models or hybrids of the two hartmann et al 2014 knöll et al 2020 ollivier et al 2020 distributed models refer to process based modelling where the domain is divided to groundwater cells and the governing equations are solved for flow in one or more directions using numerical methods e g doummar et al 2012 chang et al 2015 qiu et al 2019 kavousi et al 2020 reservoir models refer to storage discharge equations where one or more linear or nonlinear transfer functions are applied to represent flow from the total basin or decomposed zones i e quick intermediate slow flow transfer zones e g husic et al 2019b some authors refer to reservoir models as lumped models e g hartmann et al 2014 however we avoid this term because lumped is also used to indicate process based models averaged across basins or sub basins in hydrology singh 2012 discrete elements have been added to both distributed and reservoir model structures including discrete elements suggests knowledge of the conduit network structure throughout the basin more often discrete conduits are included in distributed structures chang et al 2015 qiu et al 2019 kavousi et al 2020 although discrete conduit modelling can also be coupled within a reservoir structure for the broader groundwater basin e g husic et al 2020 the model formulated and applied here classifies as a combined discrete continuum cdc fluviokarst numerical model and shows some characteristics of existing karst models as well as unique modelling features the model here is cdc fluviokarst because the upper groundwater model divides the groundwater domain to sub basins and then distributes each sub basin vertically the lower groundwater models solves the governing equations for discrete fractures swallets and conduits and the surface stream model simulates the fluvial system aboveground and interacts with karst swallets unique features include the numerical treatment of swallets discrete elements for fractures swallets and conduits and coupling the timescales of water through the model simplified features are the one dimensional vertical treatment of the upper groundwater model and treating these sub basins as three dimensionally distributed would be possible in future work and global parameterization of hydraulic conductivity and rock porosity in the upper groundwater model and further distributing these parameters could be possible if additional borings were collected throughout the groundwater basin the transferability of the model presented herein as well as other karst distributed model and reservoir model alternatives to karst study sites relies on the degree of information available and in turn leads to response variables of varying detail the karst modeler is charged with representing the groundwater basin given the degree of geomorphologic data the modeler can add a discrete network of conduits fractures and their connectivity to the surface as subsurface data becomes available from well drillings dye tracers and resistivity measurements without such data specifying a discrete conduit network leads to increasing conjecture and in turn increasing model complexity and modelling results that are not defensible for discussion purposes we classify this information spectrum as known or reasonably assumed information about i the primary springs only ii springs and swallets and iii springs swallets primary conduits and fractures reservoir models without discrete elements provide a reasonable karst modelling choice when the known information for the basin is flow at the primary spring husic et al 2019b showed a four reservoir model outperformed one two and three reservoir models when primary spring discharge was predicted the multi reservoir structure captured the flow signal reflective of multi porosities believed or known to exist in the husic et al 2019b study results were limited to residence time and time distributed flowrates associated with each reservoir distributed model simulations without discrete elements are also possible in some cases when primary information is only available for the spring however multi continuum distributed models will quickly lead to overparameterization unless at least some information is known about the matrix structure and results of such distributed model results are viewed as theoretical e g hartmann et al 2014 we suggest the fluviokarst model with its cdc structure and other similarly formulated cdc models are too complex when primary spring information only is the response available reservoir or distributed models with discrete elements added are possible albeit increasingly hypothetical when known information exists for springs and swallets such as primary springs secondary springs in stream swallets and landscape sinkholes kavousi et al 2020 used permutations of discrete conduit structures when only swallet and spring information were available and applied model evaluation criteria to arrive at the most plausible discrete conduit structure additionally the autocorrelation and cross correlation structure of swallets and springs can be used to infer the conduit structure in karst systems e g massei et al 2006 which in turn can lead to construction of discrete conduit swallet networks nevertheless results of conveyance rates and conduit dimensions become increasingly hypothetical for discrete conduit swallet networks unless swallet spring datasets are spatially dense we suggest the fluviokarst model herein and similar cdc models be viewed as hypothetical when applied when only swallet and spring datasets are available discrete networks built in to cdc models such as the model presented herein become increasingly applicable to basins where information of conduits and fracture structure and responses variables as well as spring and swallet datasets are available a known or reasonably assumed conduit swallet network allows the modeler to construct a subsurface stream or pipe network at the onset with a network defined the modeler can discretize continuum using geologic information e g presence of aquitards changing rock type using physical considerations similarly to watershed hydrology modelling as shown here multiple response variables from springs surface flows and swallets and wells in fracture dominated and conduit drainages add leverage to parameterizing cdc models in turn conveyance results from different hydrologic pathways become increasingly believable for these reasons we suggest the model herein and similar cdc models are most applicable to karst basins with data available to define conduit swallet networks as well as data from multiple locations and features to be used for model evaluation 5 conclusion our model evaluation results suggest the need for multi objective calibration for fluviokarst numerical modelling using only a single response variable i e springflow resulted in model sensitivity to only 4 out of 19 model parameters multi objective calibration with streamflow springflow and potentiometric surfaces of perched and deep aquifers showed sensitivity of 14 out of 19 model parameters offering greater confidence the acceptable model runs depict the aquifer structure and hydrologic pathways advantages of the fluviokarst model contributed herein are its capability to simulate connectivity between surface stream hydraulics and cave hydraulics via the in stream swallet and the model s ability to omit prior biases of how the system might be behaving disadvantages are the numerical model s cost for input data and the model s computational expense production runs required 168 h on the cluster using 1000 cores with 4 tb ram modelling results suggest classification of the basin as relatively mature fluviokarst with in stream swallet features a well defined fracture conduit network and a shallow phreatic primary cave these features produce hydrologic pathways classified as triunal transfer however the arrival of source waters is disconnected in time from the springflow response the pressure response of mature and phreatic fracture conduit networks suggests some modification when interpreting hydrologic pathways impact on springflow in fluviokarst basins similar to those in this study karst hydrologists might consider modifying their interpretation by considering a four component model that includes the disconnect between the pressure response and arrival of different source waters the disconnect might be consider pathway residence time and for example our results suggest pathways vary by five orders of magnitude ranging from less than one hour in vertical swallets 12 7 h in longitudinal conduits 12 7 days in the vadose zone and epikarst and 142 7 days in the bedrock matrix in stream swallets directly connect the surface stream network to the karst aquifer and the role of these features is unique to fluviokarst we define a dimensionless vertical to longitudinal conveyance ratio and investigation shows the ratio helps predict swallet behavior an order of magnitude influence of the conveyance ratio on in stream swallet contributions is found for this fluviokarst basin given the sensitivity of the conveyance ratio we suggest advancement is needed for measuring swallet and conduit diameters credit authorship contribution statement

4916,the provision of raw water to urban supply systems is a global endeavor and a great challenge to water resource managers of large metropolitan regions a sustainable supply requires the integrated management of water quantity and quality as well as the system s adaption to land use and climate changes e g deforestation droughts the available water security models inform about the current security status of a system based on the assessment of quantity quality and adaption indicators but they barely include risk variables in the analysis which could help to improve the security assessment considering the historical records of indicators or their future projections in the present study a new method is developed that couples a security assessment based on the rating of pressure indicators acting on a watershed such as water demand ordinary and accidental contaminants droughts and environmental settings e g share of forest cover with a risk assessment based on pressure properties such as severity occurrence and detectability the method is framed in the failure mode and effects analysis and was applied to the rio das velhas system that supplies a portion of belo horizonte metropolitan region minas gerais brazil with 4 million inhabitants the results exposed unacceptable risks for water demand ordinary contaminants and droughts because of their high severity and frequency the water demand risks were explained by data on current 2019 water scarcity and population growth projections until 2036 that are likely to raise water consumption the ordinary contaminant risks were deduced from information on current deviations of water quality parameters e g dissolved oxygen turbidity from legal thresholds and records since 2007 of stream water contamination by untreated domestic effluents finally the drought risks were explained by information on the persistence of stream flows below a legal reference flow coupled with the identification of many 23 dry years in the available stream flow record 48 years overall the proposed model was efficient in the evaluation of water security risk in the basin the results obtained for the study area help to act on the required mitigation through prioritization of risk attenuation given the simplicity and modest data requirements the method is helpful to decision makers and suited for replication

example in brazil the recently announced national water security plan ana 2019 assures an integrated and consistent water infrastructure until the 2035 horizon to reduce drought and flood impacts usually quantitative assessments resort to metrics the scientific literature has published many metrics to assess water security based on indicators of quantity quality climatic variability and extreme events jensen and wu 2018 a guidance document published by the university of british columbia dunn et al 2012 compiled 365 water security indicators preferably focused on the quality of surface water the indicators on supply versus demand were also abundant while those addressing the role of infrastructure or governance were just a few and poorly developed in some specific studies water security was measured by water availability relation between storage and discharge relation between availability and demand availability per capita water quality contamination by nutrients

et al 2012 wang et al 2017 despite the abundant literature on water security and related metrics some issues are not yet resolved an important example relates to the scarcity of models capable to

al 2012 lu et al 2016 pandey 2020 van ginkel et al 2018 zhao et al 2009 the assessment of water security based on risk concepts was said to become prevalent a few years ago garrick and hall 2014 but the related models still provide incomplete views about the nexus security indicators versus risk parameters for the supply of raw water to large metropolitan areas the model of dadson et al 2017 handled water security risk but was interested on the interplay between water related investments security risk and economic growth not on the management of raw water security risk based on the coupling of security indicators and risk parameters the framework developed by hall and borgomeo 2013 investigated the risks of water scarcity for domestic industrial and agricultural uses the model was based on indicators of demand supply and mitigation actions and aimed to predict the frequency and severity of future water shortages based climate and population change scenarios therefore these authors addressed security risks related to water quantity but neither integrated their outcomes with water quality risks nor considered the importance of detectability in the risk assessment the status of water security implementation obtained from outside the academic world strengthens our conviction about the need to improve water security assessments namely through an ample blending of security indicators and risk parameters starting with brazil the national plan uses an index to measure water security based on four dimensions human economic ecosystemic and related to resilience http arquivos ana gov br pnsh pnsh pdf every dimension is represented by one or more security indicator that can be quantitatively assessed and ranked according to severity levels in general ranging from 1 to 5 the index is then calculated as weighted sum of indicator levels where the weights reflect the indicator importance set up by experts in hungary the local water security action planning manual laušević et al 2016 also uses a systemic approach to water security whereby the dimensions economic environmental social and the elements needs to be secured actors involved resources and their potential and infrastructure of water security are identified and the corresponding indicators are quantitatively described water availability demand and quality infrastructure condition and level of treatment access to people and impact to human health however the systemic analyses of brazil and hungary do not handle the security indicators from a risk standpoint whereby they could be ranked according to probability of occurrence and data measurement reliability besides severity the practical examples reported for australia show that promotion of water security in the urban areas depends on whether the critical indicator is quantity or quality queensland has produced a water security plan focused on combating water scarcity caused by severe droughts https www dnrme qld gov au in melbourne the key factor was improving water quality turner et al 2016 in neither case the approaches involved the integration of quantity quality and extreme event security indicators and risk parameters into a joint assessment the general purpose of this study was therefore to contribute with a new model capable to evaluate water security based on conventional indicators and the associated risk based on a lumped measure of severity frequency and data reliability besides this substantial goal the study also aimed to develop a simple model capable to help decision making therefore the proposed method is based on a few number of water security indicators represented by readily assessed variables the specific objectives were 1 to define a number of catchment scale water security indicators pressures relevant for urban water supply of raw water 2 to characterize the pressures for risk properties namely severity s occurrence o and detectability d 3 to measure water security risk framing the s o d in the failure mode and effects analysis a pilot study was conducted in the hydrographic basin of rio das velhas to test the water security risk model this watershed is located in the state of minas gerais brazil and is a source of water for the metropolitan region of belo horizonte with 4 4 million people in brazil this region is among the most severely affected by water security problems with very large areas characterized by low security see fig 1 below it is representative of a large metropolitan region with major water security problems which can be used as reference to many other metropolises besides the large dimension and severe problems that affect this region the international relevance of this case study relies on the security problems involved namely severe and recurrent water shortages as well as chronic water quality problems which can be transposed to many other urban regions around the planet the model as whole has limited regional specificity it uses specific reference flows and quality standards but many countries also have those thresholds implemented and therefore the method can be transposed to any region on earth with straightforward adaption 2 study area the rio das velhas is located in the state of minas gerais between the latitudes 17 15 s 20 25 s and longitudes 43 25 w 44 50 w the drainage basin covers an area

security problems affecting the region are severe as can be deduced from fig 1 where the brazilian water security index is represented 3 materials and methods 3 1 a framework of water security risk for urban supply systems a general framework of water security risk for urban supply systems is outlined in fig 4 the structure comprises two modules or parts part 1 describes several issues related to the sources of raw water that are analyzed at the catchment scale part 2 describes problems related to the urban supply system analyzed at the infrastructure or treatment plant scales the framework will be developed and published in two companion papers because the level of analysis in part 1 is different from part 2 part 1 is analyzed at the programme level where the evaluation of risks is based on the quantification of pressures droughts water demand and the risks of their impacts severity likelihood and detectability part 2 is analyzed at the operational level being focused on potential failures of system components such as pipe leaks leading to water losses technological adaption to water quality variation among others the present study aims to quantitatively assess part 1 the first module outlines the security risk model of raw water which aims to evaluate the risk considering the quantity and quality components and predefined abstraction points within the watershed the module is implemented in three steps a characterization of pressures security indicators affecting the hydrographic basin b assessment of pressure impacts through evaluation of three risk properties severity occurrence and detectability c potential responses from the management authorities namely through implementation of mitigating actions or adaption measures that include provision of alternative abstraction points rationalization of use pollution control through implementation of sewage systems and wastewater treatment plants among others it is worth noting that the management or adaption actions listed in fig 4 part 1c are examples selected from the authors experience in general part 1c should be able to create a portfolio of management options to achieve each management goal based on context specific risk or a user driven quantitative prioritization scheme to identify what management strategies might be optimal for their context 3 2 workflow to quantitatively assess the raw water security risk the route to quantitatively assess the raw water security risk of an urban supply system is portrayed in fig 5 it comprises a characterization stage and an evaluation stage the analysis is centered on the abstraction point from which the water is collected and delivered to the various uses considering the hydrographic basin upstream from the abstraction point the characterization stage starts to identify natural and anthropogenic pressures potentially acting on the area for example water demand droughts ordinary and accidental contamination the large arrow pointing to the left describes this worflow when active these pressures can cause quantitative and qualitative stresses on the abstraction point threatening raw water security then a number of properties are selected to characterize the pressures and associated impacts risk properties the chosen properties were detectability occurrence and severity finally a group of parameters or criteria are adopted to adequately describe the properties for example the water stress index was adopted to quantitatively describe the severity of water demand impact the workflow leading to pressure and risk property characterization is illustrated by the small arrows pointing to the right the evaluation stage is executed in one step large arrow pointing to the right based on the values of detectability d occurrence o and severity s determined in the characterization stage the risk of raw water security is calculated for each pressure as weighted product of d o and s folowing the fmea failure mode and effect analysis ben daya 2009 schneider and stamatis 1996 the next subsections describe the stages and steps outlined in this section 3 2 1 pressures impacts and their properties the selection of pressures indicated on fig 5 was built upon a comprehensive literature review coupled with the authors experience on water resources management and the context urban water supply the list of pressures is summarized in the last column of table 1 the pressures are reproduced in column 1 and briefly described in column 2 the next columns characterize the pressures for the properties occurrence and detectability as well as for the potential adverse effects impacts on the supply system which can be ranked according to severity as regards occurrence pressures can be classified as frequent or contingent if they occur regularly or sporadically detectability describes the system s capacity to recognize and monitor the pressure namely if the pressure can be perceived immediately or predicted on the basis of a recurrence model the adverse effects comprise chronic and acute quantity and quality hazards related to the pressure e g chronic water shortage or accidental pollution 3 2 2 characterization of properties 3 2 2 1 severity the pressures can act on raw water producing quantitative and qualitative stresses the magnitude of a stress measures the impact of a pressure while severity describes the impact on a qualitative scale in the present model the impact of pressures on water quantity results from the action of demand and droughts the stress caused by water demand is measured by the ratio of a granted flow q out which means the amount of water permitted to be withdrawn from the river allocated water over a reference flow q ref called water stress index i ws gleick 1996 raskin et al 1997 1 i ws q o u t q r e f 100 in brazil there are predefined values for the reference flow of perennial streams https www ana gov br the most common threshold is the aforementioned q7 10 minimum stream flow in 7 consecutive days with a 10 year return period which was adopted for the present model the granted flow is a percentage of the reference flow the larger the grant the larger the stress and consequently the impact and severity the stress caused by the droughts is measured by the ratio of minimum daily flow in a predefined timeframe q usually a year over the reference flow which was coined by the authors as anomalous flow index i af 2 i a f q q r e f when the i af gets 1 the river is said to enter a critical hydrologic condition the impact of pressures on water quality was assessed by a framework compliance index ice this parameter measures the aggregated deviation of various quality parameters relative to predefined thresholds the selected parameters were thermo tolerant coliforms coli tt escherichia coli biochemical oxygen demand bod total phosphorus ptot dissolved oxygen do field ph and turbidity following the indication of ana the national water agency ana 2012 the deviations are assessed in regard to three conditions 1 scope number of parameters that violated the desirable limits at least once in the period of interest 2 frequency share of non conformities relative to the number of observations 3 amplitude difference between observed and desired values considering the quality objective for water the calculated ratings of ice are then normalized to the 0 100 scale where 100 means full compliance with the expected quality standards and 0 no compliance finally the normalized compliances are ranked according to five categories ana 2012 namely very good 100 95 good 95 80 regular 80 65 bad 65 45 very bad 45 the application of ice depends on whether the pressure is frequent or contingent table 1 in the first case ordinary contaminants the application is based on the comparison of actual and reference ices in the second case accidental contaminants the ice is evaluated considering the response of all parameters to the contingent hazard i e on the comparison of their values before and after the accidental spill besides the aforementioned impacts which are called direct anthropogenic activities can affect the water security of abstraction points through changes in land use namely of vegetation cover these impacts are called indirect and can interfere with raw water quality and quantity a number of studies has firmly related forest cover with improved water quality gartner et al 2013 macdonald and shemie 2014 ríos villamizar et al 2017 schmalz et al 2015 tnc 2015 unesco 2018 the studies refer the capacity of vegetation patches or riparian buffer strips to filter sediments and contaminants before they reach the water bodies fernandes et al 2020 2019 pissarra et al 2019 valera et al 2019 the relationship between forest occupation and water quantity in catchments has been addressed as well but the conclusions are divisive gartner et al 2013 mcculloch and robinson 1993 putro et al 2016 usually afforestation changes the water balance in the catchment rising some components and dropping others santos et al 2019 therefore the role of afforestation on water quantity depends on the component one is looking at in the present model the presence of forest cover upstream the abstraction point is assumed to favor water security which means that the model highlighted the importance of forest cover for improved water quality the percentage of forest cover will be used to rank severity in this regard 3 2 2 2 occurrence in addition to severity the harmful effects of a pressure depend on occurrence frequency the most frequent events are likely to be more threatening to water security than the rarer events however the frequent events are also expected to be less intense than rare events for example the water demand droughts and land use changes are more frequent when they occur at the minimum intensity e g low intensity short standing droughts than when they take place at the maximum force e g pervasive deforestation the ordinary contaminants are an exception around the urban areas because poor quality water is frequent at high levels of intensity finally accidental contamination is an exceptional event and for that reason not frequent nevertheless when these events occur are characteristically very intense and therefore deserve special attention in regard to mitigation measures 3 2 2 3 detectability detectability describes the feasibility of a pressure to be assessed the pressures more rigorously described are less risky than the pressures for which information is lacking or fragmented this property was included in the analysis to account for model uncertainty important factors that affect detectability include the monitoring network s quality spatial and temporal coverage and the measurement technologies for example water demand drought and ordinary contaminant impacts are poorly detected in ungauged watersheds detectably factors also include the quality and amount of information and data compiled about the watershed such as land use maps or historical records on environmental accidents 3 2 3 graduation of properties the properties of pressures and impacts were graduated for the sake of risk assessment forthcoming section 3 2 4 in all cases the number of classes were limited to three to reduce the spectrum of severity occurrence and detectability combinations that when large could complicate the analysis and subsequent decision making andrade and turrioni 2000 soares et al 2013 vilas bôas and peres 2013 for the same reason simplicity the graduation values of each property class were reduced to integer numbers 1 2 or 3 the next step was to set up the limits of each class for every property and pressure for the severity of water demand i ws index and drought i af index the classes were defined in keeping with the recommendations of ana the national water agency ana 2009 and the integrated system of environmental information siam 2015 hosted by the minas gerais state secretariat for environment and sustainable development table 2 columns 1 and 2 for ordinary contaminants column 3 the five classes of ice were arbitrarily recast into three levels of severity as follows 1 low very good ice good 2 moderate ice regular 3 high bad ice very bad for the accidental contaminants column 4 the severity levels were set to low when the ice did not change after the spill to moderate when the ice deteriorated to the next class e g from regular to bad and to high when it jumped more than one class e g from regular to very bad the set up of thresholds for vegetation cover was based on legal constraints defined for protected areas in brazil namely the legal reserve conservation units and permanent preservation areas ppa the law no 12651 12 called forest code enforced a percentage of forest cover in these areas to preserve native vegetation from expansion of urban areas and anthropogenic activities valera et al 2017 but also to keep good quality water in streams recent publications confirmed the role of ppa widths in the conservation of water quality pissarra et al 2019 valera et al 2019 therefore the percentages of forest occupation indicated in the forest code were used as proxies to the vegetation cover limits depicted in column 5 of table 2 the boundaries of occurrence and detectability classes are listed in tables 3 and 4 respectively they apply to all pressures as regards occurrence the levels increased from 1 low risk to 3 high risk for increasing levels of pressure frequency namely isolated events irregular or seasonal patterns and regular to continuous pressure the thresholds of detectability were defined according to qualitative criteria comprising sensory evidences low risk availability or possibility to measure the pressure moderate risk and the need to use indirect approaches such as hydrologic inferences high risk 3 2 4 raw water security risk the estimation of raw water security risk was based on the fmea failure mode and effect analysis ben daya 2009 schneider and stamatis 1996 the method defines risk as product of occurrence detectability and severity originally the fmea attributed the same importance to all intervening variables and that was viewed as limitation fattahi and khalilzadeh 2018 leal et al 2006 liu et al 2017 in the present case the equal weights are also a restriction because the importance of pressure properties differ severity is by far the most important property because of its direct association with the pressure impacts occurrence is ranked as second most important property before detectability because occurrence is still related with the pressure while detectability is external inasmuch as it merely assesses the uncertainty involved in the pressure characterization the relative importance of s o d as defined in the present study is followed by many other studies using the fmea approach liu et al 2019 wang et al 2009 in order to overcome this drawback weights were defined for each property and included in the fmea equation for raw water security risk as follows 3 r ws s w s o w o d w d where r ws is the risk the terms s o and d describe severity occurrence and detectability respectively and the exponent terms ws wo and wd represent the corresponding weights considering the aforementioned relevance of each property the weights were set to w s 2 5 w o 0 75 and w d 0 25 the specific values were obtained through consensus of a team involving several members with distinctive sensibilities namely the first author the general director of minas gerais water institute the corresponding author an academic and two water institute technicians the number of s o d combinations is 27 the range of raw water security values is 1 r ws 46 8 in keeping with above mentioned weights table 5a for management purposes this interval was divided into security classes the number of classes and related labels were defined in keeping with criteria recommended by the organization for economic co operation and development oecd 2013b 1 acceptable 2 tolerable 3 unacceptable the tolerable risks do not require action besides monitoring of pressure properties the other risks call for mitigation measures that are proportional to the level of risk both in intensity and speed the limits of each class were defined on the basis of severity and occurrence the most important properties as follows a the unacceptable risks comprised the high impacts s 3 or the moderate impacts s 2 with high occurrence o 3 b the tolerable risks included the moderate s 2 to the low impacts s 1 with high occurrence o 3 c finally the acceptable risks were those with low severity s 1 and moderate or low occurrence o 2 or o 1 these criteria are summarized in table 5b considering the weights assigned to s o and d the boundaries of security risk r ws were calculated using eq 3 and are presented in the last column the rws grows continuously and exponentially for increasing s o d ranks with an exception in the transition from s o d 2 3 3 to s o d 3 1 1 this transition belongs to the unacceptable class and here the rws decreases from 17 0 to 15 6 the link of a risk measure to a risk class is not affected by this exception because it appears away from the tolerable unacceptable limit 3 2 5 sensitivity analysis the weights assigned to the risk factors assume that severity s is the key factor many applications based on the failure modes and effects model make the same assumption liu et al 2019 wang et al 2009 however for the sake of verifying the model response to changing the weights of s o and d two additional scenarios were tested 1 in the first scenario the weights of severity and occurrence were equated because the frequency of severe events is also paramount for assessing the risk 2 in the second scenario all risk parameters were equated this could be a base scenario when no a priori assumptions exist about the importance of each risk factor in all cases the sum of weights was equal to the original assessment now termed scenario 1 s1 s o d 3 5 2 5 0 75 0 25 so in the first additional scenario s2 the weights were s 1 5 o 1 5 d 0 5 and in the second additional scenario s3 the weights were s o d 1 17 besides testing the model response to changing the security property weights sensitivity analysis helped reducing the risk of misinterpretation and potential attribution of wrong weights kosovac and davidson 2020 4 results the raw water security risk model was applied to the portion of rio das velhas watershed located upstream of bela fama s abstraction point which covers an area of 1682 5 km2 and is characterized by low to very low water security indices fig 1 this public water source belongs to the rio das velhas system that supplies the belo horizonte metropolitan region namely the municipalities of itabirito nova lima ouro preto and rio acima with a total of 226 000 inhabitants a number of information sources were used to characterize the pressures and related impacts the sources were mostly public and included various organizations from the state of minas gerais including semad secretariat for the environment and sustainable development http www meioambiente mg gov br igam water resources management institute http www igam mg gov br feam environmental foundation http www feam br ief forest institute http www ief mg gov br copasa sanitation company http www copasa com br peixe vivo agency https agenciapeixevivo org br and fiemg industry federation https www7 fiemg com br the data required to evaluate raw water security at the bela fama s abstraction point were downloaded from these websites organized and processed in the model workflow of fig 5 4 1 characterization of severity according to the igam s records the demand for raw water in the interest area was 12 05 m3 s in 2010 this value was used to characterize demand in the present study the reference flow q7 10 was determined from stream discharge data available at the honório bicalho s hydrometric station http www snirh gov br hidroweb serieshistoricas using the siscah software souza 2011 the discharges refer to 2019 and were assumed to follow the weibull distribution the result was q7 10 11 68 m3 s the consequent water stress index is iws 103 2 eq 1 and severity is s 3 table 2 the q7 10 is plotted in fig 6 where the entire 2019 stream flow record is also represented the lowest discharge occurred in september q 7 9 m3 s the reason why the anomalous flow index was set to i af 7 9 11 68 0 67 eq 2 and severity to s 3 the characterization of ordinary contaminants ice index was based on the igam s monitoring records in 2019 the average values for the ice components were coli tt 9803 nmp 100 ml bod 2 2 mg l ptot 0 21 mg l do 7 mg l 8 1 ph 6 5 and turbidity 157 unt the corresponding compliance framework index was ice 40 71 which means a very bad compliance and hence a severity s 3 this condition was not occasional because the igam s records relative to the 2003 2019 period reveal 35 of very bad and 65 of bad compliances see fig 9 below the assessment of accidental contaminants was based on data from the feam the tailings dams distributed upstream from the bela fama s abstraction point and related to the mining of iron represented the fixed sources http www feam br monitoramento gestao de barragens the inventory of road and railway accidents that occurred around the water source and resulted in spills of hazardous substances represented the mobile sources http www meioambiente mg gov br emergencia ambiental the number of tailings dams is 37 they represent diverse levels of potential damage to the rio das velhas water supply system upon rupture low 3 dams medium 10 high 24 overall the system s vulnerability to this contaminant point sources is very high however in 2019 no accidents occurred with the tailing dams the number of transportation accidents in 2019 were 6 and represented road accidents they occurred in the nova lima and itabirito municipalities without changing the ice around the bela fama s water source the absence of accidents with fixed sources and lack of ice response to accidents with mobile sources implies a severity s 1 in 2019 the land use and cover lulc within the parcel of rio das velhas watershed located upstream the bela fama s abstraction point is presented in table 6 the lulc distribution was obtained from interpretation of landsat images relative to 2019 available at the earth explorer platform of united states geological survey https earthexplorer usgs gov the image resolution is 30 m and the scenes were classified by the maxver icm interated conditional modes method nunes et al 2011 to obtain the lulc classes the vegetative cover comprises 37 of forest fragments and 30 of arable land meaning that the area devoid of vegetation is 33 50 thus in keeping with the

was estimated in 27 1 the regularity of water demand increase characterizes this pressure as frequent meaning with high occurrence o 3 the frequency of droughts was interpreted from a long term stream flow record 48 years namely the largest series available for the bela fama s abstraction point 1972 2019 period the hydrograph is illustrated in fig 7 the average stream flow discharge was 28 5 m3 s the number of years with annual discharge below the average that we called dry years was 23 which means approximately 50 thus the frequency of droughts approached by the frequency of dry years was moderate with the occurrence set to o 2 the history of untreated domestic effluents discharged upstream the bela fama s abstraction point is documented in the national secretariat for sanitation archives http app4 mdr gov br seriehistorica the volumes were repeatedly large varying from a minimum of 25 of all produced effluents and a maximum of 63 in the 2007 2018 period the contamination of stream water by ordinary pollutants was therefore regular and for that reason characterized by the largest level of occurrence o 3 the history of accidents with consequences for the rio das velhas supply system was compiled from the feam s datasets the time window was set to 2010 2019 within this period there were 3 accidents with fixed sources tailings dams all producing impacts on water the accidents involving mobile sources road accidents were 54 but only one contaminated the stream water in view of this history the occurrence was graded as moderate o 2 the interpretation of landsat images using the maxver icm interated conditional modes method revealed areas devoid of vegetation that slightly decreased from 1999 to 2019 in the beginning of this period the non vegetated areas occupied 551 km2 and in the end 522 km2 the change was considered occasional and therefore infrequent o 1 4 3 characterization of detectability the water stress index relies on granted and reference stream flow discharges these values are objectively defined and easily quantified besides of being regularly used by water resource managers in daily activity therefore the water demand pressure is detectable continuously and sensibly being graduated with the minimum risk d 1 table 4 the ordinary and accidental contaminants were assessed from field data and for that reason graduated with a moderate detectability d 2 finally the pressures droughts and environmental conditions were interpreted from hydrologic models or satellite images and consequently assigned a reduced detectability d 3 in both cases 4 4 evaluation of raw water security risk the summary of s o and d ratings as assigned to the pressures and related impacts is provided in table 7 the before last column describes the risk measure rws calculated by eq 3 while the last column depicts the risk class based on the current assessment the water security risk of bela fama s abstraction point is unacceptable for water demand droughts and ordinary contaminants and acceptable for accidental contaminants and environmental conditions 4 5 results of sensitivity analysis the results of sensitivity analysis are illustrated in fig 8 the xx axis rank contains 27 entries that represent the number of s o and d combinations considering that these risk factors may all assume the values 1 2 or 3 table 5a the ranks are defined for increasing values of s then increasing values of o for the same s and finally increasing values of d for the same o and s the yy axis represents the risk of water security calculated by eq 3 the blue red and green lines describe the evolution of water security as function of rank the r ws is larger for the larger ranks because they correspond to combinations of larger s d and o values the differences between the lines are due to the weight changes the figure also depicts the ranks of stressors represented by the vertical dashed lines see values in table 7 and the thresholds that separate the acceptable tolerable and unacceptable risks based on the original assessment s1 see values in table 5b it is clear that regardless the scenario the risk associated to stressors droughts water demand and ordinary contaminants is unacceptable however the risks related with stressors environmental conditions and accidental contaminants may change as function of the changing weight the risks related with the environmental conditions are acceptable for s1 and s2 and move to the frontier between acceptable and tolerable for s3 the risks related with the accidental contaminants are acceptable for s1 and tolerable for s2 and s3 relative to s2 and s3 s1 is generally less risky for smaller ranks but becomes more risky for higher ranks 5 discussion 5 1 analysis of water security risk in the studied area the large security risk values estimated for the rio das velhas supply system reflect the poor water condition perceived for long time by the minas gerais authorities on water resources management environment and sanitation but application of our model allowed to quantify the perception a fundamental step to decide upon the type and intensity of mitigation measures the simultaneous tabulation of security risk values natural and anthropogenic pressures and pressure properties table 7 allowed a panoramic view over the risk levels dominating the study area as well the pressures requiring priority mitigation the outlook of urban water supply security from diversified standpoints has been realized in various recent studies babel et al 2020b krueger et al 2019a the assessment of water security risk using the failure modes and effects method highlighted the very high values of r ws obtained for ordinary contaminants rws 42 3 water demand 35 5 and droughts 34 5 in 2019 if the analysis were expanded to a larger period the results would reveal that this critical condition may have started several years before fig 9 describes the evolution of ice contamination index i af drought index and i ws demand index since 2003 or earlier the blue and green lines describe the i af 1981 2019 period and i ws 2000 2019 respectively whereas the vertical bars 2003 2019 portray the ice under very bad red and bad yellow water quality conditions a close inspection of fig 9 makes it evident the sharp decrease of i af from 2014 onwards before 2014 the drought risk was moderate but changed to high since then the decrease of i af was accompanied by a sharp increase of i ws before 2012 the values of this index represented a low water demand risk but afterwards the risk changed to moderate finally the number of years with very bad ice increased substantially in 2011 2019 44 relative to 2003 2010 12 5 taken altogether the 2014 2019 period represented a serious condition for water supply in belo horizonte fig 8 describes the year of 2019 as rather preoccupying because three pressure indicators represented unacceptable risks regardless the weighting scenario water demand i ws droughts i af and ordinary contaminants ice these results are valid for 2019 but should not be understood as universal for the region in this regard fig 9 anticipates more tolerable security risks in the metropolitan area of belo horizonte before 2011 because the severity of water demand was low and of droughts was low to moderate while after that these severities raised to moderate for iws and to high for iaf so the evaluation of water security risk in a region requires a dynamic weighting of security properties adapted to envisaged scenarios combined with the monitoring of pressure indicator changes over time in general for every pressure indicator the corresponding risk is always determined by the intersection of its rank line the vertical dashed lines represented in fig 8 and the selected weighting line the colored lines plotted in the same figure the rank line can be moved to the left or to the right depending on whether the indicator s rank is lower or higher at the time of evaluation respectively whereas the weighting line can be adapted to the valuation of pressure indicator importance at the same moment therefore fig 8 is a snapshot of water security risk assessed in 2019 which can be redrawn to represent any other past or future year through the plot of rank and weighting lines representing those moments the 2011 2019 period coincides a number of water shortages affecting several regions in brazil eventually the most important is the one caused by the unprecedented drought of 2014 2015 that preferably occurred in the southeast region e g são paulo and generated a severe water crisis with a high impact on water supply and hydropower generation empinotti et al 2019 millington 2018 the 2015 2016 drought mostly affecting the amazon region is also worth noting since was the severest and widespread in the last 100 years jiménez muñoz et al 2016 finally one might refer the multiyear drought of 2011 2017 generally affecting the northeast and viewed as the most extreme in decades cunha et al 2019 fig 9 can therefore be the view of our failure modes model over these documented drought and water crises namely of their reflexes on the studied area in the rio das velhas supply system the risk related to domestic contaminants derives from uncontrolled effluent discharges ineffective treatment of domestic effluents and incomplete sewage system coverage this is a long standing problem in the region with known consequences for surface water quality friese et al 2010 the situation is very preoccupying because the water security risk derived therefrom is severe and frequent table 7 unfortunately it is also a common place in many regions around the globe that has been mentioned in various articles and reviews on wastewater management and water security bradley and bartram 2013 hoekstra et al 2018 khan et al 2020 the risk of water demand was also classified as severe and forecasted to become worse in the future in response to a projection of population growth in the metropolitan region of belo horizonte this concern was reported for other regions in brazil such as paraíba do sul river basin paiva et al 2020 where the authors additionally addressed quality issues derived from urban sprawl such as industrialization and agricultural intensification 5 2 the choice of using failure modes to assess water security at catchment scale this study presented for the first time a raw water security risk model based on failure mode and effects analysis fmea the fmea is an approach that has been used in the water sector when the studies were carried out at the operational level of analysis i e at the water supply system scale the novelty of our study was to bring the method to a programme level of analysis i e at the catchment scale where it has barely been tested to our best knowledge some advantages of our method are noteworthy while other similar approaches at this scale evaluate security through isolated or combined assessments of pressure indicators damkjaer and taylor 2017 howlett and cuenca 2017 jensen and wu 2018 the present framework couples the pressures with variables important to risk management such as severity occurrence and detectability this achievement is significant in the next paragraphs a comprehensive survey of modeling approaches to water security is presented that makes evident the lack of a model framework that combines the objectivity of operational level methods failure modes with the holistic views of programme level methods based on the combined assessment of security indicators the reduced number of levels adopted to characterize the pressures properties and security risks is another gain small differences among risk conditions may not be detected this way but decision making is facilitated when based on fewer criteria this practical choice reflects the authors experience on water resources management especially the first author s who currently heads a team of experienced technicians at the minas gerais institute for water resources management igam the team experience was also beneficial to the choice of property weights eq 3 the team members composed of experienced managers academics and field technicians followed a delphi consensus approach commonly used in water policy and management studies chung et al 2014 de carvalho et al 2017 mayor et al 2016 taylor and ryder 2003 the method of failure modes and effects has been applied before to the water sector but not in the context of raw water security assessments at catchment scale as done in the present study for example the method was used to analyze the risk of drinking water processing in indonesia where the authors highlighted the incorrect treatment dosage and lack of pumping machine maintenance as prominent failure risks rimantho and hatta 2018 another example comes from the tucson regional water supply system usa where the method was used to examine the volumetric severity and likelihood of a component failure within a network that links sources to demand points aiming to assess redundancies and resilience within the system hwang et al 2015 diao and co workers proposed the so called global resilience analysis to test the resilience of four water distribution systems to three typical failure modes pipe failure excess demand and substance intrusion diao et al 2016 the water sector has approached water security risk from standpoints other than the failure modes and effects method in keeping with the purpose to attain at the predefined level of analysis e g operational programme or strategic at the programme level a reference for the present study the attention is primarily laid on techniques used to evaluate the risks posed by a similar hazard at a variety of locations or with the wide variety of risks existing within a watershed pollard et al 2004 the earliest and most simple programme level approaches included the coupling of geographic information systems gis with data on the water supply infrastructure and aimed to visually track utility assets and evaluate their risk factors booth and rogers 2001 more evolved approaches integrated spatially distributions of water availability quality demand among other security indicators in order to assess the risk of water supply systems d ambrosio et al 2020 zende et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 or reviewed the remote sensing applications for water security addressing the topics of quantity quality and extremes chawla et al 2020 studies at the strategic level of analysis could also be discussed here krueger et al 2019b siska and takara 2015 but they fall outside the scope of this work organizations have also proposed specific water security risk assessments at the programme level of analysis targeting the compliance of legal directives for example the dpsir framework developed by the european environmental agency eea in 1999 kristensen 2004 was proposed to identify relevant hazards within a hydrographic basin targeting the water framework directive directive 2000 60 ec of the european parliament and of the council the framework recognizes driving forces e g growth of population pressures discharges of effluents state amplified nutrient loads impacts lake eutrophication and policy response control of effluent discharge and was adopted to assess water security risk at catchment scale babel and shinde 2018 gari et al 2018 besides the dpsir the european environmental agency developed the pressure pathway receptor framework in 2000 to accommodate a plethora of potential catchment management issues eea 2000 including the compliance with the wfd by european member states this conceptual model was later used in various studies aiming the evaluation and ranking of potential pollution risks as well as the prioritization of risk management or mitigation procedures pacheco and sanches fernandes 2016 santos et al 2015 more recently water security at the programme level of analysis has been assessed through holistic approaches involving the selection of adequate security indicators for water quantity quality and extremes floods droughts that subsequently are processed in sophisticated algorithms to obtain a global security view over the system a few cases were presented in the introduction section but others can also be mentioned li et al 2019 for example a study in japan resorted to the system dynamics model borrowed from cybernetics to obtain an integrated assessment of water security systems in the country su et al 2019 another study used the problem and solution tree mapping to handle data from a multi stakeholder workshop involving members from the state and local governments researchers development agencies and the local community and achieve water security in rural indian himalayas sen and kansal 2019 a third study used the projection pursuit model an emerging mathematical method for turning high dimensional nonlinear problems into one dimensional ones combined with a particle swarm optimization technique to get an assessment of water security in central asia based on ecological water availability water demand and socioeconomic criteria wang et al 2020 in none of the formerly presented studies a combination of operational and programme level methods was tested to assess water security that was accomplished in the present study 5 3 an outlook on mitigation and adaption measures the index values depicted in fig 9 for the rio das velhas system represent unacceptable water quantity and quality risks and call for urgent mitigation and adaption measures a condition identical to this system was described elsewhere chang and zhu 2020 where the authors evaluated water security in four municipalities of china depending on the municipality the proposed mitigating actions included community adaption to droughts tianjin and beijing reduction of water use and regulation of wastewater and pollutant discharges shanghai improvement of sewage and drainage infrastructure and balancing the water intensity of economic activities chongqing a number of other studies addressed mitigation and adaption measures related to one or various water security indicators in cases where the risks of water demand were studied the working groups explored in detail some mitigation measures that included the resort to alternative sources xu et al 2020 climate change was also an issue in urban water security research related to demand jaramillo and nazemi 2018 while climate projections were used to assess the drought component of water security risk in numerous works babel et al 2020b kisakye and van der bruggen 2018 stewart et al 2020 verbist et al 2020 several adaption measures were proposed in those recent studies that could be transposed to the rio das velhas supply system such as pricing incentives and regulatory measures to encourage permanent urban water conservation revision of the water rights system investment in water recycling investment in rainwater infrastructure that enables regular aquifer recharge and surplus storage during normal and wet seasons the water security plan for mitigation measures must be able to prioritize preventive adaptive and contingent actions some examples of preventive and adaptive procedures were indicated in the previous paragraphs the rio das velhas supply system serves the eastern part of belo horizonte metropolitan region with a nominal capacity close to 48 7 2 m3 s the system is complemented for the reminder 52 with raw water from the paropeba river basin which supplies the western part with 7 8 m3 s stored in three reservoirs the two sub systems are integrated but the current adaptation to water demand variations in the region can only occur through water transferences from the rio das velhas to the paraopeba system not vice versa besides there are no alternative abstraction points in the rio das velhas basin to prevent the system from contingent demands the urban water supply is therefore vulnerable and periodically under great stress monitoring contributes significantly to implement adequate mitigation measures from the standpoint of water security risk the monitoring system should be adapted to cover the most risky pressures in the hydrographic basin in the rio das velhas the spatial density of monitoring stations should be adjusted to allow more precise descriptions of actual and reference flows as well as stream water quality technology should also be adapted to allow automatic transmission of data especially where contingent pressures are likely to occur taken altogether these actions would help to characterize detectability and reduce the associated risks in turn the improved detectability would contribute to early recognition of pattern changes and hence to a better characterization of occurrence overall a monitoring network makes it possible to forecast and evaluate the efficacy of mitigating actions whenever they are necessary 6 conclusions the general purpose of this study was accomplished because the proposed water security risk model was developed and effectively applied to the supply system of a large urban area namely the metropolitan region of belo horizonte the method uses failure modes to quantify water security risk based on pressure indicators and risk variables the pressure indicators comprised water demand droughts ordinary and accidental contaminants and changes to forest cover the risk variables pressure properties were severity occurrence and detectability the combined use of pressure indicators and risk variables allowed to frame the current 2019 water security risk in the scope of historical or forecasted pressure changes besides security risk scores could be calibrated in regard to measurement reliability severity was the risk variable used to define the current status of pressures while occurrence framed them as function of past or future variation finally detectability measured reliability the calculation of water security risk as weighted product of severity occurrence and detectability failure mode model brought the three risk components into a single index this is new the evaluation of water security in the metropolitan region of belo horizonte namely in the rio das velhas supply system exposed high severity and frequency risks in regard to water demand droughts and ordinary contaminants the results were not surprising because they reflected the water resource managers perception the trigger of water demand risk was excessive water use thought to aggravate in the near future the drought risk was explained by current stream flow drops below the reference flow q7 10 which the minimum stream flow in 7 consecutive days with a 10 year return period coupled with a history of dry years finally the contaminant risk was justified by the long standing stream water contamination caused by domestic effluent loads overall the results provided the necessary insights to plan prioritize and implement adequate mitigation measures for raw water improvement broad conclusions on the water security of rio das velhas water supply system as whole would require a part 2 assessment fig 4 that is forecasted for a companion paper credit

4916,the provision of raw water to urban supply systems is a global endeavor and a great challenge to water resource managers of large metropolitan regions a sustainable supply requires the integrated management of water quantity and quality as well as the system s adaption to land use and climate changes e g deforestation droughts the available water security models inform about the current security status of a system based on the assessment of quantity quality and adaption indicators but they barely include risk variables in the analysis which could help to improve the security assessment considering the historical records of indicators or their future projections in the present study a new method is developed that couples a security assessment based on the rating of pressure indicators acting on a watershed such as water demand ordinary and accidental contaminants droughts and environmental settings e g share of forest cover with a risk assessment based on pressure properties such as severity occurrence and detectability the method is framed in the failure mode and effects analysis and was applied to the rio das velhas system that supplies a portion of belo horizonte metropolitan region minas gerais brazil with 4 million inhabitants the results exposed unacceptable risks for water demand ordinary contaminants and droughts because of their high severity and frequency the water demand risks were explained by data on current 2019 water scarcity and population growth projections until 2036 that are likely to raise water consumption the ordinary contaminant risks were deduced from information on current deviations of water quality parameters e g dissolved oxygen turbidity from legal thresholds and records since 2007 of stream water contamination by untreated domestic effluents finally the drought risks were explained by information on the persistence of stream flows below a legal reference flow coupled with the identification of many 23 dry years in the available stream flow record 48 years overall the proposed model was efficient in the evaluation of water security risk in the basin the results obtained for the study area help to act on the required mitigation through prioritization of risk attenuation given the simplicity and modest data requirements the method is helpful to decision makers and suited for replication

challenging the national authorities ever since the growth of world population climate change and resource availability became a concern oecd 2013a in brazil the urban supply challenge was recently noted in the most important metropolises such as são paulo rio de janeiro and belo horizonte these cities experienced severe water crises in 2014 and 2015 that endangered the provision of drinking water to approximately 39 million people nobre et al 2016 the prominent causes were prolonged drought limited resilience of public supply systems and the long standing degradation of hydrographic

example in brazil the recently announced national water security plan ana 2019 assures an integrated and consistent water infrastructure until the 2035 horizon to reduce drought and flood impacts usually quantitative assessments resort to metrics the scientific literature has published many metrics to assess water security based on indicators of quantity quality climatic variability and extreme events jensen and wu 2018 a guidance document published by the university of british columbia dunn et al 2012 compiled 365 water security indicators preferably focused on the quality of surface water the indicators on supply versus demand were also abundant while those addressing the role of infrastructure or governance were just a few and poorly developed in some specific studies water security was measured by water availability relation between storage and discharge relation between availability and demand availability per capita water quality contamination by nutrients organic loads or other pathogens rainfall deficits or surplus vulnerability or resilience to changes in the hydrologic regime flood occurrence and share of vegetation cover in the watershed or urban area arcadis 2016 brown and matlock 2011 chaves and alipaz 2007 gain et al 2016 gwp 2014 jensen and wu 2018 mason and calow 2012 raskin et al 1997 sullivan et al 2003 van ginkel et al 2018 van leeuwen et al 2012 wang et al 2017 despite the abundant literature on water security and related metrics some issues are not yet resolved an important example relates to the scarcity of models capable to anticipate water security states for the near future related to quantity and quality of raw water for urban supply based on the combined evaluation of security indicators and risk parameters such as severity probably of occurrence and detectability i e data availability or reliability many models measure one or more security indicators e g water resources availability raw water quality independently or in the form of aggregated indices and evaluate them as function of severity e g using a qualitative scale or through comparison with legal or environmental thresholds however these models rarely couple the results with risk assessments that could help characterizing the severity levels as function of frequency and the indicator data for reliability aboelnga et al 2019 dumont et al 2012 lu et al 2016 pandey 2020 van ginkel et al 2018 zhao et al 2009 the assessment of water security based on risk concepts was said to become prevalent a few years ago garrick and hall 2014 but the related models still provide incomplete views about the nexus security indicators versus risk parameters for the supply of raw water to large metropolitan areas the model of dadson et al 2017 handled water security risk but was interested on the interplay between water related investments security risk and economic growth not on the management of raw water security risk based on the coupling of security indicators and risk parameters the framework developed by hall and borgomeo 2013 investigated the risks of water scarcity for domestic industrial and agricultural uses the model was based on indicators of demand supply and mitigation actions and aimed to predict the frequency and severity of future water shortages based climate and population change scenarios therefore these authors addressed security risks related to water quantity but neither integrated their outcomes with water quality risks nor considered the importance of detectability in the risk assessment the status of water security implementation obtained from outside the academic world strengthens our conviction about the need to improve water security assessments namely through an ample blending of security indicators and risk parameters starting with brazil the national plan uses an index to measure water security based on four dimensions human economic ecosystemic and related to resilience http arquivos ana gov br pnsh pnsh pdf every dimension is represented by one or more security indicator that can be quantitatively assessed and ranked according to severity levels in general ranging from 1 to 5 the index is then calculated as weighted sum of indicator levels where the weights reflect the indicator importance set up by experts in hungary the local water security action planning manual laušević et al 2016 also uses a systemic approach to water security whereby the dimensions economic environmental social and the elements needs to be secured actors involved resources and their potential and infrastructure of water security are identified and the corresponding indicators are quantitatively described water availability demand and quality infrastructure condition and level of treatment access to people and impact to human health however the systemic analyses of brazil and hungary do not handle the security indicators from a risk standpoint whereby they could be ranked according to probability of occurrence and data measurement reliability besides severity the practical examples reported for australia show that promotion of water security in the urban areas depends on whether the critical indicator is quantity or quality queensland has produced a water security plan focused on combating water scarcity caused by severe droughts https www dnrme qld gov au in melbourne the key factor was improving water quality turner et al 2016 in neither case the approaches involved the integration of quantity quality and extreme event security indicators and risk parameters into a joint assessment the general purpose of this study was therefore to contribute with a new model capable to evaluate water security based on conventional indicators and the associated risk based on a lumped measure of severity frequency and data reliability besides this substantial goal the study also aimed to develop a simple model capable to help decision making therefore the proposed method is based on a few number of water security indicators represented by readily assessed variables the specific objectives were 1 to define a number of catchment scale water security indicators pressures relevant for urban water supply of raw water 2 to characterize the pressures for risk properties namely severity s occurrence o and detectability d 3 to measure water security risk framing the s o d in the failure mode and effects analysis a pilot study was conducted in the hydrographic basin of rio das velhas to test the water security risk model this watershed is located in the state of minas gerais brazil and is a source of water for the metropolitan region of belo horizonte with 4 4 million people in brazil this region is among the most severely affected by water security problems with very large areas characterized by low security see fig 1 below it is representative of a large metropolitan region with major water security problems which can be used as reference to many other metropolises besides the large dimension and severe problems that affect this region the international relevance of this case study relies on the security problems involved namely severe and recurrent water shortages as well as chronic water quality problems which can be transposed to many other urban regions around the planet the model as whole has limited regional specificity it uses specific reference flows and quality standards but many countries also have those thresholds implemented and therefore the method can be transposed to any region on earth with straightforward adaption 2 study area the rio das velhas is located in the state of minas gerais between the latitudes 17 15 s 20 25 s and longitudes 43 25 w 44 50 w the drainage basin covers an area of approximately 27 850 km2 the river flows along some 807 km and is the longer tributary of são francisco river fig 1 the total population in the basin approaches 4 409 896 inhabitants 24 7 of state s population land use and cover comprises 44 of agriculture and livestock pasturing areas and 45 5 of hardwood or shrub stands the urban centers are concentrated in just 2 9 of the basin despite the large occupation by agriculture and livestock production the gross domestic product in the region is mostly contributed with incomes from services and industry velhas 2015 the long term stream flow discharge at the main water course s mouth is q 310 38 m3 s on average the widrawals are represented in fig 2 as function of a safety standard conama resolution no 357 2005 q7 10 which is the minimum stream flow in 7 consecutive days with a 10 year return period the upper limit for authorized widrawals is 30 of q7 10 but this threshold has been exceeded in 2010 in various territorial units scbh

in the abstractions until 2035 mostly related with rises in mining 102 6 industry 82 1 and irrigation 70 4 consumption the demand for groundwater resources 71 9 increase is expected to grow more than for surface water especially in the industry sector 129 increase in regard to water quality the scenario in the rio das velhas is critical especially in the belo horizonte metropolitan area the iqa is a standard water quality index adopted in brazil being calculated on the basis of 1 water temperature 2 ph 3 dissolved oxygen 4 turbidity 5 total dissolved solids 6 biochemical oxygen demand 7 fecal coliforms 8 total nitrogen and 9 total phosphorus the iqa values are estimated as iqa i 1 n q i w i where 0 iqa 100 q i is the quality of i th parameter obtained from standardization of the measured values into a 0 100 range w i is the weight of i th parameter which varies in the 0 w i 1 interval as function of its importance to the overall quality and n is the total number of parameters depending on the iqa value the quality of stream water is graded as follows extremely poor iqa 19 poor 19 iqa 36 regular 36 iqa 51 good 51 iqa 79 excellent 79 iqa 100 more information o the iqa can be downloaded from http pnqa ana gov br indicadores indice aguas aspx in rio das velhas region the prevailing iqa is not better than regular 40 or even bad 35 as illustrated in fig 3 overall the water security problems affecting the region are severe as can be deduced from fig 1 where the brazilian water security index is represented 3 materials and methods 3 1 a framework of water security risk for urban supply systems a general framework of water security risk for urban supply systems is outlined in fig 4 the structure comprises two modules or parts part 1 describes several issues related to the sources of raw water that are analyzed at the catchment scale part 2 describes problems related to the urban supply system analyzed at the infrastructure or treatment plant scales the framework will be developed and published in two companion papers because the level of analysis in part 1 is different from part 2 part 1 is analyzed at the programme level where the evaluation of risks is based on the quantification of pressures droughts water demand and the risks of their impacts severity likelihood and detectability part 2 is analyzed at the operational level being focused on potential failures of system components such as pipe leaks leading to water losses technological adaption to water quality variation among others the present study aims to quantitatively assess part 1 the first module outlines the security risk model of raw water which aims to evaluate the risk considering the quantity and quality components and predefined abstraction points within the watershed the module is implemented in three steps a characterization of pressures security indicators affecting the hydrographic basin b assessment of pressure impacts through evaluation of three risk properties severity occurrence and detectability c potential responses from the management authorities namely through implementation of mitigating actions or adaption measures that include provision of alternative abstraction points rationalization of use pollution control through implementation of sewage systems and wastewater treatment plants among others it is worth noting that the management or adaption actions listed in fig 4 part 1c are examples selected from the authors experience in general part 1c should be able to create a portfolio of management options to achieve each management goal based on context specific risk or a user driven quantitative prioritization scheme to identify what management strategies might be optimal for their context 3 2 workflow to quantitatively assess the raw water security risk the route to quantitatively assess the raw water security risk of an urban supply system is portrayed in fig 5 it comprises a characterization stage and an evaluation stage the analysis is centered on the abstraction point from which the water is collected and delivered to the various uses considering the hydrographic basin upstream from the abstraction point the characterization stage starts to identify natural and anthropogenic pressures potentially acting on the area for example water demand droughts ordinary and accidental contamination the large arrow pointing to the left describes this worflow when active these pressures can cause quantitative and qualitative stresses on the abstraction point threatening raw water security then a number of properties are selected to characterize the pressures and associated impacts risk properties the chosen properties were detectability occurrence and severity finally a group of parameters or criteria are adopted to adequately describe the properties for example the water stress index was adopted to quantitatively describe the severity of water demand impact the workflow leading to pressure and risk property characterization is illustrated by the small arrows pointing to the right the evaluation stage is executed in one step large arrow pointing to the right based on the values of detectability d occurrence o and severity s determined in the characterization stage the risk of raw water security is calculated for each pressure as weighted product of d o and s folowing the fmea failure mode and effect analysis ben daya 2009 schneider and stamatis 1996 the next subsections describe the stages and steps outlined in this section 3 2 1 pressures impacts and their properties the selection of pressures indicated on fig 5 was built upon a comprehensive literature review coupled with the authors experience on water resources management and the context urban water supply the list of pressures is summarized in the last column of table 1 the pressures are reproduced in column 1 and briefly described in column 2 the next columns characterize the pressures for the properties occurrence and detectability as well as for the potential adverse effects impacts on the supply system which can be ranked according to severity as regards occurrence pressures can be classified as frequent or contingent if they occur regularly or sporadically detectability describes the system s capacity to recognize and monitor the pressure namely if the pressure can be perceived immediately or predicted on the basis of a recurrence model the adverse effects comprise chronic and acute quantity and quality hazards related to the pressure e g chronic water shortage or accidental pollution 3 2 2 characterization of properties 3 2 2 1 severity the pressures can act on raw water producing quantitative and qualitative stresses the magnitude of a stress measures the impact of a pressure while severity describes the impact on a qualitative scale in the present model the impact of pressures on water quantity results from the action of demand and droughts the stress caused by water demand is measured by the ratio of a granted flow q out which means the amount of water permitted to be withdrawn from the river allocated water over a reference flow q ref called water stress index i ws gleick 1996 raskin et al 1997 1 i ws q o u t q r e f 100 in brazil there are predefined values for the reference flow of perennial streams https www ana gov br the most common threshold is the aforementioned q7 10 minimum stream flow in 7 consecutive days with a 10 year return period which was adopted for the present model the granted flow is a percentage of the reference flow the larger the grant the larger the stress and consequently the impact and severity the stress caused by the droughts is measured by the ratio of minimum daily flow in a predefined timeframe q usually a year over the reference flow which was coined by the authors as anomalous flow index i af 2 i a f q q r e f when the i af gets 1 the river is said to enter a critical hydrologic condition the impact of pressures on water quality was assessed by a framework compliance index ice this parameter measures the aggregated deviation of various quality parameters relative to predefined thresholds the selected parameters were thermo tolerant coliforms coli tt escherichia coli biochemical oxygen demand bod total phosphorus ptot dissolved oxygen do field ph and turbidity following the indication of ana the national water agency ana 2012 the deviations are assessed in regard to three conditions 1 scope number of parameters that violated the desirable limits at least once in the period of interest 2 frequency share of non conformities relative to the number of observations 3 amplitude difference between observed and desired values considering the quality objective for water the calculated ratings of ice are then normalized to the 0 100 scale where 100 means full compliance with the expected quality standards and 0 no compliance finally the normalized compliances are ranked according to five categories ana 2012 namely very good 100 95 good 95 80 regular 80 65 bad 65 45 very bad 45 the application of ice depends on whether the pressure is frequent or contingent table 1 in the first case ordinary contaminants the application is based on the comparison of actual and reference ices in the second case accidental contaminants the ice is evaluated considering the response of all parameters to the contingent hazard i e on the comparison of their values before and after the accidental spill besides the aforementioned impacts which are called direct anthropogenic activities can affect the water security of abstraction points through changes in land use namely of vegetation cover these impacts are called indirect and can interfere with raw water quality and quantity a number of studies has firmly related forest cover with improved water quality gartner et al 2013 macdonald and shemie 2014 ríos villamizar et al 2017 schmalz et al 2015 tnc 2015 unesco 2018 the studies refer the capacity of vegetation patches or riparian buffer strips to filter sediments and contaminants before they reach the water bodies fernandes et al 2020 2019 pissarra et al 2019 valera et al 2019 the relationship between forest occupation and water quantity in catchments has been addressed as well but the conclusions are divisive gartner et al 2013 mcculloch and robinson 1993 putro et al 2016 usually afforestation changes the water balance in the catchment rising some components and dropping others santos et al 2019 therefore the role of afforestation on water quantity depends on the component one is looking at in the present model the presence of forest cover upstream the abstraction point is assumed to favor water security which means that the model highlighted the importance of forest cover for improved water quality the percentage of forest cover will be used to rank severity in this regard 3 2 2 2 occurrence in addition to severity the harmful effects of a pressure depend on occurrence frequency the most frequent events are likely to be more threatening to water security than the rarer events however the frequent events are also expected to be less intense than rare events for example the water demand droughts and land use changes are more frequent when they occur at the minimum intensity e g low intensity short standing droughts than when they take place at the maximum force e g pervasive deforestation the ordinary contaminants are an exception around the urban areas because poor quality water is frequent at high levels of intensity finally accidental contamination is an exceptional event and for that reason not frequent nevertheless when these events occur are characteristically very intense and therefore deserve special attention in regard to mitigation measures 3 2 2 3 detectability detectability describes the feasibility of a pressure to be assessed the pressures more rigorously described are less risky than the pressures for which information is lacking or fragmented this property was included in the analysis to account for model uncertainty important factors that affect detectability include the monitoring network s quality spatial and temporal coverage and the measurement technologies for example water demand drought and ordinary contaminant impacts are poorly detected in ungauged watersheds detectably factors also include the quality and amount of information and data compiled about the watershed such as land use maps or historical records on environmental accidents 3 2 3 graduation of properties the properties of pressures and impacts were graduated for the sake of risk assessment forthcoming section 3 2 4 in all cases the number of classes were limited to three to reduce the spectrum of severity occurrence and detectability combinations that when large could complicate the analysis and subsequent decision making andrade and turrioni 2000 soares et al 2013 vilas bôas and peres 2013 for the same reason simplicity the graduation values of each property class were reduced to integer numbers 1 2 or 3 the next step was to set up the limits of each class for every property and pressure for the severity of water demand i ws index and drought i af index the classes were defined in keeping with the recommendations of ana the national water agency ana 2009 and the integrated system of environmental information siam 2015 hosted by the minas gerais state secretariat for environment and sustainable development table 2 columns 1 and 2 for ordinary contaminants column 3 the five classes of ice were arbitrarily recast into three levels of severity as follows 1 low very good ice good 2 moderate ice regular 3 high bad ice very bad for the accidental contaminants column 4 the severity levels were set to low when the ice did not change after the spill to moderate when the ice deteriorated to the next class e g from regular to bad and to high when it jumped more than one class e g from regular to very bad the set up of thresholds for vegetation cover was based on legal constraints defined for protected areas in brazil namely the legal reserve conservation units and permanent preservation areas ppa the law no 12651 12 called forest code enforced a percentage of forest cover in these areas to preserve native vegetation from expansion of urban areas and anthropogenic activities valera et al 2017 but also to keep good quality water in streams recent publications confirmed the role of ppa widths in the conservation of water quality pissarra et al 2019 valera et al 2019 therefore the percentages of forest occupation indicated in the forest code were used as proxies to the vegetation cover limits depicted in column 5 of table 2 the boundaries of occurrence and detectability classes are listed in tables 3 and 4 respectively they apply to all pressures as regards occurrence the levels increased from 1 low risk to 3 high risk for increasing levels of pressure frequency namely isolated events irregular or seasonal patterns and regular to continuous pressure the thresholds of detectability were defined according to qualitative criteria comprising sensory evidences low risk availability or possibility to measure the pressure moderate risk and the need to use indirect approaches such as hydrologic inferences high risk 3 2 4 raw water security risk the estimation of raw water security risk was based on the fmea failure mode and effect analysis ben daya 2009 schneider and stamatis 1996 the method defines risk as product of occurrence detectability and severity originally the fmea attributed the same importance to all intervening variables and that was viewed as limitation fattahi and khalilzadeh 2018 leal et al 2006 liu et al 2017 in the present case the equal weights are also a restriction because the importance of pressure properties differ severity is by far the most important property because of its direct association with the pressure impacts occurrence is ranked as second most important property before detectability because occurrence is still related with the pressure while detectability is external inasmuch as it merely assesses the uncertainty involved in the pressure characterization the relative importance of s o d as defined in the present study is followed by many other studies using the fmea approach liu et al 2019 wang et al 2009 in order to overcome this drawback weights were defined for each property and included in the fmea equation for raw water security risk as follows 3 r ws s w s o w o d w d where r ws is the risk the terms s o and d describe severity occurrence and detectability respectively and the exponent terms ws wo and wd represent the corresponding weights considering the aforementioned relevance of each property the weights were set to w s 2 5 w o 0 75 and w d 0 25 the specific values were obtained through consensus of a team involving several members with distinctive sensibilities namely the first author the general director of minas gerais water institute the corresponding author an academic and two water institute technicians the number of s o d combinations is 27 the range of raw water security values is 1 r ws 46 8 in keeping with above mentioned weights table 5a for management purposes this interval was divided into security classes the number of classes and related labels were defined in keeping with criteria recommended by the organization for economic co operation and development oecd 2013b 1 acceptable 2 tolerable 3 unacceptable the tolerable risks do not require action besides monitoring of pressure properties the other risks call for mitigation measures that are proportional to the level of risk both in intensity and speed the limits of each class were defined on the basis of severity and occurrence the most important properties as follows a the unacceptable risks comprised the high impacts s 3 or the moderate impacts s 2 with high occurrence o 3 b the tolerable risks included the moderate s 2 to the low impacts s 1 with high occurrence o 3 c finally the acceptable risks were those with low severity s 1 and moderate or low occurrence o 2 or o 1 these criteria are summarized in table 5b considering the weights assigned to s o and d the boundaries of security risk r ws were calculated using eq 3 and are presented in the last column the rws grows continuously and exponentially for increasing s o d ranks with an exception in the transition from s o d 2 3 3 to s o d 3 1 1 this transition belongs to the unacceptable class and here the rws decreases from 17 0 to 15 6 the link of a risk measure to a risk class is not affected by this exception because it appears away from the tolerable unacceptable limit 3 2 5 sensitivity analysis the weights assigned to the risk factors assume that severity s is the key factor many applications based on the failure modes and effects model make the same assumption liu et al 2019 wang et al 2009 however for the sake of verifying the model response to changing the weights of s o and d two additional scenarios were tested 1 in the first scenario the weights of severity and occurrence were equated because the frequency of severe events is also paramount for assessing the risk 2 in the second scenario all risk parameters were equated this could be a base scenario when no a priori assumptions exist about the importance of each risk factor in all cases the sum of weights was equal to the original assessment now termed scenario 1 s1 s o d 3 5 2 5 0 75 0 25 so in the first additional scenario s2 the weights were s 1 5 o 1 5 d 0 5 and in the second additional scenario s3 the weights were s o d 1 17 besides testing the model response to changing the security property weights sensitivity analysis helped reducing the risk of misinterpretation and potential attribution of wrong weights kosovac and davidson 2020 4 results the raw water security risk model was applied to the portion of rio das velhas watershed located upstream of bela fama s abstraction point which covers an area of 1682 5 km2 and is characterized by low to very low water security indices fig 1 this public water source belongs to the rio das velhas system that supplies the belo horizonte metropolitan region namely the municipalities of itabirito nova lima ouro preto and rio acima with a total of 226 000 inhabitants a number of information sources were used to characterize the pressures and related impacts the sources were mostly public and included various organizations from the

severity is s 3 table 2 the q7 10 is plotted in fig 6 where the entire 2019 stream flow record is also represented the lowest discharge occurred in september q 7 9 m3 s the reason why the anomalous

compliance and hence a severity s 3 this condition was not occasional because the igam s records relative to the 2003 2019 period reveal 35 of very bad and 65 of bad compliances see fig 9 below the assessment of accidental contaminants was based on data from the feam the tailings dams distributed upstream from the bela fama s abstraction point and related to the mining of iron represented the

nunes et al 2011 to obtain the lulc classes the vegetative cover comprises 37 of forest fragments and 30 of arable land meaning that the area devoid of vegetation is 33 50 thus in keeping with the limits of table 2 the severity of pressure environmental conditions is s 1 4 2 characterization of occurrence the water resources plan for the rio das velhas basin https cbhvelhas org br plano diretor cbh velhas projected a continuous increase of raw water demand in the near future 2016 2036 period taken the ouro preto nova lima itabirito and rio acima municipalities altogether the increment was estimated in 0 11 m3 s the projections are mostly the reflex of a population growth projected by the brazilian institute for geography and statistics for the same period https www ibge gov br which was estimated in 27 1 the regularity of water demand increase characterizes this pressure as frequent meaning with high occurrence o 3 the frequency of droughts was interpreted from a long term stream flow record 48 years namely the largest series available for the bela fama s abstraction point 1972 2019 period the hydrograph is illustrated in fig 7 the average stream flow discharge was 28 5 m3 s the number of years with annual discharge below the average that we called dry years was 23 which means approximately 50 thus the frequency of droughts approached by the frequency of dry years was moderate with the occurrence set to o 2 the history of untreated domestic effluents discharged upstream the bela fama s abstraction point is documented in the national secretariat for sanitation archives http app4 mdr gov br seriehistorica the volumes were repeatedly large varying from a minimum of 25 of all produced effluents and a maximum of 63 in the 2007 2018 period the contamination of stream water by ordinary pollutants was therefore regular and for that reason characterized by the largest level of occurrence o 3 the history of accidents with consequences for the rio das velhas supply system was compiled from the feam s datasets the time window was set to 2010 2019 within this period there were 3 accidents with fixed sources tailings dams all producing impacts on water the accidents involving mobile sources road accidents were 54 but only one contaminated the stream water in view of this history the occurrence was graded as moderate o 2 the interpretation of landsat images using the maxver icm interated conditional modes method revealed areas devoid of vegetation that slightly decreased from 1999 to 2019 in the beginning of this period the non vegetated areas occupied 551 km2 and in the end 522 km2 the change was considered occasional and therefore infrequent o 1 4 3 characterization of detectability the water stress index relies on granted and reference stream flow discharges these values are objectively defined and easily quantified besides of being regularly used by water resource managers in daily activity therefore the water demand pressure is detectable continuously and sensibly being graduated with the minimum risk d 1 table 4 the ordinary and accidental contaminants were assessed from field data and for that reason graduated with a moderate detectability d 2 finally the pressures droughts and environmental conditions were interpreted from hydrologic models or satellite images and consequently assigned a reduced detectability d 3 in both cases 4 4 evaluation of raw water security risk the summary of s o and d ratings as assigned to the pressures and related impacts is provided in table 7 the before last column describes the risk measure rws calculated by eq 3 while the last column depicts the risk class based on the current assessment the water security risk of bela fama s abstraction point is unacceptable for water demand droughts and ordinary contaminants and acceptable for accidental contaminants and environmental conditions 4 5 results of sensitivity analysis the results of sensitivity analysis are illustrated in fig 8 the xx axis rank contains 27 entries that represent the number of s o and d combinations considering that these risk factors may all assume the values 1 2 or 3 table 5a the ranks are defined for increasing values of s then increasing values of o for the same s and finally increasing values of d for the same o and s the yy axis represents the risk of water security calculated by eq 3 the blue red and green lines describe the evolution of water security as function of rank the r ws is larger for the larger ranks because they correspond to combinations of larger s d and o values the differences between the lines are due to the weight changes the figure also depicts the ranks of stressors represented by the vertical dashed lines see values in table 7 and the thresholds that separate the acceptable tolerable and unacceptable risks based on the original assessment s1 see values in table 5b it is clear that regardless the scenario the risk associated to stressors droughts water demand and ordinary contaminants is unacceptable however the risks related with stressors environmental conditions and accidental contaminants may change as function of the changing weight the risks related with the environmental conditions are acceptable for s1 and s2 and move to the frontier between acceptable and tolerable for s3 the risks related with the accidental contaminants are acceptable for s1 and tolerable for s2 and s3 relative to s2 and s3 s1 is generally less risky for smaller ranks but becomes more risky for higher ranks 5 discussion 5 1 analysis of water security risk in the studied area the large security risk values estimated for the rio das velhas supply system reflect the poor water condition perceived for long time by the minas gerais authorities on water resources management environment and sanitation but application of our model allowed to quantify the perception a fundamental step to decide upon the type and intensity of mitigation measures the simultaneous tabulation of security risk values natural and anthropogenic pressures and pressure properties table 7 allowed a panoramic view over the risk levels dominating the study area as well the pressures requiring priority mitigation the outlook of urban water supply security from diversified standpoints has been realized in various recent studies babel et al 2020b krueger et al 2019a the assessment of water security risk using the failure modes and effects method highlighted the very high values of r ws obtained for ordinary contaminants rws 42 3 water demand 35 5 and droughts 34 5 in 2019 if the analysis were expanded to a larger period the results would reveal that this critical condition may have started several years before fig 9 describes the evolution of ice contamination index i af drought index and i ws demand index since 2003 or earlier the blue and green lines describe the i af 1981 2019 period and i ws 2000 2019 respectively whereas the vertical bars 2003 2019 portray the ice under very bad red and bad yellow water quality conditions a close inspection of fig 9 makes it evident the sharp decrease of i af from 2014 onwards before 2014 the drought risk was moderate but changed to high since then the decrease of i af was accompanied by a sharp increase of i ws before 2012 the values of this index represented a low water demand risk but afterwards the risk changed to moderate finally the number of years with very bad ice increased substantially in 2011 2019 44 relative to 2003 2010 12 5 taken altogether the 2014 2019 period represented a serious condition for water supply in belo horizonte fig 8 describes the year of 2019 as rather preoccupying because three pressure indicators represented unacceptable risks regardless the weighting scenario water demand i ws droughts i af and ordinary contaminants ice these results are valid for 2019 but should not be understood as universal for the region in this regard fig 9 anticipates more tolerable security risks in the metropolitan area of belo horizonte before 2011 because the severity of water demand was low and of droughts was low to moderate while after that these severities raised to moderate for iws and to high for iaf so the evaluation of water security risk in a region requires a dynamic weighting of security properties adapted to envisaged scenarios combined with the monitoring of pressure indicator changes over time in general for every pressure indicator the corresponding risk is always determined by the intersection of its rank line the vertical dashed lines represented in fig 8 and the selected weighting line the colored lines plotted in the same figure the rank line can be moved to the left or to the right depending on whether the indicator s rank is lower or higher at the time of evaluation respectively whereas the weighting line can be adapted to the valuation of pressure indicator importance at the same moment therefore fig 8 is a snapshot of water security risk assessed in 2019 which can be redrawn to represent any other past or future year through the plot of rank and weighting lines representing those moments the 2011 2019 period coincides a number of water shortages affecting several regions in brazil eventually the most important is the one caused by the unprecedented drought of 2014 2015 that preferably occurred in the southeast region e g são paulo and generated a severe water crisis with a high impact on water supply and hydropower generation empinotti et al 2019 millington 2018 the 2015 2016 drought mostly affecting the amazon region is also worth noting since was the severest and widespread in the last 100 years jiménez muñoz et al 2016 finally one might refer the multiyear drought of 2011 2017 generally affecting the northeast and viewed as the most extreme in decades cunha et al 2019 fig 9 can therefore be the view of our failure modes model over these documented drought and water crises namely of their reflexes on the studied area in the rio das velhas supply system the risk related to domestic contaminants derives from uncontrolled effluent discharges ineffective treatment of domestic effluents and incomplete sewage system coverage this is a long standing problem in the region with known consequences for surface water quality friese et al 2010 the situation is very preoccupying because the water security risk derived therefrom is severe and frequent table 7 unfortunately it is also a common place in many regions around the globe that has been mentioned in various articles and reviews on wastewater management and water security bradley and bartram 2013 hoekstra et al 2018 khan et al 2020 the risk of water demand was also classified as severe and forecasted to become worse in the future in response to a projection of population growth in the metropolitan region of belo horizonte this concern was reported for other regions in brazil such as paraíba do sul river basin paiva et al 2020 where the authors additionally addressed quality issues derived from urban sprawl such as industrialization and agricultural intensification 5 2 the choice of using failure modes to assess water security at catchment scale this study presented for the first time a raw water security risk model based on failure mode and effects analysis fmea the fmea is an approach that has been used in the water sector when the studies were carried out at the operational level of analysis i e at the water supply system scale the novelty of our study was to bring the method to a programme level of analysis i e at the catchment scale where it has barely been tested to our best knowledge some advantages of our method are noteworthy while other similar approaches at this scale evaluate security through isolated or combined assessments of pressure indicators damkjaer and taylor 2017 howlett and cuenca 2017 jensen and wu 2018 the present framework couples the pressures with variables important to risk management such as severity occurrence and detectability this achievement is significant in the next paragraphs a comprehensive survey of modeling approaches to water security is presented that makes evident the lack of a model framework that combines the objectivity of operational level methods failure modes with the holistic views of programme level methods based on the combined assessment of security indicators the reduced number of levels adopted to characterize the pressures properties and security risks is another gain small differences among risk conditions may not be detected this way but decision making is facilitated when based on fewer criteria this practical choice reflects the authors experience on water resources management especially the first author s who currently heads a team of experienced technicians at the minas gerais institute for water resources management igam the team experience was also beneficial to the choice of property weights eq 3 the team members composed of experienced managers academics and field technicians followed a delphi consensus approach commonly used in water policy and management studies chung et al 2014 de carvalho et al 2017 mayor et al 2016 taylor and ryder 2003 the method of failure modes and effects has been applied before to the water sector but not in the context of raw water security assessments at catchment scale as done in the present study for example the method was used to analyze the risk of drinking water processing in indonesia where the authors highlighted the incorrect treatment dosage and lack of pumping machine maintenance as prominent failure risks rimantho and hatta 2018 another example comes from the tucson regional water supply system usa where the method was used to examine the volumetric severity and likelihood of a component failure within a network that links sources to demand points aiming to assess redundancies and resilience within the system hwang et al 2015 diao and co workers proposed the so called global resilience analysis to test the resilience of four water distribution systems to three typical failure modes pipe failure excess demand and substance intrusion diao et al 2016 the water sector has approached water security risk from standpoints other than the failure modes and effects method in keeping with the purpose to attain at the predefined level of analysis e g operational programme or strategic at the programme level a reference for the present study the attention is primarily laid on techniques used to evaluate the risks posed by a similar hazard at a variety of locations or with the wide variety of risks existing within a watershed pollard et al 2004 the earliest and most simple programme level approaches included the coupling of geographic information systems gis with data on the water supply infrastructure and aimed to visually track utility assets and evaluate their risk factors booth and rogers 2001 more evolved approaches integrated spatially distributions of water availability quality demand among other security indicators in order to assess the risk of water supply systems d ambrosio et al 2020 zende et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 or reviewed the remote sensing applications for water security addressing the topics of quantity quality and extremes chawla et al 2020 studies at the strategic level of analysis could also be discussed here krueger et al 2019b siska and takara 2015 but they fall outside the scope of this work organizations have also proposed specific water security risk assessments at the programme level of analysis targeting the compliance of legal directives for example the dpsir framework developed by the european environmental agency eea in 1999 kristensen 2004 was proposed to identify relevant hazards within a hydrographic basin targeting the water framework directive directive 2000 60 ec of the european parliament and of the council the framework recognizes driving forces e g growth of population pressures discharges of effluents state amplified nutrient loads impacts lake eutrophication and policy response control of effluent discharge and was adopted to assess water security risk at catchment scale babel and shinde 2018 gari et al 2018 besides the dpsir the european environmental agency developed the pressure pathway receptor framework in 2000 to accommodate a plethora of potential catchment management issues eea 2000 including the compliance with the wfd by european member states this conceptual model was later used in various studies aiming the evaluation and ranking of potential pollution risks as well as the prioritization of risk management or mitigation procedures pacheco and sanches fernandes 2016 santos et al 2015 more recently water security at the programme level of analysis has been assessed through holistic approaches involving the selection of adequate security indicators for water quantity quality and extremes floods droughts that subsequently are processed in sophisticated algorithms to obtain a global security view over the system a few cases were presented in the introduction section but others can also be mentioned li et al 2019 for example a study in japan resorted to the system dynamics model borrowed from cybernetics to obtain an integrated assessment of water security systems in the country su et al 2019 another study used the problem and solution tree mapping to handle data from a multi stakeholder workshop involving members from the state and local governments researchers development agencies and the local community and achieve water security in rural indian himalayas sen and kansal 2019 a third study used the projection pursuit model an emerging mathematical method for turning high dimensional nonlinear problems into one dimensional ones combined with a particle swarm optimization technique to get an assessment of water security in central asia based on ecological water availability water demand and socioeconomic criteria wang et al 2020 in none of the formerly presented studies a combination of operational and programme level methods was tested to assess water security that was accomplished in the present study 5 3 an outlook on mitigation and adaption measures the index values depicted in fig 9 for the rio das velhas system represent unacceptable water quantity and quality risks and call for urgent mitigation and adaption measures a condition identical to this system was described elsewhere chang and zhu 2020 where the authors evaluated water security in four municipalities of china depending on the municipality the proposed mitigating actions included community adaption to droughts tianjin and beijing reduction of water use and regulation of wastewater and pollutant discharges shanghai improvement of sewage and drainage infrastructure and balancing the water intensity of economic activities chongqing a number of other studies addressed mitigation and adaption measures related to one or various water security indicators in cases where the risks of water demand were studied the working groups explored in detail some mitigation measures that included the resort to alternative sources xu et al 2020 climate change was also an issue in urban water security research related to demand jaramillo and nazemi 2018 while climate projections were used to assess the drought component of water security risk in numerous works babel et al 2020b kisakye and van der bruggen 2018 stewart et al 2020 verbist et al 2020 several adaption measures were proposed in those recent studies that could be transposed to the rio das velhas supply system such as pricing incentives and regulatory measures to encourage permanent urban water conservation revision of the water rights system investment in water recycling investment in rainwater infrastructure that enables regular aquifer recharge and surplus storage during normal and wet seasons the water security plan for mitigation measures must be able to prioritize preventive adaptive and contingent actions some examples of preventive and adaptive procedures were indicated in the previous paragraphs the rio das velhas supply system serves the eastern part of belo horizonte metropolitan region with a nominal capacity close to 48 7 2 m3 s the system is complemented for the reminder 52 with raw water from the paropeba river basin which supplies the western part with 7 8 m3 s stored in three reservoirs the two sub systems are integrated but the current adaptation to water demand variations in the region can only occur through water transferences from the rio das velhas to the paraopeba system not vice versa besides there are no alternative abstraction points in the rio das velhas basin to prevent the system from contingent demands the urban water supply is therefore vulnerable and periodically under great stress monitoring contributes significantly to implement adequate mitigation measures from the standpoint of water security risk the monitoring system should be adapted to cover the most risky pressures in the hydrographic basin in the rio das velhas the spatial density of monitoring stations should be adjusted to allow more precise descriptions of actual and reference flows as well as stream water quality technology should also be adapted to allow automatic transmission of data especially where contingent pressures are likely to occur taken altogether these actions would help to characterize detectability and reduce the associated risks in turn the improved detectability would contribute to early recognition of pattern changes and hence to a better characterization of occurrence overall a monitoring network makes it possible to forecast and evaluate the efficacy of mitigating actions whenever they are necessary 6 conclusions the general purpose of this study was accomplished because the proposed water security risk model was developed and effectively applied to the supply system of a large urban area namely the metropolitan region of belo horizonte the method uses failure modes to quantify water security risk based on pressure indicators and risk variables the pressure indicators comprised water demand droughts ordinary and accidental contaminants and changes to forest cover the risk variables pressure properties were severity occurrence and detectability the combined use of pressure indicators and risk variables allowed to frame the current 2019 water security risk in the scope of historical or forecasted pressure changes besides security risk scores could be calibrated in regard to measurement reliability severity was the risk variable used to define the current status of pressures while occurrence framed them as function of past or future variation finally detectability measured reliability the calculation of water security risk as weighted product of severity occurrence and detectability failure mode model brought the three risk components into a single index this is new the evaluation of water security in the metropolitan region of belo horizonte namely in the rio das velhas supply system exposed high severity and frequency risks in regard to water demand droughts and ordinary contaminants the results were not surprising because they reflected the water resource managers perception the trigger of water demand risk was excessive water use thought to aggravate in the near future the drought risk was explained by current stream flow drops below the reference flow q7 10 which the minimum stream flow in 7 consecutive days with a 10 year return period coupled with a history of dry years finally the contaminant risk was justified by the long standing stream water contamination caused by domestic effluent loads overall the results provided the necessary insights to plan prioritize and implement adequate mitigation measures for raw water improvement broad conclusions on the water security of rio das velhas water supply system as whole would require a part 2 assessment fig 4 that is forecasted for a companion paper credit

4917,effects of forest treatments on watershed hydrology in terms of water yield and runoff processes is a primary concern this paper evaluates the effects of long term land cover change on hydrological processes in the mica creek experimental watershed mcew in northern idaho usa in the mcew effects of clearcut and partial cut harvest practices on streamflow were monitored and evaluated from 1991 to 2013 firstly snowpack dynamics in terms of snowmelt timing and average melt rate under different elevations aspects land covers and climate conditions were analyzed at the point scale with the snow accumulation and melt sam model from the perspective of the energy balance then the grid based soil moisture routing smr hydrology model was used to provide temporal and spatial hydrological changes in the mcew we assigned locations as hydrologically sensitive areas hsas based on the probability of runoff generation p ai hs to capture potential downstream environmental effects of actual land cover change and optimal harvest patterns the results highlight the strong impacts timber harvest can have on increasing streamflow and in particular peak flow on average the daily averaged degree of saturation increased by 20 after timber harvest resulting in higher risks of flooding from large rainfall events three logging scenarios including logging in areas with low p ai hs high p ai hs and in the entire watershed area showed that logging areas had a positive relationship with water yield and that more extreme peak flow was likely to occur after clearcutting in high p ai hs areas high elevation under rainfall driven events or logging in low p ai hs areas medium elevation during snowmelt dominated events clearcutting on south facing slopes at medium elevation strongly increased the average melt rate leading to potential flooding if a snowpack was present and temperatures increased scenario analysis suggests that partial cutting in areas with low p ai hs would reduce peak flow amount by as much as 40 however for watersheds to be logged entirely choosing proper harvest locations such as clearcutting in high p ai hs areas having large snow events may effectively reduce extreme peak flow from spring snowmelt our findings inform forest management decisions favoring partial cutting over clearcutting and how to avoid concentrating harvest practices in hsas by adapting spatial distribution and timing of harvesting to climate conditions to minimize impacts on the water cycle keywords soil moisture routing model snow accumulation and melt process spatial hydrologic patterns harvest scenarios peak flow 1 introduction timber harvest has been shown to have a great impact on watershed hydrology and ecology including water quantity hoover 1944 hornbeck et al 1997 water quality campbell and doeg 1989 gravelle and link 2007 boggs et al 2016 and peak flow responses beschta et al 2000 jones 2000 guillemette et al 2005 schnorbus and alila 2013

change the frequency and magnitude of flooding bradshaw et al 2007 alila et al 2009 and summer flow responses perry and jones 2017 gronsdahl et al 2019 coble et al 2020 these effects are especially strong in mediterranean climates where the asynchronous seasonal precipitation and radiative energy fluxes usually result in extreme dryness during the hot summers wondzell and king 2003 thus understanding the interaction between timber harvest and flow regimes with climatic variability is important to maintain the sustainability of water resources the ecological environment and forest health the origin of the ideas considering the interactions between forests and watersheds through observations can be traced back to the first century ad andréassian 2004 the paired watershed study bates and henry 1928 bosch and hewlett 1982 stednick 1996 is the earliest method designed to evaluate the disturbance of harvest practices on streamflow considering climate conditions snow dominated or rainfall dominated geography elevation and plant type increases in water yield after timber harvest have been documented across a wide variety of the forest watershed experiments usually attributing increases in water yield to reduced evapotranspiration after logging hubbart et al 2007 in general increases in annual water yield range widely from 8 to 80 within the first ten years after post harvest bosch and hewlett 1982 reported an average increase of 40 mm water yield for every 10 reduction in canopy cover for a pine forest the concerns for increased peak flow are practical as a single storm of significance can lead to the majority of erosion within a year blackburn et al 1986 squires et al 2017 karwan et al 2007 found that individual peaks of total suspended solids tend to occur with storm events the effect of timber harvest on low flow and peak flow after timber harvest are highly variable lin and wei 2008 and weakly related to the percentage of cut area in a number of paired watershed studies dan moore et al 2005 impacts of timber harvest on snowmelt rates can lead to a significant increase in the frequency of floods due to the shifting from longwave dominated snowmelt to shortwave dominated snowmelt green and alila 2012 troendle and king 1985 found that removal of approximately 40 of the forest resulted in not only an increase of annual water yield but also an increase in peak flow and flood volume due to reduced interception losses from snow beschta et al 2000 found that the 1 year recurrence interval peak flow generally increased about 13 16 and the 5 year recurrence by 6 9 peak flow may result in increased sediment transport swanson 1982 although in most forests soil erosion is typically small compared to channel erosion hartanto et al 2003 bruijnzeel 2004 models are useful for evaluating land use and land cover change in forested watersheds when physical processes are included to assess timber harvest effects hewlett et al 1969 vertessy et al 1993 srivastava et al 2017 with the development of hydrological models researchers started to embed land cover change modules like timber harvest to get more realistic simulations huff et al 1999 matheussen et al 2000 srivastava et al 2018 the regional hydroecological simulation system rhessys model band et al 1993 integrated with topmodel beven and kirkby 1979 and forest bgc running and coughlan 1988 was used to calculate nitrogen carbon and water balances and to simulate forest canopy evapotranspiration the parameterization in aggregated hillslope units in the rhessys model can ignore important processes such as the variation of soil water content within a hillslope tian et al 2014 developed drainmod forest based on forest watershed management model drainmod mccarthy et al 1992 by improving more detailed hydrological process simulation and adding ecosystem components to address the interactions of hydrological biogeochemical and physiological processes in lowland forest ecosystems to capture snowfall interception and the unloading process from the branch to canopy scale an empirically based snowfall interception model was developed by hedstrom and pomeroy 1998 but the model did not include melt processes storck et al 1998 used the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model dhsvm wigmosta et al 1994 to evaluate impacts of logging activities on rain on snow floods and found snowpack and melt rate were more sensitive to timber harvest at higher elevation however soil and vegetation parameters in the dhsvm needed to be refined with calibration to yield reasonable results waichler et al 2005 du et al 2014 the snow accumulation and melt sam model brooks and boll 2005 a single layer snow pack model based on mass and energy balances was developed as a convenient tool to analyze energy dynamics at the watershed scale however the sam model did not include canopy cover dynamics for evaluation of timber harvest land cover change the choice of harvest locations needs careful consideration when some locations can lead to high potential to generate runoff under similar climate conditions lyon et al 2006 hydrologically sensitive areas hsas defined as areas which have a high probability of generating runoff and potentially become a polluting source area for receiving water bodies walter et al 2000 highly influence the magnitude of peak flow in a landscape in forest systems these areas may trigger landslides and erosion in response to disturbances in the watershed gorsevski et al 2006 hsas are highly responsive to geographic features and climate conditions agnew et al 2006 studied the correlation of hsas with topographic index and distance from a stream showing a more regionally reliable correlation with the former walter et al 2000 evaluated the changes in saturated areas at a short temporal scale and showed that saturated areas changed seasonally based on climate conditions to our knowledge the effect of land cover change on the distribution and timing of hsas within a forested landscape has not been widely evaluated understanding the effect of management on the spatial and temporal variability of hsas is important as it directly affects watershed hydrology and the corresponding environmental and ecological health within a watershed some of the more specific forest management questions related to the spatial variability in hsas include what is the impact of timber harvest location within a snow dominated watershed on snowpack dynamics and how do topography and climate affect the optimal forest management strategy to protect the watershed from unexpected hydrologic responses such as floods the concept of hsas has not yet been applied to forest harvest management specifically in the interaction between spatial timber harvest strategies and streamflow magnitudes and timing in this paper therefore our overall goal is to evaluate the impact of timber harvest strategies on runoff generation in a forested watershed specific objectives are to 1 analyze the historical hydrological responses water yield flow frequencies to timber harvest regimes clearcutting partial cutting and control in a paired watershed design 2 understand the impact of different treatments with various topographies elevation and aspect on point scale snowpack dynamics as one of the main drivers for hydrologic patterns 3 analyze the temporal and spatial variability in hsas within a forested ecosystem based on a long term dataset and 4 evaluate the impacts of harvest location on the hsas probability and overall hydrologic response 2 methods 2 1 study area and data collection the study watershed is the 28 km2 mica creek experimental watershed mcew in northern idaho mica creek is a tributary of the st joe river which flows into coeur d alene lake the elevation of the mcew ranges from 975 m to 1725 m with slopes ranging from 0 to 39 annual precipitation is approximately 1400 mm with the majority occurring from november to may more than half of annual precipitation falls as snow during winter and spring the lower elevation in the study area experiences more rain on snow events du et al 2016 instantaneous observed air temperature generally ranges from 30 c in the summer to 20 c in the winter average annual air temperature is about 5 c peak streamflow occurs mostly during mid winter or april and may primarily due to a great amount of snowmelt rain rain on snow and rain on spring snowmelt events macdonald and hoffman 1995 more than 90 of the watershed is overlain by ash capped silt loam soils on gravelly sandy loam in the deeper soil layer before reaching bedrock bedrock was detected within 1 5 m of the soil surface in small areas in the mid western and northeastern part of the watershed soil survey staff 2019 vegetation consists of 70 to 80 year old mixed conifer stands after extensive logging and burning activities in the early 1930 s the mcew is a paired and nested watershed design with seven subwatersheds referred to as sw1 to sw7 to allow for the analysis of the cumulative effects of timber harvest as well as traditional comparison of treatment versus control on long term hydrologic patterns watson et al 2001 fig 1 a watershed measurements were initiated in 1990 initial road building occurred in 1997 and experimental timber harvest in 2001 with all canopy cover being removed clearcutting from 50 of the area in sw1 and half of the canopy cover being removed partial cutting from 50 of the area in sw2 no canopy cover was removed in sw3 control sw4 evaluates the cumulative effects of sw1 to sw3 while sw5 and sw6 serves as the control for sw4 and sw7 respectively sw7 is directly downstream of sw1 to sw4 no further treatments were implemented for six years until 2007 after 2007 timber harvest including several organized logging events in sw4 to sw7 occurred every year except during 2008 fig 1b see table a 1 in supplementary material for detailed areal percentage of timber harvest few roads existed in the northwest upper drainage of the watershed prior to 1990 most roads were simple unpaved roads for access to logging areas and transportation gravel road construction in 1997 included new roads and improvement of old roads rackley and chung 2008 measurements in the mcew include precipitation air temperature discharge and sediment concentration streamflow via stage height was automatically recorded every 30 min by parshall flumes installed at the outlet of each subwatershed fig 1a starting in 1991 the monitoring period used in this study spans from october 1st 1991 until september 30th 2013 equivalent to water year wy 1992 2013 the mcew has one snotel site located at 1375 m elevation in the southern part of sw5 which was installed in october 1990 the snotel station maintained by the usda natural resources conservation service nrcs provides observed daily and hourly precipitation air temperature and snow water equivalent swe the instantaneous sensor provides a single observation on the hour from which we used the temperature at 6 am 12 pm 6 pm and 12 am to construct a 6 hour loop for snowmelt calculations the meteorological site named ridgesnow located at 1424 m elevation on the southwestern edge of sw1 tracked wind speed relative humidity and longwave and shortwave radiation potential evapotranspiration was calculated using the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 for the modeling precipitation and temperature were distributed with elevation using a fixed precipitation lapse rate 81 36 cm km 1 and a temperature lapse rate 5 31 c km 1 respectively based on differences recorded at the st maries coop station 655 6 m 47 3165 116 5789 and the mica creek snotel station 1374 6 m 47 1505 116 265 rain and snow partitioning from precipitation was determined through calibration with snotel swe using a minimum temperature of 0 76 c below which all precipitation was snow and a maximum temperature of 3 10 c above which all precipitation was rain between these two temperature thresholds the ratio of rain and precipitation increased linearly with increasing temperature 2 2 long term data analysis the mcew implemented land use activities at certain locations based on the before after control impact baci design in three treatment phases 1 no activity wy 1992 1997 for assessments of streamflow relationships between paired subwatersheds as controls for climate and geography 2 road construction wy 1998 2001 which removed less than 2 canopy and was considered as having subtle hydrological effects and 3 road and logging combined wy 2002 2013 the before and after activity phases provide the comparison of effects of timber harvest and road construction for the entire watershed the time series of streamflow for a logged watershed shows how hydrologic patterns react to land cover change while the paired watershed design corrects for climate and topographic factors see fig 1 the 30 min streamflow data were averaged to daily data for analysis average annual water yield was calculated to plot the hydrograph of paired sw1 sw2 and sw3 we evaluated the patterns of continuous influence caused by one time logging activities in 2001 until the next logging activity in sw2 in 2009 the forest regrowth impact within in these eight years was assumed minimal according to time lapse maps from google earth engine differences of observed streamflow at sw1 and sw2 relative to sw3 were calculated to capture effects from clearcut and partial cut in order to evaluate the impact of harvest on streamflow distributions we ranked observed daily streamflow within each wy from control watershed sw4 in descending order as well as assigning them to an estimation of a cumulative distribution function as their exceedance probability vogel and fennessey 1994 1 c u m u l a t i v e d i s t r i b u t i o n p q q m n 1 100 where m 1 2 3 n is the ranked number of the daily streamflow in descending order n is the total number of days in a water year for streamflow data p q q represents the probability of each streamflow rate q being exceeded the dates corresponding to the exceedance probability of 1 high 50 medium and 90 low for streamflow at sw4 in each wy were used to select the daily streamflow in sw1 sw2 and sw3 as high flow medium flow and low flow respectively we used the relative difference with sw3 to evaluate how clearcut and partial cut affected each frequency of streamflow in sw1 and sw2 before and after timber harvest in 2001 2 3 soil moisture routing model and performance criteria the hydrological model applied in the mcew is a modified version of the gis based soil moisture routing smr model boll et al 1998 frankenberger et al 1999 brooks 2003 brooks et al 2007 yourek et al 2019 by adding canopy dynamics in snowmelt and accumulation algorithms for spatial and temporal evaluation of land cover change the main modifications include road and timber harvest effects and use of a two layer soil system as a distributed hydrologic model the smr model is based on a mass balance and can output various distributed hydrologic variables besides streamflow such as soil water storage swe and actual evapotranspiration see brooks et al 2007 yourek et al 2019 most of the geographic information was publicly available and all gis maps such as elevation and soil properties were available at a 30 m spatial resolution this quasi steady state model operates on a daily time step with the exception of subsurface lateral flow which operates on a 6 h time step to capture rapid changes in water storage on steep slopes boll et al 2015 the smr model performance is evaluated from three perspectives 1 capability of capturing the effect of timber harvest 2 daily streamflow hydrograph for periods without disturbance wy 1994 1996 and with disturbances wy 2011 2013 and 3 statistical performance criteria for each wy 2 4 land cover effects logging maps were updated at the beginning of every wy on october 1 to incorporate new harvest information on clearcut and partial cut fig 1b for each annual land cover map values of key parameters describing soil properties canopy interception snowmelt and evapotranspiration were adjusted accordingly see tables a 2 and a 3 for parameter values canopy interception assumed a maximum storage amount subjected to potential evaporation once the maximum storage amount was reached additional precipitation became throughfall changes in soil properties due to land cover change affected the effective values for parameters on a grid cell which was mainly reduced root zone depth reduced canopy cover in a grid cell led to lower canopy storage and effective crop coefficients and thus greater throughfall and lower evapotranspiration for road areas soil depth was decreased to 2 cm to simulate an impermeable surface with 0 1 cm initial abstraction runoff from roads was exported out of the watershed within a day without reinfiltration down gradient lateral flow from cut slopes to road ditches was assumed to be small and was not specifically addressed in the model 2 5 snow accumulation and melt the snow accumulation and melt sam model brooks and boll 2005 which was embedded in the smr model by brooks et al 2007 and yourek et al 2019 was used to calculate snowmelt based on a mass and energy balance see supplementary material b to compare with point measurement data from hubbart et al 2015 swe at various locations was calculated using the modified version of the sam model which accounted for impacts of a forest canopy on mass and energy exchange snowfall interception was estimated based on dynamic canopy storage where all vegetation has a maximum canopy water storage depth evaporation from snow and rainfall intercepted by the canopy was calculated at a constant rate on a rainy day or the potential evaporation on a dry day sublimation and condensation on the canopy were simulated based on latent heat exchange snow not intercepted by the canopy fell to the ground and was added to the existing snowpack to test canopy effects on swe shortwave radiation and longwave radiation were adjusted eqs 2 and 3 proportional to the percent canopy cover referred to as cc in the modified sam model cc 0 for clearcut 50 for partial cut and 100 for control we assumed the shortwave radiation is diffuse radiation and the effects of non uniform canopy structure on scattering and attenuating the incoming radiation incident to the surface hardy et al 2004 was not considered in radiative transmission calculations 2 q sw 1 c c q sw a t m 3 q lw 1 c c q lw a t m c c q lw c a n o p y q lw s n o w where q sw and q lw are the shortwave and longwave radiation

6 soil water dynamics the smr model used soil depth data from du et al 2016 who used slope drainage area and elevation based on in situ measurements the soil was the bouldercreek series soil survey staff 2019 srivastava et al 2020 having a near surface a horizon extending 0 38 m to 0 82 m below the soil surface and deeper b horizon extending 0 89 to 1 92 m below the soil surface each characterized as ash capped silt loam and gravelly sandy loam respectively distribution of water input to soil layers supplemented layer b after layer a reached field capacity the soil profile then wetted up from the base of layer b up to layer a shallow subsurface lateral flow from each cell was calculated with darcy s law as the product of the hydraulic gradient equal to the land slope and an effective hydraulic conductivity k eff brooks et al 2007 below field capacity k eff increased exponentially with soil moisture content between field capacity and saturation k eff increased linearly from k fc at field capacity to the k s value of 70 c m d a y 1 soil survey staff 2019 considering the macro pores in the soil when the soil reached saturation the k eff was 10 k s brooks et al 2004 2 7 model performance the correlation of annual water yield for paired sw1 clearcut sw3 control sw2 partial cut sw3 control and sw6 sw7 were analyzed to assess the ability of the model to capture the response of water yield under three treatment phases between wy 1992 to wy 2013 the third phase was modified to wy 2002 2007 for the comparison of sw6 and sw7 because the logging events in the controlled sw6 began in wy 2008 daily streamflow between observed data and simulated outputs for sw4 was shown for periods without timber harvest wy 1994 1996 and with timber harvest wy 2011 2013 since sw4 is the approximate converging point for sw1 sw2 and sw3 which consists of all the features from three contributing subwatersheds statistical evaluation of the smr model performance is based on three criteria 1 percent bias pbias which measures the average positive or negative tendency of simulated values to the observed values 2 root mean square error rmse which shows the magnitude of difference from the simulated values to the observed data 3 kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 which is an alternative criterion that decreases systematic errors associated with nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 where nse is highly sensitive to peak flows kge evaluates model performance in a multi objective way including correlations bias error and deviations between observed and simulated values percentile plots were used to sort distributions of the statistical criteria over each wy for each subwatershed during wy 1993 2013 wy 1992 was excluded as a warm up year for the simulation 4 pbias i 1 n q sim i q obs i i 1 n q obs i 100 5 rmse i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 n 1 6 kge 1 s r r 1 2 s α α 1 2 s β β 1 2 where q obs and q sim are the observed and simulated values respectively n is the number of data points within the wy s r s α and s β are scaling factors to indicate the emphasis of each component which are set to 1 r is the linear correlation coefficient α is the ratio between the standard deviation of simulated values σ s and observed values σ o as in σ s σ o and β is the difference between means of simulated and observed normalized by the standard deviation of the observed values as in μ s μ o σ o 2 8 point scale snow water equivalent analysis the simulated swe under three treatment types clearcut partial cut and control from 10 01 2005 to 05 31 2006 was compared to in situ sonic snow depth measurements located in sw1 sw4 hubbart et al 2015 an average swe for each forest treatment type from two measurements on various slopes and aspects were digitized from hubbart et al 2015 for this point scale analysis the modified sam model was calibrated with temperature thresholds for precipitation partitioning see table b 2 upon good agreement between simulated swe by the sam model and observed data fig 2 the impact of forest cover change on the amount and timing of swe under different topographic characteristics elevation and aspect was analyzed to develop a more robust understanding of harvest effects on hsas relative to canopy effects on swe slope effects were much less apparent so these are not included in this paper the impacts of elevation and aspect on simulated swe within each of the three land cover types were assessed at elevations ranging from 1300 m to 1440 m at a 10 m increment and aspects of 0 north facing 90 east facing and 180 south facing for each elevation level elevations were categorized into low 1300 1340 m medium 1350 1390 m and high 1400 1440 m effects of timber harvest focused on peak swe swe duration of snow ablation dsm and average melt rate m average seasonal melt rate is defined as the ratio of swe over dsm which is the length from the first day of snowmelt after peak swe ablation start date to the end of ablation 7 m swe d s m the effect of aspect was assessed using the simulated timing of full snowpack ablation aspects ranging from 0 to 180 at 30 increments were evaluated for three representative elevations at 1299 m 1365 m and 1424 m and the three treatment types west facing aspect 180 360 results were symmetrical to the east facing 0 180 in this point scale analysis so only east facing results are included the peak swe date of peak swe ablation start date ablation end date and duration of ablation were calculated to assess the impact of aspect on snowmelt timing associated with treatment types the difference of m between clearcut and control treatments referred to as δ m was calculated to illustrate the impact of aspect on the sensitivity of melt rate in response to timber harvest hydrologically sensitive areas at spatial scale 2 9 definition of hydrologically sensitive areas the probability for any area to be hydrologically sensitive hs walter et al 2000 was calculated based on the relative number of days the area was saturated in a wy expressed as follows 8 p a i h s j n d a y sat j j n d a y j where p ai hs is the probability that area ai was saturated i e hydrologically sensitive daysat j is a day when ai was saturated on the jth day of the year with j as day of year thus the greater the probability of being hs the greater likelihood the area generates runoff the probability that a specific grid cell generated runoff i e p ai hs was compared for three typical dry 1993 medium 1999 and wet 1997 wys with a probability of exceedance for annual precipitation at 62 5 37 5 and 4 2 respectively which was based on the cumulative frequencies calculated from ranking annual precipitation in descending order over the available 23 year climate record these three wys occurred in the pre disturbance phase in the mcew in addition degree of saturation maps as the percentage of daily soil water amount over the saturated soil water amount were used for four representative days during storm events to illustrate spatial distribution of saturated areas for no land cover change road construction only timber harvest and road and timber harvest 2 10 impact of land cover change we used the initial simulation from wy 1992 2001 as a proxy for subsequent development of management plans depending on the evaluation of impacts of harvest scenarios on water yield and peak flow in wy 2002 2013 based on the changing patterns of p ai hs for all grid cells for wy 1992 2001 we created three harvest scenarios in sw1 clearcut and sw2 partial cut harvest scenario 1 fig 3 a considered logging in areas with low p ai hs harvest scenario 2 fig 3b included logging in areas of high p ai hs the harvested area in the same sw between scenario 1 and 2 remained the same where the logged area for both scenarios was 47 of sw1 and 38 of sw2 in harvest scenario 3 fig 3c the entire sw1 and sw2 areas were subjected to logging clearcut and partial cut respectively logging the entire subwatershed was designed as an extreme case for the purpose of scientific analysis which was not subject to current management practice regimes while riparian buffers are required along fishing bearing stream reaches in the mcew the designed scenarios did not consider such buffers for the post harvest treatment phase from wy 2002 2013 we evaluated the sensitivity of peak flows to timber harvest under snowmelt and rainfall dominated storm events for each harvest scenario we picked the maximum peak flow p f max event within each wy the relative differences of maximum peak flows between two scenarios i and j referred to as p f max i p f max j p f max j were calculated for two cases 1 i is harvest scenario 2 logging in high p ai hs areas and j is harvest scenario 1 logging in low p ai hs areas and 2 i is harvest scenario 3 logging the entire subwatershed and j is harvest scenario 2 the correlation between scenario 1 and 2 for a streamflow events and b snowmelt events were analyzed to show the impact of harvest location on hydrological patterns under snowmelt and rainfall dominated environments 3 results and discussion 3 1 observed annual streamflow timber harvest effects on streamflow were greater for clearcut than for partial cut areas after road building occurred in 1997 and timber harvest occurred in 2001 the absolute difference of annual water yield in sw1 and sw2 over the control watershed sw3 immediately increased about 295 mm and 125 mm in wy 2002 respectively the relative increase in annual water yield in sw1 and sw2 was as high as 85 and 45 respectively during the wy 2003 fig 4 clearcutting effects were very noticeable for a period of five years with diminished effects lasting almost ten years later until 2011 when new logging events occurred in sw1 the partial cutting effect was approximately half that of the clearcutting effect and the effect after 2009 increased due to a new harvest events in that year the decline in the relative difference for sw1 is likely due to vegetative regrowth or more broadly system recovery after disturbances and several years with large annual water yield causing sw3 streamflow to be larger compared to relative increases sw1 sw3 or sw2 sw3 the effect of regrowth was distinguishable by comparing the absolute difference between wy 2006 and wy 2010 where both wys had similar magnitudes of annual water yield in sw3 yet decreased clearcut responses absolute difference in water yield in sw1 indicating the disturbed sw1 system was recovering from clearcutting 3 2 high medium and low streamflow distributions differences of daily observed streamflow for the 1 high 50 medium and 90 low flows at sw1 and sw2 relative to sw3 showed strong temporal variations between wy 1992 2013 fig 5 comparing the relative differences for pre and post harvest high flow was the most sensitive to timber harvest in 2001 increasing from less than 20 on average during pre harvest to as high as 121 for sw1 and 43 for sw2 seven years after 2001 fig 5a medium flows did not show a distinct response before and after timber harvest fig 5b though the annual discharge at medium flows in sw1 and sw2 was mostly greater than in sw3 the relative difference of low flow showed a decreasing trend after 2001 indicating a decreasing trend of baseflow with diminishing effects of harvest fig 5c the high sensitivity of peak flow suggests a high flooding potential and an increased risk of sediment transport following clearcutting 3 3 model results simulated annual water yield increases after timber harvest compared well to the observed data achieved with the smr model with only minor trial and error calibration see table a 2 in supplementary material relative to the 1 1 line the smr model captured the effects on water yield for each treatment phase except for road building in sw1 and sw2 fig 6 roads were less well represented due to the assumption of them as impermeable surfaces in the model although in the mcew they were unpaved and outsloped with an ability to reinfiltrate some runoff roads increase peak flow generation especially for large peak flow events bowling 2002 cuo et al 2006 the assumption of impermeable roads in the smr might have overestimated road effects on peak flows while representation of outsloped roads in the model would have increased the soil moisture content of adjacent areas leading to more runoff generation for most water years after wy 2002 simulated water yield appeared slightly higher for sw1 and sw3 and lower for sw2 compared to observed data observed and simulated data do not deviate much from the 1 1 line in sw6 and sw7 indicating that the effect of forest treatments may be smaller at the larger scale simulated and observed streamflow agreed well in general especially in the post harvest treatment phase fig 7 the simulated low flows slightly exceeded observations during low flow seasons the model did not consider riparian buffers along fish bearing reaches as required in the mcew that may lead to a range of low flow responses retention of riparian buffers together with harvest activities could keep low flow from increasing coble et al 2020 some peak flows were over predicted mainly in the pre harvest treatment phase forest that may be due to over estimated snowmelt at large melt events as a result of inadequate canopy cover accuracy or overestimated storm events due to the assumption of stable distribution of rainfall over the watershed also the simulated streamflow was lower than the observations during early snowmelt season in some cases where simulated peak flow was over estimated later in the season e g wy 1996 this could result from the under estimated snowmelt in the early winter the canopy induced wind speed reduction in the smr model led to slower and longer snowmelt processes in the forest interior in addition the underestimated canopy cover impact on shortwave and longwave radiation can lead to a higher net energy to the snowpack ellis et al 2011 we note that swe estimates in smr were sensitive to the temperature thresholds for precipitation partitioning into rain and snow the point scale analysis below provides more details on the energy dynamics under canopy cover statistical performance criteria confirmed the validity of smr model simulations for all watersheds during the study period in fig 8 the pbias of streamflow simulation for all wys was mostly within 20 for all subwatersheds except that sw3 experienced a few over biased simulations in the second row of rmse for example the 50 percentile value for sw4 indicates that 50 of the wys had a rmse below 1 3 mm wy the majority of rmse points are in the range between 1 0 and 2 0 mm wy a few water years had rmse exceeding 3 0 mm in sw1 to sw4 from the distribution of the rmse values the larger watersheds sw5 sw7 had lower overall rmse values compared to smaller watersheds sw1 sw4 more than 80 of kge values are within 0 5 0 9 except for sw2 and sw3 having around 50 of kge values in that range the kge is positively correlated with annual water yield indicating that the model simulation was better in wetter wys the smr model performed less well under dry conditions likely because components such as deep percolation and baseflow increase their weight in the water balance these were represented by highly simplified processes with the assumption of homogeneity of soil properties such as hydraulic conductivity see table a 2 in supplementary material 3 4 point scale snowpack dynamics the internal energy deficit cold content of a snowpack needs to be satisfied by incoming energy before snowmelt starts and it is linearly dependent on snow temperature swe and the snow s water holding capacity jennings et al 2018 a deeper and colder snowpack has a higher energy deficit so that it takes more energy before liquid water begins to drain out of the bottom of the snowpack additional energy added to the snowpack triggers the melting process as well as changes internal energy deficit which controls the timing and rate of snowmelt the energy deficit and the net energy absorbed by the snowpack change with factors related to elevation aspect slope land cover and climate leading to a complex dynamic system across spatial and temporal scales cline 1997 debeer and pomeroy 2017 we first describe the impact of all those factors on snow accumulation and melt sam processes at the point scale assisted by both observations and simulations second we evaluate the more complicated spatial scale and the effect of timber harvest management in the mcew watershed we focus on snowpack dynamics in terms of peak swe dsm and m 3 5 influence of elevation aspect and canopy on energy dynamics elevation and aspect affected the energy deficit of the snowpack and the incoming energy intensity as follows 1 higher elevation increases the energy deficit because precipitation increases with elevation and the fraction of snow versus rainfall increases with decreasing temperature melloh et al 2008 from 1300 m to 1440 m in the mcew precipitation increased about 250 mm and the snow versus rainfall ratio increased from 0 94 to 1 62 according to spatial precipitation calculated based on point observations precipitation lapse rate and temperature thresholds for snowfall and rainfall the peak swe at high elevation 1400 1440 m was up to twice as much as swe at low elevation 1300 1340 m as a result of significant precipitation and temperature variation with elevation fig 10a incident solar irradiance varies with elevation where snowmelt starts earlier at lower elevation musselman et al 2012 2 aspect affects the amount of solar radiation to the surface with respect to solar incidence angle the impact of aspect on longwave radiation emitted from atmosphere was negligible during snow melting snow on south facing slopes received from 30 to 90 more solar radiation on a daily basis than snow on north facing slopes based on the simulation the presence of canopy dramatically changes the fractions of energy components in the total net energy forest shading created a more stable microclimate with less temperature fluctuation but lowered average daytime air temperature carlson 1997 primarily due to canopy blocking of shortwave and longwave radiation from to the atmosphere as shown in fig 9 sensible heat and latent heat in the areas with full canopy cover remained around zero because the canopy greatly reduced wind effects and thus convective heat transfer shortwave radiation decreased by about half from clearcut to partial cut and more than 70 from partial cut to control the absolute value of net longwave radiation negative value denotes outgoing direction decreased with more canopy cover indicating that forest cover also emitted considerable amounts of energy however the net energy contributed to snowmelt was the highest in the clearcut areas as solar radiation was the dominant energy flux during the snowmelt season whereas it was lowest in the control forest because the enhancement of longwave radiation from canopy emission did not offset the loss of shortwave radiation canopy interception decreased the energy deficit of the snowpack due to declines in the peak swe the mean peak swe for control and partial cut was about 31 and 56 of the peak swe in the clearcut respectively see fig 2 assuming a canopy storage capacity of 3 mm link et al 2004 more than 25 of the annual snowfall was intercepted by the full canopy compared to about 17 for partial cut and no interception for clearcut at medium elevation according to the sam simulations sam processes become complex as both solar energy and energy deficit peak swe decrease with increasing canopy where the magnitude of their changes vary based on topography and climate forest canopy also serves paradoxical functions as shading and wind reduction slow down snowmelt while emitting longwave radiation accelerating snowmelt especially under high insolation pomeroy et al 2009 3 6 snowmelt timing dsm the combined effects of timber harvest and aspect strongly shifted snowmelt timing as illustrated in table 1 for wy 2006 based on the simulations snow ablation started after swe reached its peak and was around 3 22 2006 for all treatment types south facing slopes 180 shortened dsm by more than a week compared to north facing slopes especially for control forest 9 4 days greater solar radiation on south facing slopes caused lower peak swe during the accumulation period and higher melt rate during the ablation period similar to pomeroy et al 2003 relative to a thick snowpack increases in shortwave radiation from north to south facing slopes dominated the net energy for a shallow snowpack under the canopy so that dsm changed the most for the control forest the average ablation end date was as early as 4 23 2006 for partial cut at a south facing slope and as late as 5 8 2006 for the control forest at a north facing slope this difference of 13 days can have significant downstream impacts due to unexpected timing and quantity change in flows uunila et al 2006 increasing swe with elevation was the main reason for the increasing trend of dsm and secondarily clearcutting slightly increased dsm at high elevations fig 10b shows that dsm in forested areas was 1 3 days longer at medium to low elevations and 1 7 days shorter at high elevation compared to dsm in open areas interestingly dsm in partial cut areas was the shortest among all three treatment types especially at low elevation this was because half the canopy emitted longwave radiation while still transmitting solar radiation musselman et al 2012 in addition the snow layer was shallow due to canopy interception and low elevation so that the net energy was enough to offset the energy deficit of snowpack to reach the melting point our findings corroborate work by lundquist et al 2013 who found that on a global scale forest cover reduced snowpack retention by 1 2 weeks when the average winter temperature is greater than 1 c hubbart et al 2015 also concluded that snow ablation date can be 2 3 weeks later for clearcut and partial cut than for forested land from snow measurements in the mcew this suggests that partial cutting at medium to high elevation while clearcutting at low elevation would reduce disturbances of timber harvest on snowmelt timing in the mcew 3 7 average melt rate m average melt rate m increased with decreasing forest shading fig 10c as a result of interception and canopy shading induced net energy dynamics m ranged from 11 4 to 15 6 5 4 9 9 and 3 3 5 3 mm day for clearcut partial cut and control respectively based on elevations between 1300 m and 1450 m aspects of 0 90 and 180 and slope at 30 also m on south facing slopes was higher by 1 8 0 9 and 0 8 mm day for each treatment type respectively compared to north facing slopes table 1 this result agreed with other studies suggesting that clearcut especially on south facing slopes experienced the most rapid snowmelt us army corps of engineers 1998 winkler 2001 varhola et al 2010 hubbart et al 2015 the sensitivity of m to land cover change represented by δ m the difference of m between clearcut and control forest was the highest at south facing 180 slopes for all three elevations fig 11 for example δ m increased from 8 1 mm day on a north facing slope to 9 3 mm day on a south facing slope at elevation of 1424 m while a great amount of solar radiation was added to the snowpack after timber harvest north facing slopes received less energy than south facing slopes while the percent reduction of shortwave radiation reaching snow on the ground by canopy type and longwave radiation by trees were independent of aspect incoming shortwave radiation was aspect dependent hence on south facing slopes shortwave radiation may exceed the longwave radiation gain from trees whereas on the north facing slopes the interception of shortwave radiation may be partly offset by longwave emission from the canopy ellis et al 2011 this led to a relatively small increase in net energy switching from control forest to clearcut on north facing slopes m and its changing magnitude from north to south facing slopes were both the greatest at medium elevation 1365 m followed by high 1424 m and low 1299 m elevations fig 11 at 1365 m δ m was 11 mm day on north facing slopes compared to 9 3 and 8 7 mm day for high and low elevation respectively medium elevation tended to have the most excessive net energy over the energy deficit of snowpack in the melting process due to the non linear relationship of elevation with incoming energy snow mass and microclimate in forest interior it could also relate to the higher temperature at medium elevation causing intensive snowmelt given critical temperature thresholds such as 1 c which is commonly used as an indicator to claim the start of spring melt lundquist et al 2004 consequently a significant increase in peak flows has been observed when logging elevation levels range from 40 to 80 of the basin whitaker et al 2002 major findings on the influences of timber harvest on snowpack dynamics based on sam simulations are as follows 1 clearcutting increased peak swe by more than two times of that for control forest on average 2 clearcutting and partial cutting on south facing slopes significantly advanced the ablation end date by as much as 13 days compared to harvest on north facing slopes 3 partial cutting at low elevation greatly shortened dsm while clearcutting at high elevation greatly lengthened dsm and 4 clearcutting on south facing slopes at medium elevation caused the most increase in m as well as generated the greatest m 3 8 spatial distribution of hsas hsas were found close to streams in lower parts of the watershed where subsurface water accumulates due to a sharp slope reduction or topographic convergence and in headwater areas fed by snowmelt on low slopes where lateral water drainage was limited fig 12 climate conditions e g total annual precipitation storm event size timing of precipitation and timber harvest significantly affected the spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture and source areas for runoff generation these hsas are examples of saturation excess overland flow occurring in this watershed which is typical for forested environments alaoui et al 2011 we analyze hsas in the following sections using the p ai hs and demonstrate the effect of harvest strategies timing location and harvest types on water yield and peak flows driven by climate and topographic conditions 3 9 climate and topographic effects on hsas as expected the fraction of the watershed defined as an hsa i e p ai hs in a wet year was much greater than in a dry year out of three years prior to timber harvest representing low medium and high average annual precipitation wy 1993 1276 mm wy 1999 1464 mm wy 1997 1965 mm wy 1997 had the largest areas with p ai hs greater than 0 01 and more than half of the areas had p ai hs greater than 0 05 fig 12 many saturated areas occurred at high elevations such as in sw1 sw2 and sw3 because these areas received more precipitation snowmelt at higher elevations typically contributed to peak runoff events during spring and early summer pederson et al 2011 grünewald et al 2014 increasing soil water storage and initiating lateral flow to lower areas areas at low elevations in the watershed south facing slopes and non riparian zones had low p ai hs because of lower precipitation input and lower peak swe especially during a relatively dry wy fig 12a and steeper slopes and thus greater hydraulic gradients soil moisture at downslope areas was mainly affected by subsurface lateral flow from upslope areas zhu et al 2014 and most of the riparian areas at downslope areas have steep slopes 25 35 with low soil moisture content moore et al 1988 liang and uchida 2014 3 10 timber harvest effects on hsas effects of timber harvest on hsas were remarkable especially under medium large precipitation events illustrated by degree of saturation maps for sw1 sw2 and sw3 at four land cover stages fig 13 before any land cover changes the watershed showed an increased degree of saturation in riparian areas at high elevation after a minor snowmelt event followed by a 57 mm rainfall event on 08 22 1992 fig 13a roads red lines in fig 13b stand out as fully saturated on a wet day in the fall of 1997 due to their minimal water storage capacity after an 85 mm precipitation event on 11 24 2004 followed by a small event on 11 28 2004 the degree of saturation of 80 occurred on logged areas in sw1 and sw2 while non logged areas only had 40 60 fig 13c clearcut areas in sw1 had a 20 greater degree of saturation than non logged areas on average under similar topographic characteristics with multiple harvest activities across the mcew an average pre storm soil moisture condition of 32 and a 45 mm precipitation event resulted in 90 degree of saturation in logged areas compared to less than 50 degree of saturation for the remaining areas fig 13d headwater regions in logged areas were near saturation under medium to large precipitation events indicating high likelihood of runoff generation clearly logging in areas with features like high elevation south facing slopes and riparian areas exaggerated the likelihood of being hsa 3 11 land cover management the predominant hydrological effect of timber harvest was reduced evaporation from interception storage as well as transpiration by trees through deep roots resulting in less evapotranspiration and more water yield this was evidenced by the different harvest locations and areas of the three harvest scenario simulations see fig 3 that all resulted in increased water yield i e total streamflow relative to pre harvest for example in sw1 clearcut the pre harvest phase wy 1992 2001 average water yield was 708 mm whereas during the post harvest treatment phase wy 2002 2013 scenario 1 47 of sw1 logged in low p ai hs resulted in 202 mm more scenario 2 47 of sw1 logged in high p ai hs resulted in 238 mm more and scenario 3 100 sw logged had the greatest average water yield of 1200 mm 492 mm more than pre harvest the trend was similar in sw2 but with much less difference between pre harvest 694 mm and scenarios 1 709 mm 2 722 mm and 3 799 mm logging in areas with high p ai hs resulted in higher peak flows in general than logging in areas with low p ai hs due to temporal redistribution of water in generating runoff this was most apparent in sw1 fig 14 a following clearcutting and less apparent in sw2 following partial cutting fig 14b clearcutting in high p ai hs areas increased maximum peak flow by 120 wy 2003 in a single rainfall event and an average of 30 higher peak flows compared to clearcutting in low p ai hs areas similar to du et al 2016 rain on snow events which occurs more in clearcut areas can significantly accelerate the snowmelt to contribute to flood events jones and perkins 2010 musselman et al 2018 however snowmelt driven events during the late ablation period tended to increase peak flows in scenario 1 wy 2008 2010 2011 and 2012 hubbart et al 2007 also observed large effects of timber harvest in the mcew during the snowmelt season in wy 2008 snowmelt driven the peak flow 05 17 2008 was the highest in scenario 1 with disproportionately large snowmelt at lower elevation because a substantial snowpack melted by high shortwave radiation under clear sky 5 15 2008 5 19 2008 in wy 2010 snowmelt and rainfall together a 36 6 mm rainfall event right after the end of snow ablation resulted in peak flow on 6 2 2010 exacerbated by near soil saturation from previous snowmelt peak flow responses to harvest scenarios suggests that logging location and timing under sensitive hydrological conditions may be used to manage peak flows and downstream flooding clearcutting in low p ai hs medium elevation areas led to higher runoff for snowmelt driven events whereas runoff tended to be higher with clearcutting in high p ai hs high elevation areas for rainfall driven events this is illustrated in fig 15 a where data points above the 1 1 line are predominantly rainfall driven events red circles indicating streamflow was greatest under scenario 2 whereas data points below the 1 1 line are predominantly snowmelt driven grey circles relatively small snowmelt events 20 mm along the 1 1 line indicate that snowmelt under scenario 1 was higher during the mar apr snowmelt season and lower during feb mar and may snowmelt season compared to scenario 2 however scenario 1 tended to generate more snowmelt than scenario 2 for some of the large snowmelt events 20 mm fig 15b which usually occurred as a result of high melt rate of substantial snowpack and strong incoming radiation this is similar to the point scale analysis in section 3 4 3 that showed clearcutting on south facing slopes at medium elevation tended to increase snowmelt the larger snowmelt events in scenario 1 compared to scenario 2 was limited to certain climate conditions in general snow at the clearcut location in sw1 disappears earlier in scenario 1 medium elevation than scenario 2 high elevation as snow accumulation energy deficit was less at lower elevation due to higher temperature less total precipitation and a lower snow versus rainfall ratio for incoming energy clearcut areas in scenario 1 were mostly south facing which received more shortwave radiation than in harvested areas in scenario 2 meanwhile longwave radiation from the sky tended to be greater with higher temperatures frequent melting caused snow albedo to be lower meaning shortwave radiation absorbed by the snowpack increased as less of it was being reflected which further accelerated melting overall the lower energy deficit of the snowpack received greater incoming energy at clearcut areas for scenario 1 leading to shorter time for ablation and moderate amount of melting due to the size of the snowpack compared to snowmelt in scenario 2 exceptions were years that still had sufficient swe in may so that snow at low p ai hs medium elevation areas with exposure to higher shortwave radiation generated a large amount of melting these results suggest that in snow dominated areas logging in the areas with low p ai hs would reduce peak flows during snowmelt seasons before solar radiation becomes strong yet increase the flood risk if there is still adequate snow pack when climate turns warmer based on our findings mixed harvest regimes planned based on p ai hs areas and climate conditions may reduce timber harvest effects on the hydrologic responses although annual water yield was positively related to timber harvest areas partial cutting in low p ai hs areas can effectively reduce the impact of timber harvest on both water yield and peak flows however for watersheds to be logged entirely over time careful planning of harvest location and timing may avoid creating harvest induced large peak flow event 4 conclusions observed streamflow collected at seven flumes in the mcew verified the impact of timber harvest on watershed hydrology both clearcutting and partial cutting caused large relative increases in annual water yield high flows at 1 of the cumulative distribution of streamflow were more sensitive to forest logging than medium 50 and low flows 90 the smr model simulated the hydrology of the mcew well based on three performance criteria pbias rmse and kge especially within the period when timber harvest effects were evaluated snowpack dynamics at the point scale revealed impacts of elevation aspect climate and timber harvest on sam process and provided a foundation for understanding the spatial effect of timber harvest on hsas sam processes essentially are the result of the interplay between internal energy deficit of the snowpack and incoming energy intensity primarily from shortwave and longwave radiation depending on climate topography and land cover peak swe in clearcut areas was twice as much as that in the control forest and resulted in long dsm at high elevation however partial cutting at medium to high elevation and clearcutting at low elevation can mitigate the impact of timber harvest on snowmelt timing as harvest on south facing slopes increased solar radiation switching land cover from forest to clearcut can dramatically increase m especially at medium elevation certain timber harvest regimes therefore can enhance large peak streamflow events forest management considering sam factors would benefit watershed response hsas play an important role in forest management due to land cover effects on hydrological processes the probability of being hydrologically sensitive p ai hs or the likelihood of runoff generation changed dramatically with climate conditions and topography most high p ai hs areas were located in headwater regions and riparian zones and expanded from upstream to downstream with increasing water input riparian buffers required along fish bearing stream reaches in the mcew were not considered in the model with high p ai hs areas mostly covering riparian zones logging these areas in the model could lead to overestimated harvest effects on streamflow patterns the p ai hs in a wet water year mostly stayed above 0 05 and these areas covered over half of the entire mcew whereas the likelihood was minimal during dry years a single considerable rainfall or snowmelt event in high p ai hs areas resulted in a significant increase in peak flows so that timing and type of harvest practice in these areas needs to be evaluated carefully annual water yield was primarily affected by logging area and logging patterns clearcutting versus partial cutting as less evapotranspiration from timber harvest increased soil water storage harvest activities potentially increased the degree of saturation by 20 in turn increasing the corresponding p ai hs peak flow was highly affected by timber harvest location and event type rainfall dominated or snowmelt dominated more extreme runoff events i e increased peak flow occurred under the harvest scenarios in high p ai hs areas than in low p ai hs areas during rainfall dominated events high p ai hs areas were in high elevation areas with greater snowpack causing large snowmelt events however during snowmelt dominated events logging in low p ai hs areas tended to have higher peak flows under certain circumstances than logging in high p ai hs such as when there was still sufficient snowpack at medium elevation as temperatures started to increase this is because medium elevation had the most excessive net total energy over internal energy deficit of the snowpack leading to high melt rates under these condition extreme snowmelt events are likely changes in land cover harvest location soil properties topography and climate together contribute to the change in hydrological patterns it is critical to balance harvest timing and location with consideration of climate condition to control factors that affect peak flows so that appropriate management plans will minimize disturbances to the watershed from our results logging in low p ai hs areas for years experiencing large rainfall events generally reduces peak flow timber harvest in high p ai hs areas preferably on north facing slopes for years with great snow accumulation can dramatically reduce extreme peak flows induced by intense spring snowmelt as limited modeling work for the mcew focused on evaluating the impact of timber harvest patterns on hydrologic responses du et al 2016 srivastava et al 2020 our findings extended strategies for forest management based on the effect of harvest location on energy dynamics and hsas to avoid large increases in water yield and peak flows which will potentially cause more erosion diminished downstream water quality and flooding issues funding this work was supported by the us forest service fs agreement number 03 jv 11222065

4917,effects of forest treatments on watershed hydrology in terms of water yield and runoff processes is a primary concern this paper evaluates the effects of long term land cover change on hydrological processes in the mica creek experimental watershed mcew in northern idaho usa in the mcew effects of clearcut and partial cut harvest practices on streamflow were monitored and evaluated from 1991 to 2013 firstly snowpack dynamics in terms of snowmelt timing and average melt rate under different elevations aspects land covers and climate conditions were analyzed at the point scale with the snow accumulation and melt sam model from the perspective of the energy balance then the grid based soil moisture routing smr hydrology model was used to provide temporal and spatial hydrological changes in the mcew we assigned locations as hydrologically sensitive areas hsas based on the probability of runoff generation p ai hs to capture potential downstream environmental effects of actual land cover change and optimal harvest patterns the results highlight the strong impacts timber harvest can have on increasing streamflow and in particular peak flow on average the daily averaged degree of saturation increased by 20 after timber harvest resulting in higher risks of flooding from large rainfall events three logging scenarios including logging in areas with low p ai hs high p ai hs and in the entire watershed area showed that logging areas had a positive relationship with water yield and that more extreme peak flow was likely to occur after clearcutting in high p ai hs areas high elevation under rainfall driven events or logging in low p ai hs areas medium elevation during snowmelt dominated events clearcutting on south facing slopes at medium elevation strongly increased the average melt rate leading to potential flooding if a snowpack was present and temperatures increased scenario analysis suggests that partial cutting in areas with low p ai hs would reduce peak flow amount by as much as 40 however for watersheds to be logged entirely choosing proper harvest locations such as clearcutting in high p ai hs areas having large snow events may effectively reduce extreme peak flow from spring snowmelt our findings inform forest management decisions favoring partial cutting over clearcutting and how to avoid concentrating harvest practices in hsas by adapting spatial distribution and timing of harvesting to climate conditions to minimize impacts on the water cycle keywords soil moisture routing model snow accumulation and melt process spatial hydrologic patterns harvest scenarios peak flow 1 introduction timber harvest has been shown to have a great impact on watershed hydrology and ecology including water quantity hoover 1944 hornbeck et al 1997 water quality campbell and doeg 1989 gravelle and link 2007 boggs et al 2016 and peak flow responses beschta et al 2000 jones 2000 guillemette et al 2005 schnorbus and alila 2013 yu and alila 2019 forest practices including timber harvest and wildfire disturb the hydrological and geological systems in terms of snowpack dynamics jost et al 2007 runoff generation vanshaar et al 2002 temperature gravelle and link 2007 sediment transport karwan et al 2007 and soil properties ares et al 2005 the acceleration of deforestation rates achard et al 2002 and post harvest regrowth can change the frequency and magnitude of flooding bradshaw et al 2007 alila et al 2009 and summer flow responses perry and jones 2017 gronsdahl et al 2019 coble et al 2020 these effects are especially strong in mediterranean climates where the asynchronous seasonal precipitation and radiative energy fluxes usually result in extreme dryness during the hot summers wondzell and king 2003 thus understanding the interaction between timber harvest and flow regimes with climatic variability is important to maintain the sustainability of water resources the ecological environment and forest health the origin of the ideas considering the interactions between forests and watersheds through observations can be traced back to the first century ad andréassian 2004 the paired watershed study bates and henry 1928 bosch and hewlett 1982 stednick 1996 is the earliest method designed to evaluate the disturbance of harvest practices on streamflow considering climate conditions snow dominated or rainfall dominated geography elevation and plant type increases in water yield after timber harvest have been documented across a wide variety of the forest watershed experiments usually attributing increases in water yield to reduced evapotranspiration after logging hubbart et al 2007 in general increases in annual water yield range widely from 8 to 80 within the first ten years after post harvest bosch and hewlett 1982 reported an average increase of 40 mm water yield for every 10 reduction in canopy cover for a pine forest the concerns for increased peak flow are practical as a single storm of significance can lead to the majority of erosion within a year blackburn et al 1986 squires et al 2017 karwan et al 2007 found that individual peaks of total suspended solids tend to occur with storm events the effect of timber harvest on low flow and peak flow after timber harvest are highly variable lin and wei 2008 and weakly related to the percentage of cut area in a number of paired watershed studies dan moore et al 2005 impacts of timber harvest on snowmelt rates can lead to a significant increase in the frequency of floods due to the shifting from longwave dominated snowmelt to shortwave dominated snowmelt green and alila 2012 troendle and king 1985 found that removal of approximately 40 of the forest resulted in not only an increase of annual water yield but also an increase in peak flow and flood volume due to reduced interception losses from snow beschta et al 2000 found that the 1 year recurrence interval peak flow generally increased about 13 16 and the 5 year recurrence by 6 9 peak flow may result in increased sediment transport swanson 1982 although in most forests soil erosion is typically small compared to channel erosion hartanto et al 2003 bruijnzeel 2004 models are useful for evaluating land use and land cover change in forested watersheds when physical processes are included to assess timber harvest effects hewlett et al 1969 vertessy et al 1993 srivastava et al 2017 with the development of hydrological models researchers started to embed land cover change modules like timber harvest to get more realistic simulations huff et al 1999 matheussen et al 2000 srivastava et al 2018 the regional hydroecological simulation system rhessys model band et al 1993 integrated with topmodel beven and kirkby 1979 and forest bgc running and coughlan 1988 was used to calculate nitrogen carbon and water balances and to simulate forest canopy evapotranspiration the parameterization in aggregated hillslope units in the rhessys model can ignore important processes such as the variation of soil water content within a hillslope tian et al 2014 developed drainmod forest based on forest watershed management model drainmod mccarthy et al 1992 by improving more detailed hydrological process simulation and adding ecosystem components to address the interactions of hydrological biogeochemical and physiological processes in lowland forest ecosystems to capture snowfall interception and the unloading process from the branch to canopy scale an empirically based snowfall interception model was developed by hedstrom and pomeroy 1998 but the model did not include melt processes storck et al 1998 used the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model dhsvm wigmosta et al 1994 to evaluate impacts of logging activities on rain on snow floods and found snowpack and melt rate were more sensitive to timber harvest at higher elevation however soil and vegetation parameters in the dhsvm needed to be refined with calibration to yield reasonable results waichler et al 2005 du et al 2014 the snow accumulation and melt sam model brooks and boll 2005 a single layer snow pack model based on mass and energy balances was developed as a convenient tool to analyze energy dynamics at the watershed scale however the sam model did not include canopy cover dynamics for evaluation of timber harvest land cover change the choice of harvest locations needs careful consideration when some locations can lead to high potential to generate runoff under similar climate conditions lyon et al 2006 hydrologically sensitive areas hsas defined as areas which have a high probability of generating runoff and potentially become a polluting source area for receiving water bodies walter et al 2000 highly influence the magnitude of peak flow in a landscape in forest systems these areas may trigger landslides and erosion in response to disturbances in the watershed gorsevski et al 2006 hsas are highly responsive to geographic features and climate conditions agnew et al 2006 studied the correlation of hsas with topographic index and distance from a stream showing a more regionally reliable correlation with the former walter et al 2000 evaluated the changes in saturated areas at a short temporal scale and showed that saturated areas changed seasonally based on climate conditions to our knowledge the effect of land cover change on the distribution and timing of hsas within a forested landscape has not been widely evaluated understanding the effect of management on the spatial and temporal variability of hsas is important as it directly affects watershed hydrology and the corresponding environmental and ecological health within a watershed some of the more specific forest management questions related to the spatial variability in hsas include what is the impact of timber harvest location within a snow dominated watershed on snowpack dynamics and how do topography and climate affect the optimal forest management strategy to protect the watershed from unexpected hydrologic responses such as floods the concept of hsas has not yet been applied to forest harvest management specifically in the interaction between spatial timber harvest strategies and streamflow magnitudes and timing in this paper therefore our overall goal is to evaluate the impact of timber harvest strategies on runoff generation in a forested watershed specific objectives are to 1 analyze the historical hydrological responses water yield flow frequencies to timber harvest regimes clearcutting partial cutting and control in a paired watershed design 2 understand the impact of different treatments with various topographies elevation and aspect on point scale snowpack dynamics as one of the main drivers for hydrologic patterns 3 analyze the temporal and spatial variability in hsas within a forested ecosystem based on a long term dataset and 4 evaluate the impacts of harvest location on the hsas probability and overall hydrologic response 2 methods 2 1 study area and data collection the study watershed is the 28 km2 mica creek experimental watershed mcew in northern idaho mica creek is a tributary of the st joe river which flows into coeur d alene lake the elevation of the mcew ranges from 975 m to 1725 m with slopes ranging from 0 to 39 annual precipitation is approximately 1400 mm with the majority occurring from november to may more than half of annual precipitation falls as snow during winter and spring the lower elevation in the study area experiences more rain on snow events du et al 2016 instantaneous observed air temperature generally ranges from 30 c in the summer to 20 c in the winter average annual air temperature is about 5 c peak streamflow occurs mostly during mid winter or april and may primarily due to a great amount of snowmelt rain rain on snow and rain on spring snowmelt events macdonald and hoffman 1995 more than 90 of the watershed is overlain by ash capped silt loam soils on gravelly sandy loam in the deeper soil layer before reaching bedrock bedrock was detected within 1 5 m of the soil surface in small areas in the mid western and northeastern part of the watershed soil survey staff 2019 vegetation consists of 70 to 80 year old mixed conifer stands after extensive logging and burning activities in the early 1930 s the mcew is a paired and nested watershed design with seven subwatersheds referred to as sw1 to sw7 to allow for the analysis of the cumulative effects of timber harvest as well as traditional comparison of treatment versus control on long term hydrologic patterns watson et al 2001 fig 1 a watershed measurements were initiated in 1990 initial road building occurred in 1997 and experimental timber harvest in 2001 with all canopy cover being removed clearcutting from 50 of the area in sw1 and half of the canopy cover being removed partial cutting from 50 of the area in sw2 no canopy cover was removed in sw3 control sw4 evaluates the cumulative effects of sw1 to sw3 while sw5 and sw6 serves as the control for sw4 and sw7 respectively sw7 is directly downstream of sw1 to sw4 no further treatments were implemented for six years until 2007 after 2007 timber harvest including several organized logging events in sw4 to sw7 occurred every year except during 2008 fig 1b see table a 1 in supplementary material for detailed areal percentage of timber harvest few roads existed in the northwest upper drainage of the watershed prior to 1990 most roads were simple unpaved roads for access to logging areas and transportation gravel road construction in 1997 included new roads and improvement of old roads rackley and chung 2008 measurements in the mcew include precipitation air temperature discharge and sediment concentration streamflow via stage height was automatically recorded every 30 min by parshall flumes installed at the outlet of each subwatershed fig 1a starting in 1991 the monitoring period used in this study spans from october 1st 1991 until september 30th 2013 equivalent to water year wy 1992 2013 the mcew has one snotel site located at 1375 m elevation in the southern part of sw5 which was installed in october 1990 the snotel station maintained by the usda natural resources conservation service nrcs provides observed daily and hourly precipitation air temperature and snow water equivalent swe the instantaneous sensor provides a single observation on the hour from which we used the temperature at 6 am 12 pm 6 pm and 12 am to construct a 6 hour loop for snowmelt calculations the meteorological site named ridgesnow located at 1424 m elevation on the southwestern edge of sw1 tracked wind speed relative humidity and longwave and shortwave radiation potential evapotranspiration was calculated using the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 for the modeling precipitation and temperature were distributed with elevation using a fixed precipitation lapse rate 81 36 cm km 1 and a temperature lapse rate 5 31 c km 1 respectively based on differences recorded at the st maries coop station 655 6 m 47 3165 116 5789 and the mica creek snotel station 1374 6 m 47 1505 116 265 rain and snow partitioning from precipitation was determined through calibration with snotel swe using a minimum temperature of 0 76 c below which all precipitation was snow and a maximum temperature of 3 10 c above which all precipitation was rain between these two temperature thresholds the ratio of rain and precipitation increased linearly with increasing temperature 2 2 long term data analysis the mcew implemented land use activities at certain locations based on the before after control impact baci design in three treatment phases 1 no activity wy 1992 1997 for assessments of streamflow relationships between paired subwatersheds as controls for climate and geography 2 road construction wy 1998 2001 which removed less than 2 canopy and was considered as having subtle hydrological effects and 3 road and logging combined wy 2002 2013 the before and after activity phases provide the comparison of effects of timber harvest and road construction for the entire watershed the time series of streamflow for a logged watershed shows how hydrologic patterns react to land cover change while the paired watershed design corrects for climate and topographic factors see fig 1 the 30 min streamflow data were averaged to daily data for analysis average annual water yield was calculated to plot the hydrograph of paired sw1 sw2 and sw3 we evaluated the patterns of continuous influence caused by one time logging activities in 2001 until the next logging activity in sw2 in 2009 the forest regrowth impact within in these eight years was assumed minimal according to time lapse maps from google earth engine differences of observed streamflow at sw1 and sw2 relative to sw3 were calculated to capture effects from clearcut and partial cut in order to evaluate the impact of harvest on streamflow distributions we ranked observed daily streamflow within each wy from control watershed sw4 in descending order as well as assigning them to an estimation of a cumulative distribution function as their exceedance probability vogel and fennessey 1994 1 c u m u l a t i v e d i s t r i b u t i o n p q q m n 1 100 where m 1 2 3 n is the ranked number of the daily streamflow in descending order n is the total number of days in a water year for streamflow data p q q represents the probability of each streamflow rate q being exceeded the dates corresponding to the exceedance probability of 1 high 50 medium and 90 low for streamflow at sw4 in each wy were used to select the daily streamflow in sw1 sw2 and sw3 as high flow medium flow and low flow respectively we used the relative difference with sw3 to evaluate how clearcut and partial cut affected each frequency of streamflow in sw1 and sw2 before and after timber harvest in 2001 2 3 soil moisture routing model and performance criteria the hydrological model applied in the mcew is a modified version of the gis based soil moisture routing smr model boll et al 1998 frankenberger et al 1999 brooks 2003 brooks et al 2007 yourek et al 2019 by adding canopy dynamics in snowmelt and accumulation algorithms for spatial and temporal evaluation of land cover change the main modifications include road and timber harvest effects and use of a two layer soil system as a distributed hydrologic model the smr model is based on a mass balance and can output various distributed hydrologic variables besides streamflow such as soil water storage swe and actual evapotranspiration see brooks et al 2007 yourek et al 2019 most of the geographic information was publicly available and all gis maps such as elevation and soil properties were available at a 30 m spatial resolution this quasi steady state model operates on a daily time step with the exception of subsurface lateral flow which operates on a 6 h time step to capture rapid changes in water storage on steep slopes boll et al 2015 the smr model performance is evaluated from three perspectives 1 capability of capturing the effect of timber harvest 2 daily streamflow hydrograph for periods without disturbance wy 1994 1996 and with disturbances wy 2011 2013 and 3 statistical performance criteria for each wy 2 4 land cover effects logging maps were updated at the beginning of every wy on october 1 to incorporate new harvest information on clearcut and partial cut fig 1b for each annual land cover map values of key parameters describing soil properties canopy interception snowmelt and evapotranspiration were adjusted accordingly see tables a 2 and a 3 for parameter values canopy interception assumed a maximum storage amount subjected to potential evaporation once the maximum storage amount was reached additional precipitation became throughfall changes in soil properties due to land cover change affected the effective values for parameters on a grid cell which was mainly reduced root zone depth reduced canopy cover in a grid cell led to lower canopy storage and effective crop coefficients and thus greater throughfall and lower evapotranspiration for road areas soil depth was decreased to 2 cm to simulate an impermeable surface with 0 1 cm initial abstraction runoff from roads was exported out of the watershed within a day without reinfiltration down gradient lateral flow from cut slopes to road ditches was assumed to be small and was not specifically addressed in the model 2 5 snow accumulation and melt the snow accumulation and melt sam model brooks and boll 2005 which was embedded in the smr model by brooks et al 2007 and yourek et al 2019 was used to calculate snowmelt based on a mass and energy balance see supplementary material b to compare with point measurement data from hubbart et al 2015 swe at various locations was calculated using the modified version of the sam model which accounted for impacts of a forest canopy on mass and energy exchange snowfall interception was estimated based on dynamic canopy storage where all vegetation has a maximum canopy water storage depth evaporation from snow and rainfall intercepted by the canopy was calculated at a constant rate on a rainy day or the potential evaporation on a dry day sublimation and condensation on the canopy were simulated based on latent heat exchange snow not intercepted by the canopy fell to the ground and was added to the existing snowpack to test canopy effects on swe shortwave radiation and longwave radiation were adjusted eqs 2 and 3 proportional to the percent canopy cover referred to as cc in the modified sam model cc 0 for clearcut 50 for partial cut and 100 for control we assumed the shortwave radiation is diffuse radiation and the effects of non uniform canopy structure on scattering and attenuating the incoming radiation incident to the surface hardy et al 2004 was not considered in radiative transmission calculations 2 q sw 1 c c q sw a t m 3 q lw 1 c c q lw a t m c c q lw c a n o p y q lw s n o w where q sw and q lw are the shortwave and longwave radiation

6 soil water dynamics the smr model used soil depth data from du et al 2016 who used slope drainage area and elevation based on in situ measurements the soil was the bouldercreek series soil survey staff 2019 srivastava et al 2020 having a near surface a horizon extending 0 38 m to 0 82 m below the soil surface and deeper b horizon extending 0 89 to 1 92 m below the soil surface each characterized as ash capped silt loam and gravelly sandy loam respectively distribution of water input to soil layers supplemented layer b after layer a reached field capacity the soil profile then wetted up from the base of layer b up to layer a shallow subsurface lateral flow from each cell was calculated with darcy s law as the product of the hydraulic gradient equal to the land slope and an effective hydraulic conductivity k eff brooks et al 2007 below field capacity k eff increased exponentially with soil moisture content between field capacity and saturation k eff increased linearly from k fc at field capacity to the k s value of 70 c m d a y 1 soil survey staff 2019 considering the macro pores in the soil when the soil reached saturation the k eff was 10 k s brooks et al 2004 2 7 model performance the correlation of annual water yield for paired sw1 clearcut sw3 control sw2 partial cut sw3 control and sw6 sw7 were analyzed to assess the ability of the model to capture the response of water yield under three treatment phases between wy 1992 to wy 2013 the third phase was modified to wy 2002 2007 for the comparison of sw6 and sw7 because the logging events in the controlled sw6 began in wy 2008 daily streamflow between observed data and simulated outputs for sw4 was shown for periods without timber harvest wy 1994 1996 and with timber harvest wy 2011 2013 since sw4 is the approximate converging point for sw1 sw2 and sw3 which consists of all the features from three contributing subwatersheds statistical evaluation of the smr model performance is based on three criteria 1 percent bias pbias which measures the average positive or negative tendency of simulated values to the observed values 2 root mean square error rmse which shows the magnitude of difference from the simulated values to the observed data 3 kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 which is an alternative criterion that decreases systematic errors associated with nash

2005 to 05 31 2006 was compared to in situ sonic snow depth measurements located in sw1 sw4 hubbart et al 2015 an average swe for each forest treatment type from two measurements on various slopes and aspects were digitized from hubbart et al 2015 for this point scale analysis the modified sam model was calibrated with temperature thresholds for precipitation partitioning see table b 2 upon good agreement between simulated swe by the sam model and observed data fig 2 the impact of forest cover change on the amount and timing of swe under different topographic characteristics elevation and aspect was analyzed to develop a more robust understanding of harvest effects on hsas relative to canopy effects on swe slope effects were much less apparent so these are not included in this paper the impacts of elevation and aspect on simulated swe within each of the three land cover types were assessed at elevations ranging from 1300 m to 1440 m at a 10 m increment and aspects of 0 north facing 90 east facing and 180 south facing for each elevation level elevations were categorized into low 1300 1340 m medium 1350 1390 m and high 1400 1440 m effects of timber harvest focused on peak swe swe duration of snow ablation dsm and average melt rate m average seasonal melt rate is defined as the ratio of swe over dsm which is the length from the first day of snowmelt after peak swe ablation start date to the end of ablation 7 m swe d s m the effect of aspect was assessed using the simulated timing of full snowpack ablation aspects ranging from 0 to 180 at 30 increments were evaluated for three representative elevations at 1299 m 1365 m and 1424 m and the three treatment types west facing aspect 180 360 results were symmetrical to the east facing 0 180 in this point scale analysis so only east facing results are included the peak swe date of peak swe ablation start date ablation end date and duration of ablation were calculated to assess the impact of aspect on snowmelt timing associated with treatment types the difference of m between clearcut and control treatments referred to as δ m was calculated to illustrate the impact of aspect on the sensitivity of melt rate in response to timber harvest hydrologically sensitive areas at spatial scale 2 9 definition of hydrologically sensitive areas the probability for any area to be hydrologically sensitive hs walter et al 2000 was calculated based on the relative number of days the area was saturated in a wy expressed as follows 8 p a i h s j n d a y sat j j n d a y j where p ai hs is the probability that area ai was saturated i e hydrologically sensitive daysat j is a day when ai was saturated on the jth day of the year with j as day of year thus the greater the probability of being hs the greater likelihood the area generates runoff the probability that a specific grid cell generated runoff i e p ai hs was compared for three typical dry 1993 medium 1999 and wet 1997 wys with a probability of exceedance for annual precipitation at 62 5 37 5 and 4 2 respectively which was based on the cumulative frequencies calculated from ranking annual precipitation in descending order over the available 23 year climate record these three wys occurred in the pre disturbance phase in the mcew in addition degree of saturation maps as the percentage of daily soil water amount over the saturated soil water amount were used for four representative days during storm events to illustrate spatial distribution of saturated areas for no land cover change road construction only timber harvest and road and timber harvest 2 10 impact of land cover change we used the initial simulation from wy 1992 2001 as a proxy for subsequent development of management plans depending on the evaluation of impacts of harvest scenarios on water yield and peak flow in wy 2002 2013 based on the changing patterns of p ai hs for all grid cells for wy 1992 2001 we created three harvest scenarios in sw1 clearcut and sw2 partial cut harvest scenario 1 fig 3 a considered logging in areas with low p ai hs harvest scenario 2 fig 3b included logging in areas of high p ai hs the harvested area in the same sw between scenario 1 and 2 remained the same where the logged area for both scenarios was 47 of sw1 and 38 of sw2 in harvest scenario 3 fig 3c the entire sw1 and sw2 areas were subjected to logging clearcut and partial cut respectively logging the entire subwatershed was designed as an extreme case for the purpose of scientific analysis which was not subject to current management practice regimes while riparian buffers are required along fishing bearing stream reaches in the mcew the designed scenarios did not consider such buffers for the post harvest treatment phase from wy 2002 2013 we evaluated the sensitivity of peak flows to timber harvest under snowmelt and rainfall dominated storm events for each harvest scenario we picked the maximum peak flow p f max event within each wy the relative differences of maximum peak flows between two scenarios i and j referred to as p f max i p f max j p f max j were calculated for two cases 1 i is harvest scenario 2 logging in high p ai hs areas and j is harvest scenario 1 logging in low p ai hs areas and 2 i is harvest scenario 3 logging the entire subwatershed and j is harvest scenario 2 the correlation between scenario 1 and 2 for a streamflow events and b snowmelt events were analyzed to show the impact of harvest location on hydrological patterns under snowmelt and rainfall dominated environments 3 results and discussion 3 1 observed annual streamflow timber harvest effects on streamflow were greater for clearcut than for partial cut areas after road building occurred in 1997 and timber harvest occurred in 2001 the absolute difference of annual water yield in sw1 and sw2 over the control watershed sw3 immediately increased about 295 mm and 125 mm in wy 2002 respectively the relative increase in annual water yield in sw1 and sw2 was as high as 85 and 45 respectively during the wy 2003 fig 4 clearcutting effects were very noticeable for a period of five years with diminished effects lasting almost ten years later until 2011 when new logging events occurred in sw1 the partial cutting effect was approximately half that of the clearcutting effect and the effect after 2009 increased due to a new harvest events in that year the decline in the relative difference for sw1 is likely due to vegetative regrowth or more broadly system recovery after disturbances and several years with large annual water yield causing sw3 streamflow to be larger compared to relative increases sw1 sw3 or sw2 sw3 the effect of regrowth was distinguishable by comparing the absolute difference between wy 2006 and wy 2010 where both wys had similar magnitudes of annual water yield in sw3 yet decreased clearcut responses absolute difference in water yield in sw1 indicating the disturbed sw1 system was recovering from clearcutting 3 2 high medium and low streamflow distributions differences of daily observed streamflow for the 1 high 50 medium and 90 low flows at sw1 and sw2 relative to sw3 showed strong temporal variations between wy 1992 2013 fig 5 comparing the relative differences for pre and post harvest high flow was the most sensitive to timber harvest in 2001 increasing from less than 20 on average during pre harvest to as high as 121 for sw1 and 43 for sw2 seven years after 2001 fig 5a medium flows did not show a distinct response before and after timber harvest fig 5b though the annual discharge at medium flows in sw1 and sw2 was mostly greater than in sw3 the relative difference of low flow showed a decreasing trend after 2001 indicating a decreasing trend of baseflow with diminishing effects of harvest fig 5c the high sensitivity of peak flow suggests a high flooding potential and an increased risk of sediment transport following clearcutting 3 3 model results simulated annual water yield increases after timber harvest compared well to the observed data achieved with the smr model with only minor trial and error calibration see table a 2 in supplementary material relative to the 1 1 line the smr model captured the effects on water yield for each treatment phase except for road building in sw1 and sw2 fig 6 roads were less well represented due to the assumption of them as impermeable surfaces in the model although in the mcew they were unpaved and outsloped with an ability to reinfiltrate some runoff roads increase peak flow generation especially for large peak flow events bowling 2002 cuo et al 2006 the assumption of impermeable roads in the smr might have overestimated road effects on peak flows while representation of outsloped roads in the model would have increased the soil moisture content of adjacent areas leading to more runoff generation for most water years after wy 2002 simulated water yield appeared slightly higher for sw1 and sw3 and lower for sw2 compared to observed data observed and simulated data do not deviate much from the 1 1 line in sw6 and sw7 indicating that the effect of forest treatments may be smaller at the larger scale simulated and observed streamflow agreed well in general especially in the post harvest treatment phase fig 7 the simulated low flows slightly exceeded observations during low flow seasons the model did not consider riparian buffers along fish bearing reaches as required in the mcew that may lead to a range of low flow responses retention of riparian buffers together with harvest activities could keep low flow from increasing coble et al 2020 some peak flows were over predicted mainly in the pre harvest treatment phase forest that may be due to over estimated snowmelt at large melt events as a result of inadequate canopy cover accuracy or overestimated storm events due to the assumption of stable distribution of rainfall over the watershed also the simulated streamflow was lower than the observations during early snowmelt season in some cases where simulated peak flow was over estimated later in the season e g wy 1996 this could result from the under estimated snowmelt in the early winter the canopy induced wind speed reduction in the smr model led to slower and longer snowmelt processes in the forest interior in addition the underestimated canopy cover impact on shortwave and longwave radiation can lead to a higher net energy to the snowpack ellis et al 2011 we note that swe estimates in smr were sensitive to the temperature thresholds for precipitation partitioning into rain and snow the point scale analysis below provides more details on the energy dynamics under canopy cover statistical performance criteria confirmed the validity of smr model simulations for all watersheds during the study period in fig 8 the pbias of streamflow simulation for all wys was mostly within 20 for all subwatersheds except that sw3 experienced a few over biased simulations in the second row of rmse for example the 50 percentile value for sw4 indicates that 50 of the wys had a rmse below 1 3 mm wy the majority of rmse points are in the range between 1 0 and 2 0 mm wy a few water years had rmse exceeding 3 0 mm in sw1 to sw4 from the distribution of the rmse values the larger watersheds sw5 sw7 had lower overall rmse values compared to smaller watersheds sw1 sw4 more than 80 of kge values are within 0 5 0 9 except for sw2 and sw3 having around 50 of kge values in that range the kge is positively correlated with annual water yield indicating that the model simulation was better in wetter wys the smr model performed less well under dry conditions likely because components such as deep percolation and baseflow increase their weight in the water balance these were represented by highly simplified processes with the assumption of homogeneity of soil properties such as hydraulic conductivity see table a 2 in supplementary material 3 4 point scale snowpack dynamics the internal energy deficit cold content of a snowpack needs to be satisfied by incoming energy before snowmelt starts and it is linearly dependent on snow temperature swe and the snow s water holding capacity jennings et al 2018 a deeper and colder snowpack has a higher energy deficit so that it takes more energy before liquid water begins to drain out of the bottom of the snowpack additional energy added to the snowpack triggers the melting process as well as changes internal energy deficit which controls the timing and rate of snowmelt the energy deficit and the net energy absorbed by the snowpack change with factors related to elevation aspect slope land cover and climate leading to a complex dynamic system across spatial and temporal scales cline 1997 debeer and pomeroy 2017 we first describe the impact of all those factors on snow accumulation and melt sam processes at the point scale assisted by both observations and simulations second we evaluate the more complicated spatial scale and the effect of timber harvest management in the mcew watershed we focus on snowpack dynamics in terms of peak swe dsm and m 3 5 influence of elevation aspect and canopy on energy dynamics elevation and aspect affected the energy deficit of the snowpack and the incoming energy intensity as follows 1 higher elevation increases the energy deficit because precipitation increases with elevation and the fraction of snow versus rainfall increases with decreasing temperature melloh et al 2008 from 1300 m to 1440 m in the mcew precipitation increased about 250 mm and the snow versus rainfall ratio increased from 0 94 to 1 62 according to spatial precipitation calculated based on point observations precipitation lapse rate and temperature thresholds for snowfall and rainfall the peak swe at high elevation 1400 1440 m was up to twice as much as swe at low elevation 1300 1340 m as a result of significant precipitation and temperature variation with elevation fig 10a incident solar irradiance varies with elevation where snowmelt starts earlier at lower elevation musselman et al 2012 2 aspect affects the amount of solar radiation to the surface with respect to solar incidence angle the impact of aspect on longwave radiation emitted from atmosphere was negligible during snow melting snow on south facing slopes received from 30 to 90 more solar radiation on a daily basis than snow on north facing slopes based on the simulation the presence of canopy dramatically changes the fractions of energy components in the total net energy forest shading created a more stable microclimate with less temperature fluctuation but lowered average daytime air temperature carlson 1997 primarily due to canopy blocking of shortwave and longwave radiation from to the atmosphere as shown in fig 9 sensible heat and latent heat in the areas with full canopy cover remained around zero because the canopy greatly reduced wind effects and thus convective heat transfer shortwave radiation decreased by about half from clearcut to partial cut and more than 70 from partial cut to control the absolute value of net longwave radiation negative value denotes outgoing direction decreased with more canopy cover indicating that forest cover also emitted considerable amounts of energy however the net energy contributed to snowmelt was the highest in the clearcut areas as solar radiation was the dominant energy flux during the snowmelt season whereas it was lowest in the control forest because the enhancement of longwave radiation from canopy emission did not offset the loss of shortwave radiation canopy interception decreased the energy deficit of the snowpack due to declines in the peak swe the mean peak swe for control and partial cut was about 31 and 56 of the peak swe in the clearcut respectively see fig 2 assuming a canopy storage capacity of 3 mm link et al 2004 more than 25 of the annual snowfall was intercepted by the full canopy compared to about 17 for partial cut and no interception for clearcut at medium elevation according to the sam simulations sam processes become complex as both solar energy and energy deficit peak swe decrease with increasing canopy where the magnitude of their changes vary based on topography and climate forest canopy also serves paradoxical functions as shading and wind reduction slow down snowmelt while emitting longwave radiation accelerating snowmelt especially under high insolation pomeroy et al 2009 3 6 snowmelt timing dsm the combined effects of timber harvest and aspect strongly shifted snowmelt timing as illustrated in table 1 for wy 2006 based on the simulations snow ablation started after swe reached its peak and was around 3 22 2006 for all treatment types south facing slopes 180 shortened dsm by more than a week compared to north facing slopes especially for control forest 9 4 days greater solar radiation on south facing slopes caused lower peak swe during the accumulation period and higher melt rate during the ablation period similar to pomeroy et al 2003 relative to a thick snowpack increases in shortwave radiation from north to south facing slopes dominated the net energy for a shallow snowpack under the canopy so that dsm changed the most for the control forest the average ablation end date was as early as 4 23 2006 for partial cut at a south facing slope and as late as 5 8 2006 for the control forest at a north facing slope this difference of 13 days can have significant downstream impacts due to unexpected timing and quantity change in flows uunila et al 2006 increasing swe with elevation was the main reason for the increasing trend of dsm and secondarily clearcutting slightly increased dsm at high elevations fig 10b shows that dsm in forested areas was 1 3 days longer at medium to low elevations and 1 7 days shorter at high elevation compared to dsm in open areas interestingly dsm in partial cut areas was the shortest among all three treatment types especially at low elevation this was because half the canopy emitted longwave radiation while still transmitting solar radiation musselman et al 2012 in addition the snow layer was shallow due to canopy interception and low elevation so that the net energy was enough to offset the energy deficit of snowpack to reach the melting point our findings corroborate work by lundquist et al 2013 who found that on a global scale forest cover reduced snowpack retention by 1 2 weeks when the average winter temperature is greater than 1 c hubbart et al 2015 also concluded that snow ablation date can be 2 3 weeks later for clearcut and partial cut than for forested land from snow measurements in the mcew this suggests that partial cutting at medium to high elevation while clearcutting at low elevation would reduce disturbances of timber harvest on snowmelt timing in the mcew 3 7 average melt rate m average melt rate m increased with decreasing forest shading fig 10c as a result of interception and canopy shading induced net energy dynamics m ranged from 11 4 to 15 6 5 4 9 9 and 3 3 5 3 mm day for clearcut partial cut and control respectively based on elevations between 1300 m and 1450 m aspects of 0 90 and 180 and slope at 30 also m on south facing slopes was higher by 1 8 0 9 and 0 8 mm day for each treatment type respectively compared to north facing slopes table 1 this result agreed with other studies suggesting that clearcut especially on south facing slopes experienced the most rapid snowmelt us army corps of engineers 1998 winkler 2001 varhola et al 2010 hubbart et al 2015 the sensitivity of m to land cover change represented by δ m the difference of m between clearcut and control forest was the highest at south facing 180 slopes for all three elevations fig 11 for example δ m increased from 8 1 mm day on a north facing slope to 9 3 mm day on a south facing slope at elevation of 1424 m while a great amount of solar radiation was added to the snowpack after timber harvest north facing slopes received less energy than south facing slopes while the percent reduction of shortwave radiation reaching snow on the ground by canopy type and longwave radiation by trees were independent of aspect incoming shortwave radiation was aspect dependent hence on south facing slopes shortwave radiation may exceed the longwave radiation gain from trees whereas on the north facing slopes the interception of shortwave radiation may be partly offset by longwave emission from the canopy ellis et al 2011 this led to a relatively small increase in net energy switching from control forest to clearcut on north facing slopes m and its changing magnitude from north to south facing slopes were both the greatest at medium elevation 1365 m followed by high 1424 m and low 1299 m elevations fig 11 at 1365 m δ m was 11 mm day on north facing slopes compared to 9 3 and 8 7 mm day for high and low elevation respectively medium elevation tended to have the most excessive net energy over the energy deficit of snowpack in the melting process due to the non linear relationship of elevation with incoming energy snow mass and microclimate in forest interior it could also relate to the higher temperature at medium elevation causing intensive snowmelt given critical temperature thresholds such as 1 c which is commonly used as an indicator to claim the start of spring melt lundquist et al 2004 consequently a significant increase in peak flows has been observed when logging elevation levels range from 40 to 80 of the basin whitaker et al 2002 major findings on the influences of timber harvest on snowpack dynamics based on sam simulations are as follows 1 clearcutting increased peak swe by more than two times of that for control forest on average 2 clearcutting and partial cutting on south facing slopes significantly advanced the ablation end date by as much as 13 days compared to harvest on north facing slopes 3 partial cutting at low elevation greatly shortened dsm while clearcutting at high elevation greatly lengthened dsm and 4 clearcutting on south facing slopes at medium elevation caused the most increase in m as well as generated the greatest m 3 8 spatial distribution of hsas hsas were found close to streams in lower parts of the watershed where subsurface water accumulates due to a sharp slope reduction or topographic convergence and in headwater areas fed by snowmelt on low slopes where lateral water drainage was limited fig 12 climate conditions e g total annual precipitation storm event size timing of precipitation and timber harvest significantly affected the spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture and source areas for runoff generation these hsas are examples of saturation excess overland flow occurring in this watershed which is typical for forested environments alaoui et al 2011 we analyze hsas in the following sections using the p ai hs and demonstrate the effect of harvest strategies timing location and harvest types on water yield and peak flows driven by climate and topographic conditions 3 9 climate and topographic effects on hsas as expected the fraction of the watershed defined as an hsa i e p ai hs in a wet year was much greater than in a dry year out of three years prior to timber harvest representing low medium and high average annual precipitation wy 1993 1276 mm wy 1999 1464 mm wy 1997 1965 mm wy 1997 had the largest areas with p ai hs greater than 0 01 and more than half of the areas had p ai hs greater than 0 05 fig 12 many saturated areas occurred at high elevations such as in sw1 sw2 and sw3 because these areas received more precipitation snowmelt at higher elevations typically contributed to peak runoff events during spring and early summer pederson et al 2011 grünewald et al 2014 increasing soil water storage and initiating lateral flow to lower areas areas at low elevations in the watershed south facing slopes and non riparian zones had low p ai hs because of lower precipitation input and lower peak swe especially during a relatively dry wy fig 12a and steeper slopes and thus greater hydraulic gradients soil moisture at downslope areas was mainly affected by subsurface lateral flow from upslope areas zhu et al 2014 and most of the riparian areas at downslope areas have steep slopes 25 35 with low soil moisture content moore et al 1988 liang and uchida 2014 3 10 timber harvest effects on hsas effects of timber harvest on hsas were remarkable especially under medium large precipitation events illustrated by degree of saturation maps for sw1 sw2 and sw3 at four land cover stages fig 13 before any land cover changes the watershed showed an increased degree of saturation in riparian areas at high elevation after a minor snowmelt event followed by a 57 mm rainfall event on 08 22 1992 fig 13a roads red lines in fig 13b stand out as fully saturated on a wet day in the fall of 1997 due to their minimal water storage capacity after an 85 mm precipitation event on 11 24 2004 followed by a small event on 11 28 2004 the degree of saturation of 80 occurred on logged areas in sw1 and sw2 while non logged areas only had 40 60 fig 13c clearcut areas in sw1 had a 20 greater degree of saturation than non logged areas on average under similar topographic characteristics with multiple harvest activities across the mcew an average pre storm soil moisture condition of 32 and a 45 mm precipitation event resulted in 90 degree of saturation in logged areas compared to less than 50 degree of saturation for the remaining areas fig 13d headwater regions in logged areas were near saturation under medium to large precipitation events indicating high likelihood of runoff generation clearly logging in areas with features like high elevation south facing slopes and riparian areas exaggerated the likelihood of being hsa 3 11 land cover management the predominant hydrological effect of timber harvest was reduced evaporation from interception storage as well as transpiration by trees through deep roots resulting in less evapotranspiration and more water yield this was evidenced by the different harvest locations and areas of the three harvest scenario simulations see fig 3 that all resulted in increased water yield i e total streamflow relative to pre harvest for example in sw1 clearcut the pre harvest phase wy 1992 2001 average water yield was 708 mm whereas during the post harvest treatment phase wy 2002 2013 scenario 1 47 of sw1 logged in low p ai hs resulted in 202 mm more scenario 2 47 of sw1 logged in high p ai hs resulted in 238 mm more and scenario 3 100 sw logged had the greatest average water yield of 1200 mm 492 mm more than pre harvest the trend was similar in sw2 but with much less difference between pre harvest 694 mm and scenarios 1 709 mm 2 722 mm and 3 799 mm logging in areas with high p ai hs resulted in higher peak flows in general than logging in areas with low p ai hs due to temporal redistribution of water in generating runoff this was most apparent in sw1 fig 14 a following clearcutting and less apparent in sw2 following partial cutting fig 14b clearcutting in high p ai hs areas increased maximum peak flow by 120 wy 2003 in a single rainfall event and an average of 30 higher peak flows compared to clearcutting in low p ai hs areas similar to du et al 2016 rain on snow events which occurs more in clearcut areas can significantly accelerate the snowmelt to contribute to flood events jones and perkins 2010 musselman et al 2018 however snowmelt driven events during the late ablation period tended to increase peak flows in scenario 1 wy 2008 2010 2011 and 2012 hubbart et al 2007 also observed large effects of timber harvest in the mcew during the snowmelt season in wy 2008 snowmelt driven the peak flow 05 17 2008 was the highest in scenario 1 with disproportionately large snowmelt at lower elevation because a substantial snowpack melted by high shortwave radiation under clear sky 5 15 2008 5 19 2008 in wy 2010 snowmelt and rainfall together a 36 6 mm rainfall event right after the end of snow ablation resulted in peak flow on 6 2 2010 exacerbated by near soil saturation from previous snowmelt peak flow responses to harvest scenarios suggests that logging location and timing under sensitive hydrological conditions may be used to manage peak flows and downstream flooding clearcutting in low p ai hs medium elevation areas led to higher runoff for snowmelt driven events whereas runoff tended to be higher with clearcutting in high p ai hs high elevation areas for rainfall driven events this is illustrated in fig 15 a where data points above the 1 1 line are predominantly rainfall driven events red circles indicating streamflow was greatest under scenario 2 whereas data points below the 1 1 line are predominantly snowmelt driven grey circles relatively small snowmelt events 20 mm along the 1 1 line indicate that snowmelt under scenario 1 was higher during the mar apr snowmelt season and lower during feb mar and may snowmelt season compared to scenario 2 however scenario 1 tended to generate more snowmelt than scenario 2 for some of the large snowmelt events 20 mm fig 15b which usually occurred as a result of high melt rate of substantial snowpack and strong incoming radiation this is similar to the point scale analysis in section 3 4 3 that showed clearcutting on south facing slopes at medium elevation tended to increase snowmelt the larger snowmelt events in scenario 1 compared to scenario 2 was limited to certain climate conditions in general snow at the clearcut location in sw1 disappears earlier in scenario 1 medium elevation than scenario 2 high elevation as snow accumulation energy deficit was less at lower elevation due to higher temperature less total precipitation and a lower snow versus rainfall ratio for incoming energy clearcut areas in scenario 1 were mostly south facing which received more shortwave radiation than in harvested areas in scenario 2 meanwhile longwave radiation from the sky tended to be greater with higher temperatures frequent melting caused snow albedo to be lower meaning shortwave radiation absorbed by the snowpack increased as less of it was being reflected which further accelerated melting overall the lower energy deficit of the snowpack received greater incoming energy at clearcut areas for scenario 1 leading to shorter time for ablation and moderate amount of melting due to the size of the snowpack compared to snowmelt in scenario 2 exceptions were years that still had sufficient swe in may so that snow at low p ai hs medium elevation areas with exposure to higher shortwave radiation generated a large amount of melting these results suggest that in snow dominated areas logging in the areas with low p ai hs would reduce peak flows during snowmelt seasons before solar radiation becomes strong yet increase the flood risk if there is still adequate snow pack when climate turns warmer based on our findings mixed harvest regimes planned based on p ai hs areas and climate conditions may reduce timber harvest effects on the hydrologic responses although annual water yield was positively related to timber harvest areas partial cutting in low p ai hs areas can effectively reduce the impact of timber harvest on both water yield and peak flows however for watersheds to be logged entirely over time careful planning of harvest location and timing may avoid creating harvest induced large peak flow event 4 conclusions observed streamflow collected at seven flumes in the mcew verified the impact of timber harvest on watershed hydrology both clearcutting and partial cutting caused large relative increases in annual water yield high flows at 1 of the cumulative distribution of streamflow were more sensitive to forest logging than medium 50 and low flows 90 the smr model simulated the hydrology of the mcew well based on three performance criteria pbias rmse and kge especially within the period when timber harvest effects were evaluated snowpack dynamics at the point scale revealed impacts of elevation aspect climate and timber harvest on sam process and provided a foundation for understanding the spatial effect of timber harvest on hsas sam processes essentially are the result of the interplay between internal energy deficit of the snowpack and incoming energy intensity primarily from shortwave and longwave radiation depending on climate topography and land cover peak swe in clearcut areas was twice as much as that in the control forest and resulted in long dsm at high elevation however partial cutting at medium to high elevation and clearcutting at low elevation can mitigate the impact of timber harvest on snowmelt timing as harvest on south facing slopes increased solar radiation switching land cover from forest to clearcut can dramatically increase m especially at medium elevation certain timber harvest regimes therefore can enhance large peak streamflow events forest management considering sam factors would benefit watershed response hsas play an important role in forest management due to land cover effects on hydrological processes the probability of being hydrologically sensitive p ai hs or the likelihood of runoff generation changed dramatically with climate conditions and topography most high p ai hs areas were located in headwater regions and riparian zones and expanded from upstream to downstream with increasing water input riparian buffers required along fish bearing stream reaches in the mcew were not considered in the model with high p ai hs areas mostly covering riparian zones logging these areas in the model could lead to overestimated harvest effects on streamflow patterns the p ai hs in a wet water year mostly stayed above 0 05 and these areas covered over half of the entire mcew whereas the likelihood was minimal during dry years a single considerable rainfall or snowmelt event in high p ai hs areas resulted in a significant increase in peak flows so that timing and type of harvest practice in these areas needs to be evaluated carefully annual water yield was primarily affected by logging area and logging patterns clearcutting versus partial cutting as less evapotranspiration from timber harvest increased soil water storage harvest activities potentially increased the degree of saturation by 20 in turn increasing the corresponding p ai hs peak flow was highly affected by timber harvest location and event type rainfall dominated or snowmelt dominated more extreme runoff events i e increased peak flow occurred under the harvest scenarios in high p ai hs areas than in low p ai hs areas during rainfall dominated events high p ai hs areas were in high elevation areas with greater snowpack causing large snowmelt events however during snowmelt dominated events logging in low p ai hs areas tended to have higher peak flows under certain circumstances than logging in high p ai hs such as when there was still sufficient snowpack at medium elevation as temperatures started to increase this is because medium elevation had the most excessive net total energy over internal energy deficit of the snowpack leading to high melt rates under these condition extreme snowmelt events are likely changes in land cover harvest location soil properties topography and climate together contribute to the change in hydrological patterns it is critical to balance harvest timing and location with consideration of climate condition to control factors that affect peak flows so that appropriate management plans will minimize disturbances to the watershed from our results logging in low p ai hs areas for years experiencing large rainfall events generally reduces peak flow timber harvest in high p ai hs areas preferably on north facing slopes for years with great snow accumulation can dramatically reduce extreme peak flows induced by intense spring snowmelt as limited modeling work for the mcew focused on evaluating the impact of timber harvest patterns on hydrologic responses du

4918,a concentration transport model has been formulated to characterize the transport of a mass of self propelling active particles in an unsteady wetland flow at the phase averaged scale the vertical distribution and motion of mass center are rigorously derived for an active particle cloud in the tidal wetland flow by use of the concentration moment method while the longitudinal dispersivity is calculated by means of finite difference method it is found that the distribution of total quantity of active particles in each streamline in the tidal wetland flow is identical to that in the fully developed wetland flow the velocity and longitudinal dispersivity of mass center of the active particle cloud eventually reach a stable oscillatory status for the case of tidal wetland flow rather than an asymptotic constant velocity which occurs in the steady wetland flow the effects of dimensionless parameters on the amplitude phase and period of the velocity of mass

introduction coastal wetlands are drawing increasing attention due to their tremendous benefits and functions in terms of biodiversity conservation water purification shoreline protection climate moderation etc mitsch and gosselink 1993 kadlec and knight 1996 costanza et al 1997 noor islam et al 2014 there exist an abundance of active particles in the coastal wetlands which propel themselves through the water by beating and rotating their flagella and cilia for example heterosigma akashiwo migration of active particles plays a pivotal role in the material transport energy cycle and information exchange in the basic food web also an immense variety of ecological phenomena for example the formation of red tides and thin phytoplankton layers are closely related to the migration of active particles therefore the mechanism of migration of active particles in the tidal wetland flow is essential to understand various processes and functions associated with coastal wetlands nepf 2012 wang et al 2020 yang et al 2020 there exist two types of particles in the typical wetlands namely the passive and active particles zeng et al 2019 the former refer to the particles that migrate by means of advection turbulent diffusion and sedimentation such as heavy metals plastic particles and sediment particles the latter refer to the particles that can propel themselves through the water by converting the biochemical energy stored in the cells into the mechanical energy of flagella and cilia pedley and kessler 1992 such as heterosigma akashiwo akashiwo sanguinea and prorocentrum micans schuech and menden deuer 2014 a conspicuous difference between the migration of active and passive particles lies on the fact that most active particles have active randomness and tendencies to external stimulus such us gravity light temperature salinity and nutrient concentration regarding the migration of passive particles related to the coastal wetlands numerous investigations were

understanding for the initial and long time asymptotic evolution of passive particles in various wetland flows many efforts have been performed to understand various phenomena associated with the migration of active particles in pure fluid flows kessler 1985 1986 pedley and kessler 1990 1992 lillo et al 2014 goldstein 2015 durham and stocker 2017 such as gyrotactic trapping durham et al 2009

current ardekani et al 2017 lovecchio et al 2017 and shear induced depletion of bacterial transport rusconi et al 2014 the migration of active particles in wetland flows is more complex which depends on the combined action of flowing water vegetation and motile particles very recently zeng et al 2019 presented the vertical distribution of gyrotactic micro organisms in a free water surface wetland based on the fixed concentration condition for the bed bottom and the zero flux boundary condition for the free water surface yang et al 2020 investigated the distribution of total active particles along a streamline velocity of mass center and longitudinal dispersivity of a micro organism patch however these analytical solutions only consider the migration of active particles in a fully developed steady wetland flow up to date the migration of active particles in a tidal wetland flow has not been understood well though it is quite significant for ecological conservation and restoration of typical coastal wetlands such as salt marshes mangrove swamps etc the active particles considered in this paper are gyrotactic micro organisms which are closely related to many ecological phenomena occurring in coastal wetlands including red tides which can result in massive fish killings this work is to explore the features and mechanisms of active particle migration in a tidal wetland flow the specific goals are i to formulate the migration of an active particle cloud in the wetland flow ii to obtain the distribution of total active particles in each streamline iii to determine the velocity of mass center motion and longitudinal dispersivity of the active particle cloud and iv to explore the effects of non dimensional parameters on the migration of active particles 2 formulation for the wetland flow the governing equation describing the concentration of active particles is given as follows liu et al 2005 zeng et al 2019 yang et al 2020 1 ϕ c t u u s u d c κ λ ϕ c κ k ϕ λ s c where ϕ is the porosity to reflect the density of vegetation c number of cells m 3 the superficial concentration of active particles u m s 1 the superficial flow velocity u s m s 1 the swimming velocity u d m s 1 the sedimentation velocity κ curvature factor to represent the geometric effects of flow passage at the stem scale λ m 2 s 1 the mass diffusivity k m 2 s 1 the mass dispersivity tensor to reflect the influence of the concentration differences at the stem scale on the macroscopic transport at the phase averaged scale and λ s m 2 s 1 the translational diffusivity tensor to represent the randomness of gyrotactic micro organisms the longitudinal swimming velocity approximately 1 100 μ m s 1 in general can be negligible since in most cases it is much less than the typical tidal flow velocity approximately 1 100 cm s 1 consider transport of active particles in the tidal flow through a free surface wetland with depth of h in the cartesian coordinate system as shown in fig 1 as the first step to explore the migration of active particles in the tidal wetland flow we consider an idealized tidal flow profile expressed as wu et al 2012 2 ψ ψ s ζ ψ o ζ τ 3 ψ s ζ l 1 2 sin γ l ζ γ l γ l 2 α 2 4 ψ o ζ τ l 1 2 a 1 ϖ γ l ϖ γ l 2 α 2 cos 2 π t r τ 2 π sin 2 π t r τ ϖ 2 γ l 2 α 2 2 4 π 2 where ψ is the dimensionless flow velocity scaled by the characteristic velocity u c ψ s and ψ o are the steady and oscillatory components of ψ respectively γ l l 1 2 π α dimensionless represents the comprehensive effect of the water depth vegetation friction fluid viscosity curvature of flow passage and vertical momentum dispersion on the velocity profile ϖ represents the ratio of the effective momentum diffusion to oscillation and t r dimensionless represents the ratio of the effective vertical diffusion to oscillation u c can be expressed as u c p s h 2 κ μ l zz wu et al 2012 where p s is the steady component of superficial pressure gradient l zz is the vertical momentum dispersivity and μ is the dynamic viscosity note that the velocity profile given by eq 2 is limited to the typical coastal wetlands where the water depth is much less than the horizontal width of the wetland for the case of an active particle cloud in the tidal wetland flow with the initial concentration subject to 5 c x z 0 q ϕ δ x δ z h 2 where q the number of cells is the total number of active particles and δ is the dirac delta function eq 1 can be simplified as 6 c t u t ϕ c x 1 ϕ w s w d c z κ λ λ xx s k l ϕ 2 c x 2 κ λ λ zz s k v ϕ 2 c z 2 where u m s 1 is the longitudinal flow velocity dependent of time w s m s 1 is the vertical swimming velocity w d m s 1 is the vertical settling velocity respectively λ xx s m 2 s 1 and λ zz s m 2 s 1 are the longitudinal and vertical translational diffusivity respectively and k l m 2 s 1 and k v m 2 s 1 are the longitudinal and vertical mass dispersivity respectively in contrast to the transport model of active particles presented by yang et al 2020 for an idealized two dimensional steady wetland flow eq 6 takes a periodical flow pattern into account the settling velocity of active particles due to the density difference of water and micro organisms has also been included in eq 6 therefore the vertical flux of active particles in the present work is balanced by the following dynamic processes including swimming sedimentation and translational diffusion of active particles superficial mass dispersion due to wetland flow as well as molecular diffusion the zero flux boundary conditions for concentration of active particles at the free surface and bed bottom read as 7 w s w d c ϕ κ λ λ zz s k v ϕ c z z 0 h 0 eq 7 means that no active particles enter or leave the tidal flow through the water air or water wall interfaces since the number of active particles is limited at the initial time we can specify the concentration boundary conditions at x as 8 c z t 0 with dimensionless parameters defined as 9 ω ch 2 ϕ q τ κ λ λ zz s k v ϕ t h 2 ξ x u t ϕ h ζ z h φ v w s w d u c where u is the double averaged flow velocity over the water depth and an oscillatory period t eq 6 can be rewritten as 10 ω τ pe ψ ω ξ pe φ v ω ζ d l r 2 ω ξ 2 2 ω ζ 2 where 11 pe u c h κ λ zz s λ k v ϕ ϕ d l r λ xx s λ k l ϕ λ zz s λ k v ϕ ψ ψ ψ pe is the péclet number to represent the relative strength of active particle migration contributed by advection and total vertical mass dispersion d l r is the ratio of the total longitudinal diffusivity to the total vertical diffusivity and ψ is the deviation of the non dimensional flow velocity ψ with respect to ψ with operators of and for any variable f defined as 12 f 0 1 f d ζ f 0 1 f d τ respectively by use of eqs 9 and 11 we have dimensionless boundary and initial conditions as follows 13 pe φ v ω ω ζ ζ 0 0 pe φ v ω ω ζ ζ 1 0 14 ω ζ 0 0 ω ζ 0 0 15 ω ξ ζ 0 δ ξ δ ζ 1 2 since the concentration of active particles decays exponentially at ξ ω ξ ζ τ satisfies aris 1956 yang et al 2020 16 ξ i ω ξ 0 ξ i ω ξ ξ 0 i 0 1 2 3 mass distribution of an active particle cloud the concentration moment method initially presented by aris 1956 for analyzing the dispersion of solutes in the flow through a tube has been adopted extensively for the analysis on dispersion of passive and active particles in various wetland flows chen et al 2010 zeng et al 2014 yang et al 2020 according to the work by aris 1956 the pth concentration moment of active particle distribution is defined as follows 17 m p ζ τ ω ξ ζ τ ξ p d ξ p 0 1 2 for ecological conservation and assessments associated with the migration of active particles in typical tidal wetland flows the zeroth first and second concentration moments can provide enough information for transport of the active particle cloud which reflects the total quantity motion of gravity center and spreading rate of an active particle cloud respectively applying the operation d ξ for eqs 10 13 and 15 with the aid of eqs 14 and 16 yields the definite problem 18 m 0 τ pe φ v m 0 ζ 2 m 0 ζ 2 19 pe φ v m 0 m 0 ζ ζ 0 0 pe φ v m 0 m 0 ζ ζ 1 0 20 m 0 ζ 0 δ ζ 1 2 which is equivalent to that for the fully developed wetland flow yang et al 2020 therefore the distribution of total quantity of active particles in each streamline is independent of the oscillatory components of the tidal flow as shown in fig 2 the solution of the zeroth concentration moment was derived by yang et al 2020 21 m 0 ζ τ c 0 exp pe φ v ζ n 1 c n sin n π ζ 2 n π pe φ v cos n π ζ exp pe φ v ζ 2 exp 4 n

particle distribution depends on the combined action of the mass dispersion translational diffusion mean swimming and sedimentation in the vertical direction the convective transport contributed by the wetland flow has no effects on the total quantity of active particles over the streamline 4 motion of mass center of an active particle cloud applying the operation ξ d ξ for eqs 10 13 and 15 we have 24 m 1 τ pe φ v m 1 ζ 2 m 1 ζ 2 pe ψ ζ τ m 0 25 pe φ v m 1 m 1 ζ ζ 0 0 pe φ v m 1 m 1 ζ ζ 1 0 26 m 1 ζ 0 0 according to eq 24 the first moment of active particle distribution depends on the combined action of advection and vertical mass dispersion governed by the wetland flow as well as the translational diffusion the mean vertical swimming and sedimentation contributed by the self propelling active particles pe ψ ζ τ m 0 is the driving source to generate the ultimately stable variation of the first moment the governing equation of active particle transport for the steady wetland flow yang et al 2020 can be included by eq 24 as a limiting case of ψ changing only with the vertical position the solution of m 1 ζ τ is rigorously derived by means of the method of separation of variables see the detailed derivation in appendix a as follows 27 m 1 ζ τ 0 τ d 00 ζ τ τ τ exp pe φ v ζ n 1 d 0 n ζ τ τ exp pe φ v ζ χ n τ r 1 d r 0 ζ τ τ β r ζ exp pe φ v 2 ζ χ r τ r 1

35 χ n τ exp 4 n 2 π 2 pe φ v 2 4 τ n 1 2 the velocity of the mass center of the active particle cloud can be expressed as aris 1956 yang et al 2020 36 v c 1 m 0 2 m 1 τ m 0 m 0 τ m 1 as shown in fig 3 the mass center of the active particle cloud undergoes two stages namely the initial stage and the stable oscillatory stage the former is mainly affected by the initial distribution of active particles while the latter is independent of the initial concentration distribution fig 4 presents the variation of v c with τ at ζ 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 0 9 for ϖ 1 0 pe 10 0 a 1 10 0 t r 1 0 and α 1 0 it is shown that the effects of initial concentration distribution on v c is mainly confined to the first oscillatory period the oscillatory amplitude of v c increases with ζ which means that the motion of mass center is relatively strong at the free water surface however the oscillatory period of the mass center is independent of the vertical position the amplitude of moving velocity of the mass center increases with the increase of a 1 while the period and phase of v c are independent of a 1 as shown in fig 5 which implies that the strength of the tidal flow only influences the speed of mass center of the active particle cloud the moving velocity of the mass center of the active particle cloud in the fully developed free surface wetland flow can be included as a limiting case of a 1 0 the large α can weaken the amplitude of moving velocity of the mass center as shown in fig 6 the period and phase of v c is independent of α in the stable oscillatory stage pe can influence both the amplitude and phase of v c as shown in fig 7 the large pe can enhance the amplitude of v c the oscillatory period of the mass center of active particles decreases with the increase of t r as shown in fig 8 5 longitudinal dispersion of an active particle cloud applying the operation ξ 2 d ξ for eqs 10 13 and 15 with the aid of eqs 14 and 16 we have 37 m 2 τ pe φ v m 2 ζ 2 m 2 ζ 2 2 pe ψ ζ τ m 1 2 m 0 d l r 38 pe φ v m 2 m 2 ζ ζ 0 0 pe φ v m 2 m 2 ζ ζ 1 0 39 m 2 ζ 0 0 differing from the first moment the second moment of active particle distribution also depends on the relative strength of the total longitudinal mass dispersion and the total vertical dispersion besides the combined action of advection vertical mass dispersion translational diffusion mean vertical swimming and sedimentation the governing equation of active particle transport in the fully developed wetland flow yang et al 2020 can be included as a case of ψ independent of time according to eqs 37 39 the second moment is related to a 1 α pe and t r since the complexity of the zeroth and first moments it is quite difficult to get the explicit expression of m 2 ζ τ in this work the finite difference method with time marching of euler scheme is used to solve eqs 37 39 and then to explore the effects of dimensionless parameters on the longitudinal dispersivity which can be calculated as aris 1956 yang et al 2020 40 d ζ τ 1 2 d d τ m 2 m 0 m 1 2 m 0 2 fig 9 presents the variation of d with ζ and τ for pe 1 0 α 1 0 a 1 10 t r 1 0 and ϖ 1 0 it is shown that the longitudinal dispersivity cannot reach an asymptotic value as it does in the fully developed wetland flow instead d would reach a stable oscillatory status in the tidal flow through a wetland the effect of initial distribution of active particles on the longitudinal dispersion is mainly limited to the first oscillatory period the amplitude of d near the free water surface obviously differs from that near the bed bottom as shown in fig 10 the increase of a 1 can enhance the amplitude of d as shown in fig 11 which means that the spreading rate of an active particle cloud increases with an increasing tidal flow a 1 does not influence the oscillatory period and phase for the limiting case of a 1 0 d ultimately tends to a constant the amplitude of d decreases with the increase of α as shown in fig 12 similar to the parameter a 1 α does not affect the oscillatory period and phase of d it is found that the phase of d does not change monotonically with pe as shown in fig 13 the negative d may occur for the case of large pe in contrast to the positive longitudinal dispersivity for the steady wetland flow yang et al 2020 the negative longitudinal dispersivity was also observed for the transport of passive particles in the tidal wetland flow zeng et al 2012 it is also found that the period of d decreases with the increase of t r as shown in fig 14 6 discussion in this work we analyzed the transport of active particles in the tidal wetland flow combining a concentration transport model the concentration moment method and the finite difference method regarding the migration of an active particle cloud in the tidal wetland flow there exist four time scales t t l ρ h 2 κ μ l zz t k h 2 κ λ k v ϕ λ zz s and t u h u c t l represents the characteristic time of vertical momentum dispersion through the whole water depth t k represents the characteristic time required by the vertical non uniformity of active particles cloud being smeared out by molecular diffusion vertical mass dispersion and translational diffusion and t u stands for the necessary time for the active particles across the whole water depth by vertical advection with u c the dimensionless parameters to influence the transport of active particles in the tidal wetland flow include a 1 α d l r ϖ p e and t r there exist many discussions on the data source related to the estimation of input parameters a 1 α and d l r chen et al 2010 wu et al 2012 zeng et al 2012 and in this work we mainly focus on the model parameters ϖ p e and t r according to wu et al 2012 ϖ is defined as ϖ κ μ l zz t ρ h 2 t t l μ and ρ reflect the physical properties of water which cannot change too much for water bodies in a specified coastal region for the tidal wetlands water depth is generally several meters and the flow period t depends on the local tidal patterns the semidiurnal tide pattern diurnal tide pattern or the mixed tide pattern κ reflects the effect of flow passage curvature at the stem scale on superficial flow at the phase averaged scale l zz represents the vertical momentum dispersion due to the inhomogeneity of flow caused by the existence of vegetation which is related to the reynolds number re d ud ν where u is the typical flow velocity at the stem scale d is the equivalent diameter of vegetation stem and ν is the kinematic viscosity coefficient of water zeng and chen 2011 estimated the values of l zz 0 142 kg m s 1 and κ 0 95 dimensionless for a typical wetland flow based on the dynamics of porous media the dimensionless parameter p e t k t u is determined by h λ ϕ κ u c k v and λ zz s for the migration of active particles h represents the characteristic length of particle transport in the vertical direction λ reflects the stochastic motion of water molecules ϕ reflects the density of vegetation and κ can be estimated based on the empirical formula κ ϕ liu et al 2005 the vertical mass dispersivity k v is determined by λ ϕ and the péclet number at the stem scale pe d ud λ zeng et al 2012 estimated the value of k v 1 85 10 3 m 2 s 1 for a typical steady wetland flow based on an empirical formula for gyrotactic micro organisms λ zz s is influenced by cells shape the deviation of mass center of the cell body and its buoyancy center and the vorticity of ambient flow other external conditions such as the light intensity nutrient concentration and temperature can also influence the translational diffusion of active particles yang et al 2020 calculated the value of λ zz s 1 49 10 8 m 2 s 1 for heterosigma akashiwo in a wetland flow t r h 2 κ λ k v ϕ λ zz s t t k t reflects the ratio of the characteristic time required for the vertical non uniformity of an active particle cloud being smeared out by molecular diffusion vertical mass dispersion and translational diffusion to the tidal period for most cases λ k v ϕ and λ λ zz s t r can be simplified as h 2 κ k v ϕ λ zz s t 7 conclusions a concentration transport model has been formulated to describe the migration of a cloud of self propelling active particles in the tidal wetland flow the vertical distribution and motion of mass center are rigorously derived for an active particle cloud by use of the concentration moment method while the longitudinal dispersivity is calculated by means of finite difference method the effects of characteristic parameters on the amplitude phase and period of the velocity of mass center and longitudinal dispersivity are examined in detail it is found that the total quantity of the active particle cloud does not oscillate for the tidal wetland flow which means that the oscillatory velocity does not influence the distribution of total quantity of active particles in each streamline the motion of mass center of the active particle cloud eventually reaches a stable oscillatory status for the tidal wetland flow the increase of a 1 and pe can enhance the amplitude of v c while the increase of α can weaken it the longitudinal dispersion of active particles has been analyzed by use of the finite difference method it is shown that the longitudinal dispersivity ultimately reaches a stable oscillatory status the increase of a 1 and decrease of α can enhance the amplitude of d the phase and period of d are mainly determined by pe and t r respectively differing from the constant positive d for the fully developed flow the negative d may occur for the case of large a 1 the analytical solution presented in this work is limited to the dilute suspension of micro organisms with weak changes of the cell body such as heterosigma akashiwo chlamydomonas reinhardtii and dinoflagellates in the shallow wetland flow dominated by the emergent rigid vegetation where the effects of waves can be neglected there are some interesting issues deserving to investigate in the future including the laboratory and field observations of active particles transport in the typical wetland flows extension of mathematical models from a single zone or single layer wetland to multi

bio convection triggered by cells accumulation pedley and kessler 1990 vincent and hill 1996 hwang and pedley 2014 micro scale patches in turbulence durham et al 2013 active migration strategy stimulated by turbulence sengupta et al 2017 dispersion and accumulation bearon et al 2011 2012 croze et al 2013 2017 dehkharghania et al 2019 jiang and chen 2019 2020 migration in a stratified current ardekani et al 2017 lovecchio et al 2017 and shear induced depletion of bacterial transport rusconi et al 2014 the migration of active particles in wetland flows is more complex which depends on the combined action of flowing water vegetation and motile particles very recently zeng et al 2019 presented the vertical distribution of gyrotactic micro organisms in a free water surface wetland based on the fixed concentration condition for the bed bottom and the zero flux boundary condition for the free water surface yang et al 2020 investigated the distribution of total active particles along a streamline velocity of mass center and longitudinal dispersivity of a micro organism patch however these analytical solutions only consider the migration of active particles in a fully developed steady wetland flow up to date the migration of active particles in a tidal wetland flow has not been understood well though it is quite significant for ecological conservation and restoration of typical coastal wetlands such as salt marshes mangrove swamps etc the active particles considered in this paper are gyrotactic micro organisms which are closely related to many ecological phenomena occurring in coastal wetlands including red tides which can result in massive fish killings this work is to explore the features and mechanisms of active particle migration in a tidal wetland flow the specific goals are i to formulate the migration of an active particle cloud in the wetland flow ii to obtain the distribution of total active particles in each streamline iii to determine the velocity of mass center motion and longitudinal dispersivity of the active particle cloud and iv to explore the effects of non dimensional parameters on the migration of active particles 2 formulation for the wetland flow the governing equation describing the concentration of active particles is given as follows liu et al 2005 zeng et al 2019 yang et al 2020 1 ϕ c t u u s u d c κ λ ϕ c κ k ϕ λ s c where ϕ is the porosity to reflect the density of vegetation c number of cells m 3 the superficial concentration of active particles u m s 1 the superficial flow velocity u s m s 1 the swimming velocity u d m s 1 the sedimentation velocity κ curvature factor to represent the geometric effects of flow passage at the stem scale λ m 2 s 1 the mass diffusivity k m 2 s 1 the mass dispersivity tensor to reflect the influence of the concentration differences at the stem scale on the macroscopic transport at the phase averaged scale and λ s m 2 s 1 the translational diffusivity tensor to represent the randomness of gyrotactic micro organisms the longitudinal swimming velocity approximately 1 100 μ m s 1 in general can be negligible since in most cases it is much less than the typical tidal flow velocity approximately 1 100 cm s 1 consider transport of active particles in the tidal flow through a free surface wetland with depth of h in the cartesian coordinate system as shown in fig 1 as the first step to explore the migration of active particles in the tidal wetland flow we consider an idealized tidal flow profile expressed as wu et al 2012 2 ψ ψ s ζ ψ o ζ τ 3 ψ s ζ l 1 2 sin γ l ζ γ l γ l 2 α 2 4 ψ o ζ τ l 1 2 a 1 ϖ γ l ϖ γ l 2 α 2 cos 2 π t r τ 2 π sin 2 π t r τ ϖ 2 γ l 2 α 2 2 4 π 2 where ψ is the dimensionless flow velocity scaled by the characteristic velocity u c ψ s and ψ o are the steady and oscillatory components of ψ respectively γ l l 1 2 π α dimensionless represents the comprehensive effect of the water depth vegetation friction fluid viscosity curvature of flow passage and vertical momentum dispersion on the velocity profile ϖ represents the ratio of the effective momentum diffusion to oscillation and t r dimensionless represents the ratio of the effective vertical diffusion to oscillation u c can be expressed as u c p s h 2 κ μ l zz wu et al 2012 where p s is the steady component of superficial pressure gradient l zz is the vertical momentum dispersivity and μ is the dynamic viscosity note that the velocity profile given by eq 2 is limited to the typical coastal wetlands where the water depth is much less than the horizontal width of the wetland for the case of an active particle cloud in the tidal wetland flow with the initial concentration subject to 5 c x z 0 q ϕ δ x δ z h 2 where q the number of cells is the total number of active particles and δ is the dirac delta function eq 1 can be simplified as 6 c t u t ϕ c x 1 ϕ w s w d c z κ λ λ xx s k l ϕ 2 c x 2 κ λ λ zz s k v ϕ 2 c z 2 where u m s 1 is the longitudinal flow velocity dependent of time w s m s 1 is the vertical swimming velocity w d m s 1 is the vertical settling velocity respectively λ xx s m 2 s 1 and λ zz s m 2 s 1 are the longitudinal and vertical translational diffusivity respectively and k l m 2 s 1 and k v m 2 s 1 are the longitudinal and vertical mass dispersivity respectively in contrast to the transport model of active particles presented by yang et al 2020 for an idealized two dimensional steady wetland flow eq 6 takes a periodical flow pattern into account the settling velocity of active particles due to the density difference of water and micro organisms has also been included in eq 6 therefore the vertical flux of active particles in the present work is balanced by the following dynamic processes including swimming sedimentation and translational diffusion of active particles superficial mass dispersion due to wetland flow as well as molecular diffusion the zero flux boundary conditions for concentration of active particles at the free surface and bed bottom read as 7 w s w d c ϕ κ λ λ zz s k v ϕ c z z 0 h 0 eq 7 means that no active particles enter or leave the tidal flow through the water air or water wall interfaces since the number of active particles is limited at the initial time we can specify the concentration boundary conditions at x as 8 c z t 0 with dimensionless parameters defined as 9 ω ch 2 ϕ q τ κ λ λ zz s k v ϕ t h 2 ξ x u t ϕ h ζ z h φ v w s w d u c where u is the double averaged flow velocity over the water depth and an oscillatory period t eq 6 can be rewritten as 10 ω τ pe ψ ω ξ pe φ v ω ζ d l r 2 ω ξ 2 2 ω ζ 2 where 11 pe u c h κ λ zz s λ k v ϕ ϕ d l r λ xx s λ k l ϕ λ zz s λ k v ϕ ψ ψ ψ pe is the péclet number to represent the relative strength of active particle migration contributed by advection and total vertical mass dispersion d l r is the ratio of the total longitudinal diffusivity to the total vertical diffusivity and ψ is the deviation of the non dimensional flow velocity ψ with respect to ψ with operators of and for any variable f defined as 12 f 0 1 f d ζ f 0 1 f d τ respectively by use of eqs 9 and 11 we have dimensionless boundary and initial conditions as follows 13 pe φ v ω ω ζ ζ 0 0 pe φ v ω ω ζ ζ 1 0 14 ω ζ 0 0 ω ζ 0 0 15 ω ξ ζ 0 δ ξ δ ζ 1 2 since the concentration of active particles decays exponentially at ξ ω ξ ζ τ satisfies aris 1956 yang et al 2020 16 ξ i ω ξ 0 ξ i ω ξ ξ 0 i 0 1 2 3 mass distribution of an active particle cloud the concentration moment method initially presented by aris 1956 for analyzing the dispersion of solutes in the flow through a tube has been adopted extensively for the analysis on dispersion of passive and active particles in various wetland flows chen et al 2010 zeng et al 2014 yang et al 2020 according to the work by aris 1956 the pth concentration moment of active particle distribution is defined as follows 17 m p ζ τ ω ξ ζ τ ξ p d ξ p 0 1 2 for ecological conservation and assessments associated with the migration of active particles in typical tidal wetland flows the zeroth first and second concentration moments can provide enough information for transport of the active particle cloud which reflects the total quantity motion of gravity center and spreading rate of an active particle cloud respectively applying the operation d ξ for eqs 10 13 and 15 with the aid of eqs 14 and 16 yields the definite problem 18 m 0 τ pe φ v m 0 ζ 2 m 0 ζ 2 19 pe φ v m 0 m 0 ζ ζ 0 0 pe φ v m 0 m 0 ζ ζ 1 0 20 m 0 ζ 0 δ ζ 1 2 which is equivalent to that for the fully developed wetland flow yang et al 2020 therefore the distribution of total quantity of active particles in each streamline is independent of the oscillatory components of the tidal flow as shown in fig 2 the solution of the zeroth concentration moment was derived by yang et al 2020 21 m 0 ζ τ c 0 exp pe φ v ζ n 1 c n sin n π ζ 2 n π pe φ v cos n π ζ exp pe φ v ζ 2 exp 4 n

particle distribution depends on the combined action of the mass dispersion translational diffusion mean swimming and sedimentation in the vertical direction the convective transport contributed by the wetland flow has no effects on the total quantity of active particles over the streamline 4 motion of mass center of an active particle cloud applying the operation ξ d ξ for eqs 10 13 and 15 we have 24 m 1 τ pe φ v m 1 ζ 2 m 1 ζ 2 pe ψ ζ τ m 0 25 pe φ v m 1 m 1 ζ ζ 0 0 pe φ v m 1 m 1 ζ ζ 1 0 26 m 1 ζ 0 0 according to eq 24 the first moment of active particle distribution depends on the combined action of advection and vertical mass dispersion governed by the wetland flow as well as the translational diffusion the mean vertical swimming and sedimentation contributed by the self propelling active particles pe ψ ζ τ m 0 is the driving source to generate the ultimately stable variation of the first moment the governing equation of active particle transport for the steady wetland flow yang et al 2020 can be included by eq 24 as a limiting case of ψ changing only with the vertical position the solution of m 1 ζ τ is rigorously derived by means of the method of separation of variables see the detailed derivation in appendix a as follows 27 m 1 ζ τ 0 τ d 00 ζ τ τ τ exp pe φ v ζ n 1 d 0 n ζ τ τ exp pe φ v ζ χ n τ r 1 d r 0 ζ τ τ β r ζ exp pe φ v 2 ζ χ r τ r 1

35 χ n τ exp 4 n 2 π 2 pe φ v 2 4 τ n 1 2 the velocity of the mass center of the active particle cloud can be expressed as aris 1956 yang et al 2020 36 v c 1 m 0 2 m 1 τ m 0 m 0 τ m 1 as shown in fig 3 the mass center of the active particle cloud undergoes two stages namely the initial stage and the stable oscillatory stage the former is mainly affected by the initial distribution of active particles while the latter is independent of the initial concentration distribution fig 4 presents the variation of v c with τ at ζ 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 0 9 for ϖ 1 0 pe 10 0 a 1 10 0 t r 1 0 and α 1 0 it is shown that the effects of initial concentration distribution on v c is mainly confined to the first oscillatory period the oscillatory amplitude of v c increases with ζ which means that the motion of mass center is relatively strong at the free water surface however the oscillatory period of the mass center is independent of the vertical position the amplitude of moving velocity of the mass center increases with the increase of a 1 while the period and phase of v c are independent of a 1 as shown in fig 5 which implies that the strength of the tidal flow only influences the speed of mass center of the active particle cloud the moving velocity of the mass center of the active particle cloud in the fully developed free surface wetland flow can be included as a limiting case of a 1 0 the large α can weaken the amplitude of moving velocity of the mass center as shown in fig 6 the period and phase of v c is independent of α in the stable oscillatory stage pe can influence both the amplitude and phase of v c as shown in fig 7 the large pe can enhance the amplitude of v c the oscillatory period of the mass center of active particles decreases with the increase of t r as shown in fig 8 5 longitudinal dispersion of an active particle cloud applying the operation ξ 2 d ξ for eqs 10 13 and 15 with the aid of eqs 14 and 16 we have 37 m 2 τ pe φ v m 2 ζ 2 m 2 ζ 2 2 pe ψ ζ τ m 1 2 m 0 d l r 38 pe φ v m 2 m 2 ζ ζ 0 0 pe φ v m 2 m 2 ζ ζ 1 0 39 m 2 ζ 0 0 differing from the first moment the second moment of active particle distribution also depends on the relative strength of the total longitudinal mass dispersion and the total vertical dispersion besides the combined action of advection vertical mass dispersion translational diffusion mean vertical swimming and sedimentation the governing equation of active particle transport in the fully developed wetland flow yang et al 2020 can be included as a case of ψ independent of time according to eqs 37 39 the second moment is related to a 1 α pe and t r since the complexity of the zeroth and first moments it is quite difficult to get the explicit expression of m 2 ζ τ in this work the finite difference method with time marching of euler scheme is used to solve eqs 37 39 and then to explore the effects of dimensionless parameters on the longitudinal dispersivity which can be calculated as aris 1956 yang et al 2020 40 d ζ τ 1 2 d d τ m 2 m 0 m 1 2 m 0 2 fig 9 presents the variation of d with ζ and τ for pe 1 0 α 1 0 a 1 10 t r 1 0 and ϖ 1 0 it is shown that the longitudinal dispersivity cannot reach an asymptotic value as it does in the fully developed wetland flow instead d would reach a stable oscillatory status in the tidal flow through a wetland the effect of initial distribution of active particles on the longitudinal dispersion is mainly limited to the first oscillatory period the amplitude of d near the free water surface obviously differs from that near the bed bottom as shown in fig 10 the increase of a 1 can enhance the amplitude of d as shown in fig 11 which means that the spreading rate of an active particle cloud increases with an increasing tidal flow a 1 does not influence the oscillatory period and phase for the limiting case of a 1 0 d ultimately tends to a constant the amplitude of d decreases with the increase of α as shown in fig 12 similar to the parameter a 1 α does not affect the oscillatory period and phase of d it is found that the phase of d does not change monotonically with pe as shown in fig 13 the negative d may occur for the case of large pe in contrast to the positive longitudinal dispersivity for the steady wetland flow yang et al 2020 the negative longitudinal dispersivity was also observed for the transport of passive particles in the tidal wetland flow zeng et al 2012 it is also found that the period of d decreases with the increase of t r as shown in fig 14 6 discussion in this work we analyzed the transport of active particles in the tidal wetland flow combining a concentration transport model the concentration moment method and the finite difference method regarding the migration of an active particle cloud in the tidal wetland flow there exist four time scales t t l ρ h 2 κ μ l zz t k h 2 κ λ k v ϕ λ zz s and t u h u c t l represents the characteristic time of vertical momentum dispersion through the whole water depth t k represents the characteristic time required by the vertical non uniformity of active particles cloud being smeared out by molecular diffusion vertical mass dispersion and translational diffusion and t u stands for the necessary time for the active particles across the whole water depth by vertical advection with u c the dimensionless parameters to influence the transport of active particles in the tidal wetland flow include a 1 α d l r ϖ p e and t r there exist many discussions on the data source related to the estimation of input parameters a 1 α and d l r chen et al 2010 wu et al 2012 zeng et al 2012 and in this work we mainly focus on the model parameters ϖ p e and t r according to wu et al 2012 ϖ is defined as ϖ κ μ l zz t ρ h 2 t t l μ and ρ reflect the physical properties of water which cannot change too much for water bodies in a specified coastal region for the tidal wetlands water depth is generally several meters and the flow period t depends on the local tidal patterns the semidiurnal tide pattern diurnal tide pattern or the mixed tide pattern κ reflects the effect of flow passage curvature at the stem scale on superficial flow at the phase averaged scale l zz represents the vertical momentum dispersion due to the inhomogeneity of flow caused by the existence of vegetation which is related to the reynolds number re d ud ν where u is the typical flow velocity at the stem scale d is the equivalent diameter of vegetation stem and ν is the kinematic viscosity coefficient of water zeng and chen 2011 estimated the values of l zz 0 142 kg m s 1 and κ 0 95 dimensionless for a typical wetland flow based on the dynamics of porous media the dimensionless parameter p e t k t u is determined by h λ ϕ κ u c k v and λ zz s for the migration of active particles h represents the characteristic length of particle transport in the vertical direction λ reflects the stochastic motion of water molecules ϕ reflects the density of vegetation and κ can be estimated based on the empirical formula κ ϕ liu et al 2005 the vertical mass dispersivity k v is determined by λ ϕ and the péclet number at the stem scale pe d ud λ zeng et al 2012 estimated the value of k v 1 85 10 3 m 2 s 1 for a typical steady wetland flow based on an empirical formula for gyrotactic micro organisms λ zz s is influenced by cells shape the deviation of mass center of the cell body and its buoyancy center and the vorticity of ambient flow other external conditions such as the light intensity nutrient concentration and temperature can also influence the translational diffusion of active particles yang et al 2020 calculated the value of λ zz s 1 49 10 8 m 2 s 1 for heterosigma akashiwo in a wetland flow t r h 2 κ λ k v ϕ λ zz s t t k t reflects the ratio of the characteristic time required for the vertical non uniformity of an active particle cloud being smeared out by molecular diffusion vertical mass dispersion and translational diffusion to the tidal period for most cases λ k v ϕ and λ λ zz s t r can be simplified as h 2 κ k v ϕ λ zz s t 7 conclusions a concentration transport model has been formulated to describe the migration of a cloud of self propelling active particles in the tidal wetland flow the vertical distribution and motion of mass center are rigorously derived for an active particle cloud by use of the concentration moment method while the longitudinal dispersivity is calculated by means of finite difference method the effects of characteristic parameters on the amplitude phase and period of the velocity of mass center and longitudinal dispersivity are examined in detail it is found that the total quantity of the active particle cloud does not oscillate for the tidal wetland flow which means that the oscillatory velocity does not influence the distribution of total quantity of active particles in each streamline the motion of mass center of the active particle cloud eventually reaches a stable oscillatory status for the tidal wetland flow the increase of a 1 and pe can enhance the amplitude of v c while the increase of α can weaken it the longitudinal dispersion of active particles has been analyzed by use of the finite difference method it is shown that the longitudinal dispersivity ultimately reaches a stable oscillatory status the increase of a 1 and decrease of α can enhance the amplitude of d the phase and period of d are mainly determined by pe and t r respectively differing from the constant positive d for the fully developed flow the negative d may occur for the case of large a 1 the analytical solution presented in this work is limited to the dilute suspension of micro organisms with weak changes of the cell body such as heterosigma akashiwo chlamydomonas reinhardtii and dinoflagellates in the shallow wetland flow dominated by the emergent rigid vegetation where the effects of waves can be neglected there are some interesting issues deserving to investigate in the future including the laboratory and field observations of active particles transport in the typical wetland flows extension of mathematical models from a single zone or single layer wetland to multi zones and multi layers wetland as well as the effects of swimming behaviors on the hydrodynamic stability of various wetland flows declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

4919,the future climate change predicts higher drought risks in deteriorating the functions and services of dryland ecosystems interpreting the sensitivity of ecosystem water use efficiency wue to aridity could provide important environmental implications to water conservation and carbon budgets of drylands the effects of temporal aridity changes on wue in semi arid ecosystems particularly in meadow steppes have been poorly investigated in this study we used eddy covariance data from two representative temperate meadows on mongolian plateau changling 2007 2015 china and bayan 2014 2018 mongolia to understand the inter and intra annual changes of wue by evaporative fraction ef as well as the climatic and biotic controls on gross ecosystem production gep evapotranspiration et and partitioned evaporation t and transpiration e results showed that the response of annual wue to ef was positive in changling meadow with dry atmosphere but insignificant in bayan with cold climate the contrasting wues were driven by divergent gep and et responses to ef in two meadows monthly t et increased linearly with ef in both meadows but logarithmically with leaf area index lai bayan and changling meadows had a similar instantaneous wue wuep gep t that were insensitive to ef change we also found that the frequency of growing season precipitation affected wue at both sites we conclude that contrasting gep responses to ef determined the meadow wue variations the magnitude and changes in transpiration and evaporation provide further insights on the biophysical regulations i e lai of ecosystem water use and wuep this study indicated that differences in ecosystem water yield soil water status and sensitivities of gep and et partitioning jointly contributed to the divergent wue at

ecosystem water use efficiency wue defined in this study as the ratio of carbon gained i e gross ecosystem production gep to water loss i e evapotranspiration et or transpiration t is a key measure of water carbon coupling for an ecosystem beer et al 2010 farquhar and sharkey 1982 guerrieri et al 2019 the magnitude and changes of wue can provide insights into ecosystem responses to environmental changes including disturbances eamus 1991 peñuelas et al 2011 especially in arid and semi arid regions where water is the most crucial element determining ecosystem composition structure and function chen et al 2013 jaeger et al 2017 recent studies on wue at the global scale show that grassland wue is more sensitive to changes in hydro climatic conditions and disturbances than other terrestrial ecosystems ainsworth and rogers 2007 badr et al 2012 kwon et al 2017 livingston et al 1999 resulting in high spatiotemporal variations in biophysical processes or complex responses to multiple factors huang et al 2016 reichstein et al 2002 wue based on the algorithm gpp et varies from 0 5 gc kg 1 h2o to 6 0 gc kg 1 h2o globally ito and inatomi 2012 xue et al 2015 with wue of grasslands ranging between 0 5 and 4 0 gc kg 1 h2o brümmer et al 2012 ito and inatomi 2012 the studies that established this baseline were mostly based on remote sensing estimates or modeling of gpp and et that often have large data gaps in arid and semi arid regions because of low vegetation cover and or leaf area huang et al 2017 tian et al 2011 a small number of in situ ground observations and experimental studies exist but these are mostly from north america and europe the eurasian temperate zone where the largest grasslands on earth s surface stretch from the mongolia plateau to the mediterranean sea has been rarely studied except in inner mongolia of china due mostly to lack of field measurement facilities e g absence of eddy covariance towers from central mongolia to israel chen et al 2020 nonetheless limited research indicates that drought severity due to reduced precipitation high temperature e g heatwaves or a combination of both increases wue in semi arid grasslands but decreases wue in semi humid ones ito and inatomi 2012 another consensus on grassland wue is that land use cover change e g grazing hay harvesting can cause significant changes in wue which in turn will have direct consequences on ecosystem stability and other resource use efficiency bai et al 2004 han et al 2016 lauenroth et al 2000 ponce campos et al 2013 meadow steppes differ from other steppe types in the eurasian temperate climate zone in that they have a relatively high abundance of water resources being the transitional and intrazonal vegetation type between forest wetland and typical steppes meadow steppes account for 18 9 of total grassland area in the mongolian plateau with a scattered distribution area largely shrunk by poor grassland management and erratic changes in climate freeze thaw and runoff unlike typical or desert steppes meadow steppes are mainly composed of mesoxerophilous perennial herbaceous species which are higher in biodiversity and primary productivity and these generate unique rich humus soils with recurring oxidation reduction reactions guo et al 2012 the soil plant and soil water status make up the water dependent ecosystem functions in meadow steppes therefore understanding the influences of temporal changes in dryness wetness and water balance on ecological processes e g carbon sequestration is especially important to the study of ecosystem functions and development of meadow ecosystems in recent decades ecosystem production and et in temperate meadow steppes has increased as a result of stable or slightly increased precipitation and warming climate on the mongolian plateau john et al 2018 albeit increasing droughts heatwaves and anthropogenic pressures can substantially change gep et and wue unfortunately the spatial and temporal changes of wue and the underlying regulatory mechanisms e g due to aridity have not been explored for these valuable steppes consequently long term continuous and in situ observations of carbon water exchanges are needed in dominant meadow types e g typical meadow to investigate the effects of dryness on wue and underlying mechanisms on the mongolian plateau in 2006 and 2013 our team installed eddy covariance ec flux towers at representative typical meadow steppes in eastern inner mongolia and central mongolia respectively to fill the data gaps in the global fluxnet network these two flux towers have collected years of valuable and rare carbon and water flux data to facilitate comparative and mechanistic studies of typical meadow steppes on the mongolian plateau based on the long term data here for the first time we report our findings of wue dynamics under different hydro climate conditions e g wet dry normal years and from hourly to multiple year scales because water is the most significant driving factor we also focused on the changes in wue with aridity before a comprehensive analysis of all potential drivers direct or indirect through structural equation modeling sem we hypothesize that aridity can be used as a key indicator for explaining the temporal changes of wue our initial steps include the interdependence of wue with major hydro climatic variables that either are part of aridity calculations e g precipitation or have direct casual relationships e g soil water storage because gep is a direct result of plant photosynthesis it is also important to examine coupled changes of wue with the proportion of transpiration t in et i e t et schlesinger and jasechko 2014 we specifically hypothesize that variations in t et can elicit responsive changes in wue at ecosystem level unfortunately t et is not directly measured at an eddy covariance flux tower but fortunately there exist reliable biophysical models e g the penman monteith model and the shuttleworth wallace model to partition et into t and evaporation e hu et al 2009 kool et al 2014 shuttleworth and wallace 1985 talsma et al 2018 introducing et partitioning into a wue study should help elucidate a purely physiological balance between canopy water consumption and carbon assimilation at ecosystem scale specifically instantaneous water use efficiency wuep gep t bernacchi and vanloocke 2015 our

balance roerink et al 2000 wang et al 2006 ef ranges from 0 to 1 and is closely related to bowen ratio β as ef is the ratio of latent heat to available energy the sum of latent and sensible heat ef

calculated each year for the two sites to evaluate temporal changes of dryness and wetness as a supplement aridity index k a widely used reliable indicator of the wet and dry degree of a region is calculated by dividing et by precipitation allen et al 1998 k has been used as a variable for identifying surface water status with higher k indicating drier areas li and xiao 2020 dry normal and wet years at our sites were classified based on the ef value of the growing season may september for each site table 1 the 9 year continuous monitoring of carbon and water fluxes in changling showed distinct dry years 2007 2009 and 2010 normal years 2008 2012 2014 and wet years 2011 2013 2015 based on the same protocols dry years were found for 2015 2016 and 2018 and wet years in 2014 and 2017 at the bayan meadow steppe the ef classification result of dry normal and wet years was roughly consistent with the result of k classifications and total precipitation level of the past 30 years 2 5 et partitioning the modelling method for partitioning et into transpiration t and evaporation e was developed by shuttleworth and wallace 1985 known as the shuttleworth wallace model the s w model describes the water vapor flows from soil to the atmosphere as analogous to the flow of electric current it assumes water evaporates from the soil surface and transpires by plants the s w model applied in our study was developed by estimating canopy stomatal resistance in the ball berry stomatal conductance model ball et al 1987 hu et al 2008 wang and leuning 1998 details for the s w modelling are presented in hu 2009 the transpiration to evapotranspiration fraction t et was calculated by dividing modelled t to modelled et measured ets from our flux tower were further partitioned into t and e based on t et 2 6 data analysis to explore the complex relationships and the multiple mechanisms for interdependent changes of carbon and water cycles we employed a structural equation model sem fan et al 2016 by including both direct and indirect casual relations among all potential biotic and abiotic factors that may affect gep et and wue our initial sem analyses were performed in the sas 9 4 platform sas institute cary nc usa by including daily ta and ts as the potential thermal drivers p rh swc and vpd as water forcing and par and rn as significant energy influences lai was also included as a biotic indicator of vegetation adequate model fits were tested and retained until the χ2 test was insignificant p 0 05 t and e were applied in our sems to evaluate the contributions of two water loss processes for wue influencing 3 results 3 1 water deficit and climate factors the mean std water deficit p et at the changling site increased significantly with annual evaporative

in central mongolia bayan meadow on average had a much higher water deficit due to high et in both wet 335 8 1 4 mm and dry years 401 1 23 3 mm with et that was supported by permafrost and snow melt being twice the size of annual p table 2 as expected a drought was found at the changling site in all three dry years with 2007 and 2010 experiencing spring drought and 2009 experiencing summer drought the changling site received only 40 6 mm precipitation in the first half of 2007 weighting 27 9 the precipitation of the same period in the wettest year 2013 145 7 mm fig 2 precipitation during the summer drought of 2010 was 59 1 mm which is about 36 of the 9 year average 164 6 mm for the same period june july altogether water deficit in changling was 50 9 of annual precipitation in dry years for the bayan site there was consistent water deficit in all five study years and year round mean growing season ta and ts were significantly higher in changling ta 18 1 0 4 c ts 16 2 0 8 c

and et the growing season gep was similar between changling 545 58 80 47 gc m 2 and bayan 615 62 119 91 gc m 2 but et was significantly higher in bayan 459 90 47 45 kg h2o than in changling 299 78 25 16 kg h2o p 0 05 fig 4 at the changling site gep in dry years 459 83 27 30 gc m 2 was significantly lower than that in wet 565 83 59 93 gc m 2 and normal years 611 09 59 00 gc m 2 p 0 05 while et showed no significant difference between dry 311 10 21 23 kg h2o normal 311 22 16 58 kg h2o and wet years 277 01 25 33 kg h2o conversely gep in the bayan site was significantly higher in dry years 628

fraction t et was on average higher in changling than in bayan t et of wet years was 0 63 0 01 for changling and 0 43 0 02 for bayan which was significantly higher than in normal 0 50 0 02 and dry

decreased with ef in bayan p 0 78 fig 4 when monthly values of gpp et and t et were examined for their changes with aridity there appeared divergent relationships fig 5 gep and et increased linearly with ef at both sites but at a much higher rate at bayan than at changling fig 5a b compared to bayan changling had a much greater gep increasing rate than et increasing rate which was consistent with the annual relationship of wue and ef in changling t et ratio increased linearly with ef in both sites p 0 01 fig 5c d with the fitting slope of bayan approaching 1 0 and slope of changling at about 0 7 while the roles of lai in regulating gep and et have been widely studied here we found that the changes in monthly t et and wue with lai were similar at the two study sites fig 6 we developed a logarithm model for the relationship between t et and lai regardless of overall low lai values at the bayan site fig 6a here we also took an extra step to examine the instantaneous water use efficiency wuep gep t that is defined in plant physiology again no significant difference was found between the two sites and the overall wuep was 3 4 gc kg 1 h2o fig 6b at the bayan site wuep in dry years appeared slightly higher than that in wet years at the changling site however wuep was lower in dry years than in normal and wet years fig 6c there existed clear seasonal changes in wue and t et at both sites and for all years fig 7 in changling monthly wue peaked in july 6 out of 9 years with the exception of 2011 when wue was highest in september for bayan the peak wue appeared later in august interestingly the seasonal change of t et seemed mostly synchronized with that of wue with the exceptions of 2011 2012 in changling finally wue at both sites showed a similar linear relationship with precipitation frequency during june july fig 8 a b suggesting that more frequent rains elevated ecosystem water use efficiency 3 4 sem results our sem framework was created with the same structure so comparisons between the two study sites can be made our focal variable in the sems is wue with gep and et as the two direct contributing variables fig 9 hypothesized connections with other potential regulatory variables i e climatic variables and lai as well as their interactions were developed based on either biophysical principles or our knowledge about the meadow steppes gep had greater influence on wue in bayan r 0 729 than in changling r 0 654 while influences of et were similar between the two sites there was a large difference in the regulatory factors on gep between changling and bayan gep was more dependent on the increase of lai i e positive r value in changling while gep was predominantly influenced by ta and par in bayan ta imposed a stronger positive effect on gep in bayan than in changling lai which was strongly related to ta and rn in changling directly stimulated gep whereas in bayan lai correlated more with precipitation and had a weak effect on gep precipitation had an indirect impact on gep in both changling and bayan by increasing swc fig 9 moreover the positive effect of swc and negative effect of vpd on gep were stronger in bayan than in changling et was primarily from transpiration in changling but from evaporation in bayan vpd had a stronger negative effect on transpiration in changling than in bayan which declined significantly with relative humidity moreover transpiration increased more significantly with par and lai in changling than in bayan in contrast air temperature had stronger positive effect on transpiration in bayan than in changling positive effects of net radiation rn on transpiration appeared similar between the two sites other relationships such as ta ts ts p vpd rn etc also showed similar levels of correlation between the two sites 3 5 contextualization of wue within global grasslands wue of the two meadow steppes on the mongolian plateau was 1 34 gc kg 1 h2o in bayan and 1 83 gc kg 1 h2o in changling both falling within the medium range of the eurasian steppes fig 10 both sites had wue lower than the global annual mean of 2 12 gc kg 1 h2o ranging from 0 51 to 5 76 gc kg 1 h2o based on 56 available grassland savanna sites within the fluxnet database wue of our sites was similar to the mean wue in asian grasslands 1 36 gc kg 1 h2o but lower than that in europe 2 75 gc kg 1 h2o 4 discussion 4 1 wue wue has been widely recognized as an important indicator in modeling ecosystem carbon water cycling generally wue related physiological processes are less water restrained in meadow steppes than in typical and desert steppes the meadows located in the eastern and central mongolian plateau had a greater wue than those in typical steppes of drylands in east asia under similar annual precipitation wue in changling and bayan meadows was higher than the previously reported mean wue of 0 5 1 0 gc kg 1 h2o in typical steppes hu et al 2008 xiao et al 2013 and their maximum values 1 74 gc kg 1 h2o zhu et al 2014 on the mongolian plateau where precipitation varies from 300 mm to 400 mm in contrast to high wue and precipitation levels of global grasslands the meadow wue of the mongolian plateau was relatively higher under low precipitation conditions the high wue value indicates that spatial variability of wue does not strictly follow the global precipitation gradients rather we speculate that the high wue values in the meadow steppes might be due to the distinct plant compositions and unique soil water conditions such as ratio of c3 c4 species phenology relatively rich soil and frequent waterlogging for example wue of the common c4 species in changling phragmites communis is higher than that of c3 plants on the mongolian plateau taylor et al 2010 additionally summer wue would decrease in many water limited ecosystems due to stomatal closure and rising soil evaporation yet meadows in both changling and bayan remained highly productive and displayed greater wue due to sufficient underground water supply permafrost and snow melt and lower dependence on precipitation than in other water limited ecosystems the interannual variations of wue appeared to be more dependent on ecosystem carbon assimilation i e gep than on et in both meadows our results clearly indicated that gep was sensitive to dryness e g ef in both meadows but et was less responsive again this weak relationship between et and aridity is probably attributable to the consistently high soil moisture and low water table in supporting soil evaporation and plant transpiration in drought this finding is in line with some evidence that et responds more to changes in atmospheric conditions than to soil moisture except under extremely low soil water conditions seneviratne et al 2010 because of this mechanism et remains indeclinable under drought in humid regions de boeck and verbeeck 2011 seneviratne et al 2010 conversely gep showed relatively high interannual variation with aridity and divergent relations between the two sites which consequently resulted in significant differences in wue between the two sites our finding that the decreasing gep under dryer atmospheric conditions i e changling agreed well with previous studies that water availability is usually the dominant driver for carbon exchange in semi arid ecosystems ahlström et al 2015 scott et al 2015 wilcox et al 2017 in semi arid grasslands atmospheric drought and soil water deficit exerted a significant adverse influence on canopy conductance leading to greater loss in photosynthetic capacity and gep than et contrarily the insignificant response of wue to interannual ef in bayan meadow appeared mainly because warmer and drier climates promote gep and et at pretty much the same rates by high energy input frequent rainfall events heavier rainfall and more cloudy days in wet years tend to reduce growing season length and ecosystem production in bayan meadow by substantially shading solar energy in cold climate generally speaking water stress elevates the sensitivity of wue to aridity in temperate meadows of the two meadows changling was under much higher water stress from atmosphere higher vpd as for bayan evaporative potential and actual et reached a relatively high level due to the continuous water logging via river recharge and thawing permafrost in the growing season which compensated for the negative effect of low temperature on et and eventually led to lower wue both meadows had similar wue in dry years but the response of wue to increasing water availability was much stronger in changling than in bayan we suppose the divergent response of wue to aridity change is actually related with drought severity and the extent to which precipitation ameliorates atmospheric and soil water deficits grass in changling meadow usually endured much more severe atmospheric drought than in bayan plant growth and wue therefore was more sensitive to interannual precipitation change and water stress reduction in changling but less responsive under humid climate response of wue to rising water availability was also prominent in global terrestrial ecosystems when increasing precipitation relieved soil or atmospheric drought limitation on ecosystem productivity in the grasslands of the us great plains for example wue in humid atmosphere has been reported to increase significantly with water availability where precipitation substantially reduced severe soil water stress gang et al 2016 however in extremely dry regions increasing precipitation can hardly compensate for water loss from soil evaporation especially when vpd is high and soil water is limited negative response of wue to drought therefore is an adaptation strategy to mitigate the effects of water loss in extremely dry regions temperature predominated the positive response of wue to aridity in cold and humid temperate meadows indicating a corresponding dominance shift of wue to energy supply with increasing humidity compared to changling bayan has a lower temperature and a shorter growing season that severely impede plant growth and photosynthesis but alleviate evaporative demands this results in a faster temperature induced carbon assimilation rate and ultimately a higher wue this positive change in both gep and wue to drought would suggest a higher ecosystem resistance ponce campos et al 2013 however this is because soil water in bayan is replenished by river snowmelt and permafrost as warming and drying trends are predicted to happen in future climate scenarios ecosystem function in bayan would be more threatened by reduced gep soil carbon stock release water depletion and aridification than in arid and semi arid ecosystems ending up with a lowered wue and altered sensitivity to aridity 4 2 effect of drought on wue differences in water balance soil moisture seasonal precipitation distribution and frequency were compared in this study to understand carbon water cycling of temperate meadows changes in aridity caused a more volatile water balance in the water limited meadows this phenomenon is obvious in rainfed changling where severe atmospheric drought together with the low water potential of saline alkaline soil stimulates et and deep soil water movement to topsoil dong et al 2011 contrarily a consistent large water deficit p et in bayan was due to the predominant snowmelt supply to soil water and et high wue level is maintained at changling and bayan meadows through depletion of the groundwater table which is adverse to photosynthetic activities and potentially accelerates carbon release in permafrost therefore drought was indirectly threatening meadow steppe carbon sequestration wue and ecosystem resistance to future climate change additionally acute drought in this area caused by extreme climate events such as heat waves would also lead to substantial reduction in wue year round qu et al 2016 in this study changes in precipitation frequency were found to affect grassland wue here we found a positive response of wue to increasing precipitation frequency for both meadows at monthly scale this result further confirmed a stronger impact of higher water availability and shortened dry spells in ameliorating soil water stress and improving ecosystem production liu et al 2017 interestingly we found that spring droughts could lead to a greater wue reduction in changling than summer droughts likely due to a combination of high et and germination failure dong et al 2011 increases in soil moisture reduced the negative effects of summer drought on ecosystem production and wue in changling and bayan meadows but enhanced the response to temperature this result again confirmed varying seasonal climate effects on wue in global ecosystem studies huang et al 2016 4 3 et partitioning evapotranspiration seems to be more critical than gep in determining the magnitude and changes in wue especially in bayan because et includes non productive soil evaporation and water transpired in c uptake it is important to assess et partitioning to place our understanding in perspective in humid grassland ecosystems precipitation 1000 mm the peak growing season t et can reach to 0 9 wang and yamanaka 2014 in our study the peak growing seasons t et in both meadows 0 8 were similar to t et of alpine meadows temperate steppes and wheat maize crops in north china liu et al 2002 the higher canopy cover and lai explained the high t et in changling for bayan it seems that more water was used in non productive evaporation than carbon gain fig 5 biophysically evaporation and transpiration rely on soil water from different depths here deep soil water is hydraulically lifted up by roots for plant transpiration bond et al 1971 geris et al 2017 jha et al 2017 while topsoil water supports evaporation and transpiration tiemuerbieke et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 this might be the primary reason why meadow wue is higher than typical and desert steppes on the mongolian plateau however the underlying force for the inter site t et difference may actually lie in the temperature limitation on plant growth in bayan coldness limits plant growth and canopy cover our data indicate that hydrological conditions explain the difference in the response of t et to dryness change in changling and bayan in changling non productive evaporation in et often varied greatly with canopy density rainfall and soil water desiccation in bayan reduced canopy shading and greater exposure of surface water also stimulated more soil evaporation than transpiration in dry periods maxwell and condon 2016 however continuous water logging and humid atmosphere in bayan e g low vpd attenuated water stress above canopy leaf stomata and soil surface and even created an anaerobic underground environment to impede further development of ecosystem production consequently changes in water availability had little effect on stomatal closure opening land surface mostly covered by water resistance and water loss from stomata transpiration and ground evaporation moreover the gap between 1 and the correlation coefficient of t et and ef was strongly influenced by the heavy atmospheric drought in the changling meadow in this study drought and climate altered ecosystem wue but did not change wuep and t et the response of t et to lai followed a similar negative exponential function in both meadows this relationship was consistent with other field studies lu et al 2017 ma and song 2019 indicating that the determination of lai in water flux allocation is not restrained by climate or seasonal interannual aridity change in humid ecosystems when lai was below 0 7 t et rose linearly with canopy cover and plant growth especially in early growing seasons but leaf stomatal conductance and canopy stomatal resistance started to decrease at high lai levels which turn t et into stable levels another important conclusion from our study is that instantaneous wue wuep in humid ecosystems appears to be a good physiological indicator over time because it is insensitive to the joint forces of vegetation change and aridity in addition we found that warmer climates caused an early arrival of peak t et and wue the peak t et and wue month in warm meadows july in changling was one month ahead of that in cold ecosystems august in bayan early start of growing season and higher accumulated temperature were most responsible for the advance in growing activities and transpiration in sum the meadow steppes showed contrasting response of wue to aridity that is regulated by joint effect of vegetation status climate and water cycling process and the potential risk that hydro climatic and ecological processes are facing under future climate change and human interference 5 conclusions the changes of wue in two distant meadow steppes by aridity were investigated for underlying mechanisms and responsible regulatory factors through comparisons of two temperate eurasian steppes higher wue was found in the less humid temperate meadow of changling china than in the bayan meadow of mongolia wue decreased with dryness in changling due to the stronger negative effect of dryness to photosynthesis gep but was insignificantly related to dryness in bayan due to the positive effect of warmer temperature in increasing gep increasing air temperature would promote wue by stimulating gep and decreasing soil evaporation in the cold mongolian meadow steppe differences in ecosystem water yield soil water content status and sensitivities of gep transpiration and evaporation to changing environment contributed to divergent wue responses in these meadow steppes we identified divergent regulations between the two steppes as well as the distinct driving forces for studying carbon water cycling credit authorship contribution statement gang dong conceptualization data curation formal

4919,the future climate change predicts higher drought risks in deteriorating the functions and services of dryland ecosystems interpreting the sensitivity of ecosystem water use efficiency wue to aridity could provide important environmental implications to water conservation and carbon budgets of drylands the effects of temporal aridity changes on wue in semi arid ecosystems particularly in meadow steppes have been poorly investigated in this study we used eddy covariance data from two representative temperate meadows on mongolian plateau changling 2007 2015 china and bayan 2014 2018 mongolia to understand the inter and intra annual changes of wue by evaporative fraction ef as well as the climatic and biotic controls on gross ecosystem production gep evapotranspiration et and partitioned evaporation t and transpiration e results showed that the response of annual wue to ef was positive in changling meadow with dry atmosphere but insignificant in bayan with cold climate the contrasting wues were driven by divergent gep and et responses to ef in two meadows monthly t et increased linearly with ef in both meadows but logarithmically with leaf area index lai bayan and changling meadows had a similar instantaneous wue wuep gep t that were insensitive to ef change we also found that the frequency of growing season precipitation affected wue at both sites we conclude that contrasting gep responses to ef determined the meadow wue variations the magnitude and changes in transpiration and evaporation provide further insights on the biophysical regulations i e lai of ecosystem water use and wuep this study indicated that differences in ecosystem water yield soil water status and sensitivities of gep and et partitioning jointly contributed to the divergent wue at

meadow steppes account for 18 9 of total grassland area in the mongolian plateau with a scattered distribution area largely shrunk by poor grassland management and erratic changes in climate freeze thaw and runoff unlike typical or desert steppes meadow steppes are mainly composed of mesoxerophilous perennial herbaceous species which are higher in biodiversity and primary productivity and these generate unique rich humus soils with recurring oxidation reduction reactions guo et al 2012 the soil plant and soil water status make up the water dependent ecosystem functions in meadow steppes therefore understanding the influences of temporal changes in dryness wetness and water balance on ecological processes e g carbon sequestration is especially important to the study of ecosystem functions and development of meadow ecosystems in recent decades ecosystem production and et in temperate meadow steppes has increased as a result of stable or slightly increased precipitation and warming climate on the mongolian plateau john et al 2018 albeit increasing droughts heatwaves and anthropogenic pressures can substantially change gep et and wue unfortunately the spatial and temporal changes of wue and the underlying regulatory mechanisms e g due to aridity have not been explored for these valuable steppes consequently long term continuous and in situ observations of carbon water exchanges are needed in dominant meadow types e g typical meadow to investigate the effects of dryness on wue and underlying mechanisms on the mongolian plateau in 2006 and 2013 our team installed eddy covariance ec flux towers at representative typical meadow steppes in eastern inner mongolia and central mongolia respectively to fill the data gaps in the global fluxnet network these two flux towers have collected years of valuable and rare carbon and water flux data to facilitate comparative and mechanistic studies of typical meadow steppes on the mongolian plateau based on the long term data here for the first time we report our findings of wue dynamics under different hydro climate conditions e g wet dry normal years and from hourly to multiple year scales because water is the most significant driving factor we also focused on the changes in wue with aridity before a comprehensive analysis of all potential drivers direct or indirect through structural equation modeling sem we hypothesize that aridity can be used as a key indicator for explaining the temporal changes of wue our initial steps include the interdependence of wue with major hydro climatic variables that either are part of aridity calculations e g precipitation or have direct casual relationships e g soil water storage because gep is a direct result of plant photosynthesis it is also important to examine coupled changes of wue with the proportion of transpiration t in et i e t et schlesinger and jasechko 2014 we specifically hypothesize that variations in t et can elicit responsive changes in wue at ecosystem level unfortunately t et is not directly measured at an eddy covariance flux tower but fortunately there exist reliable biophysical models e g the penman monteith model and the shuttleworth wallace model to partition et into t and evaporation e hu et al 2009 kool et al 2014 shuttleworth and wallace 1985 talsma et al 2018 introducing et partitioning into a wue study should help elucidate a purely physiological balance between canopy water consumption and carbon assimilation at ecosystem scale specifically instantaneous water use efficiency wuep gep t bernacchi and vanloocke 2015 our study objectives are to 1 understand the inter and intra annual variation of wue of two high latitude meadow stepps 2 examine the changes of wue with aridity precipitation and t et under different hydro climatic conditions and 3 identify the critical process carbon assilimilation water loss and the biophysical forcing on wue 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site description the study includes two meadow steppes on the mongolian plateau fig 1 one is a lowland cn cng hereafter changling in the songnen grassland ecology field station of the northeast normal university in changling jilin china

1400 mm that depends more heavily on permafrost and snow melt and a nearby river than on groundwater replenishment both sites have a continental monsoonal climate that is characterized with cold dry winters and warm humid summers the growing season normally spans may september 2 2 flux and meteorological measurements open path ec systems were installed in changling and bayan in 2006 and 2013 respectively each system includes an infrared gas analyzer irga li 7500 li cor inc usa and a csat3 three dimensional sonic anemometer csat3 campbell scientific inc csi usa mounted 2 0 m above the ground to calculate the net exchange of co2 h2o and energy between the meadow steppes and the atmosphere the raw time series at 10 hz of three dimensional wind velocities sonic temperature and co2 and

heating correction burba et al 2008 were applied to the flux calculations stationarity flux variance similarity and friction velocity thresholds of the 30 min fluxes were also used to remove periods with poorly developed turbulent mixing foken and wichura 1996 on average 82 of changling and 78 of bayan nee data passed these quality checks and controls and the rest was filled by a standardized gap filling algorithm reichstein et al 2005 data gaps due to instrument malfunction power failure and calibration schedule were also filled using linear interpolation detailed information regarding data quality processing and gap filling is provided in dong et al 2011 2 4 aridity index k evaporative fraction ef is a normalized value suitable for temporal quantification of surface water deficit and balance roerink et al 2000 wang et al 2006 ef ranges from 0 to 1 and is closely related to bowen ratio β as ef is the ratio of latent heat to available energy the sum of latent and sensible heat ef can be described as follows ef le le h le r n g 1 1 β where le latent heat h sensible heat rn net radiation g ground heat fluxes and β bowen ratio the growing season mean ef may september was calculated each year for the two sites to evaluate temporal changes of dryness and wetness as a supplement aridity index k a widely used reliable indicator of the wet and dry degree of a region is calculated by dividing et by precipitation allen et al 1998 k has been used as a variable for identifying surface water status with higher k indicating drier areas li and xiao 2020 dry normal and wet years at our sites were classified based on the ef value of the growing season may september for each site table 1 the 9 year continuous monitoring of carbon and water fluxes in changling showed distinct dry years 2007 2009 and 2010 normal years 2008 2012 2014 and wet years 2011 2013 2015 based on the same protocols dry years were found for 2015 2016 and 2018 and wet years in 2014 and 2017 at the bayan meadow steppe the ef classification result of dry normal and wet years was roughly consistent with the result of k classifications and total precipitation level of the past 30 years 2 5 et partitioning the modelling method for partitioning et into transpiration t and evaporation e was developed by shuttleworth and wallace 1985 known as the shuttleworth wallace model the s w model describes the water vapor flows from soil to the atmosphere as analogous to the flow of electric current it assumes water evaporates from the soil surface and transpires by plants the s w model applied in our study was developed by estimating canopy stomatal resistance in the ball berry stomatal conductance model ball et al 1987 hu et al 2008 wang and leuning 1998 details for the s w modelling are presented in hu 2009 the transpiration to evapotranspiration fraction t et was calculated by dividing modelled t to modelled et measured ets from our flux tower were further partitioned into t and e based on t et 2 6 data analysis to explore the complex relationships and the multiple mechanisms for interdependent changes of carbon and water cycles we employed a structural equation model sem fan et al 2016 by including both direct and indirect casual relations among all potential biotic and abiotic factors that may affect gep et and wue our initial sem analyses were performed in the sas 9 4 platform sas institute cary nc usa by including daily ta and ts as the potential thermal drivers p rh swc and vpd as water forcing and par and rn as significant energy influences lai was also included as a biotic indicator of vegetation adequate model fits were tested and retained until the χ2 test was insignificant p 0 05 t and e were applied in our sems to evaluate the contributions of two water loss processes for wue influencing 3 results 3 1 water deficit and climate factors the mean std water deficit p et at the changling site increased significantly with annual evaporative fraction ef that defines wet years 45 5 38 5 mm normal years 15 0 5 4 mm and dry years 140 3 16 4 mm table 2 the water deficit in dry years was equivalent to 50 9 of annual precipitation in changling in central mongolia bayan meadow on average had a much higher water deficit due to high et in both wet 335 8 1 4 mm and dry years 401 1 23 3 mm with et that was supported by permafrost and snow melt being twice the size of annual p table 2 as expected a drought was found at the changling site in all three dry years with 2007 and 2010 experiencing spring drought and 2009 experiencing summer drought the changling site received only 40 6 mm precipitation in the first half of 2007 weighting 27 9 the precipitation of the same period in the wettest year 2013 145 7 mm fig 2 precipitation during the summer drought of 2010 was 59 1 mm which is about 36 of the 9 year average 164 6 mm for the same period june july altogether water deficit in changling was 50 9 of annual precipitation in dry years for the bayan site there was consistent water deficit in all five study years and year round mean growing season ta and ts were significantly higher in changling ta 18 1 0 4 c ts 16 2 0 8 c

dry normal and wet years in changling 0 44 0 19 0 43 0 16 and 0 57 0 13 m3m 3 respectively and in bayan 0 54 0 14 m3m 3 in dry years and 0 57 0 12 m3m 3 in wet years fig 3c j however swc varied with seasonal precipitation in changling but rose rapidly in may and then remained at a high level 0 60 m3m 3 in june october independently of precipitation variation in bayan fig 3d j monthly mean se lai was much higher in changling 0 96 0 07 than in bayan 0 35 0 04 fig 3e k total biomass in may september was similar between changling 1084 11 141 16 kg m 2 and bayan 1016 82 140 88 kg m 2 fig 3f l 3 2 wue wue was on average higher in changling 1 83 0 29 gc kg 1 h2o than that in bayan 1 34 0 19 gc kg 1 h2o fig 4 wue in dry years 1 48 0 06 gc kg 1 h2o was 25 lower than in normal 1 96 0 12 gc kg 1 h2o and wet years 2 05 0 17 gc kg 1 h2o in changling in bayan wue in dry years 1 41 0 17 gc kg 1 h2o was similar to that in wet years 1 23 0 21 gc kg 1 h2o fig 4 when examined for its contributors i e gep and et the growing season gep was similar between changling 545 58 80 47 gc m 2 and bayan 615 62 119 91 gc m 2 but et was significantly higher in bayan 459 90 47 45 kg h2o than in changling 299 78 25 16 kg h2o p 0 05 fig 4 at the changling site gep in dry years 459 83 27 30 gc m 2 was significantly lower than that in wet 565 83 59 93 gc m 2 and normal years 611 09 59 00 gc m 2 p 0 05 while et showed no significant difference between dry 311 10 21 23 kg h2o normal 311 22 16 58 kg h2o and wet years 277 01 25 33 kg h2o conversely gep in the bayan site was significantly higher in dry years 628 83 108 40 gc m 2 than in wet years 514 82 11 78 gc m 2 p 0 05 again no significant difference in et was found between dry 484 33 18 60 kg h2o and wet years 423 27 61 96 kg h2o in bayan transpiration fraction t et was on average higher in changling than in bayan t et of wet years was 0 63 0 01 for changling and 0 43 0 02 for bayan which was significantly higher than in normal 0 50 0 02 and dry years 0 49 0 02 in changling and dry years 0 37 0 02 in bayan p 0 05 fig 4 3 3 changes with ef wue increased significantly with evaporative fraction ef in changling p 0 05 but insignificantly decreased with ef in bayan p 0 78 fig 4 when monthly values of gpp et and t et were examined for their changes with aridity there appeared divergent relationships fig 5 gep and et increased linearly with ef at both sites but at a much higher rate at bayan than at changling fig 5a b compared to bayan changling had a much greater gep increasing rate than et increasing rate which was consistent with the annual relationship of wue and ef in changling t et ratio increased linearly with ef in both sites p 0 01 fig 5c d with the fitting slope of bayan approaching 1 0 and slope of changling at about 0 7 while the roles of lai in regulating gep and et have been widely studied here we found that the changes in monthly t et and wue with lai were similar at the two study sites fig 6 we developed a logarithm model for the relationship between t et and lai regardless of overall low lai values at the bayan site fig 6a here we also took an extra step to examine the instantaneous water use efficiency wuep gep t that is defined in plant physiology again no significant difference was found between the two sites and the overall wuep was 3 4 gc kg 1 h2o fig 6b at the bayan site wuep in dry years appeared slightly higher than that in wet years at the changling site however wuep was lower in dry years than in normal and wet years fig 6c there existed clear seasonal changes in wue and t et at both sites and for all years fig 7 in changling monthly wue peaked in july 6 out of 9 years with the exception of 2011 when wue was highest in september for bayan the peak wue appeared later in august interestingly the seasonal change of t et seemed mostly synchronized with that of wue with the exceptions of 2011 2012 in changling finally wue at both sites showed a similar linear relationship with precipitation frequency during june july fig 8 a b suggesting that more frequent rains elevated ecosystem water use efficiency 3 4 sem results our sem framework was created with the same structure so comparisons between the two study sites can be made our focal variable in the sems is wue with gep and et as the two direct contributing variables fig 9 hypothesized connections with other potential regulatory variables i e climatic variables and lai as well as their interactions were developed based on either biophysical principles or our knowledge about the meadow steppes gep had greater influence on wue in bayan r 0 729 than in changling r 0 654 while influences of et were similar between the two sites there was a large difference in the regulatory factors on gep between changling and bayan gep was more dependent on the increase of lai i e positive r value in changling while gep was predominantly influenced by ta and par in bayan ta imposed a stronger positive effect on gep in bayan than in changling lai which was strongly related to ta and rn in changling directly stimulated gep whereas in bayan lai correlated more with precipitation and had a weak effect on gep precipitation had an indirect impact on gep in both changling and bayan by increasing swc fig 9 moreover the positive effect of swc and negative effect of vpd on gep were stronger in bayan than in changling et was primarily from transpiration in changling but from evaporation in bayan vpd had a stronger negative effect on transpiration in changling than in bayan which declined significantly with relative humidity moreover transpiration increased more significantly with par and lai in changling than in bayan in contrast air temperature had stronger positive effect on transpiration in bayan than in changling positive effects of net radiation rn on transpiration appeared similar between the two sites other relationships such as ta ts ts p vpd rn etc also showed similar levels of correlation between the two sites 3 5 contextualization of wue within global grasslands wue of the two meadow steppes on the mongolian plateau was 1 34 gc kg 1 h2o in bayan and 1 83 gc kg 1 h2o in changling both falling within the medium range of the eurasian steppes fig 10 both sites had wue lower than the global annual mean of 2 12 gc kg 1 h2o ranging from 0 51 to 5 76 gc kg 1 h2o based on 56 available grassland savanna sites within the fluxnet database wue of our sites was similar to the mean wue in asian grasslands 1 36 gc kg 1 h2o but lower than that in europe 2 75 gc kg 1 h2o 4 discussion 4 1 wue wue has been widely recognized as an important indicator in modeling ecosystem carbon water cycling generally wue related physiological processes are less water restrained in meadow steppes than in typical and desert steppes the meadows located in the eastern and central mongolian plateau had a greater wue than those in typical steppes of drylands in east asia under similar annual precipitation wue in changling and bayan meadows was higher than the previously reported mean wue of 0 5 1 0 gc kg 1 h2o in typical steppes hu et al 2008 xiao et al 2013 and their maximum values 1 74 gc kg 1 h2o zhu et al 2014 on the mongolian plateau where precipitation varies from 300 mm to 400 mm in contrast to high wue and precipitation levels of global grasslands the meadow wue of the mongolian plateau was relatively higher under low precipitation conditions the high wue value indicates that spatial variability of wue does not strictly follow the global precipitation gradients rather we speculate that the high wue values in the meadow steppes might be due to the distinct plant compositions and unique soil water conditions such as ratio of c3 c4 species phenology relatively rich soil and frequent waterlogging for example wue of the common c4 species in changling phragmites communis is higher than that of c3 plants on the mongolian plateau taylor et al 2010 additionally summer wue would decrease in many water limited ecosystems due to stomatal closure and rising soil evaporation yet meadows in both changling and bayan remained highly productive and displayed greater wue due to sufficient underground water supply permafrost and snow melt and lower dependence on precipitation than in other water limited ecosystems the interannual variations of wue appeared to be more dependent on ecosystem carbon assimilation i e gep than on et in both meadows our results clearly indicated that gep was sensitive to dryness e g ef in both meadows but et was less responsive again this weak relationship between et and aridity is probably attributable to the consistently high soil moisture and low water table in supporting soil evaporation and plant transpiration in drought this finding is in line with some evidence that et responds more to changes in atmospheric conditions than to soil moisture except under extremely low soil water conditions seneviratne et al 2010 because of this mechanism et remains indeclinable under drought in humid regions de boeck and verbeeck 2011 seneviratne et al 2010 conversely gep showed relatively high interannual variation with aridity and divergent relations between the two sites which consequently resulted in significant differences in wue between the two sites our finding that the decreasing gep under dryer atmospheric conditions i e changling agreed well with previous studies that water availability is usually the dominant driver for carbon exchange in semi arid ecosystems ahlström et al 2015 scott et al 2015 wilcox et al 2017 in semi arid grasslands atmospheric drought and soil water deficit exerted a significant adverse influence on canopy conductance leading to greater loss in photosynthetic capacity and gep than et contrarily the insignificant response of wue to interannual ef in bayan meadow appeared mainly because warmer and drier climates promote gep and et at pretty much the same rates by high energy input frequent rainfall events heavier rainfall and more cloudy days in wet years tend to reduce growing season length and ecosystem production in bayan meadow by substantially shading solar energy in cold climate generally speaking water stress elevates the sensitivity of wue to aridity in temperate meadows of the two meadows changling was under much higher water stress from atmosphere higher vpd as for bayan evaporative potential and actual et reached a relatively high level due to the continuous water logging via river recharge and thawing permafrost in the growing season which compensated for the negative effect of low temperature on et and eventually led to lower wue both meadows had similar wue in dry years but the response of wue to increasing water availability was much stronger in changling than in bayan we suppose the divergent response of wue to aridity change is actually related with drought severity and the extent to which precipitation ameliorates atmospheric and soil water deficits grass in changling meadow usually endured much more severe atmospheric drought than in bayan plant growth and wue therefore was more sensitive to interannual precipitation change and water stress reduction in changling but less responsive under humid climate response of wue to rising water availability was also prominent in global terrestrial ecosystems when increasing precipitation relieved soil or atmospheric drought limitation on ecosystem productivity in the grasslands of the us great plains for example wue in humid atmosphere has been reported to increase significantly with water availability where precipitation substantially reduced severe soil water stress gang et al 2016 however in extremely dry regions increasing precipitation can hardly compensate for water loss from soil evaporation especially when vpd is high and soil water is limited negative response of wue to drought therefore is an adaptation strategy to mitigate the effects of water loss in extremely dry regions temperature predominated the positive response of wue to aridity in cold and humid temperate meadows indicating a corresponding dominance shift of wue to energy supply with increasing humidity compared to changling bayan has a lower temperature and a shorter growing season that severely impede plant growth and photosynthesis but alleviate evaporative demands this results in a faster temperature induced carbon assimilation rate and ultimately a higher wue this positive change in both gep and wue to drought would suggest a higher ecosystem resistance ponce campos et al 2013 however this is because soil water in bayan is replenished by river snowmelt and permafrost as warming and drying trends are predicted to happen in future climate scenarios ecosystem function in bayan would be more threatened by reduced gep soil carbon stock release water depletion and aridification than in arid and semi arid ecosystems ending up with a lowered wue and altered sensitivity to aridity 4 2 effect of drought on wue differences in water balance soil moisture seasonal precipitation distribution and frequency were compared in this study to understand carbon water cycling of temperate meadows changes in aridity caused a more volatile water balance in the water limited meadows this phenomenon is obvious in rainfed changling where severe atmospheric drought together with the low water potential of saline alkaline soil stimulates et and deep soil water movement to topsoil dong et al 2011 contrarily a consistent large water deficit p et in bayan was due to the predominant snowmelt supply to soil water and et high wue level is maintained at changling and bayan meadows through depletion of the groundwater table which is adverse to photosynthetic activities and potentially accelerates carbon release in permafrost therefore drought was indirectly threatening meadow steppe carbon sequestration wue and ecosystem resistance to future climate change additionally acute drought in this area caused by extreme climate events such as heat waves would also lead to substantial reduction in wue year round qu et al 2016 in this study changes in precipitation frequency were found to affect grassland wue here we found a positive response of wue to increasing precipitation frequency for both meadows at monthly scale this result further confirmed a stronger impact of higher water availability and shortened dry spells in ameliorating soil water stress and improving ecosystem production liu et al 2017 interestingly we found that spring droughts could lead to a greater wue reduction in changling than summer droughts likely due to a combination of high et and germination failure dong et al 2011 increases in soil moisture reduced the negative effects of summer drought on ecosystem production and wue in changling and bayan meadows but enhanced the response to temperature this result again confirmed varying seasonal climate effects on wue in global ecosystem studies huang et al 2016 4 3 et partitioning evapotranspiration seems to be more critical than gep in determining the magnitude and changes in wue especially in bayan because et includes non productive soil evaporation and water transpired in c uptake it is important to assess et partitioning to place our understanding in perspective in humid grassland ecosystems precipitation 1000 mm the peak growing season t et can reach to 0 9 wang and yamanaka 2014 in our study the peak growing seasons t et in both meadows 0 8 were similar to t et of alpine meadows temperate steppes and wheat maize crops in north china liu et al 2002 the higher canopy cover and lai explained the high t et in changling for bayan it seems that more water was used in non productive evaporation than carbon gain fig 5 biophysically evaporation and transpiration rely on soil water from different depths here deep soil water is hydraulically lifted up by roots for plant transpiration bond et al 1971 geris et al 2017 jha et al 2017 while topsoil water supports evaporation and transpiration tiemuerbieke et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 this might be the primary reason why meadow wue is higher than typical and desert steppes on the mongolian plateau however the underlying force for the inter site t et difference may actually lie in the temperature limitation on plant growth in bayan coldness limits plant growth and canopy cover our data indicate that hydrological conditions explain the difference in the response of t et to dryness change in changling and bayan in changling non productive evaporation in et often varied greatly with canopy density rainfall and soil water desiccation in bayan reduced canopy shading and greater exposure of surface water also stimulated more soil evaporation than transpiration in dry periods maxwell and condon 2016 however continuous water logging and humid atmosphere in bayan e g low vpd attenuated water stress above canopy leaf stomata and soil surface and even created an anaerobic underground environment to impede further development of ecosystem production consequently changes in water availability had little effect on stomatal closure opening land surface mostly covered by water resistance and water loss from stomata transpiration and ground evaporation moreover the gap between 1 and the correlation coefficient of t et and ef was strongly influenced by the heavy atmospheric drought in the changling meadow in this study drought and climate altered ecosystem wue but did not change wuep and t et the response of t et to lai followed a similar negative exponential function in both meadows this relationship was consistent with other field studies lu et al 2017 ma and song 2019 indicating that the determination of lai in water flux allocation is not restrained by climate or seasonal interannual aridity change in humid ecosystems when lai was below 0 7 t et rose linearly with canopy cover and plant growth especially in early growing seasons but leaf stomatal conductance and canopy stomatal resistance started to decrease at high lai levels which turn t et into stable levels another important conclusion from our study is that instantaneous wue wuep in humid ecosystems appears to be a good physiological indicator over time because it is insensitive to the joint forces of vegetation change and aridity in addition we found that warmer climates caused an early arrival of peak t et and wue the peak t et and wue month in warm meadows july in changling was one month ahead of that in cold ecosystems august in bayan early start of growing season and higher accumulated temperature were most responsible for the advance in growing activities and transpiration in sum the meadow steppes showed contrasting response of wue to aridity that is regulated by joint effect of vegetation status climate and water cycling process and the potential risk that hydro climatic and ecological processes are facing under future climate change and human interference 5 conclusions the changes of wue in two distant meadow steppes by aridity were investigated for underlying mechanisms and responsible regulatory factors through comparisons of two temperate eurasian steppes higher wue was found in the less humid temperate meadow of changling china than in the bayan meadow of mongolia wue decreased with dryness in changling due to the stronger negative effect of dryness to photosynthesis gep but was insignificantly related to dryness in bayan due to the positive effect of warmer temperature in increasing gep increasing air temperature would promote wue by stimulating gep and decreasing soil evaporation in the cold mongolian meadow steppe differences in ecosystem water yield soil water content status and sensitivities of gep transpiration and evaporation to changing environment contributed to divergent wue responses in these meadow steppes we identified divergent regulations between the two steppes as well as the distinct driving forces for studying carbon water cycling credit authorship contribution statement gang dong conceptualization data curation formal
