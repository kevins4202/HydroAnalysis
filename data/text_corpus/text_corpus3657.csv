18285,determination of the effects of cascade dams on benthic microbial ecosystem is essential for dam regulation and ecological function protection however no comprehensive investigation has yet shown the ecosystem level responses of microbiota to dam impoundments this study conducted dna metabarcoding and microbial food web analysis for multiple species and their interrelationships along a cascade dam affected river the composition distribution and diversity of bacteria protozoans and metazoans were obviously different between river and reservoirs mainly controlled by hydrological p 0 01 and nutrient parameters p 0 05 those three groups make up a co occurrence network with most edges direct from higher to lower trophic levels or vice versa and more than 50 keystones participate in the food web indicating the significant role of predator prey relationships based on the microbial food web analysis the predator biomass especially at higher trophic levels decreased by about 10 from the riverine to the lacustrine system the structural equation model illustrates that both bottom up forces environmental factors particularly velocity and nutrient concentrations and top down forces higher trophic levels critically control microbial food web patterns p 0 05 as a result of dam impoundments the lower velocity in the reservoirs has direct negative effects on trophic transfer efficiencies that may be further magnified by nutrient accumulation probably leading to an increase of eutrophication and posing a risk to water quality the results suggest the potential ecological risk in the reservoirs and highlight the need to consider from the perspective of ecosystem during the operation of cascade dams graphical abstract image 1 keywords cascade dams multi species microbial food web dna metabarcoding ecological impacts 1 introduction dams are constructed in global rivers for reasons such as energy generation water supply and flood control latrubesse et al 2017 they are considered as the most severe anthropogenic disturbance affecting the integrity of river ecosystems chen and olden 2017 unlike individual dams cascade dams typically exhibit cumulative effects on the stream network within a river basin or larger region leading to river fragmentation hydrologic variation and sediment siltation duan et al 2016 kondolf et al 2014 as a result of dam impoundments the obviously decreased water self purification ability may threaten the water quality and increase the risk of pollution in the reservoirs fan et al 2015 in aquatic ecosystem benthic microbiota plays a central role in pollutant degradation and is responsible for many ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycle regulation and environmental indication falkowski et al 2008 hartman et al 2008 revealing the responses of benthic microbiota to reservoir impoundments can help us better understand the cascade dam induced ecological impacts and potential ecological risk biological responses to environmental stresses can occur at the individual population community and ecosystem levels it has been reported that cascade dams have profound effects on individual movement population reproduction community structure and ecosystem functions of riparian floras macro invertebrates and migratory fishes fan et al 2015 a recent study found that bacterial community in riparian sediments responded sensitively to multiple dams chen et al 2018 demonstrating the potential effects of cascade dams on benthic microbiota however the fundamental role of microbiota in ecological functions is attributed not only to bacteria but also to other components of microbial ecosystem such as micro eukaryotic communities kamp et al 2015 to clarify the ecosystem level responses of microbial communities to environmental changes the primary task is to characterize their compositions and diversities it was a challenge for previous researchers mainly due to taxonomic and logistical limitations development in dna metabarcoding approaches and bioinformatic pipelines presents a solution to above limitations the efficiency and accuracy of these methods have been verified by comparison with morphology based identification or with known community composition deiner et al 2016 elbrecht et al 2017 dna metabarcoding projects have concluded that different species do not usually respond synchronously to environmental changes and this lack of synchronization will result in community reorganization and ecological variations comte et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 for these reasons it is of vital importance to shift from an autecological perspective to the consideration of multi species variations using dna metabarcoding considering from the ecosystem perspective biological responses to environmental changes do not typically occur in isolation instead these responses are connected with others at the same or adjacent trophic levels including mutualistic predatory and parasitic rocha et al 2019 dam closure can have considerable impacts on interactions among food webs which may amplify the direct effects of cascade dams power et al 1996 even when the focus is on target species rather than whole ecosystems a food web perspective is necessary because each species depends critically on its resources prey and potential predators kergunteuil et al 2019 power et al 1995 in food webs changes at lower trophic levels could induce bottom up effects through ecological networks and may induce feedback processes top down controls may also occur and can strongly influence and modify community responses therefore characterization of trophic interactions in the food webs can better illustrate the ecosystem level responses to environmental changes the microbial food web is considered as the basis of ecological processes by controlling the biomass of primary producers and increasing the flow of energy and materials stock et al 2014 recent studies have demonstrated environmental controls on microbial food web structure trophic transfer efficiency and their response to disturbances such as thermal stratification and nutrient enrichment domingues et al 2017 palijan and balkic 2018 to better identify food web patterns ecologists have utilized different techniques to quantify interaction strengths routinely measuring turnover rates to estimate ecological efficiency or production rate is highly difficult so simplifications are typically made the predator prey biomass ratio ppbr a proxy for trophic transfer efficiency is widely used to illustrate microbial food web patterns in various aquatic ecosystems garcia comas et al 2016 reczuga et al 2018 yang et al 2018 however the traditional methods to determine predator and prey biomass are time consuming and labor intensive recently yang et al 2018 took advantage of dna metabarcoding to obtain diversity estimates of predator flagellates and prey bacteria by extracting data for operational taxonomic units otus from 16s to 18s rdna pools thus dna metabarcoding may be useful in microbial food web analysis and may provide higher resolution ecological data the main objective of this study was to clarify the ecosystem level responses of benthic microbiota to cascade dam impoundments for this purpose analyses were carried out to 1 investigate the composition distribution and diversity of multiple species along a representative cascade dam affected river using dna metabarcoding 2 find out how the environmental changes due to dam impoundments can control microbial communities 3 determine the interactions among multi trophic level species and quantify the direct and indirect effects of bottom up and top down controls on the overall microbial food web this study gives a holistic description of the influence of cascade dams on benthic ecosystem and suggests the potential ecological risk providing a baseline for conservation purposes of dam regulation and ecological function 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area sampling and environmental variables the hanjiang river located between 106 and 114 e and 30 40 n is the longest tributary of the yangtze river connecting the yangtze river and the silk road economic belt hanjiang river occupies significant position in advancing the belt and road initiative the middle lower hanjiang river is a typical basin affected by cascade dams and was selected as the study region song et al 2018 to date four dams are in operation along the middle lower reaches and three remaining dams of the proposed series of cascade dams will be completed in the next decades due to the impoundment the upper reaches of each dam are transformed from lotic to lentic conditions the lacustrine and riverine systems were included as sampling sites to represent the conditions with or without the effects of dam impoundments respectively the lacustrine sites l1 l4 located in the danjiangkou reservoir wangfuzhou reservoir cuijiaying reservoir and xinglong reservoir and the riverine sites r1 r11 are distributed along the flowing river from upstream to downstream fig 1 given that the construction of dams has greatly delayed and attenuated seasonal and interannual streamflow variability of rivers winemiller et al 2016 the seasonal variability is less significant compared to dam impoundments and is thereby not taken into consideration sampling was conducted in june 2018 at each site water samples were collected in triplicate using pre cleaned polyethylene bottles and were subsequently stored at 4 c the surface sediment samples top 0 10 cm were obtained in triplicate from different locations 1 m apart from each other and were well mixed and homogenized half of the sediment samples were stored at 4 c

co usa the other variables were analyzed in the laboratory the concentrations of total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn were determined using total phosphorus and total nitrogen analyzer npw 160 hach nitrogen nutrients in sediment samples were extracted with 2 m kcl using a 1 10 sediment extractant ratio from lyophilized sediments and then measured together with ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n in water samples using a continuous flow injection analyzer quickchem 8500 hach the concentrations of microelements were measured using an icp oes thermo scientific icap 7000 plus the environmental variables were refined using principal component analysis pca and were divided into velocity water physical parameters water organics water nutrients water microelements sediment nutrients and sediment microelements 2 2 dna metabarcoding and bioinformatical analysis to identify and estimate changes in the relative abundances of multiple microbial communities we employed high throughput sequencing and environmental dna metabarcoding briefly dna was extracted and purified from 0 5 g sediment samples using the powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc carlsbad ca united states according to the manufacturer s instructions the dna integrity was checked by gel electrophoresis and the samples were stored at 20 c until amplification and sequencing the v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna gene was targeted to analyze bacterial sequences using the barcode and adapter linked primers 341f and 806r yu et al 2005 sequencing of environmental dna using a taxonomic marker such as 18s rrna can provide a broad taxonomic overview of the eukaryotic communities drummond et al 2015 the universal eukaryotic primers tareuk454fwd1 5 ccagcascygcggtaattcc 3 and tareukrev3 5 actttcgttcttgatyra 3 were used to amplify 380 bp fragments that covered the complete v4 region of the eukaryotic 18s rrna gene stoeck et al 2010 the pcr reactions were prepared according to standard conditions for transstart fastpfu dna polymerase using a pcr cycler abi geneamp 9700 amplifications were done in a total solution volume of solution of 20 μl which was composed of 4 μl 5 fastpfu buffer 2 μl 2 5 mm dntps 0 8 μl forward primer 5 μm 0 8 μl reverse primer 5 μm 0 4 μl fastpfu polymerase 10 ng template dna and ddh2o to 20 μl pcr cycling was performed as performed as 95 c for 5 min followed by 27 cycles of denaturation at 95 c for 30 s annealing at 55 c for 30 s and extension at 72 c for 45 s followed by a final extension at 72 c for 10 min raw forward and reverse reads were overlapped and any reads not containing the primers were discarded sequences containing uncalled bases were also discarded the remaining sequences were quality filtered and chimeras were identified and filtered using qiime v 1 9 1 caporaso et al 2010b fasta files were generated based on the remaining sequences sequences were clustered into otus using the uclust clustering method edgar 2010 and disallowing singletons with defined pairwise sequence identify cut off of 97 taxonomy was assigned by comparison to the silva 132 database quast et al 2013 using blast with default settings representative otus were aligned against the same reference database using pynast caporaso et al 2010a finally the otu table that excluded any sequences that failed to align with pynast was referred to as the final otu table otu tables of bacteria and eukaryotes were obtained and the protozoan and metazoan otu tables were further extracted from the eukaryotic otu table 2 3 statistical analysis α diversity indexes of bacteria protozoan and metazoan communities were separately calculated in r v 3 5 1 http www r project org with the vegan package to examine the difference of microbial α diversity between lacustrine and riverine systems one factor analysis of variance one way anova test was performed using ibm spss statistics 22 0 chicago il usa differences in microbial community composition β diversity were determined by computing the pairwise bray curtis distances using vegan package in r to assess the cluster patterns of microbial communities we compared the similarity of bacterial protozoan and metazoan communities between lacustrine and riverine systems and among different parts of the flowing river using non metric multidimensional scaling nmds then permutational manova permanova was performed based on 999 permutations with the adonis function of the vegan in r to assess significance stamp v2 1 3 parks et al 2014 was used to compare samples organized into lacustrine and riverine groups and to obtain statistically significant differential taxonomic abundance mantel tests were conducted to determine the main factors that control bacteria protozoan and metazoan communities co occurrence network analysis was used to illustrate the correlations among multi species otus with relative abundances above 2 6 and 3 for bacteria protozoans and metazoans respectively were selected the network was filtered to include only correlations with a coefficient rho 0 6 and a statistical significance p 0 01 barberán et al 2011 the network was visualized using gephi software and revealed the 178 nodes with significant local similarity correlations the overall topological indices including the number of nodes and edges degree density modularity average clustering coefficient and average path length were computed using gephi newman 2003 additionally an identically sized random network was generated based on the erdӧs réyni model erdos and r rényi 1960 and the topological properties of this network were calculated using igraph packages in r 2 4 microbial food web analysis to characterize the microbial food web pattern predator diversity estimates were extracted from the pool of otus affiliated with common trophically linked species according to the literature parry 2004 weitere et al 2018 following the method of yang et al 2018 heterotrophic flagellates hf are the dominant protozoan predators of bacteria in aquatic systems and amoeba could feed on attached bacteria ciliates are another protozoan group that effectively feed on bacteria and their larger cell sizes allow them to prey on flagellates and small ciliates meiofauna make up the higher trophic level in which nematoda and rotifera are the dominant predators in most benthic systems for the bacterial community two functional groups were considered autotrophic cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria excluding cyanobacteria yang et al 2018 only heterotrophic bacteria hb were included in the microbial food web analysis due to their dominant roles in benthic heterotrophic food web hillebrand et al 2002 we used the predator prey biomass ratio as a proxy of trophic transfer efficiency among different trophic levels the number of copies per individual is influenced by their size and biomass so we used the number of reads to represent fractional biomass rather than abundance in terms of individuals singh et al 2019 trophic transfer efficiency between protozoan and bacterial groups was calculated as hf hb amoeba hb and ciliates hb and transfer efficiency within the protozoan community was calculated as ciliates hf although nematoda and rotifera are the most widely reported predators other meiofauna can also feed on bacteria and protozoans therefore trophic transfer efficiency from bacteria to meiofauna was represented as meiofauna hb and that from protozoan to meiofauna was calculated as meiofauna protozoan meiofauna hf amoeba ciliates to further explore the top down and bottom up controls of microbial food web we used a structural equation model sem to determine the direct and indirect paths among environmental predictors and trophic transfer efficiencies the sem model was constructed using amos v 22 spss chicago il usa and the regression weights correlations and covariances were estimated based on maximum likelihood discrepancy indices were also calculated including chi aquare tset χ2 df incremental fit index ifi comparative fitting index cfi expected cross validation index ecvi akaike information criterion aic bayesian information criterion bic and consistent akaike information criterion caic to test if the model represent a complex set of theoretical hypothesis west et al 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 responses of multiple species to cascade dam impoundments we first analyzed the composition distribution and diversity variations of bacteria protozoans and metazoans affected by dam impoundments after dna metabarcoding and bioinformatic analysis a total of 24330 and 5063 otus were detected for bacteria and eukaryotes respectively proteobacteria 49 71 firmicutes 10 46 and actinobacteria 9 02 dominate the bacterial community at the genus level two clusters are observed with obvious compositional discrimination and are almost in accordance with the lacustrine and riverine groups fig s1 indicating the discrimination of bacterial composition between these systems comparative analysis of the dominant bacterial compositions with or without dam effects fig s2 showed that most bacterial genus taxa significantly decrease p 0 05 from riverine to lacustrine system but reyranella deinococcus and lysobacter are much abundant in reservoirs than in the riverine sites p 0 05 eukaryotic community composition and distribution were determined and are displayed in fig 2 more than 99 of the eukaryotes are protozoans and metazoans the protozoan community is dominated by sar 56 51 including stramenopiles alveolates and rhizaria followed by archaeplastida 34 35 and amoebozoa 4 98 for the metazoan community bilateria 99 74 is dominant including taxa such as chordata arthropoda rotifera and nematoda the eukaryotic community composition is largely consistent with previous molecular or morphological based studies gong et al 2015 scheckenbach et al 2010 demonstrating the availability and efficiency of dna metabarcoding the eukaryotic composition in the lacustrine and riverine systems also shows discrimination based on the hierarchical clustering fig 2 more stramenopile maxillopoda and rhabdocoela are obtained in riverine sites with more gnathostomata presents in reservoirs fig s2 the α diversity indices of bacteria protozoans and metazoans are shown in table s1 most indices showed an overall increase trend along the riverine sites from upstream to downstream while obviously decrease in the reservoirs the relative lower abundance richness and diversity in the reservoirs indicate the potential negative effects of dam impoundments on microbial communities a trend also observed in other cascade dam affected rivers chen et al 2018 wang et al 2018 based on the results of one way anova test table 1 all the α diversity estimators of bacteria and most of the indices for protozoans and metazoans exhibit statistically significant discrimination p 0 05 between lacustrine and riverine systems it seems that the discriminations between reservoir and river locations are more pronounced for bacterial community compared with those of higher trophic level species the results of nmds analysis and permanova test indicate that bacteria protozoans and metazoans all exhibit different geographic patterns with samples collected in the reservoirs and river clustering separately fig 3 a c e and showing dramatic variations between the two systems p 0 01 comparison of the different parts of the flowing river separated by cascade dams reveals that the microbial communities also show obvious cluster patterns fig 3 b d f especially bacteria p 0 025 r2 0 42 and protozoans p 0 006 r2 0 48 therefore in addition to the discrimination between river and reservoirs microbial communities also exhibit significant fragmentation from upstream to downstream locations these results are supported by reports of the discontinuity of vegetation and fish along the dam affected rivers suggesting that extensive fragmentation may change community compositions and distributions cooper et al 2016 jansson et al 2000 3 2 primary factors influencing benthic microbial communities the physiochemical parameters of water and sediment samples from the 15 sampling sites are shown in table s2 we can see that velocity do and codmn tend to increase from upstream to downstream and significantly decrease in the reservoir sites l1 l4 the nutrient concentrations including tp tn nh4 n and no3 n in both the water and the sediment samples are much higher in the lacustrine system than in the adjacent riverine system additionally a gradually increasing trend of these nutrient parameters is detected from upper to lower reaches likely due to the nutrient input resulting from anthropogenic activities li et al 2016 the observed values are in agreement with previous investigations indicating that cascade dams could result in hydrology variation and nutrient accumulation in the reservoirs fan et al 2015 the mantel test result table 2 and canonical correlation analysis cca plots fig s3 demonstrate different correlations of environmental variables with bacteria protozoans and metazoans respectively the bacterial community is mainly controlled by hydrology related parameters such as velocity r 0 54 p 0 001 do r 0 38 p 0 008 and transparency r 0 27 p 0 023 due to the transformation from lotic to lentic condition the associated stressor regime including higher water level longer hydraulic retention time and lower flow velocity will affect the composition relative abundance and distribution of microbial communities battin et al 2003 li et al 2015 protozoan and metazoan groups are more correlated p 0 05 with nutrient parameters tp tn no3 n in both the water and the sediment probably due to their direct and indirect participation in material cycles and sensitivity to nutrient variations kamp et al 2015 collectively these results reveal that multi species exhibit distinct patterns that are predictable from a variety of abiotic variables overall understanding the responses of different species to environmental variations is necessary to improve our ability to predict the impact of cascade dams on benthic ecosystem 3 3 interactions among bacteria protozoans and metazoans a co occurrence network was constructed to reveal association within microbial communities and elucidates the potential ecologically meaningful interactions between taxa the underlying hypothesis is therefore that ecological interactions produce correlations and relational patterns in the abundance of microbiota layeghifard et al 2017 the network consists 178 nodes with 83 bacterial otus 41 protozoan otus and 54 metazoan otus with 2276 edges and a mean of 25 57 edges per node fig 4 the topological properties were calculated to describe the complex relationships among multiple species the real co occurrence network has an average path length of 4 11 with a clustering coefficient of 0 414 and modularity index of 0 679 suggesting that the network has a modular structure compared with the separately generated random network with average path length of 1 88 and clustering coefficient of 0 14 the real network is more significantly clustered and forms a small world in order to figure out what species are significantly correlated we used different color of edge to represent their two endpoints it is interesting to find that the color patterns of one endpoint fig 4 a are obviously different from the other fig 4 b indicating that lots of edges target from higher to lower trophic level species or vice versa that is to say the significantly correlated species are usually from different trophic levels we also found that more than 50 keystones of the network participate in the microbial food web based on these analysis predator prey relationships may be the most significant interactions among microbiota these results are supported by a recent review article bjorbækmo et al 2019 demonstrating that predation is the most common protist interaction food web networks have been used to illustrate the predator prey relations dunne et al 2002 analyzed a broad range of high quality food webs finding higher connectivity and much smaller size of food web networks compared to other networks most of the topological properties determined here such as the clustering coefficients 0 414 and their ratios between the real and random network 2 96 are in accordance with most of the food web networks emphasizing again a significant role of trophic interrelationships in the microbiota however there are some differences which may suggest that not all otus included in our network are dominant in microbial food web and exhibit predator prey relationships thus microbial food web analysis was further conducted to better understand the trophic relationships among microbiota and their responses to environmental changes 3 4 bottom up and top down controls in microbial food web we focused on the primary components of the microbial food web including hb hf amoeba ciliates and meiofauna with nematoda and rotifera as the most representative species the abundance of hb is much higher than autotrophic bacteria table s3 especially in the reservoir sites demonstrating their dominant role in heterotrophic food web once again the discriminations of food web component abundances between lacustrine and riverine systems are shown in fig 5 hb and hf show little variations between the two systems while other predators decrease by about 10 from river to reservoirs especially at the highest trophic levels previous studies have demonstrated a systematic difference in the average sensitivity of species among trophic levels for example in a microcosm containing aquatic microbes warming greatly increased herbivore and predator extinction frequencies but there was little effect on producers and bacterivores petchey et al 1999 our results suggest that the impoundments of cascade dams might impact the food web pattern and thereby change the biomass of microbial food web components particularly at higher trophic levels to further explore how the microbial food web pattern is influenced a sem was used to disentangle the relationships of trophic transfer efficiencies with environmental factors and uncover the interactions among multiple trophic levels fig 6 the sem exhibits a reasonable fit based on the good fit indices with χ2 df 1 220 1 3 ifi 0 925 0 90 and cfi 0 905 0 90 additionally ecvi aic bic and caic increase from the default to saturated and then to independence model the direct indirect and total effects of all the variables were calculated and are presented in table s4 the sem revealed that both bottom up resource availability and top down predation forces critically control the microbial food web with distinct and sometime interactive effects domingues et al 2017 the ratios of amoeba hb r 0 46 p 0 04 ciliate hb r 0 57 p 0 11 and meiofauna protozoan r 0 70 p 0 002 are all directly and positively correlated with velocity and the hf hb ratio is negatively related r 0 56 p 0 001 the vital role of flow velocity in controlling predator prey interactions was demonstrated by leonard et al 1998 who focused on marine intertidal communities and observed greater predator density at high flow sites compared to low flow sites our results suggest that the microbial food web may similarly respond to hydrologic variations low velocity may restrain the reproduction of the bacterial community and limit the dispersal and predation of protozoans and meiofauna thereby leading to a decrease of trophic transfer efficiencies shimeta et al 2001 surprisingly although direct positive effects of velocity on most trophic transfer efficiencies were observed some of the standardized total effects are negative table s4 this may suggest that hydrologic condition not only acts as a non negligible bottom up force it may also control the strength of interactions among trophic levels to change food web patterns leonard et al 1998 for instance in addition to the direct effects of velocity the indirect cascading effects are substantially stronger for amoeba hb r 0 53 and ciliates hb r 0 60 through the interaction between meiofauna and protozoans therefore top down forces may exert larger effects on trophic transfer efficiencies from heterotrophic bacteria to amoeba and ciliates compared with the impacts of environmental parameters based on the standardized total effects table s4 almost all the predator prey ratios are negatively affected by nutrient levels in both water and sediment p 0 05 the generally lower trophic transfer efficiencies with increasing nutrient concentration were also observed in previous study pernthaler 2005 demonstrating that bacteria are more tightly controlled by competition for nutrients instead of predation in more productive waters however these suggestions are somewhat inconsistent with the results of thelaus et al 2008 who observed an increase in the ratio of protozoan and bacteria biomass from nutrient poor to nutrient rich conditions by both food web model simulation and meta analysis this difference could be explained by the special habitat formed by dam impoundments nutrient concentration is not the only variable influencing microbial food web pattern in our study reiterating the significant role of hydrology trophic transfer from bacteria to protozoans and metazoans is an important mechanism of nutrient regeneration particularly of nitrogen and phosphorus pernthaler 2005 attributed to dam impoundments the obviously decreased velocity and accumulated nutrients may restrain the trophic transfer efficiencies and thereby aggravate eutrophication with potential threaten to water quality within the reservoirs our data suggest the interaction of environmental parameters with shifts in top down and bottom up control to affect microbial food web structure the lowest trophic level hf hb has little influence on higher trophic levels only exerting direct effect on ciliate hb r 0 436 p 0 09 high total effects of meiofauna protozoan amoeba hb and ciliates hb on other trophic transfer ratios indicate a strong regulating role of protozoans and meiofauna in microbiota as documented previously ozen et al 2018 weitere et al 2018 the network fig 4 depicts most of the significant correlations are between different trophic level species could also be verified future work could expand to consider the variation of food web interactions not just correlations with short intermediate and long term hydrologic changes in a more comprehensive framework 4 conclusions overall this study indicates that cascade dam impoundments can change the composition distribution and diversity of benthic bacteria protozoans and metazoans as the result of primary control by hydrologic and nutrient variables microbiota exhibits obvious predator prey relationships both bottom up forces environmental factors and top down forces higher trophic levels are critical to control microbial food web patterns the obviously decreased velocity and accumulated nutrients can restrain the trophic transfer efficiencies and may thereby aggravate eutrophication with potential threaten to water quality within the reservoirs given that dams are used to regulate most of the world s rivers there may be examples of how extensive fragmentation of river systems may have caused similar obstructions to organism interaction and ecological function we emphasize the importance of evaluating ecosystem level effects of dam impoundments on benthic microbiota to optimize operation of cascade dams

18285,determination of the effects of cascade dams on benthic microbial ecosystem is essential for dam regulation and ecological function protection however no comprehensive investigation has yet shown the ecosystem level responses of microbiota to dam impoundments this study conducted dna metabarcoding and microbial food web analysis for multiple species and their interrelationships along a cascade dam affected river the composition distribution and diversity of bacteria protozoans and metazoans were obviously different between river and reservoirs mainly controlled by hydrological p 0 01 and nutrient parameters p 0 05 those three groups make up a co occurrence network with most edges direct from higher to lower trophic levels or vice versa and more than 50 keystones participate in the food web indicating the significant role of predator prey relationships based on the microbial food web analysis the predator biomass especially at higher trophic levels decreased by about 10 from the riverine to the lacustrine system the structural equation model illustrates that both bottom up forces environmental factors particularly velocity and nutrient concentrations and top down forces higher trophic levels critically control microbial food web patterns p 0 05 as a result of dam impoundments the lower velocity in the reservoirs has direct negative effects on trophic transfer efficiencies that may be further magnified by nutrient accumulation probably leading to an increase of eutrophication and posing a risk to water quality the results suggest the potential ecological risk in the reservoirs and highlight the need to consider from the perspective of ecosystem during the operation of cascade dams graphical abstract image 1 keywords cascade dams multi species microbial food web dna metabarcoding ecological impacts 1 introduction dams are constructed in global rivers for reasons such as energy generation water supply and flood control latrubesse et al 2017 they are considered as the most severe anthropogenic disturbance affecting the integrity of river ecosystems chen and olden 2017 unlike individual dams cascade dams typically exhibit cumulative effects on the stream network within a river basin or larger region leading to river fragmentation hydrologic variation and sediment siltation duan et al 2016 kondolf et al 2014 as a result of dam

microbiota plays a central role in pollutant degradation and is responsible for many ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycle regulation and environmental indication falkowski et al 2008 hartman et al 2008 revealing the responses of benthic microbiota to reservoir impoundments can help us better understand the cascade dam induced ecological impacts and potential ecological risk biological responses to environmental stresses can occur at the individual population community and ecosystem levels it has been reported that cascade dams have profound effects on individual movement population reproduction community structure and ecosystem functions of riparian floras macro invertebrates and migratory fishes fan et al 2015 a recent study found that bacterial community in riparian sediments responded sensitively to multiple dams chen et al 2018 demonstrating the potential effects of cascade dams on benthic microbiota however the fundamental role of microbiota in ecological functions is attributed not only to bacteria but also to other components of microbial ecosystem such as micro eukaryotic communities kamp et al 2015 to clarify the ecosystem level responses of microbial

limitations development in dna metabarcoding approaches and bioinformatic pipelines presents a solution to above limitations the efficiency and accuracy of these methods have been verified by comparison with morphology based identification or with known community composition deiner et al 2016 elbrecht et al 2017 dna metabarcoding projects have concluded that different species do not usually respond synchronously to environmental changes and this lack of synchronization will result in community reorganization and ecological variations comte et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 for these reasons it is of vital importance to shift from an autecological perspective to the consideration of multi species variations using dna metabarcoding considering from the ecosystem perspective biological responses to environmental changes do not typically occur in isolation instead these responses are connected with others at the same or adjacent trophic levels including mutualistic predatory and parasitic rocha et al 2019 dam closure can have considerable impacts on interactions among food webs which may amplify the direct effects of cascade dams power et al 1996 even when the focus is on target species rather than whole ecosystems a food web perspective is necessary because each species depends critically on its resources prey and potential predators kergunteuil et al 2019 power et al 1995 in food webs changes at lower trophic levels could induce bottom up effects through ecological networks and may induce feedback processes top down controls may also occur and can strongly influence and modify community responses therefore characterization of trophic interactions in the food webs can better illustrate the ecosystem level responses to environmental changes the microbial food web is considered as the basis of ecological processes by controlling the biomass of primary producers and increasing the flow of energy and materials stock et al 2014 recent studies have demonstrated environmental controls on microbial food web structure trophic transfer efficiency and their response to disturbances such as thermal stratification and nutrient enrichment domingues et al 2017 palijan and balkic 2018 to better identify food web patterns ecologists have utilized different techniques to quantify interaction strengths routinely measuring turnover rates to estimate ecological efficiency or production rate is highly difficult so simplifications are typically made the predator prey biomass ratio ppbr a proxy for trophic transfer efficiency is widely used to illustrate microbial food web patterns in various aquatic ecosystems garcia comas et al 2016 reczuga et al 2018 yang et al 2018 however the traditional methods to determine predator and prey biomass are time consuming and labor intensive recently yang et al 2018 took advantage of dna metabarcoding to obtain diversity estimates of predator flagellates and prey bacteria by extracting data for operational taxonomic units otus from 16s to 18s rdna pools thus dna metabarcoding may be useful in microbial food web analysis and may provide higher resolution ecological data the main objective of this study was to clarify the ecosystem level responses of benthic microbiota to cascade dam impoundments for this purpose analyses were carried out to 1 investigate the composition distribution and diversity of multiple species along a representative cascade dam affected river using dna metabarcoding 2 find out how the environmental changes due to dam impoundments can control microbial communities 3 determine the interactions among multi trophic level species and quantify the direct and indirect effects of bottom up and top down controls on the overall microbial food web this study gives a holistic description of the influence of cascade dams on benthic ecosystem and suggests the potential ecological risk providing a baseline for conservation purposes of dam regulation and ecological function 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area sampling and environmental variables the hanjiang river located between 106 and 114 e and 30 40 n is the longest tributary of the yangtze river connecting the yangtze river and the silk road economic belt hanjiang river occupies significant position in advancing the belt and road initiative the middle lower hanjiang river is a typical basin affected by cascade dams and was selected as the study region song et al 2018 to date four dams are in operation along the middle lower reaches and three remaining dams of the proposed series of cascade dams will be completed in the next decades due to the impoundment the upper reaches of each dam are transformed from lotic to lentic conditions the lacustrine and riverine systems were included as sampling sites to represent the conditions with or without the effects of dam impoundments respectively the lacustrine sites l1 l4 located in the danjiangkou reservoir wangfuzhou reservoir cuijiaying reservoir and xinglong reservoir and the riverine sites r1 r11 are distributed along the flowing river from upstream to downstream fig 1 given that the construction of dams has greatly delayed and attenuated seasonal and interannual streamflow variability of rivers winemiller et al 2016 the seasonal variability is less significant compared to dam impoundments and is thereby not taken into consideration sampling was conducted in june 2018 at each site water samples were collected in triplicate using pre cleaned polyethylene bottles and were subsequently stored at 4 c the surface sediment samples top 0 10 cm were obtained in triplicate from different locations 1 m apart from each other and were well mixed and homogenized half of the sediment samples were stored at 4 c for later physicochemical analysis and the other half were stored at 80 c for dna extraction a total of 26 environmental variables were measured as listed in table s1 at the time of sample collection velocity temperature ph value conductivity dissolved oxygen do and transparency were measured in situ using a portable doppler flow meter dpl ls12 and a hach hq30d portable meter hach company loveland co usa the other variables were analyzed in the laboratory the concentrations of total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn were determined using total phosphorus and total nitrogen analyzer npw 160 hach nitrogen nutrients in sediment samples were extracted with 2 m kcl using a 1 10 sediment extractant ratio from lyophilized sediments and then measured together with ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n in water samples using a continuous flow injection analyzer quickchem 8500 hach the concentrations of microelements were measured using an icp oes thermo scientific icap 7000 plus the environmental variables were refined using principal component analysis pca and were divided into velocity water physical parameters water organics water nutrients water microelements sediment nutrients and sediment microelements 2 2 dna metabarcoding and bioinformatical analysis to identify and estimate changes in the relative abundances of multiple microbial communities we employed high throughput sequencing and environmental dna metabarcoding briefly dna was extracted and purified from 0 5 g sediment samples using the powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc carlsbad ca united states according to the manufacturer s instructions the dna integrity was checked by gel electrophoresis and the samples were stored at 20 c until amplification and sequencing the v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna gene was targeted to analyze bacterial sequences using the barcode and adapter linked primers 341f and 806r yu et al 2005 sequencing of environmental dna using a taxonomic marker such as 18s rrna can provide a broad taxonomic overview of the eukaryotic communities drummond et al 2015 the universal eukaryotic primers tareuk454fwd1 5 ccagcascygcggtaattcc 3 and tareukrev3 5 actttcgttcttgatyra 3 were used to amplify 380 bp fragments that covered the complete v4 region of the eukaryotic 18s rrna gene stoeck et al 2010 the pcr reactions were prepared according to standard conditions for transstart fastpfu dna polymerase using a pcr cycler abi geneamp 9700 amplifications were done in a total solution volume of solution of 20 μl which was composed of 4 μl 5 fastpfu buffer 2 μl 2 5 mm dntps 0 8 μl forward primer 5 μm 0 8 μl reverse primer 5 μm 0 4 μl fastpfu polymerase 10 ng template dna and ddh2o to 20 μl pcr cycling was performed as performed as 95 c for 5 min followed by 27 cycles of denaturation at 95 c for 30 s annealing at 55 c for 30 s and extension at 72 c for 45 s followed by a final extension at 72 c for 10 min raw forward and reverse reads were overlapped and any reads not containing the primers were discarded sequences containing uncalled bases were also discarded the remaining sequences were quality filtered and chimeras were identified and filtered using qiime v 1 9 1 caporaso et al 2010b fasta files were generated based on the remaining sequences sequences were clustered into otus using the uclust clustering method edgar 2010 and disallowing singletons with defined pairwise sequence identify cut off of 97 taxonomy was assigned by comparison to the silva 132 database quast et al 2013 using blast with default settings representative otus were aligned against the same reference database using pynast caporaso et al 2010a finally the otu table that excluded any sequences that failed to align with pynast was referred to as the final otu table otu tables of bacteria and eukaryotes were obtained and the protozoan and metazoan otu tables were further extracted from the eukaryotic otu table 2 3 statistical analysis α diversity indexes of bacteria protozoan and metazoan communities were separately calculated in r v 3 5 1 http www r project org with the vegan package to examine the difference of microbial α diversity between lacustrine and riverine systems one factor analysis of variance one way anova test was performed using ibm spss statistics 22 0 chicago il usa differences in microbial community composition β diversity were determined by computing the pairwise bray curtis distances using vegan package in r to assess the cluster patterns of microbial communities we compared the similarity of bacterial protozoan and metazoan communities between lacustrine and riverine systems and among different parts of the flowing river using non metric multidimensional scaling nmds then permutational manova permanova was performed based on 999 permutations with the adonis function of the vegan in r to assess significance stamp v2 1 3 parks et al 2014 was used to compare samples organized into lacustrine and riverine groups and to obtain statistically significant differential taxonomic abundance mantel tests were conducted to determine the main factors that control bacteria protozoan and metazoan communities co occurrence network analysis was used to illustrate the correlations among multi species otus with relative abundances above 2 6 and 3 for bacteria protozoans and metazoans respectively were selected the network was filtered to include only correlations with a coefficient rho 0 6 and a statistical significance p 0 01 barberán et al 2011 the network was visualized using gephi software and revealed the 178 nodes with significant local similarity correlations the overall topological indices including the number of nodes and edges degree density modularity average clustering coefficient and average path length were computed using gephi newman 2003 additionally an identically sized random network was generated based on the erdӧs réyni model erdos and r rényi 1960 and the topological properties of this network were calculated using igraph packages in r 2 4 microbial food web analysis to characterize the microbial food web pattern predator diversity estimates were extracted from the pool of otus affiliated with common trophically linked species according to the literature parry 2004 weitere et al 2018 following the method of yang et al 2018 heterotrophic flagellates hf are the dominant protozoan predators of bacteria in aquatic systems and amoeba could feed on attached bacteria ciliates are another protozoan group that effectively feed on bacteria and their larger cell sizes allow them to prey on flagellates and small ciliates meiofauna make up the higher trophic level in which nematoda and rotifera are the dominant predators in most benthic systems for the bacterial community two functional groups were considered autotrophic cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria excluding cyanobacteria yang et al 2018 only heterotrophic bacteria hb were included in the microbial food web analysis due to their dominant roles in benthic heterotrophic food web hillebrand et al 2002 we used the predator prey biomass ratio as a proxy of trophic transfer efficiency among different trophic levels the number of copies per individual is influenced by their size and biomass so we used the number of reads to represent fractional biomass rather than abundance in terms of individuals singh et al 2019 trophic transfer efficiency between protozoan and bacterial groups was calculated as hf hb amoeba hb and ciliates hb and transfer efficiency within the protozoan community was calculated as ciliates hf although nematoda and rotifera are the most widely reported predators other meiofauna can also feed on bacteria and protozoans therefore trophic transfer efficiency from bacteria to meiofauna was represented as meiofauna hb and that from protozoan to meiofauna was calculated as meiofauna protozoan meiofauna hf amoeba ciliates to further explore the top down and bottom up controls of microbial food web we used a structural equation model sem to determine the direct and indirect paths among environmental predictors and trophic transfer efficiencies the sem model was constructed using amos v 22 spss chicago il usa and the regression weights correlations and covariances were estimated based on maximum likelihood discrepancy indices were also calculated including chi aquare tset χ2 df incremental fit index ifi comparative fitting index cfi expected cross validation index ecvi akaike information criterion aic bayesian information criterion bic and consistent akaike information criterion caic to test if the model represent a complex set of theoretical hypothesis west et al 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 responses of multiple species to cascade dam impoundments we first analyzed the composition distribution and diversity variations of bacteria protozoans and metazoans affected by dam impoundments after dna metabarcoding and bioinformatic analysis a total of 24330 and 5063 otus were detected for bacteria and eukaryotes respectively proteobacteria 49 71 firmicutes 10 46 and actinobacteria 9 02 dominate the bacterial community at the genus level two clusters are observed with obvious compositional discrimination and are almost in accordance with the lacustrine and riverine groups fig s1 indicating the discrimination of bacterial composition between these systems comparative analysis of the dominant bacterial compositions with or without dam effects fig s2 showed that most bacterial genus taxa significantly decrease p 0 05 from riverine to lacustrine system but reyranella deinococcus and lysobacter are much abundant in reservoirs than in the riverine sites p 0 05 eukaryotic community composition and distribution were determined and are displayed in fig 2 more than 99 of the eukaryotes are protozoans and metazoans the protozoan community is dominated by sar 56 51 including stramenopiles alveolates and rhizaria followed by archaeplastida 34 35 and amoebozoa 4 98 for the metazoan community bilateria 99 74 is dominant including taxa such as chordata arthropoda rotifera and nematoda the eukaryotic community composition is largely consistent with previous molecular or morphological based studies gong et al 2015 scheckenbach et al 2010 demonstrating the availability and efficiency of dna metabarcoding the eukaryotic composition in the lacustrine and riverine systems also shows discrimination based on the hierarchical clustering fig 2 more stramenopile maxillopoda and rhabdocoela are obtained in riverine sites with more gnathostomata presents in reservoirs fig s2 the α diversity indices of bacteria protozoans and metazoans are shown in table s1 most indices showed an overall increase trend along the riverine sites from upstream to downstream while obviously decrease in the reservoirs the relative lower abundance richness and diversity in the reservoirs indicate the potential negative effects of dam impoundments on microbial communities a trend also observed in other cascade dam affected rivers chen et al 2018 wang et al 2018 based on the results of one way anova test table 1 all the α diversity estimators of bacteria and most of the indices for protozoans and metazoans exhibit statistically significant discrimination p 0 05 between lacustrine and riverine systems it seems that the discriminations between reservoir and river locations are more pronounced for bacterial community compared with those of higher trophic level species the results of nmds analysis and permanova test indicate that bacteria protozoans and metazoans all exhibit different geographic patterns with samples collected in the reservoirs and river clustering separately fig 3 a c e and showing dramatic variations between the two systems p 0 01 comparison of the different parts of the flowing river separated by cascade dams reveals that the microbial communities also show obvious cluster patterns fig 3 b d f especially bacteria p 0 025 r2 0 42 and protozoans p 0 006 r2 0 48 therefore in addition to the discrimination between river and reservoirs microbial communities also exhibit significant fragmentation from upstream to downstream locations these results are supported by reports of the discontinuity of vegetation and fish along the dam affected rivers suggesting that extensive fragmentation may change community compositions and distributions cooper et al 2016 jansson et al 2000 3 2 primary factors influencing benthic microbial communities the physiochemical parameters of water and sediment samples from the 15 sampling sites are shown in table s2 we can see that velocity do and codmn tend to increase from upstream to downstream and significantly decrease in the reservoir sites l1 l4 the nutrient concentrations including tp tn nh4 n and no3 n in both the water and the sediment samples are much higher in the lacustrine system than in the adjacent riverine system additionally a gradually increasing trend of these nutrient parameters is detected from upper to lower reaches likely due to the nutrient input resulting from anthropogenic activities li et al 2016 the observed values are in agreement with previous investigations indicating that cascade dams could result in hydrology variation and nutrient accumulation in the reservoirs fan et al 2015 the mantel test result table 2 and canonical correlation analysis cca plots fig s3 demonstrate different correlations of environmental variables with bacteria protozoans and metazoans respectively the bacterial community is mainly controlled by hydrology related parameters such as velocity r 0 54 p 0 001 do r 0 38 p 0 008 and transparency r 0 27 p 0 023 due to the transformation from lotic to lentic condition the associated stressor regime including higher water level longer hydraulic retention time and lower flow velocity will affect the composition relative abundance and distribution of microbial communities battin et al 2003 li et al 2015 protozoan and metazoan groups are more correlated p 0 05 with nutrient parameters tp tn no3 n in both the water and the sediment probably due to their direct and indirect participation in material cycles and sensitivity to nutrient variations kamp et al 2015 collectively these results reveal that multi species exhibit distinct patterns that are predictable from a variety of abiotic variables overall understanding the responses of different species to environmental variations is necessary to improve our ability to predict the impact of cascade dams on benthic ecosystem 3 3 interactions among bacteria protozoans and metazoans a co occurrence network was constructed to reveal association within microbial communities and elucidates the potential ecologically meaningful interactions between taxa the underlying hypothesis is therefore that ecological interactions produce correlations and relational patterns in the abundance of microbiota layeghifard et al 2017 the network consists 178 nodes with 83 bacterial otus 41 protozoan otus and 54 metazoan otus with 2276 edges and a mean of 25 57 edges per node fig 4 the topological properties were calculated to describe the complex relationships among multiple species the real co occurrence network has an average path length of 4 11 with a clustering coefficient of 0 414 and modularity index of 0 679 suggesting that the network has a modular structure compared with the separately generated random network with average path length of 1 88 and clustering coefficient of 0 14 the real network is more significantly clustered and forms a small world in order to figure out what species are significantly correlated we used different color of edge to represent their two endpoints it is interesting to find that the color patterns of one endpoint fig 4 a are obviously different from the other fig 4 b indicating that lots of edges target from higher to lower trophic level species or vice versa that is to say the significantly correlated species are usually from different trophic levels we also found that more than 50 keystones of the network participate in the microbial food web based on these analysis predator prey relationships may be the most significant interactions among microbiota these results are supported by a recent review article bjorbækmo et al 2019 demonstrating that predation is the most common protist interaction food web networks have been used to illustrate the predator prey relations dunne et al 2002 analyzed a broad range of high quality food webs finding higher connectivity and much smaller size of food web networks compared to other networks most of the topological properties determined here such as the clustering coefficients 0 414 and their ratios between the real and random network 2 96 are in accordance with most of the food web networks emphasizing again a significant role of trophic interrelationships in the microbiota however there are some differences which may suggest that not all otus included in our network are dominant in microbial food web and exhibit predator prey relationships thus microbial food web analysis was further conducted to better understand the trophic relationships among microbiota and their responses to environmental changes 3 4 bottom up and top down controls in microbial food web we focused on the primary components of the microbial food web including hb hf amoeba ciliates and meiofauna with nematoda and rotifera as the most representative species the abundance of hb is much higher than autotrophic bacteria table s3 especially in the reservoir sites demonstrating their dominant role in heterotrophic food web once again the discriminations of food web component abundances between lacustrine and riverine systems are shown in fig 5 hb and hf show little variations between the two systems while other predators decrease by about 10 from river to reservoirs especially at the highest trophic levels previous studies have demonstrated a systematic difference in the average sensitivity of species among trophic levels for example in a microcosm containing aquatic microbes warming greatly increased herbivore and predator extinction frequencies but there was little effect on producers and bacterivores petchey et al 1999 our results suggest that the impoundments of cascade dams might impact the food web pattern and thereby change the biomass of microbial food web components particularly at higher trophic levels to further explore how the microbial food web pattern is influenced a sem was used to disentangle the relationships of trophic transfer efficiencies with environmental factors and uncover the interactions among multiple trophic levels fig 6 the sem exhibits a reasonable fit based on the good fit indices with χ2 df 1 220 1 3 ifi 0 925 0 90 and cfi 0 905 0 90 additionally ecvi aic bic and caic increase from the default to saturated and then to independence model the direct indirect and total effects of all the variables were calculated and are presented in table s4 the sem revealed that both bottom up resource availability and top down predation forces critically control the microbial food web with distinct and sometime interactive effects domingues et al 2017 the ratios of amoeba hb r 0 46 p 0 04 ciliate hb r 0 57 p 0 11 and meiofauna protozoan r 0 70 p 0 002 are all directly and positively correlated with velocity and the hf hb ratio is negatively related r 0 56 p 0 001 the vital role of flow velocity in controlling predator prey interactions was demonstrated by leonard et al 1998 who focused on marine intertidal communities and observed greater predator density at high flow sites compared to low flow sites our results suggest that the microbial food web may similarly respond to hydrologic variations low velocity may restrain the reproduction of the bacterial community and limit the dispersal and predation of protozoans and meiofauna thereby leading to a decrease of trophic transfer efficiencies shimeta et al 2001 surprisingly although direct positive effects of velocity on most trophic transfer efficiencies were observed some of the standardized total effects are negative table s4 this may suggest that hydrologic condition not only acts as a non negligible bottom up force it may also control the strength of interactions among trophic levels to change food web patterns leonard et al 1998 for instance in addition to the direct effects of velocity the indirect cascading effects are substantially stronger for amoeba hb r 0 53 and ciliates hb r 0 60 through the interaction between meiofauna and protozoans therefore top down forces may exert larger effects on trophic transfer efficiencies from heterotrophic bacteria to amoeba and ciliates compared with the impacts of environmental parameters based on the standardized total effects table s4 almost all the predator prey ratios are negatively affected by nutrient levels in both water and sediment p 0 05 the generally lower trophic transfer efficiencies with increasing nutrient concentration were also observed in previous study pernthaler 2005 demonstrating that bacteria are more tightly controlled by competition for nutrients instead of predation in more productive waters however these suggestions are somewhat inconsistent with the results of thelaus et al 2008 who observed an increase in the ratio of protozoan and bacteria biomass from nutrient poor to nutrient rich conditions by both food web model simulation and meta analysis this difference could be explained by the special habitat formed by dam impoundments nutrient concentration is not the only variable influencing microbial food web pattern in our study reiterating the significant role of hydrology trophic transfer from bacteria to protozoans and metazoans is an important mechanism of nutrient regeneration particularly of nitrogen and phosphorus pernthaler 2005 attributed to dam impoundments the obviously decreased velocity and accumulated nutrients may restrain the trophic transfer efficiencies and thereby aggravate eutrophication with potential threaten to water quality within the reservoirs our data suggest the interaction of environmental parameters with shifts in top down and bottom up control to affect microbial food web structure the lowest trophic level hf hb has little influence on higher trophic levels only exerting direct effect on ciliate hb r 0 436 p 0 09 high total effects of meiofauna protozoan amoeba hb and ciliates hb on other trophic transfer ratios indicate a strong regulating role of protozoans and meiofauna in microbiota as documented previously ozen et al 2018 weitere et al 2018 the network fig 4 depicts most of the significant correlations are between different trophic level species could also be verified future work could expand to consider the variation of food web interactions not just correlations with short intermediate and long term hydrologic changes in a more comprehensive framework 4 conclusions overall this study indicates that cascade dam impoundments can change the composition distribution and diversity of benthic bacteria protozoans and metazoans as the result of primary control by hydrologic and nutrient variables microbiota exhibits obvious predator prey relationships both bottom up forces environmental factors and top down forces higher trophic levels are critical to control microbial food web patterns the obviously decreased velocity and accumulated nutrients can restrain the trophic transfer efficiencies and may thereby aggravate eutrophication with potential threaten to water quality within the reservoirs given that dams are used to regulate most of the world s rivers there may be examples of how extensive fragmentation of river systems may have caused similar obstructions to organism interaction and ecological function we emphasize the importance of evaluating ecosystem level effects of dam impoundments on benthic microbiota to optimize operation of cascade dams

18286,nitrate no3 fate estimates in turbulent karst pathways are lacking due in part to the difficulty of accessing remote subsurface environments to address this knowledge and methodological gap we collected no3 δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 data for 65 consecutive days during a low flow period from within a phreatic conduit and its terminal end point a spring used for drinking water to simulate nitrogen n fate within the karst conduit the authors developed a numerical model of no3 isotope dynamics during low flow data show an increase in no3 from 1 78 to 1 87 mg n l 1 p 10 4 coincident with a decrease in δ 15nno3 from 7 7 to 6 8 p 10 3 as material flows from within the conduit to the spring modeling results indicate that the nitrification of isotopically lighter ammonium δ 15nnh4 acts as a mechanism for an increase in no3 that coincides with a decrease in δ 15nno3 further numerical modeling assists with quantifying isotopic overprinting of nitrification on denitrification i e coincident no3 production during removal by constraining the rates of the two processes modeled denitrification fluxes within the karst conduit 67 0 19 0 mg n m 2 d 1 are an order of magnitude greater than laminar ground water pathways 1 10 mg n m 2 d 1 and an order of magnitude less than surface water systems 100 1000 mg n m 2 d 1 in this way karst conduits are a unique interface of the processes and gradients that control both surface and ground water end points this study shows the efficacy of ambient n stable isotope data to reflect n transformations in subsurface karst and highlights the usefulness of stable isotopes to assist with water quality numerical modeling in karst lastly we provide a rare if not unique estimate of n fate in subsurface conduits and provide a counterpoint to the paradigm that karst conduits are conservative source to sink conveyors graphical abstract image 1 keywords karst biogeochemistry sediment water quality nutrient cycling denitrification 1 introduction karst topography covers approximately 12 of the earth s surface and provides drinking water resources to nearly a quarter of the world s population ford and williams 2007 karst landscapes are developed by the dissolution of chemically soluble bedrock leading to the formation of sinking streams sinkholes caves and fracture networks white 2002 these dissolution features provide low resistance pathways for water sediment and contaminants thus posing an environmental risk to downstream waterbodies one such landscape agricultural karst terrain is particularly susceptible to contamination as recent anthropogenic activity has increased the availability of reactive nitrogen n and consequently the potential for eutrophication ford et al 2019 heffernan et al 2012 husic et al 2019a 2019b however the fate of reactive n in karst sinking streams caves and conduits is lacking in the scientific literature previous studies neglect or marginalize n transformations in sinking streams and turbulent karst conduits e g mahler and garner 2009 mccormack et al 2016 perrin et al 2007 these studies argue that because of high flow velocities karst conduits can be treated as conservative source to sink conveyors recent study has suggested that a reformulation of this conservative assumption is needed first epigenetic karst conduits often contain terrestrially derived sediment deposits and biofilms capable of mediating dissolved n transformations simon et al 2007 second researchers have noted the presence of sediment bound bacterial communities in karst caves and their potential to process terrestrially derived nitrate no3 ammonium nh4 dissolved organic n don sediment organic n son and dinitrogen gas n2 heffernan et al 2012 henson et al 2017 these bacterial communities can drive nitrification nh4 no3 mineralization don son nh4 denitrification no3 n2 and immobilization nh4 son reactions the conservative transport assumption could lead to inaccurate estimates of the availability of reactive n which may have worrisome consequences related to the occurrence of harmful algal blooms and the operation of municipal water systems denitrification as the permanent removal pathway of no3 affects ecosystem and biogeochemical cycles at local regional and global scales and is influenced by the spatiotemporal variability of ecological hydrological and geomorphological processes seitzinger et al 2006 primary drivers of denitrification include the availability of no3 organic carbon c and oxygen as well as particle size and hyporheic exchange boyer et al 2006 dähnke and thamdrup 2013 given these drivers rivers typically have the highest processing rates while groundwater pathways have the lowest seitzinger et al 2006 in this way karst conduits are a unique interface that combines processes and gradients that control surface stream and groundwater end points despite these unique features the net role of the conduit pathway towards removal is not well known the magnitude of no3 removal in karst conduits relative to other pathways may serve as an indicator of the net role of karst topography in global n cycling and be of interest to water quality managers to quantify the aforementioned processes in turbulent karst conduits collection of daily n samples from multiple points along the karst conduit seems a logical approach and many previous studies in surface streams use this method e g see review in birgand et al 2007 however karst conduits positioned many meters below the ground surface can be difficult to locate access and instrument for this reason karst methods generally lag behind their surface counterparts hartmann et al 2014 one advantage of the present study is that the primary conduit has already been located using electrical resistivity testing at a location 5 km upstream of the spring and was intersected by 3 groundwater wells allowing for convenient sample collection zhu et al 2011 the terminal resurgence of this conduit is at the largest spring in the bluegrass region of kentucky where it serves as the primary municipal drinking water source for 13 000 people in georgetown ky this study set up provides an opportunity to collect unique data sets to assess the impact of in conduit no3 transformations on the drinking water source ambient n stable isotopes have proven useful in surface and subsurface systems for separating sources of organic matter and nutrients husic et al 2019a 2017a elucidating denitrification processes heffernan et al 2012 and assisting with the reduction of

one form to another microbes prefer to utilize the isotopically lighter 14n which imparts a fractionation ε effect on the remaining substrate leading to an enrichment in the substrate s δ 15n signature previous karst studies have used ambient n isotopes to infer the existence of denitrification processes e g albertin et al 2012 heffernan et al 2012 however no studies to our knowledge use continuous daily sampling of δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 to estimate n transformations within a karst conduit the use of coupled elemental and isotopic data sets together with process based numerical modeling shows promise for improving predictions of n fate and water quality in karst jensen et al 2018 numerical modeling can provide a continuous estimate of integrated processes within a study section provided inputs and outputs are measured and knowledge of hydrodynamic behavior in the testbed is known additionally including stable isotope data streams adds an additional set of equations without additional unknowns and allows for the reduction of equifinality and improvement in model predictions ford et al 2017 further numerical modeling of isotope dynamics allows for the estimation of the isotopic overprinting of nitrification on denitrification i e coincident no3 production during removal which can better inform removal rates granger and wankel 2016 literature exists for models of karst hydrology palanisamy and workman 2014 sediment transport husic et al 2017b and no3 concentration ford et al 2019 however no studies to our knowledge have focused on numerical modeling of δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 fate in karst overall the objective of this study was to estimate the cycling and removal of n from within the sediment bed of a karst conduit we collected 65 consecutive days of stable isotope δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 data from within a subsurface conduit and at its terminal endpoint a spring used for drinking water sample collection coincided with a two month low flow period during which internal cycling controlled n dynamics as surface derived water e g flow into sinkholes was excluded from the study section thereafter we constructed a numerical model coupling elemental and stable isotope mass balance equations and explored whether the integration of stable isotope data help to constrain model predictions and isotopic overprinting we provide estimates of the rate of no3 removal within karst conduits and provide a counterpoint to the paradigm that karst conduits are conservative source to sink conveyors 2 study site and materials 2 1 study site the royal spring

the phreatic conduit linearly interpolated from sample to sample at 1 h intervals provided an upstream model boundary condition for no3 δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 inputs to the study section we consider a 6 lateral inflow of water based on earlier dye tracing work adams 2019 from the phreatic conduit to the royal spring we parameterized the no3 δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 of this inflow as the mean 2 standard deviations of all low flow data collected during this study as the land use distribution i e horse farms and hay pasture in the lower 6 of the spring basin is the same as the distribution in the upper

and we assume this relationship also holds for low flows lastly we evaluate model performance by comparing measured no3 and δ15nno3 values at royal spring with model simulated results 3 2 2 model

conduit bed and release stored nh4 or no3 equations for each of these reactions are shown in the supplemental information table s1 and their respective terms are defined therein finally only the relevant transformations enumerated in equation 3 are applied to each n pool for example if considering mass balance changes to the don pool the denitrification and nitrification terms would effectively equal 0 as they do not directly impact the mass of don the cycling of n between oxidation states is recognized to discriminate in favor of lighter isotopes in a process termed fractionation kendall et al 2007 the isotopic mass balance accounting for mixing of sources and biogeochemical transformations through space and time was modeled as 4 δ i j n δ i 1 j n x i 1 j n δ i n

parameterized ranges for nh4 concentration c nh4 don concentration c don and don n stable isotope composition δ 15 n don for water recharging the conduit husic 2018 husic et al 2019b using an aggregated range reported by kendall et al 2007 we placed bounds on the possible values of the nh4 n stable isotope composition δ 15 n nh4 of conduit recharge forty four of the 65 daily samples occurred during low flow periods defined as 10 or more consecutive days of baseflow i e 0 3 m3 s 1 these 44 samples provided the data for statistical model evaluation for normally distributed data a two tailed t test α 0 05 was used to assess differences between upstream and downstream constituent composition for non normal data the non parametric mann whitney rank sum test α 0 05 was used instead we evaluated normality using the kolmogorov smirnov test the no3 and δ 15 n no3 data sets were randomly divided into calibration and validation sets of equal cardinality we evaluated no3 and δ 15 n no3 model performance using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 5 n s e 1 t 1 t q m t q o t 2 t 1 t q m t q o 2 where t is the total number of observations q o t is the observed value at time t q m t is the modeled value at time t and q o is the mean of all observed values the nse ranges from to 1 with 1 indicating a perfect match of modeled results to data and 0 indicating that the model provides no more predictive capability than the mean of observed data moriasi et al 2007 the minimum objective criteria for modeled no3 nseno3 and δ 15 n no3 nseδ15n were set at 0 3 and 0 0 respectively nseδ18o was not considered as the data do not show a discernible trend while minimum objective criteria for water and sediment are commonly reported e g moriasi et al 2007 criteria for no3 and δ 15 n no3 are not well established therefore the authors impose that the no3 and δ 15 n no3 models should be better than 0 3 and at least as good 0 0 as the mean of the data respectively we further constrained model results such that the ratio r of modeled don and nh4 concentrations exiting vs entering the conduit rdon and rnh4 respectively fall within the bounds of observed data from a historical dataset the means of these ratios are 0 7 and 0 6 see fig s1 for data respectively and due to data scarcity model simulations falling within 0 2 of these means were accepted during model evaluation husic et al 2019b further to assess the presence and impact of isotopic overprinting of nitrification on denitrification we ran several scenarios through the calibrated numerical model we tested assumptions regarding nitrification denitrification and conservative transport and assessed the impact on model statistics when including biogeochemical reactions vs excluding them the three scenarios were 1 no denitrification 2 no nitrification and 3 conservative transport i e all reaction rates set to 0 lastly we assessed model uncertainty and parameter sensitivity before and after integrating stable isotope data using the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue methodology beven 2006 glue is initiated by assuming a prior distribution for model parameters simultaneously sampling all parameters and then retaining only parameter sets that satisfy the minimum objective criteria husic et al 2019b a posterior distribution can then be constructed from the set of acceptable evaluations and uncertainty bounds can be generated for no3 and δ 15 n no3 predictions a total of 5 5 106 simulations were performed uncertainty analysis was performed on an institutionally shared high performance computing cluster with 9240 processor cores and 57 tb of total ram 3 3 nitrate removal in sinking streams to provide a comparison of no3 removal estimates in karst sediment bed to other freshwater systems we compiled published denitrification and nitrification rates studies include other karst aquifers heffernan et al 2012 karst lakes mccormack et al 2016 non karst lakes piña ochoa and álvarez cobelas 2006 streams from diverse biomes arango et al 2007 agricultural soil and groundwater anderson et al 2014 jahangir et al 2012 and global estimates for groundwater and river sediment seitzinger et al 2006 the heffernan et al 2012 study investigated 61 springs in the upper floridian aquifer usa and estimated that despite relatively low rates denitrification accounted for the removal of a considerable fraction of aquifer n inputs mccormack et al 2016 calculated denitrification in karst turloughs disappearing lakes by a mass balance calculation the study by arango et al 2007 covers numerous streams including those impacted by urban agricultural and forested land uses the studies by piña ochoa and álvarez cobelas 2006 and seitzinger et al 2006 aggregate many different denitrification estimates from all over the world only estimates made from within the sediment i e not the water column were used in calculations for this study lastly denitrification in riparian soils and deep groundwater are also estimated from numerous sites anderson et al 2014 jahangir et al 2012 we also aggregate studies of nitrification including prairie and agriculture impacted streams kemp and dodds 2002 and open channel karst caverns simon and benfield 2002 4 results and discussion 4 1 collection of ambient n stable isotope data during the 65 days of field sampling three low flow periods defined as 10 or more consecutive days of baseflow were identified figure 3 a the elevation of water in the phreatic conduit observation well was only slightly 0 5 m above the springhead elevation providing energy to drive flow downstream figure 3b temperature in the conduit decreased down gradient due to the relatively low background temperature of the aquifer t rock 13 c the differences in temperature were statistically significant p 10 3 and can be accounted for by thermal convection at the conduit wall t rock t h2o 4 c in terms of specific conductance potential ion exchange of water with the limestone bedrock caused longitudinal increase in conductivity from 601 μs cm at phreatic conduit to 608 μs cm at royal spring but the increase was not statistically significant p 0 83 this result was not surprising as other modeling studies in karst indicate that the conductivity response during transport changes half as slowly as temperature winston and criss 2004 data trends in water temperature and conductivity provide circumstantial evidence that the study section of the phreatic conduit represents a relatively closed system during low flow nitrate and ambient n stable isotope data indicate that the karst sediment bed acts as a net source of no3 during transport fig 4 while upstream inputs of no3 decreased by an average of 1 5 per day the mean concentration of no3 transported between the phreatic conduit and royal spring increased by an average of 5 from 1 78 to 1 87 mg n l 1 p 10 4 figure 4a b the biogeochemical fate of no3 in the conduit during the study period appears to be dominated by production processes rather than removal potential reasons for an increase in no3 concentration could be from the nitrification of nh4 the mineralization of organic n bound to conduit sediment or the mineralization of don net production of no3 from nh4 and don is plausible as past research has indicated that the subsurface conduit water column is relatively well oxygenated do sat 76 fig s3 and that decomposition of organic c which is tightly coupled to mineralization of organic n occurs at rates comparable to those in biochemically active surface streams husic et al 2017b coinciding with the downstream increase in no3 concentration was a decrease in δ 15 n no3 from 7 7 to 6 8 p 10 3 figure 4c d the shift towards lighter δ 15 n no3 would indicate that don son and nh4 with isotopically lighter δ 15 n don δ 15 n son and δ 15 n nh4 compositions respectively are oxidized to no3 the rate at which this oxidation of lighter δ 15 n occurs appears to outpace denitrification as one would otherwise expect to see an isotopically heavier δ 15 n signal if no3 reduction to n2 was the dominant processes possible sources for isotopically lighter δ 15 n don and δ 15 n nh4 include nh4 derived from fertilizer or precipitation δ 15 n nh4 3 7 and organic n from labile detrital and algal pools δ 15 n don 5 3 kendall et al 2007 the δ 18 o no3 data varied considerably and comparison of δ 18 o no3 at upstream and downstream sites did not show statistically significant differences p 0 48 figure 4e f the lack of an apparent trend in δ 18 o no3 does not necessarily imply that changes to δ 18 o are not coupled to changes in δ 15 n but rather the imprint of any one reaction may be masked by many other simultaneous reactions granger and wankel 2016 lastly the upstream δ 15 n no3 signature suggests that n loading to the conduit is primarily derived from a combination of soil fertilizer and manure sources with samples generally aligned with the hypothesized denitrification line figure 4g as noted earlier there is a statistically significant p 10 3 shift towards lighter δ 15 n no3 from upstream to downstream data results show that ambient n stable isotopes help to reflect n transformation in subsurface karst environments with our study adding to the body of emerging stable isotope literature jensen et al 2018 however the isotope data alone are unable to differentiate between whether this new no3 is sourced from allochthonous or autochthonous n with that in mind a numerical model provides a tool to remedy this uncertainty and to elucidate processes that are not revealed by data streams alone 4 2 isotope aided numerical modeling of nitrate fate the isotope dataset allowed for adding a second set of modeling equations without adding additional unknowns which helped constrain uncertainty and equifinality in model parameters fig 5 and table 1 after evaluating the numerical model results against the three elemental criteria nse no3 r nh4 and r don see fig 2 the posterior distribution of several parameters was reduced significantly from the assumed prior distribution figure 5a and table 1 subsequently when integrating the isotopic criteria nse δ15n the posterior distributions of the denitrification and nitrification rate constants were further constrained as was nh4 recharge to the system figure 5b reaction rates and concentrations of the inorganic n phases no3 and nh4 are relatively sensitive to model calibration see ε nitr ε den k nitr β den c nh4 rec and δ 15 n nh4 rec whereas rates and concentrations that impact the organic n phases don and son are not as sensitive see ε imm k min c don rec and δ 15 n don rec in fig 5 the lack of sensitivity in the organic n related parameters likely arises from the slower processing rates and more recalcitrant nature of don relative to nh4 and no3 isotopic fractionation parameters related to nitrification ε nitr and denitrification ε den were on the lower range reported in the literature with posterior medians of 3 8 and 2 5 respectively figure 5b the low values of ε nitr and ε den indicates that although nitrification and denitrification may occur in the subsurface these processes do not substantially fractionate the isotopic signature of their respective pools these results tend to agree with a study by heffernan et al 2012 where small ε den values of between 5 3 and 7 5 were estimated using dissolved gas data at 61 karst springs in non karst systems reported values of ε nitr and ε den can range considerably from 1 to 26 and 1 to 18 respectively and can be influenced by nutrient enzyme and diffusion limitations kendall et al 2007 and references within and whether denitrification is occurring in the water column high enrichment or within the benthic zone low enrichment dähnke and thamdrup 2013 nitrate fate and transport model results agreed well with biogeochemical data observations at royal spring and indicate that the source of the additional no3 was from autochthonous production i e the conversation of son don and nh4 to no3 rather than external allochthonous inputs figure 6 a the nse statistics for the optimal no3 model run were 0 39 and 0 28 for calibration and validation periods respectively model results are consistent with data and show longitudinal increases in no3 concentration brought on by the oxidation of don and nh4 from the phreatic conduit to royal spring the nse statistics for the optimal δ 15nno3 model run were 0 27 and 0 15 for calibration and validation periods respectively figure 6b these results are satisfactory given the complexity and difficulty of modeling isotopic n fate at the spatial and temporal resolution performed in this study modeled δ 15nno3 results are consistent with data and indicate that no3 becomes isotopically depleted in 15n during longitudinal transport from input at the upstream phreatic conduit to discharge at the terminal royal spring the model was generally not sensitive to the 6 lateral inflow from the phreatic conduit to royal spring as the quantity of the inflow to the total load was relatively small and the concentration of material was similar to existing in conduit material some disagreement between the calibrated model and data occurs when the model overestimates δ 15nno3 at the beginning of low flow period 3 this is likely associated with a process not captured by our spatially and temporally integrated model structure such as the occurrence of non stationary hot moments or hot spots that can disproportionately process matter within the time and space domains respectively krause et al 2017 for example large spatial heterogeneity in the release of nh4 or no3 from the karst bed could impact predictions this explanation is plausible as the event preceding low flow period 3 was the largest in the two month study and significant storm flow has been shown to disturb the structure of the biologically active surficial layer of the benthos which can expose previously buried material to processing ford et al 2015 numerical modeling of isotope dynamics allowed for the estimation of isotopic overprinting of nitrification on denitrification results from testing multiple scenarios i e no denitrification no nitrification and conservative transport indicate that if either nitrification or denitrification are excluded from the modeling framework no3 and δ 15nno3 results are not accurately represented fig s4 in the case of no denitrification no3 is consistently over estimated nse no3 0 36 in the case of no nitrification the δ 15nno3 signature is greatly over estimated nse δ15n 0 73 lastly with the conservative transport assumption i e all reaction rates set to 0 the model does not satisfactorily simulate the δ 15nno3 signature nse δ15n 0 38 the integration of both elemental no3 and isotopic δ 15nno3 datasets was crucial to determining the existence and relative importance of in conduit processes while our results indicates that denitrification does occur during transport its signal is not as pronounced due to concurrent no3 production by nitrification thus our numerical model allowed for the assessment of isotopic overprinting which would have otherwise masked in conduit denitrification isotope aided numerical modeling also helped to reduce uncertainty regarding the dominant processes controlling no3 fate in subsurface karst in general we found no3 elemental modeling alone that is without the integration of δ 15nno3 data could accurately represent no3 concentration at the spring but would under represent internal processing rates the additional δ 15nno3 data series revealed that the subsurface karst facilitates transformations at a greater rate than indicated by elemental no3 data alone although the increased nitrification and denitrification rates offset one another with regards to net no3 concentration there is a non linear effect of fractionation on the δ 15nno3 signature which provides the means for more accurately calibrating reaction rates pre isotope calibration rates for denitrification nitrification and mineralization were 37 6 25 0 50 3 17 9 and 29 7 9 8 mg n m 2 d 1 respectively on the other hand post isotope calibration showed elevated biogeochemical processing with denitrification nitrification and mineralization rates increasing to 67 0 19 0 79 5 12 1 and 34 1 9 3 mg n m 2 d 1 respectively immobilization rates were an order of magnitude lower 4 67 0 01 mg n m 2 d 1 and were unaffected by the isotopic calibration the increase in the estimates of denitrification and nitrification are significant p 10 4 and represent a 78 and 58 increase in processing over pre isotope estimates respectively and the variance in all rate estimates is reduced ambient n isotopes have shown success when applied to constrain no3 fate in surface systems ford et al 2017 kaown et al 2009 and our results complement this growing body of literature and show the potential of ambient n isotopes to assist with n modeling in karst groundwater 4 3 nitrate removal in sinking streams the karst conduit s no3 removal via denitrification 67 0 19 0 mg n m 2 d 1 falls between the bounds of groundwater and surface water systems fig 7 and table 2 nitrate removal in streams rivers and creeks varies significantly 100 1000 mg n m 2 d 1 and is typically greater than other ecosystems as rivers are characterized by high biochemical gradients of oxygen nutrients and organic matter arango et al 2007 piña ochoa and álvarez cobelas 2006 on the other hand groundwater 1 10 mg n m 2 d 1 and soil 10 100 mg n m 2 d 1 zones are characterized by lesser denitrification fluxes than streams rivers and creeks but constitute a greater proportion of watershed land area and have longer residence times anderson et al 2014 jahangir et al 2012 seitzinger et al 2006 in comparison to other karst systems average aquifer denitrification up gradient of springs 0 3 3 mg n m 2 d 1 and within turloughs 5 50 mg n m 2 d 1 falls within the ranges of removal found in equivalent non karst systems heffernan et al 2012 husic et al 2019b mccormack et al 2016 piña ochoa and álvarez cobelas 2006 thus karst conduits act to remove no3 at greater rates than karst and non karst soil lake and groundwater systems but at lower rates than surface streams primarily due to a lack of a consistent labile e g autotrophic carbon source zeng et al 2019 our estimation of no3 fate in karst conduits using stable isotopes and numerical modeling contextualizes the potential role and importance of conduit sediment to remove no3 from the broader nutrient cascade nitrification in the sinking stream of our study 79 5 12 1 mg n m 2 d 1 was on the higher end of rates reported in the literature which is consistent with periods of high nh4 levels observed in our system in the royal spring basin the long term average concentration of nh4 recharging the subsurface is 0 12 mg n l 1 while the concentration discharging at the spring is 0 07 mg n l 1 fig s1 however shortly prior to and during the study period high concentrations of nh4 were detected at royal spring e g may 5 1 2 mg n l 1 june 12 0 38 mg n l 1 and sept 15 0 40 mg n l 1 and in some instances such as may 5 and june 1 the water treatment plant at royal spring shut down operations due to high nh4 concentrations personal communication georgetown municipal and water sewer service 2017 likewise long term don concentrations decrease from 0 35 mg n l 1 for recharge to 0 23 mg n l 1 at the spring fig s1 which may provide an additional source of nh4 through mineralization of the organic n as has been indicated recently in other karst systems e g musgrove et al 2016 our results are consistent with other studies of agriculture impacted watersheds where maximum rates of nitrification can be up to tenfold greater than denitrification kemp and dodds 2002 and net nitrifying streams are associated with higher no3 concentrations prior studies have suggested the importance of nitrification and denitrification within the phreatic karst zone e g einsiedl and mayer 2006 musgrove et al 2016 and our study provides a quantification of its importance in the context of karst conduits given the comparatively high transformations rates indicated by stable isotopes and numerical modeling the net role of karst conduits in n cycling appears to be non conservative countering the paradigm of karst conduits as conservative conveyors of energy and nutrients the mechanism for this non conservative behavior is the presence of a terrestrially derived organically rich sediment substrate which acts as an interface for no3 removal in surface rivers these benthic interfaces are sometimes considered ecohydrological hot spots and control points where significant processing of organic matter and nutrients occurs across steep biochemical gradients bernhardt et al 2017 krause et al 2017 thus it is reasonable that the no3 removal rate in karst conduits 67 0 19 0 mg n m 2 d 1 falls between surface 100 1000 mg n m 2 d 1 and subsurface 1 10 mg n m 2 d 1 systems as conduits act as an intermediary pathway that mediate terrestrial loading of riverine organic matter with subterranean leaching of nutrients further support for the relative removal efficiency of karst is provided in a study by piña ochoa and álvarez cobelas 2006 analyzing the qualitative factors influencing denitrification i e light conditions presence of plants oxygen levels organic c quality total phosphorus concentrations and nitrate levels piña ochoa and álvarez cobelas 2006 conclude that low light conditions the absence of plants low oxygen within anaerobic sediment pockets low phosphorus high organic c and high nitrate are correlated with increased denitrification rates the present karst systems fits all but the phosphorus criteria given the combination of factors that include buffered loading to the conduit mixing with the sediment substrate and high background aquifer no3 levels it is highly plausible that the karst conduit is an efficient denitrifying system to conclude karst conduit pathways that are well recharged by surface derived organic material are likely non conservative and should be considered as such when accounting for n fate and constructing n budgets 5 conclusions 1 the karst sinking stream s no3 removal falls between the bounds of groundwater systems and surface water systems providing a counterpoint to the paradigm that karst conduits are conservative source to sink conveyors 2 nitrogen concentration and isotope data results show that the karst conduit acts as a net source of no3 via nitrification of soil organic n and fertilizer adding to the emerging body of ambient n isotope literature for estimating n fate 3 the isotope aided numerical model reduced uncertainty when estimating no3 removal and quantified isotopic overprinting for the karst sinking stream adding to the growing body of literature on the usefulness of isotope aided methods to assist

18286,nitrate no3 fate estimates in turbulent karst pathways are lacking due in part to the difficulty of accessing remote subsurface environments to address this knowledge and methodological gap we collected no3 δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 data for 65 consecutive days during a low flow period from within a phreatic conduit and its terminal end point a spring used for drinking water to simulate nitrogen n fate within the karst conduit the authors developed a numerical model of no3 isotope dynamics during low flow data show an increase in no3 from 1 78 to 1 87 mg n l 1 p 10 4 coincident with a decrease in δ 15nno3 from 7 7 to 6 8 p 10 3 as material flows from within the conduit to the spring modeling results indicate that the nitrification of isotopically lighter ammonium δ 15nnh4 acts as a mechanism for an increase in no3 that coincides with a decrease in δ 15nno3 further numerical modeling assists with quantifying isotopic overprinting of nitrification on denitrification i e coincident no3 production during removal by constraining the rates of the two processes modeled denitrification fluxes within the karst conduit 67 0 19 0 mg n m 2 d 1 are an order of magnitude greater than laminar ground water pathways 1 10 mg n m 2 d 1 and an order of magnitude less than surface water systems 100 1000 mg n m 2 d 1 in this way karst conduits are a unique interface of the processes and gradients that control both surface and ground water end points this study shows the efficacy of ambient n stable isotope data to reflect n transformations in subsurface karst and highlights the usefulness of stable isotopes to assist with water quality numerical modeling in karst lastly we provide a rare if not unique estimate of n fate in subsurface conduits and provide a counterpoint to the paradigm that karst conduits are conservative source to sink conveyors graphical abstract image 1 keywords karst biogeochemistry sediment water quality nutrient cycling denitrification 1 introduction karst topography covers approximately 12 of the earth s surface and provides drinking water resources to nearly a quarter of the world s population ford and williams 2007 karst landscapes are developed by the dissolution of chemically soluble bedrock leading to the formation of sinking streams sinkholes caves and fracture networks white 2002 these dissolution features provide low resistance pathways for water sediment and contaminants thus posing an environmental risk to downstream waterbodies one such landscape agricultural karst terrain is particularly susceptible to contamination as recent anthropogenic activity has increased the availability of reactive nitrogen n and consequently the potential for eutrophication ford et al 2019 heffernan et al 2012 husic et al 2019a 2019b however the fate of reactive n in karst sinking streams caves and conduits is lacking in the scientific literature previous studies neglect or marginalize n transformations in sinking streams and turbulent karst conduits e g mahler and garner 2009 mccormack et al 2016 perrin et al 2007 these studies argue that because of high flow velocities karst conduits can be treated as conservative source to sink conveyors recent study has suggested that a reformulation of this conservative assumption is needed first epigenetic karst conduits often contain terrestrially derived sediment deposits and biofilms capable of mediating dissolved n transformations simon et al 2007 second researchers have noted the presence of sediment bound bacterial communities in karst caves and their potential to process terrestrially derived nitrate no3 ammonium nh4 dissolved organic n don sediment organic n son and dinitrogen gas n2 heffernan et al 2012 henson et al 2017 these bacterial communities can drive nitrification nh4 no3 mineralization don son nh4 denitrification no3 n2 and immobilization nh4 son reactions the conservative transport assumption could lead to inaccurate estimates of the availability of reactive n which may have worrisome consequences related to the occurrence of harmful algal blooms and the operation of municipal water systems denitrification as the permanent removal pathway of no3 affects ecosystem and biogeochemical cycles at local regional and global scales and is influenced by the spatiotemporal variability of ecological hydrological and geomorphological processes seitzinger et al 2006 primary drivers of denitrification include the availability of no3 organic carbon c and oxygen as well as particle size and hyporheic exchange boyer et al 2006 dähnke and thamdrup 2013 given these drivers rivers typically have the highest processing rates while groundwater pathways have the lowest seitzinger et al 2006 in this way karst conduits are a unique interface that combines processes and gradients that control surface stream and groundwater end points despite these unique features the net role of the conduit pathway towards removal is not well known the magnitude of no3 removal in karst conduits relative to other pathways may serve as an indicator of the net role of karst topography in global n cycling and be of interest to water quality managers to quantify the aforementioned processes in turbulent karst conduits collection of daily n samples from multiple points along the karst conduit seems a logical approach and many previous studies in surface streams use this method e g see review in birgand et al 2007 however karst conduits positioned many meters below the ground surface can be difficult to locate access and instrument for this reason karst methods generally lag behind their surface counterparts hartmann et al 2014 one advantage of the present study is that the primary conduit has already been located using electrical resistivity testing at a location 5 km upstream of the spring and was intersected by 3 groundwater wells allowing for convenient sample collection zhu et al 2011 the terminal resurgence of this conduit is at the largest spring in the bluegrass region of kentucky where it serves as the primary municipal drinking water source for 13 000 people in georgetown ky this study set up provides an opportunity to collect unique data sets to assess the impact of in conduit no3 transformations on the drinking water source ambient n stable isotopes have proven useful in surface and subsurface systems for separating sources of organic matter and nutrients husic et al 2019a 2017a elucidating denitrification processes heffernan et al 2012 and assisting with the reduction of uncertainty and equifinality in numerical models ford et al 2017 each n phase has a unique isotopic signature δ reported in units of per mil as the ratio of 15n 14n in a sample versus a reference standard e g δ 15n 15n 14n sample 15n 14n air 1 1000 kendall et al 2007 this isotopic signature is impacted by physical mixing and biogeochemical fate processes figure 1 a for example as n cycles from one form to another microbes prefer to utilize the isotopically lighter 14n which imparts a fractionation ε effect on the remaining substrate leading to an enrichment in the substrate s δ 15n signature previous karst studies have used ambient n isotopes to infer the existence of denitrification processes e g albertin et al 2012 heffernan et al 2012 however no studies to our knowledge use continuous daily sampling of δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 to estimate n transformations within a karst conduit the use of coupled elemental and isotopic data sets together with process based numerical modeling shows promise for improving predictions of n fate and water quality in karst jensen et al 2018 numerical modeling can provide a continuous estimate of integrated processes within a study section provided inputs and outputs are measured and knowledge of hydrodynamic behavior in the testbed is known additionally including stable isotope data streams adds an additional set of equations without additional unknowns and allows for the reduction of equifinality and improvement in model predictions ford et al 2017 further numerical modeling of isotope dynamics allows for the estimation of the isotopic overprinting of nitrification on denitrification i e coincident no3 production during removal which can better inform removal rates granger and wankel 2016 literature exists for models of karst hydrology palanisamy and workman 2014 sediment transport husic et al 2017b and no3 concentration ford et al 2019 however no studies to our knowledge have focused on numerical modeling of δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 fate in karst overall the objective of this study was to estimate the cycling and removal of n from within the sediment bed of a karst conduit we collected 65 consecutive days of stable isotope δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 data from within a subsurface conduit and at its terminal endpoint a spring used for drinking water sample collection coincided with a two month low flow period during which internal cycling controlled n dynamics as surface derived water e g flow into sinkholes was excluded from the study section thereafter we constructed a numerical model coupling elemental and stable isotope mass balance equations and explored whether the integration of stable isotope data help to constrain model predictions and isotopic overprinting we provide estimates of the rate of no3 removal within karst conduits and provide a counterpoint to the paradigm that karst conduits are conservative source to sink conveyors 2 study site and materials 2 1 study site the royal spring

two well established sampling stations served to characterize water sediment and nutrient inputs phreatic conduit and outputs royal spring to the study section figure 1c due to the difficulty in

water and sediment data and modeling provide inputs to the numerical model developed in this study husic et al 2019b 2017a 2017b these inputs include the sediment exchange between the water column and

the course of 65 consecutive days an intensive field investigation measured physical elemental and isotopic data at two locations along the karst conduit a well level indicator slope 113583 recorded

discharged water from the phreatic conduit to the surface for collection into 1 l bottles to prevent biological activity from altering sample composition we filtered 40 ml of sample through a 0 45 μm

is coupled to previously developed sediment c and n models for the study site husic 2018 husic et al 2017a the model runs at an hourly time step at 1 km spatial increments and was applied to the 5 km conduit reach between the phreatic conduit and royal spring sites given an average conduit flow velocity of 0 12 0 11 m s 1 husic et al 2017a fluid starting at the phreatic conduit reaches royal spring within 10 9 h providing ample time for down gradient changes at the scale observed by our daily sampling routine i e the model domain satisfies the cfl condition daily field collected data at the phreatic conduit linearly interpolated from sample to sample at 1 h intervals provided an upstream model boundary condition for no3 δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 inputs to the study section we consider a 6 lateral inflow of water based on earlier dye tracing work adams 2019 from the phreatic conduit to the royal spring we parameterized the no3 δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 of this inflow as the mean 2 standard deviations of all low flow data collected during this study as the land use distribution i e horse farms and hay pasture in the lower 6 of the spring basin is the same as the distribution in the upper 94 both a water budget q rs 0 99q pc r2 0 77 husic 2018 and stable isotope comparison δ 2 h h2o and δ 18 o h2o husic et al 2019a indicate a relatively small amount of lateral inflow during high flows and we assume this relationship also holds for low flows lastly we evaluate model performance by comparing measured no3 and δ15nno3 values at royal spring with model simulated results 3 2 2 model equations and formulation many physical and biogeochemical processes affect nh4 don no3 δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 mass balances fig 2 the mass balance of dissolved n species kg n within a cell is a

previous time step kg n q i 1 j 1 n and q i j n are the flow rate into and out of the cell m3 s 1 respectively c i 1 j 1 n and c i j n are the concentration of an n species flowing into and out of the

s1 in cave systems 99 of microorganisms reside within fine sediment lehman et al 2001 thus we assume that transformations of the dissolved n pool are primarily facilitated by bacteria inhabiting the karst conduit bed see fig s2 for downhole imagery of a thin sediment mat blanketing the conduit bed the mass balance of sediment organic n son kg n is composed of three constituent pools in order of lability algae litter and soil husic et al 2017a and was modeled as 2 s i j k s i 1 j k e i j k d i j k x i j k r i j n where k is an index for n source i e algae litter soil s i 1 j k is the supply

particulate pools of n is facilitated by transformations in the sediment bed the mass of n exchanged between all pools kg n was modeled as 3 r i j n n m i n i j n d n n i t r i j n n i m m i j n n d e

kg n n i m m i j n is the mass of n immobilized into son by biota kg n and n d e n i j n is the mass of no3 denitrified to n2 kg n sorption is not considered as low flows are unlikely to agitate the conduit bed and release stored nh4 or no3 equations for each of these reactions are shown in the supplemental information table s1 and their respective terms are defined therein finally only the relevant transformations enumerated in equation 3 are applied to each n pool for example if considering mass balance changes to the don pool the denitrification and nitrification terms would effectively equal 0 as they do not directly impact the mass of don the cycling of n between oxidation states is recognized to discriminate in favor of lighter isotopes in a process termed fractionation kendall et al 2007 the isotopic mass balance accounting for mixing of sources and biogeochemical transformations through space and time was modeled as 4 δ i j n δ i 1 j n x i 1 j n δ i n

derived values table 1 uncertain inputs were estimated using monte carlo sampling from uniform distributions fig 2 stable isotope enrichment factors ε and coefficients for biogeochemical reactions β and k were derived from published work on c and n cycling in human impacted streams ford et al 2017 kendall et al 2007 ryzhakov et al 2010 based on historic data collected in the cane run watershed we parameterized ranges for nh4 concentration c nh4 don concentration c don and don n stable isotope composition δ 15 n don for water recharging the conduit husic 2018 husic et al 2019b using an aggregated range reported by kendall et al 2007 we placed bounds on the possible values of the nh4 n stable isotope composition δ 15 n nh4 of conduit recharge forty four of the 65 daily samples occurred during low flow periods defined as 10 or more consecutive days of baseflow i e 0 3 m3 s 1 these 44 samples provided the data for statistical model evaluation for normally distributed data a two tailed t test α 0 05 was used to assess differences between upstream and downstream constituent composition for non normal data the non parametric mann whitney rank sum test α 0 05 was used instead we evaluated normality using the kolmogorov smirnov test the no3 and δ 15 n no3 data sets were randomly divided into calibration and validation sets of equal cardinality we evaluated no3 and δ 15 n no3 model performance using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 5 n s e 1 t 1 t q m t q o t 2 t 1 t q m t q o 2 where t is the total number of observations q o t is the observed value at time t q m t is the modeled value at time t and q o is the mean of all observed values the nse ranges from to 1 with 1 indicating a perfect match of modeled results to data and 0 indicating that the model provides no more predictive capability than the mean of observed data moriasi et al 2007 the minimum objective criteria for modeled no3 nseno3 and δ 15 n no3 nseδ15n were set at 0 3 and 0 0 respectively nseδ18o was not considered as the data do not show a discernible trend while minimum objective criteria for water and sediment are commonly reported e g moriasi et al 2007 criteria for no3 and δ 15 n no3 are not well established therefore the authors impose that the no3 and δ 15 n no3 models should be better than 0 3 and at least as good 0 0 as the mean of the data respectively we further constrained model results such that the ratio r of modeled don and nh4 concentrations exiting vs entering the conduit rdon and rnh4 respectively fall within the bounds of observed data from a historical dataset the means of these ratios are 0 7 and 0 6 see fig s1 for data respectively and due to data scarcity model simulations falling within 0 2 of these means were accepted during model evaluation husic et al 2019b further to assess the presence and impact of isotopic overprinting of nitrification on denitrification we ran several scenarios through the calibrated numerical model we tested assumptions regarding nitrification denitrification and conservative transport and assessed the impact on model statistics when including biogeochemical reactions vs excluding them the three scenarios were 1 no denitrification 2 no nitrification and 3 conservative transport i e all reaction rates set to 0 lastly we assessed model uncertainty and parameter sensitivity before and after integrating stable isotope data using the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue methodology beven 2006 glue is initiated by assuming a prior distribution for model parameters simultaneously sampling all parameters and then retaining only parameter sets that satisfy the minimum objective criteria husic et al 2019b a posterior distribution can then be constructed from the set of acceptable evaluations and uncertainty bounds can be generated for no3 and δ 15 n no3 predictions a total of 5 5 106 simulations were performed uncertainty analysis was performed on an institutionally shared high performance computing cluster with 9240 processor cores and 57 tb of total ram 3 3 nitrate removal in sinking streams to provide a comparison of no3 removal estimates in karst sediment bed to other freshwater systems we compiled published denitrification and nitrification rates studies include other karst aquifers heffernan et al 2012 karst lakes mccormack et al 2016 non karst lakes piña ochoa and álvarez cobelas 2006 streams from diverse biomes arango et al 2007 agricultural soil and groundwater anderson et al 2014 jahangir et al 2012 and global estimates for groundwater and river sediment seitzinger et al 2006 the heffernan et al 2012 study investigated 61 springs in the upper floridian aquifer usa and estimated that despite relatively low rates denitrification accounted for the removal of a considerable fraction of aquifer n inputs mccormack et al 2016 calculated denitrification in karst turloughs disappearing lakes by a mass balance calculation the study by arango et al 2007 covers numerous streams including those impacted by urban agricultural and forested land uses the studies by piña ochoa and álvarez cobelas 2006 and seitzinger et al 2006 aggregate many different denitrification estimates from all over the world only estimates made from within the sediment i e not the water column were used in calculations for this study lastly denitrification in riparian soils and deep groundwater are also estimated from numerous sites anderson et al 2014 jahangir et al 2012 we also aggregate studies of nitrification including prairie and agriculture impacted streams kemp and dodds 2002 and open channel karst caverns simon and benfield 2002 4 results and discussion 4 1 collection of ambient n stable isotope data during the 65 days of field sampling three low flow periods defined as 10 or more consecutive days of baseflow were identified figure 3 a the elevation of water in the phreatic conduit observation well was only slightly 0 5 m above the springhead elevation providing energy to drive flow downstream figure 3b temperature in the conduit decreased down gradient due to the relatively low background temperature of the aquifer t rock 13 c the differences in temperature were statistically significant p 10 3 and can be accounted for by thermal convection at the conduit wall t rock t h2o 4 c in terms of specific conductance potential ion exchange of water with the limestone bedrock caused longitudinal increase in conductivity from 601 μs cm at phreatic conduit to 608 μs cm at royal spring but the increase was not statistically significant p 0 83 this result was not surprising as other modeling studies in karst indicate that the conductivity response during transport changes half as slowly as temperature winston and criss 2004 data trends in water temperature and conductivity provide circumstantial evidence that the study section of the phreatic conduit represents a relatively closed system during low flow nitrate and ambient n stable isotope data indicate that the karst sediment bed acts as a net source of no3 during transport fig 4 while upstream inputs of no3 decreased by an average of 1 5 per day the mean concentration of no3 transported between the phreatic conduit and royal spring increased by an average of 5 from 1 78 to 1 87 mg n l 1 p 10 4 figure 4a b the biogeochemical fate of no3 in the conduit during the study period appears to be dominated by production processes rather than removal potential reasons for an increase in no3 concentration could be from the nitrification of nh4 the mineralization of organic n bound to conduit sediment or the mineralization of don net production of no3 from nh4 and don is plausible as past research has indicated that the subsurface conduit water column is relatively well oxygenated do sat 76 fig s3 and that decomposition of organic c which is tightly coupled to mineralization of organic n occurs at rates comparable to those in biochemically active surface streams husic et al 2017b coinciding with the downstream increase in no3 concentration was a decrease in δ 15 n no3 from 7 7 to 6 8 p 10 3 figure 4c d the shift towards lighter δ 15 n no3 would indicate that don son and nh4 with isotopically lighter δ 15 n don δ 15 n son and δ 15 n nh4 compositions respectively are oxidized to no3 the rate at which this oxidation of lighter δ 15 n occurs appears to outpace denitrification as one would otherwise expect to see an isotopically heavier δ 15 n signal if no3 reduction to n2 was the dominant processes possible sources for isotopically lighter δ 15 n don and δ 15 n nh4 include nh4 derived from fertilizer or precipitation δ 15 n nh4 3 7 and organic n from labile detrital and algal pools δ 15 n don 5 3 kendall et al 2007 the δ 18 o no3 data varied considerably and comparison of δ 18 o no3 at upstream and downstream sites did not show statistically significant differences p 0 48 figure 4e f the lack of an apparent trend in δ 18 o no3 does not necessarily imply that changes to δ 18 o are not coupled to changes in δ 15 n but rather the imprint of any one reaction may be masked by many other simultaneous reactions granger and wankel 2016 lastly the upstream δ 15 n no3 signature suggests that n loading to the conduit is primarily derived from a combination of soil fertilizer and manure sources with samples generally aligned with the hypothesized denitrification line figure 4g as noted earlier there is a statistically significant p 10 3 shift towards lighter δ 15 n no3 from upstream to downstream data results show that ambient n stable isotopes help to reflect n transformation in subsurface karst environments with our study adding to the body of emerging stable isotope literature jensen et al 2018 however the isotope data alone are unable to differentiate between whether this new no3 is sourced from allochthonous or autochthonous n with that in mind a numerical model provides a tool to remedy this uncertainty and to elucidate processes that are not revealed by data streams alone 4 2 isotope aided numerical modeling of nitrate fate the isotope dataset allowed for adding a second set of modeling equations without adding additional unknowns which helped constrain uncertainty and equifinality in model parameters fig 5 and table 1 after evaluating the numerical model results against the three elemental criteria nse no3 r nh4 and r don see fig 2 the posterior distribution of several parameters was reduced significantly from the assumed prior distribution figure 5a and table 1 subsequently when integrating the isotopic criteria nse δ15n the posterior distributions of the denitrification and nitrification rate constants were further constrained as was nh4 recharge to the system figure 5b reaction rates and concentrations of the inorganic n phases no3 and nh4 are relatively sensitive to model calibration see ε nitr ε den k nitr β den c nh4 rec and δ 15 n nh4 rec whereas rates and concentrations that impact the organic n phases don and son are not as sensitive see ε imm k min c don rec and δ 15 n don rec in fig 5 the lack of sensitivity in the organic n related parameters likely arises from the slower processing rates and more recalcitrant nature of don relative to nh4 and no3 isotopic fractionation parameters related to nitrification ε nitr and denitrification ε den were on the lower range reported in the literature with posterior medians of 3 8 and 2 5 respectively figure 5b the low values of ε nitr and ε den indicates that although nitrification and denitrification may occur in the subsurface these processes do not substantially fractionate the isotopic signature of their respective pools these results tend to agree with a study by heffernan et al 2012 where small ε den values of between 5 3 and 7 5 were estimated using dissolved gas data at 61 karst springs in non karst systems reported values of ε nitr and ε den can range considerably from 1 to 26 and 1 to 18 respectively and can be influenced by nutrient enzyme and diffusion limitations kendall et al 2007 and references within and whether denitrification is occurring in the water column high enrichment or within the benthic zone low enrichment dähnke and thamdrup 2013 nitrate fate and transport model results agreed well with biogeochemical data observations at royal spring and indicate that the source of the additional no3 was from autochthonous production i e the conversation of son don and nh4 to no3 rather than external allochthonous inputs figure 6 a the nse statistics for the optimal no3 model run were 0 39 and 0 28 for calibration and validation periods respectively model results are consistent with data and show longitudinal increases in no3 concentration brought on by the oxidation of don and nh4 from the phreatic conduit to royal spring the nse statistics for the optimal δ 15nno3 model run were 0 27 and 0 15 for calibration and validation periods respectively figure 6b these results are satisfactory given the complexity and difficulty of modeling isotopic n fate at the spatial and temporal resolution performed in this study modeled δ 15nno3 results are consistent with data and indicate that no3 becomes isotopically depleted in 15n during longitudinal transport from input at the upstream phreatic conduit to discharge at the terminal royal spring the model was generally not sensitive to the 6 lateral inflow from the phreatic conduit to royal spring as the quantity of the inflow to the total load was relatively small and the concentration of material was similar to existing in conduit material some disagreement between the calibrated model and data occurs when the model overestimates δ 15nno3 at the beginning of low flow period 3 this is likely associated with a process not captured by our spatially and temporally integrated model structure such as the occurrence of non stationary hot moments or hot spots that can disproportionately process matter within the time and space domains respectively krause et al 2017 for example large spatial heterogeneity in the release of nh4 or no3 from the karst bed could impact predictions this explanation is plausible as the event preceding low flow period 3 was the largest in the two month study and significant storm flow has been shown to disturb the structure of the biologically active surficial layer of the benthos which can expose previously buried material to processing ford et al 2015 numerical modeling of isotope dynamics allowed for the estimation of isotopic overprinting of nitrification on denitrification results from testing multiple scenarios i e no denitrification no nitrification and conservative transport indicate that if either nitrification or denitrification are excluded from the modeling framework no3 and δ 15nno3 results are not accurately represented fig s4 in the case of no denitrification no3 is consistently over estimated nse no3 0 36 in the case of no nitrification the δ 15nno3 signature is greatly over estimated nse δ15n 0 73 lastly with the conservative transport assumption i e all reaction rates set to 0 the model does not satisfactorily simulate the δ 15nno3 signature nse δ15n 0 38 the integration of both elemental no3 and isotopic δ 15nno3 datasets was crucial to determining the existence and relative importance of in conduit processes while our results indicates that denitrification does occur during transport its signal is not as pronounced due to concurrent no3 production by nitrification thus our numerical model allowed for the assessment of isotopic overprinting which would have otherwise masked in conduit denitrification isotope aided numerical modeling also helped to reduce uncertainty regarding the dominant processes controlling no3 fate in subsurface karst in general we found no3 elemental modeling alone that is without the integration of δ 15nno3 data could accurately represent no3 concentration at the spring but would under represent internal processing rates the additional δ 15nno3 data series revealed that the subsurface karst facilitates transformations at a greater rate than indicated by elemental no3 data alone although the increased nitrification and denitrification rates offset one another with regards to net no3 concentration there is a non linear effect of fractionation on the δ 15nno3 signature which provides the means for more accurately calibrating reaction rates pre isotope calibration rates for denitrification nitrification and mineralization were 37 6 25 0 50 3 17 9 and 29 7 9 8 mg n m 2 d 1 respectively on the other hand post isotope calibration showed elevated biogeochemical processing with denitrification nitrification and mineralization rates increasing to 67 0 19 0 79 5 12 1 and 34 1 9 3 mg n m 2 d 1 respectively immobilization rates were an order of magnitude lower 4 67 0 01 mg n m 2 d 1 and were unaffected by the isotopic calibration the increase in the estimates of denitrification and nitrification are significant p 10 4 and represent a 78 and 58 increase in processing over pre isotope estimates respectively and the variance in all rate estimates is reduced ambient n isotopes have shown success when applied to constrain no3 fate in surface systems ford et al 2017 kaown et al 2009 and our results complement this growing body of literature and show the potential of ambient n isotopes to assist with n modeling in karst groundwater 4 3 nitrate removal in sinking streams the karst conduit s no3 removal via denitrification 67 0 19 0 mg n m 2 d 1 falls between the bounds of groundwater and surface water systems fig 7 and table 2 nitrate removal in streams rivers and creeks varies significantly 100 1000 mg n m 2 d 1 and is typically greater than other ecosystems as rivers are characterized by high biochemical gradients of oxygen nutrients and organic matter arango et al 2007 piña ochoa and álvarez cobelas 2006 on the other hand groundwater 1 10 mg n m 2 d 1 and soil 10 100 mg n m 2 d 1 zones are characterized by lesser denitrification fluxes than streams rivers and creeks but constitute a greater proportion of watershed land area and have longer residence times anderson et al 2014 jahangir et al 2012 seitzinger et al 2006 in comparison to other karst systems average aquifer denitrification up gradient of springs 0 3 3 mg n m 2 d 1 and within turloughs 5 50 mg n m 2 d 1 falls within the ranges of removal found in equivalent non karst systems heffernan et al 2012 husic et al 2019b mccormack et al 2016 piña ochoa and álvarez cobelas 2006 thus karst conduits act to remove no3 at greater rates than karst and non karst soil lake and groundwater systems but at lower rates than surface streams primarily due to a lack of a consistent labile e g autotrophic carbon source zeng et al 2019 our estimation of no3 fate in karst conduits using stable isotopes and numerical modeling contextualizes the potential role and importance of conduit sediment to remove no3 from the broader nutrient cascade nitrification in the sinking stream of our study 79 5 12 1 mg n m 2 d 1 was on the higher end of rates reported in the literature which is consistent with periods of high nh4 levels observed in our system in the royal spring basin the long term average concentration of nh4 recharging the subsurface is 0 12 mg n l 1 while the concentration discharging at the spring is 0 07 mg n l 1 fig s1 however shortly prior to and during the study period high concentrations of nh4 were detected at royal spring e g may 5 1 2 mg n l 1 june 12 0 38 mg n l 1 and sept 15 0 40 mg n l 1 and in some instances such as may 5 and june 1 the water treatment plant at royal spring shut down operations due to high nh4 concentrations personal communication georgetown municipal and water sewer service 2017 likewise long term don concentrations decrease from 0 35 mg n l 1 for recharge to 0 23 mg n l 1 at the spring fig s1 which may provide an additional source of nh4 through mineralization of the organic n as has been indicated recently in other karst systems e g musgrove et al 2016 our results are consistent with other studies of agriculture impacted watersheds where maximum rates of nitrification can be up to tenfold greater than denitrification kemp and dodds 2002 and net nitrifying streams are associated with higher no3 concentrations prior studies have suggested the importance of nitrification and denitrification within the phreatic karst zone e g einsiedl and mayer 2006 musgrove et al 2016 and our study provides a quantification of its importance in the context of karst conduits given the comparatively high transformations rates indicated by stable isotopes and numerical modeling the net role of karst conduits in n cycling appears to be non conservative countering the paradigm of karst conduits as conservative conveyors of energy and nutrients the mechanism for this non conservative behavior is the presence of a terrestrially derived organically rich sediment substrate which acts as an interface for no3 removal in surface rivers these benthic interfaces are sometimes considered ecohydrological hot spots and control points where significant processing of organic matter and nutrients occurs across steep biochemical gradients bernhardt et al 2017 krause et al 2017 thus it is reasonable that the no3 removal rate in karst conduits 67 0 19 0 mg n m 2 d 1 falls between surface 100 1000 mg n m 2 d 1 and subsurface 1 10 mg n m 2 d 1 systems as conduits act as an intermediary pathway that mediate terrestrial loading of riverine organic matter with subterranean leaching of nutrients further support for the relative removal efficiency of karst is provided in a study by piña ochoa and álvarez cobelas 2006 analyzing the qualitative factors influencing denitrification i e light conditions presence of plants oxygen levels organic c quality total phosphorus concentrations and nitrate levels piña ochoa and álvarez cobelas 2006 conclude that low light conditions the absence of plants low oxygen within anaerobic sediment pockets low phosphorus high organic c and high nitrate are correlated with increased denitrification rates the present karst systems fits all but the phosphorus criteria given the combination of factors that include buffered loading to the conduit mixing with the sediment substrate and high background aquifer no3 levels it is highly plausible that the karst conduit is an efficient denitrifying system to conclude karst conduit pathways that are well recharged by surface derived organic material are likely non conservative and should be considered as such when accounting for n fate and constructing n budgets 5 conclusions 1 the karst sinking stream s no3 removal falls between the bounds of groundwater systems and surface water systems providing a counterpoint to the paradigm that karst conduits are conservative source to sink conveyors 2 nitrogen concentration and isotope data results show that the karst conduit acts as a net source of no3 via nitrification of soil organic n and fertilizer adding to the emerging body of ambient n isotope literature for estimating n fate 3 the isotope aided numerical model reduced uncertainty when estimating no3 removal and quantified isotopic overprinting for the karst sinking stream adding to the growing body of literature on the usefulness of isotope aided methods to assist

18287,releases of greenhouse gases ghgs from the subsurface can result in atmospheric emissions and the degradation of water quality these effects require attention in today s changing climate to properly quantify emissions reduce risk and inform sound policy decisions flowing subsurface ghgs including methane and carbon dioxide present a risk in the form of two environmental expressions i to the atmosphere surface expression and ii to shallow groundwater aqueous expression results based on high resolution observations in an analog experimental system and analytical modelling show that these expressions depend on the rate of gas flow and the velocity of the flowing groundwater in deeper systems the emission of flowing subsurface ghgs could be significantly limited by dissolution into groundwater adversely impacting water resources without surficial evidence of an underlying issue this work shows that mass transfer in the subsurface must be considered to quantify monitor and mitigate risks of leaking subsurface ghgs graphical abstract image 1 keywords greenhouse gas dissolution environmental expression emissions groundwater multiphase flow 1 introduction our reliance on the geological subsurface for energy including both conventional and unconventional resources and the storage of waste products has created increased interaction between the subsurface and the atmosphere environmental concern associated with the leakage of greenhouse gases ghgs such as methane from oil and gas development bachu 2017 cahill et al 2017 forde et al 2019 and storage conley et al 2016 carbon dioxide from carbon sequestration apps et al 2010 cahill et al 2013 celia and nordbotten 2009 and hydrogen from the storage of nuclear wastes shaw 2015 woods and norris 2016 are increasingly being considered gas leakage can originate from deep below the surface and travel along naturally occurring geological features toward the surface however the primary concern is gas migration along subsurface infrastructure including active injection and extraction wells or inactive legacy infrastructure from previous operations cca 2014 dusseault and jackson 2014 regardless of the source and mechanism for gas migration to the surface a pathway for migrating subsurface gas is through shallow freshwater aquifers vengosh et al 2014 once in an aquifer potential impacts of these gases can occur as one of two environmental expressions i aqueous expression when the gas dissolves into the flowing groundwater sherwood et al 2016 vidic et al 2013 or ii surface expression when the gas reaches the surface forde et al 2019 aqueous expression can cause gases such as methane and carbon dioxide to degrade the quality of groundwater as they dissolve this degradation can include changes of redox potential acidification liberation of metals and biological degradation cahill et al 2013 kelly et al 1985 roy et al 2016 woda et al 2018 due to climate change protecting sources of freshwater including groundwater is vital therefore groundwater quality changes as a result of migrating gas need to be understood surface expression can present possible effects to the atmosphere and human health ghgs that escape the subsurface have the potential to be a contributor to climate change cca 2014 further combustible gases such as natural gas could present risk of explosion or asphyxiation of occupants in infrastructure in proximity to surface expression jackson et al 2013 osborn et al 2011 it is reasonable to expect that both aqueous expression and surface expression of subsurface gas could result from the same source and that surface expression would dominate if the mass transfer from the gas to the aqueous phase was not great enough to dissolve all of the mass from the vertically flowing gas although emissions of ghgs from surface infrastructure e g leakage from oil and gas infrastructure industrial emissions surface casing vent flows are largely perceived to be an important anthropogenic driver of climate change emissions from migrating subsurface gas may also be important as such these subsurface sources need to be considered alongside emissions from surface infrastructure if a large fraction of migrating subsurface gases is emitted at the surface this source may require consideration to close bottom up versus top down mass balances of ghg releases and be accounted for in ghg inventories the magnitude of surface expression from flowing subsurface gases is however not well quantified and the underlying processes have not been explicitly studied accurate estimation of such emissions if significant is imperative as it can influence national and international policies on the climate as well as trading and carbon pricing policy competing processes in the subsurface may make it possible for substantial gas to water mass transfer therefore increasing aqueous expression and decreasing surface expression to this end shallow aquifers could be considered as a final line of defence to limiting ghg emissions from the subsurface this defence however comes at the expense of source water degradation to quantify these expressions and their contribution to overall emissions the competition between gas flow and mass transfer needs to be better understood gas movement in the subsurface is largely influenced by the medium in which it flows and the rate at which it flows through that medium brooks et al 1999 geistlinger et al 2006 selker et al 2007 the high density contrast between gas and water causes migration to be strongly influenced by buoyancy resulting in predominantly vertical gas migration toward the surface frette et al 1992 however as gas migrates the resulting gas geometry and gas saturation fraction of the pore volume in the porous material is influenced by the capillarity of the material at the pore scale and resistance to flow created by the fluid fluid shear forces geistlinger et al 2009 ji et al 1993 roosevelt and corapcioglu 1998 selker et al 2007 the resulting migration pathway and structure referred to here as source architecture of the gas in the subsurface is therefore highly complex and includes the potential for substantial lateral migration beneath low permeability units this complexity causes a high degree of variability in the mass transfer rate between gaseous and aqueous phases and therefore in the concentration of dissolved gases along the migration pathway clayton et al 1996 imhoff and miller 1996 mayer and miller 1996 mumford et al 2010 at low gas flow rates gas moves upwards in single channels of disconnected gas whereas at high gas flow rates gas moves in complex ensembles of continuous gas channels ji et al 1993 the mass transfer from these different architectures varies with single channels allowing for higher dissolution rates due to increased interfacial area and higher aqueous relative permeability clayton et al 1996 sale and mcwhorter 2001 therefore the expected mass transfer rate is dependent on the gas flow rate groundwater velocity also influences mass transfer from the migrating gas geistlinger et al 2005 powers et al 1998 at low aqueous flow velocities it is traditionally assumed that the concentration in the aqueous phase is in equilibrium with the gaseous phase referred to as the local equilibrium assumption lea fry et al 1996 gas to water partitioning at higher aqueous flow velocities depends on the concentration gradient across the gas water interface referred to as rate limited mass transfer geller and hunt 1993 miller et al 1990 powers et al 1991 regardless of the mass transfer kinetics at high aqueous flow velocities gas dissolves into the water at a higher rate due to a sustained concentration gradient the coupling of gas flow rate with water flow rate will ultimately govern the environmental expression of migrating subsurface gas the multicomponent nature of a migrating gas will also influence mass transfer subsurface systems are inherently multicomponent in nature with the native water in shallow aquifers containing dissolved background gases as a result of contact with the atmosphere fluctuation in water level causing atmospheric gas to be trapped in the pore space or gas production by microbial activity gas migrating from deeper regions can also be multicomponent for example stray gas migrating from oil and gas operations is natural gas composed of multiple hydrocarbons e g methane ethane propane butane and other gases e g co2 noble gases previous studies have shown that the transport of dissolved gases is retarded due to multicomponent gas partitioning with a trapped gas phase fry et al 1996 gupta et al 1994 this is the result of the partitioning of any one dissolved gas being affected by all other gases in a mixture as they compete to satisfy both henry s law and dalton s law cirpka and kitanidis 2001 mumford et al 2010 this concept applies equally to the migration of gas through gas charged water depending on the components present dissolution of a gas component may be affected by the presence of another gas component in the dissolved phase cirpka and kitanidis 2001 geistlinger et al 2005 van de ven and mumford 2018 this multicomponent mass transfer will influence the environmental expression of a flowing gas by affecting mass transfer rates and changing the gas composition it is hypothesised that the rate of gas flow in unconsolidated porous media combined with the velocity of the water flow will strongly influence the environmental expression of migrating subsurface gas this study aims to better understand the interaction between gas flow rate and water velocity to elucidate the expected magnitudes of aqueous versus surface expression of migrating gas using quasi two dimensional flow cell experiments and a unique visualization technique coupled with gas chromatography experimental results will allow for the development and validation of a screening level model to understand aqueous versus surface expression of flowing subsurface gases 2 methods 2 1 analog experimental system slow gas injections were performed in an analog bench scale experimental system using a quasi two dimensional flow cell constructed of 25 25 cm2 acrylic plates fig 1 the two plates were separated by 1 cm in which water saturated homogeneous sand 0 7 mm average grain size schroth et al 1996 was emplaced to a height of 21 cm from the bottom of the cell sand was emplaced by continuously pouring a sand slurry while vibrating the apparatus to ensure a homogeneous and initially gas free sand pack in the top 4 cm a surface was constructed using glass beads 4 mm diameter to create a high permeability air flow layer this layer remained unsaturated and was used to sample gas that reached the top of the cell the flow cell was then backlit using an led light bank distilled water in equilibrium with the atmosphere was pumped through the flow cell using an eight channel peristaltic pump masterflex l s 6 600rpm cartridge pump to promote horizontal flow water was injected through eight side ports spaced every 2 9 cm long the influent edge and was expelled through an effluent flow port connected to a clear well and set to a constant hydraulic head of 21 cm above the bottom of the flow cell the clear well consisted of a stainless steel screen that separated the sand from the effluent edge of the flow cell the horizontal flow field was confirmed using a dye tracer test conducted prior to the experiments aqueous flow velocities ranged between 0 005 and 0 343 cm s which are relatively high velocities with respect to groundwater flow however were selected to investigate and demonstrate the effects of mass transfer over the height of the small flow cell it is expected that mathematical models evaluated against this data could be used to investigate these effects over larger scales and at lower velocities gas was injected into the cell through a 21 gauge needle positioned in the center 12 5 cm from either edge of the cell and 2 cm from the bottom ultra high purity carbon dioxide 99 997 praxair was delivered at a constant flow rate of 0 1 0 5 or 1 ml min to the cell using a mass flow controller cole parmer rk 32907 55 directly from a gas cylinder these injection rates were chosen to represent low leakage rates that have been previously reported for stray gas migration associated with shale gas development nowamooz et al 2015 each experiment was performed using multiple water flow steps at a single gas injection rate to investigate multiple combinations of gas injection rates and aqueous velocities table 1 during each step the system was allowed to reach steady state between gas flow and dissolution this was achieved when greater than five pore volumes of water had flowed through the cell at the defined gas flow rate and aqueous velocity experiments 1 a 0 5 a 0 5 b and 0 5 c were each performed with four steps high to medium to low then back to high relative velocity experiments 0 5 a 0 5 b and 0 5 c were triplicate experiments to assess repeatability experiments 1 b 0 5 d and 0 1 a were used to investigate additional combinations of gas flow rate and aqueous velocity for comparison to the screening level model 2 2 aqueous mass transfer visualization visualization of the mass transfer of co2 from the gaseous phase to the aqueous phase was used to qualitatively assess the dissolution fronts dissolution fingers and relative concentrations of aqueous co2 this was achieved using a modified light transmission method that uses the ph indicator resazurin to track co2 dissolution based on acidification of the pore water van de ven and mumford 2018 resazurin dye changes color from a dark purple to orange pink color in the ph range between distilled water and co2 saturated water 5 6 3 8 as a result of distinct change in hue color at a ph of 5 6 using this technique dissolved co2 concentrations as low as 10 5 mmol l are detectable van de ven and mumford 2018 the influent water contained 1 mg l of resazurin sodium salt and the color change was captured using a cmos camera canon eos 6d outfitted with a canon ef 17 40 mm lens placed 60 cm from the flow cell face images were captured at high spatial 2736 by 1824 pixel and temporal 30 s resolution to investigate the coupled gas flow and mass transfer dynamics although a qualitative analysis of the images is presented here analysis based on hue can also be used to measure dissolved co2 concentrations van de ven and mumford 2018 light transmission was also used to visualize movement of the flowing gas phase niemet and selker 2001 tidwell and glass 1994 gas in the sand pack changes the refraction of the incident light and decreases the light intensity passing through the cell as such a captured image appears darker at pixels where gas is present this technique was used to identify gas pathways and gas breakthrough at the surface to aid in interpretation of the measured aqueous and surface expression 2 3 gaseous phase quantification the concentration of co2 in gas that reached the surface layer was analyzed to determine the surface expression of co2 and its relationship to gas migration air was injected through the unsaturated glass beads at a rate of 2 4 ml min using a peristaltic pump masterflex l s 6 600rpm cartridge pump to sweep any surface emitted co2 gas out of the cell this gas was immediately and directly analyzed using a gas chromatograph gc agilent technologies 7890b by connecting the sweep gas outlet to an automated gas sampling valve on the gc this valve sampled the sweep gas every 10 2 min sample volume of 1 ml analysis was conducted using a porabond q agilent technologies column 50 m length 0 530 mm diameter 10 μm film and a thermal conductivity detector tcd at a temperature of 250 c the oven was set to a temperature of 32 c and held for 2 min then increased to a temperature of 50 c at a rate of 40 c min then held for 1 min co2 was identified at a residence time of 1 19 min and peaks were integrated using chemstation software agilent technologies the gc was calibrated before the start of each experiment using eight blank measurements and triplicate measurements using standards of 0 2 1 5 and 10 co2 balanced with nitrogen prospec praxair canada a single calibration check was performed at the end of each experiment using the 5 standard ensuring that the signal was within the 95 confidence interval of the calibration curve a detection limit was computed as the average plus three standard deviations of the blank samples a single experimental detection limit was applied as the greatest value found in all tests 1100 ppmv concentration uncertainty was computed using the measured uncertainty of the calibration curve and used a 95 confidence value miller and miller 2005 measured concentrations were converted to mass flux using 1 j c q g a c e l l where j is the co2 mass flux ml 2t 1 c is the co2 concentration q g is the volumetric gas flow rate and a cell is the surface area of the sand pack exposed to the sweep gas equal to 25 cm2 2 4 model development the relative amounts of aqueous to surface expression resulting from a flowing gas phase is dependent on the rates of gas injection and dissolution it is postulated that a dissolved plume originating from a flowing gas could be arrested environmental expression to be purely aqueous if the aqueous velocity was sufficiently high for a single component system this arrested plume height is coincident with the height of the gas channel the rate at which gas dissolves to the aqueous phase is dependent on the total interfacial area of the resulting gas channel and that total interfacial area increases with the height of the flowing gas phase in contact with flowing water therefore higher injection rates result in higher arrested plume heights at steady state in this study a screening level model was developed to predict the arrested plume height evaluated against experimental data as a first step towards assessing the potential for mass transfer to substantially limit surface expression the proposed screening level model is based on a mass balance of a single component system co2 in these experiments the steady state mass balance applied over a control volume that contains the entire gas channel of the single component assuming a sufficient height for complete dissolution and an influent aqueous concentration of zero is 2 m g i n m a q o u t where m is the mass flow rate mt 1 the subscripts g and aq represent the gaseous and aqueous phases respectively and the superscripts in represent mass entering the gas phase by injection and out represents mass leaving the gas phase by dissolution it is assumed that the gas behaves ideally and the pressure of the aquifer system is constant and sufficiently low such that m g i n can be described using the

gas behaviour is used for the low pressures and temperatures in these experiments eq 3 could be substituted for a different equation of state as required mass transfer from the gaseous phase can be described using stagnant film theory geistlinger et al 2005 holocher et al 2003 miller et al 1990 as 4 m a q o u t a v k c w p g r t k h where a is the specific interfacial area per unit volume of

outer boundary of the stagnant film ml 3 p g is the pressure of the gas cluster ml 1t 2 and k h is the dimensionless gas to water henry s constant the specific interfacial area of the injected gas

drainage curve p c s w which is equivalent to the free energy loss during drainage of water filled pores the mass transfer coefficient is also a difficult parameter to measure mass transfer was expected to be rate limited because of the high aqueous velocities of the experiments therefore a classically defined root square velocity dependent coefficient was assumed levich 1962 and defined as

this study are listed in table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 visualization of mass transfer influenced gas migration an example experiment experiment 0 5 b is shown in fig 2 the aqueous velocity was varied from a relatively high 0 045 cm s to moderate 0 024 cm s to low 0 005 cm s velocity then back to the original high 0 045 cm s velocity and the results are representative of the behaviour observed in all experiments gas flow occurred as a collection of single channels which can be seen as dark areas in the sand pack in fig 2a d outlined in white although the overall gas pattern appeared as a collection of single channels gas flow only occurred in one channel at a given time during the high aqueous flow rate 0 045 cm s gas migrated vertically with minor lateral movement as a result of pore scale heterogeneity fig 2a a dissolved co2 plume pink hue extended from the gas channel in the direction of flow the height of that plume referred to here as the arrested plume height was 8 2 0 9 cm above the injection needle for most of the 0 045 cm s flow period fig 2e the arrested plume height showed minor variation as a result of pore scale gas dynamics importantly this height was lower than the maximum height of the gas channel which grew to 15 cm above the injection needle and no change in color was observed in that upper section this suggests that the aqueous velocity was sufficiently high to strip all co2 from the vertically flowing gas this co2 was replaced by background gases nitrogen and oxygen which partition from the aqueous phase to the gaseous phase this multicomponent mass transfer is important to the studied system and is discussed in detail in section 3 2 decreasing the aqueous velocity to 0 024 cm s increased the arrested plume height to 12 6 0 9 cm still less than the height of the flow cell fig 2b a further decrease in aqueous velocity to 0 005 cm s resulted in the plume reaching the top of the flow cell fig 2c and a return to 0 045 cm s returned the arrested plume height to 8 8 0 9 cm fig 2d the measured arrested plume heights for all experiments are shown in table 1 with good repeatability between replicates conducted in different sand packs minor variation in arrested plume height is the result of variations between sand packings where minor variations in porosity and pore scale heterogeneity are expected as the flow cell is emptied and repacked results shown in fig 2 suggest that although gas reached the top of the flow cell when subjected to an aqueous velocity of 0 024 cm s co2 reached the top of the flow cell only once the aqueous velocity had been decreased to 0 005 cm s this is supported by analysis of the co2 concentrations in the sweep gas fig 2f at high aqueous velocities and low arrested plume heights no co2 was detected in the sweep gas that is the injected co2 exited the flow cell entirely by aqueous expression with no surface expression importantly this was the case even when gas reached the top of the flow cell fig 2e at 0 024 cm s because that gas did not contain co2 at low aqueous velocities substantial co2 was detected in the sweep gas with a maximum flux of 27 6 gm 2day 1 across the triplicate sets this is less than the injected flux of 110 3 gm 2day 1 and shows that at this lowest aqueous velocity 25 of the injected co2 exited by surface expression with the remainder by aqueous expression 3 2 effect of dissolved atmospheric gases in addition to showing the arrested plume height the visualization technique also showed that the height of the gas phase fig 2a d extended well above the arrested plume height during much of the experiments fig 2e a gas height greater than an arrested plume height is the result of multicomponent gas dissolution governing the mass transfer from the flowing gas phase the influent water in this system was in equilibrium with the atmosphere and contained dissolved atmospheric gases mainly nitrogen and oxygen these background gas concentrations create a competition between multiple components as the gaseous co2 dissolves to the aqueous phase when gas to water mass transfer occurs in the presence of background dissolved gases gas partitions both from the gaseous phase co2 to the aqueous phase and from the aqueous phase to the gaseous phase nitrogen and oxygen as the flowing aqueous phase strips co2 from the gaseous phase lower gas to water henry s constant nitrogen and oxygen which are relatively mobile with respect to co2 higher gas to water henry s constant partition from the aqueous phase to the gaseous phase while simultaneously achieving equilibrium of the partial pressures within the gaseous phase this bi directional partitioning causes the volume of the gaseous phase to be sustained and allows continued buoyant migration albeit of co2 depleted gas this illustrates that multicomponent mass transfer in aquifer systems that have dissolved background gases can have a large influence on the interaction of a flowing gas phase with the flowing aqueous phase 3 3 mass transfer induced dynamic instability the interaction between gas flow and the associated mass transfer resulted in dynamic effects governed by the irregularity and heterogeneity inherent in porous media systems in previous experiments of air injection at similar injection rates and in the same sand by van de ven and mumford van de ven and mumford 2019 gas migration occurred as a single disconnected channel in these single channels gas migration is influenced by local drainage and imbibition events depending on the pore scale heterogeneity of the media ji et al 1993 mumford et al 2010 in this study however a steady state single gas channel did not form instead a single channel would initially migrate co2 would partition from that single finger into the aqueous phase and then a new single gas channel would form it is hypothesised that mass transfer from the migrating gas phase causes instabilities in the gas channel allowing imbibition of the surrounding water phase into drained pores at specific gas water interfaces as the radii of curvature were affected due to mass transfer from the gas to the water an example is shown in fig 3 where an originally connected channel fig 3a is fragmented as mass is lost from a narrow section of the gas channel fig 3b as a result of this fragmentation vertically flowing gas finds a new path of least resistance fig 3b circumventing the original path to the left creating a new single flowing gas channel which then begins to dissolve to the aqueous phase fig 3c this mass transfer induced instability caused a dynamic gas migration pathway the dynamic discontinuity in the migrating gas phase was also observed in the measured gas flux in the surface layer at a low aqueous velocity fig 2c the co2 flux at the surface fig 2f was episodic with variable but significant spikes in the flux this episodic flux is generated both by the discontinuous gas dynamics small clusters reaching the surface and time varying dissolution rates from the gas channel observations of this mass transfer induced gas dynamics have not been previously reported and are an area of research which needs to be extended to better understand its effects on gas migration and trapping and how this influences aqueous versus surface expression at various scales 3 4 estimation of arrested plume height the measured arrested plume heights of the 24 combinations of gas injection rate and aqueous velocities including four replicates were compared to estimates using eq 9 although the system being modeled is unavoidably multicomponent as discussed in section 3 2 we assumed that the mass of the component of interest co2 partitions to the aqueous phase at a higher rate than the background gases n2 and o2 partition to the gaseous phase as a result of a higher concentration gradient of that component and a higher affinity for dissolution low henry s constant this assumption is supported by the observation that the gas finger grew much slower above the arrested plume height where it is dominated by n2 and o2 than below it where it is dominated by co2 this is seen in fig 2e where the slope of the gas height over time at an aqueous velocity of 0 045 cm s decreases after the arrested height is established therefore the component of interest will be the dominant species dictating the arrested height of the aqueous plume the primary drainage curve of the sand used in this study was characterized by hegele 2014 using a brooks corey brooks and corey 1964 model more information can be found in the supplementary material because eq 9 is dependent on a specific water saturation but the gas saturation throughout a gas channel varies the average gas saturation of a channel was assumed to be 0 33 van de ven and mumford 2019 and φ and ψ were calculated at this saturation gas channels which form during upward gas flow are irregular in shape dictated by the porous media and the resulting flow path fig 2a d shows that the cross section of the gas channel is variable over the height of the flow cell and its three dimensional shape has not been characterized in this study or in the literature the effective cross sectional area of the flowing gas channel a therefore is difficult to estimate to incorporate the uncertainty of this parameter in the model the shape of a was calculated using the area of a circle or a square creating an upper and lower uncertainty envelop respectively for the estimate using eq 9 resulting in a cylindrical or prismatic channel respectively along with uncertainty of the shape its width is uncertain gas channel widths over the height of the channel in this study and van de ven and mumford 2019 measured 4 to 8 times the average grain size during discontinuous gas flow 2 9 5 7 mm respectively which agrees with other work in the literature measuring channels widths in similar sands elder and benson 1999 selker et al 2007 however within that range the width of a gas channel increases with increasing injection rate elder and benson 1999 selker et al 2007 van de ven and mumford 2019 therefore the average widths used in the estimate of a were varied between 3 and 3 4 mm circular diameter and square width respectively for a gas injection rate of 0 1 ml min 3 7 and 4 2 mm for 0 5 ml min and 4 1 and 4 6 mm for 1 ml min fig 4 shows the comparison of the measured and predicted arrested plume heights with respect to the aqueous velocity the estimates made using eq 9 encompassed the experimental data with arrested plume height decreasing steeply as velocities increased to approximately 0 1 cm s and becoming asymptotic as velocity continued to increase this asymptotic behaviour shows that the mass transfer from the gaseous phase reaches a limit at which further increase in aqueous velocity only marginally affects the arrested plume height as expected using a root square velocity dependence for the mass transfer coefficient eq 7 the agreement between the experimental data and the screening level model suggests a consideration of rate limited mass transfer combined with an estimate of the interfacial area of a gas channel can be used to estimate the influence of mass transfer on gas migration co2 partitioned from the gaseous to aqueous phase faster than the background gases partitioned from the aqueous to gaseous phase this result supports the assumption that a single component gas was adequate for modelling co2 because it is highly mobile compared to oxygen and nitrogen 1 2 orders of magnitude for o2 and n2 therefore the gas phase below the arrested plume height was dominated by the mass transfer of co2 essentially single component allowing arrested plume height to be used as a proxy for the co2 dominated gas phase height the application of this model to other gas components of interest e g methane requires further investigation to assess whether this assumption is valid and whether the simulation of a multicomponent gas phase is required 4 conclusions the competition between vertical gas flow and water flow in the subsurface was shown to affect the environmental expression of subsurface ghgs the findings of this study offer novel observations of this interaction and suggest that the gas flow rate and the aqueous velocity are key system parameters which strongly influence the amount of mass that dissolves in the aqueous phase or that reaches the surface it was also found that the rate of mass transfer from the gaseous to aqueous phase can influence the gas dynamics by either arresting the vertical gas migration to prevent surface expression or causing instability of the flowing gas phase to create migration pathways that have not been previously reported in studies of immiscible fluid flow interestingly as a result of multicomponent mass transfer the height of gas within the system is not equal to the height of the injected gas component s plume and is dependent on the relative contrast in henry s constants of components within the system this work highlights that dissolved background gases influence mass transfer in subsurface systems and require careful consideration the results of this study provide the following implications for subsurface flowing gases for a variety of applications e g stray gas migration carbon sequestration energy storage and waste disposal in deep multicomponent subsurface systems mass transfer may result in a significant fraction of mass loading to the aqueous phase and less mass reaching the surface the effects of systems with relatively smaller contrasts in henry s constants between components e g methane oxygen and nitrogen requires future investigation to quantify the proportionality of environmental expressions the estimation of subsurface leakage rates is not a trivial effort and consideration of mass transfer is needed to accurately estimate total leakage rates immediate environmental expression in the aqueous phase does not limit the risk for surface expression entirely as aqueous plumes develop and biological degradation occurs dissolved mass may flow or partition to the atmosphere creating a latent surface expression of the subsurface ghg in systems whose native pore water contains dissolved gases e g dissolved atmospheric gases or noble gases competition of mass transfer from gas to water and water to gas can cause significant alteration in gas composition such that surface expression of the leak may not contain the gas species of concern this impacts leak identification and assessment at the surface e g gas efflux measurements and observation of flowing gas in water wells or standing water as the measured and observed gas may not present atmospheric concern however may be indicative of a groundwater concern the environmental expression of subsurface gases such as carbon dioxide and methane are highly dependent on subsurface characteristics this notion may further complicate closing bottom up versus top down estimates of emissions from leaking gas sources future research needs to consider the implication of the competition of gas flow and mass transfer in heterogeneous systems and look to better understand the potential impacts for ghg emissions and degradation of groundwater quality declaration of competing

18287,releases of greenhouse gases ghgs from the subsurface can result in atmospheric emissions and the degradation of water quality these effects require attention in today s changing climate to properly quantify emissions reduce risk and inform sound policy decisions flowing subsurface ghgs including methane and carbon dioxide present a risk in the form of two environmental expressions i to the atmosphere surface expression and ii to shallow groundwater aqueous expression results based on high resolution observations in an analog experimental system and analytical modelling show that these expressions depend on the rate of gas flow and the velocity of the flowing groundwater in deeper systems the emission of flowing subsurface ghgs could be significantly limited by dissolution into groundwater adversely impacting water resources without surficial evidence of an underlying issue this work shows that mass transfer in the subsurface must be considered to quantify monitor and mitigate risks of leaking subsurface ghgs graphical abstract image 1 keywords greenhouse gas dissolution environmental expression emissions groundwater multiphase flow 1 introduction our reliance on the geological subsurface for energy including both conventional and unconventional resources and the storage of waste products has created increased interaction between the subsurface and the atmosphere environmental concern associated with the leakage of greenhouse gases ghgs such as methane from oil and gas development bachu 2017 cahill et al 2017 forde et al 2019 and storage conley et al 2016 carbon dioxide from carbon sequestration apps et al 2010 cahill et al 2013 celia and nordbotten 2009 and hydrogen from the storage of nuclear wastes shaw 2015 woods and norris 2016 are increasingly being considered gas leakage can originate from deep below the surface and travel along naturally occurring geological features toward the surface however the primary concern is gas migration along subsurface infrastructure including active injection and extraction wells or inactive legacy infrastructure from previous operations cca 2014 dusseault and jackson 2014 regardless of the source and mechanism for gas migration to the surface a pathway for migrating subsurface gas is through shallow freshwater aquifers vengosh et al 2014 once in an aquifer potential impacts of these gases can occur as one of two environmental expressions i aqueous expression when the gas dissolves into the flowing groundwater sherwood et al 2016 vidic et al 2013 or ii surface expression when the gas reaches the surface forde et al 2019 aqueous expression can cause gases such as methane and carbon dioxide to degrade the quality of groundwater as they dissolve this degradation can include changes of redox potential acidification liberation of metals and biological degradation cahill et al 2013 kelly et al 1985 roy et al 2016 woda et al 2018 due to climate change protecting sources of freshwater including groundwater is vital therefore groundwater quality changes as a result of migrating gas need to be understood surface expression can present possible effects to the atmosphere and human health ghgs that escape the subsurface have the potential to be a contributor to climate change cca 2014 further combustible gases such as natural gas could present risk of explosion or asphyxiation of occupants in infrastructure in proximity to surface expression jackson et al 2013 osborn et al 2011 it is reasonable to expect that both aqueous expression and surface expression of subsurface gas could result from the same source and that surface expression would dominate if the mass transfer from the gas to the aqueous phase was not great enough to dissolve all of the mass from the vertically flowing gas although emissions of ghgs from surface infrastructure e g leakage from oil and gas infrastructure industrial emissions surface casing vent flows are largely perceived to be an important anthropogenic driver of climate change emissions from migrating subsurface gas may also be important as such these subsurface sources need to be considered alongside emissions from surface infrastructure if a large fraction of migrating subsurface gases is emitted at the surface this source may require consideration to close bottom up versus top down mass balances of ghg releases and be accounted for in ghg inventories the magnitude of surface expression from flowing subsurface gases is however not well quantified and the underlying processes have not been explicitly studied accurate estimation of such emissions if significant is imperative as it can influence national and international policies on the climate as well as trading and carbon pricing policy competing processes in the subsurface may make it possible for substantial gas to water mass transfer therefore increasing aqueous expression and decreasing surface expression to this end shallow aquifers could be considered as a final line of defence to limiting ghg emissions from the subsurface this defence however comes at the expense of source water degradation to quantify these expressions and their contribution to overall emissions the competition between gas flow and mass transfer needs to be better understood gas movement in the subsurface is largely influenced by the medium in which it flows and the rate at which it flows through that medium brooks et al 1999 geistlinger et al 2006 selker et al 2007 the high density contrast between gas and water causes migration to be strongly influenced by buoyancy resulting in predominantly vertical gas migration toward the surface frette et al 1992 however as gas migrates the resulting gas geometry and gas saturation fraction of the pore volume in the porous material is influenced by the capillarity of the material at the pore scale and resistance to flow created by the fluid fluid shear forces geistlinger et al 2009 ji et al 1993 roosevelt and corapcioglu 1998 selker et al 2007 the resulting migration pathway and structure referred to here as source architecture of the gas in the subsurface is therefore highly complex and includes the potential for substantial lateral migration beneath low permeability units this complexity causes a high degree of variability in the mass transfer rate between gaseous and aqueous phases and therefore in the concentration of dissolved gases along the migration pathway clayton et al 1996 imhoff and miller 1996 mayer and miller 1996 mumford et al 2010 at low gas flow rates gas moves upwards in single channels of disconnected gas whereas at high gas flow rates gas moves in complex ensembles of continuous gas channels ji et al 1993 the mass transfer from these different architectures varies with single channels allowing for higher dissolution rates due to increased interfacial area and higher aqueous relative permeability clayton et al 1996 sale and mcwhorter 2001 therefore the expected mass transfer rate is dependent on the gas flow rate groundwater velocity also influences mass transfer from the migrating gas geistlinger et al 2005 powers et al 1998 at low aqueous flow velocities it is traditionally assumed that the concentration in the aqueous phase is in equilibrium with the gaseous phase referred to as the local equilibrium assumption lea fry et al 1996 gas to water partitioning at higher aqueous flow velocities depends on the concentration gradient across the gas water interface referred to as rate limited mass transfer geller and hunt 1993 miller et al 1990 powers et al 1991 regardless of the mass transfer kinetics at high aqueous flow velocities gas dissolves into the water at a higher rate due to a sustained concentration gradient the coupling of gas flow rate with water flow rate will ultimately govern the environmental expression of migrating subsurface gas the multicomponent nature of a migrating gas will also influence mass transfer subsurface systems are inherently multicomponent in nature with the native water in shallow aquifers containing dissolved background gases as a result of contact with the atmosphere fluctuation in water level causing atmospheric gas to be trapped in the pore space or gas production by microbial activity gas migrating from deeper regions can also be multicomponent for example stray gas migrating from oil and gas operations is natural gas composed of multiple hydrocarbons e g methane ethane propane butane and other gases e g co2 noble gases previous studies have shown that the transport of dissolved gases is retarded due to multicomponent gas partitioning with a trapped gas phase fry et al 1996 gupta et al 1994 this is the result of the partitioning of any one dissolved gas being affected by all other gases in a mixture as they compete to satisfy both henry s law and dalton s law cirpka and kitanidis 2001 mumford et al 2010 this concept applies equally to the migration of gas through gas charged water depending on the components present dissolution of a gas component may be affected by the presence of another gas component in the dissolved phase cirpka and kitanidis 2001 geistlinger et al 2005 van de ven and mumford 2018 this multicomponent mass transfer will influence the environmental expression of a flowing gas by affecting mass transfer rates and changing the gas composition it is hypothesised that the rate of gas flow in unconsolidated porous media combined with the velocity of the water flow will strongly influence the environmental expression of migrating subsurface gas this study aims to better understand the interaction between gas flow rate and water velocity to elucidate the expected magnitudes of aqueous versus surface expression of migrating gas using quasi two dimensional flow cell experiments and a unique visualization technique coupled with gas chromatography experimental results will allow for the development and validation of a screening level model to understand aqueous versus surface expression of flowing subsurface gases 2 methods 2 1 analog experimental system slow gas injections were performed in an analog bench scale experimental system using a quasi two dimensional flow cell constructed of 25 25 cm2 acrylic plates fig 1 the two plates were separated by 1 cm in which water saturated homogeneous sand 0 7 mm average grain size schroth et al 1996 was emplaced to a height of 21 cm from the bottom of the cell sand was emplaced by continuously pouring a sand slurry while vibrating the apparatus to ensure a homogeneous and initially gas free sand pack in the top 4 cm a surface was constructed using glass beads 4 mm diameter to create a high permeability air flow layer this layer remained unsaturated and was used to sample gas that reached the top of the cell the flow cell was then backlit using an led light bank distilled water in equilibrium with the atmosphere was pumped through the flow cell using an eight channel peristaltic pump masterflex l s 6 600rpm cartridge pump to promote horizontal flow water was injected through eight side ports spaced every 2 9 cm long the influent edge and was expelled through an effluent flow port connected to a clear well and set to a constant hydraulic head of 21 cm above the bottom of the flow cell the clear well consisted of a stainless steel screen that separated the sand from the effluent edge of the flow cell the horizontal flow field was confirmed using a dye tracer test conducted prior to the experiments aqueous flow velocities ranged between 0 005 and 0 343 cm s which are relatively high velocities with respect to groundwater flow however were selected to investigate and demonstrate the effects of mass transfer over the height of the small flow cell it is expected that mathematical models evaluated against this data could be used to investigate these effects over larger scales and at lower velocities gas was injected into the cell through a 21 gauge needle positioned in the center 12 5 cm from either edge of the cell and 2 cm from the bottom ultra high purity carbon dioxide 99 997 praxair was delivered at a constant flow rate of 0 1 0 5 or 1 ml min to the cell using a mass flow controller cole parmer rk 32907 55 directly from a gas cylinder these injection rates were chosen to represent low leakage rates that have been previously reported for stray gas migration associated with shale gas development nowamooz et al 2015 each experiment was performed using multiple water flow steps at a single gas injection rate to investigate multiple combinations of gas injection rates and aqueous velocities table 1 during each step the system was allowed to reach steady state between gas flow and dissolution this was achieved when greater than five pore volumes of water had flowed through the cell at the defined gas flow rate and aqueous velocity experiments 1 a 0 5 a 0 5 b and 0 5 c were each performed with four steps high to medium to low then back to high relative velocity experiments 0 5 a 0 5 b and 0 5 c were triplicate experiments to assess repeatability experiments 1 b 0 5 d and 0 1 a were used to investigate additional combinations of gas flow rate and aqueous velocity for comparison to the screening level model 2 2 aqueous mass transfer visualization visualization of the mass transfer of co2 from the gaseous phase to the aqueous phase was used to qualitatively assess the dissolution fronts dissolution fingers and relative concentrations of aqueous co2 this was achieved using a modified light transmission method that uses the ph indicator resazurin to track co2 dissolution based on acidification of the pore water van de ven and mumford 2018 resazurin dye changes color from a dark purple to orange pink color in the ph range between distilled water and co2 saturated water 5 6 3 8 as a result of distinct change in hue color at a ph of 5 6 using this technique dissolved co2 concentrations as low as 10 5 mmol l are detectable van de ven and mumford 2018 the influent water contained 1 mg l of resazurin sodium salt and the color change was captured using a cmos camera canon eos 6d outfitted with a canon ef 17 40 mm lens placed 60 cm from the flow cell face images were captured at high spatial 2736 by 1824 pixel and temporal 30 s resolution to investigate the coupled gas flow and mass transfer dynamics although a qualitative analysis of the images is presented here analysis based on hue can also be used to measure dissolved co2 concentrations van de ven and mumford 2018 light transmission was also used to visualize movement of the flowing gas phase niemet and selker 2001 tidwell and glass 1994 gas in the sand pack changes the refraction of the incident light and decreases the light intensity passing through the cell as such a captured image appears darker at pixels where gas is present this technique was used to identify gas pathways and gas breakthrough at the surface to aid in interpretation of the measured aqueous and surface expression 2 3 gaseous phase quantification the concentration of co2 in gas that reached the surface layer was analyzed to determine the surface expression of co2 and its relationship to gas migration air was injected through the unsaturated glass beads at a rate of 2 4 ml min using a peristaltic pump masterflex l s 6 600rpm cartridge pump to sweep any surface emitted co2 gas out of the cell this gas was immediately and directly analyzed using a gas chromatograph gc agilent technologies 7890b by connecting the sweep gas outlet to an automated gas sampling valve on the gc this valve sampled the sweep gas every 10 2 min sample volume of 1 ml analysis was conducted using a porabond q agilent technologies column 50 m length 0 530 mm diameter 10 μm film and a thermal conductivity detector tcd at a temperature of 250 c the oven was set to a temperature of 32 c and held for 2 min then increased to a temperature of 50 c at a rate of 40 c min then held for 1 min co2 was identified at a residence time of 1 19 min and peaks were integrated using chemstation software agilent technologies the gc was calibrated before the start of each experiment using eight blank measurements and triplicate measurements using standards of 0 2 1 5 and 10 co2 balanced with nitrogen prospec praxair canada a single calibration check was performed at the end of each experiment using the 5 standard ensuring that the signal was within the 95 confidence interval of the calibration curve a detection limit was computed as the average plus three standard deviations of the blank samples a single experimental detection limit was applied as the greatest value found in all tests 1100 ppmv concentration uncertainty was computed using the measured uncertainty of the calibration curve and used a 95 confidence value miller and miller 2005 measured concentrations were converted to mass flux using 1 j c q g a c e l l where j is the co2 mass flux ml 2t 1 c is the co2 concentration q g is the volumetric gas flow rate and a cell is the surface area of the sand pack exposed to the sweep gas equal to 25 cm2 2 4 model development the relative amounts of aqueous to surface expression resulting from a flowing gas phase is dependent on the rates of gas injection and dissolution it is postulated that a dissolved plume originating from a flowing gas could be arrested environmental expression to be purely aqueous if the aqueous velocity was sufficiently high for a single component system this arrested plume height is coincident with the height of the gas channel the rate at which gas dissolves to the aqueous phase is dependent on the total interfacial area of the resulting gas channel and that total interfacial area increases with the height of the flowing gas phase in contact with flowing water therefore higher injection rates result in higher arrested plume heights at steady state in this study a screening level model was developed to predict the arrested plume height evaluated against experimental data as a first step towards assessing the potential for mass transfer to substantially limit surface expression the proposed screening level model is based on a mass balance of a single component system co2 in these experiments the steady state mass balance applied over a control volume that contains the entire gas channel of the single component assuming a sufficient height for complete dissolution and an influent aqueous concentration of zero is 2 m g i n m a q o u t where m is the mass flow rate mt 1 the subscripts g and aq represent the gaseous and aqueous phases respectively and the superscripts in represent mass entering the gas phase by injection and out represents mass leaving the gas phase by dissolution it is assumed that the gas behaves ideally and the pressure of the aquifer system is constant and sufficiently low such that m g i n can be described using the ideal gas law as 3 m g i n p i n j v r t where p inj is the injection gas pressure ml 1t 2 v is the volumetric gas flow rate l3t 1 r is the ideal gas constant and t is the temperature although ideal gas behaviour is used for the low pressures and temperatures in these experiments eq 3 could be substituted for a different equation of state as required mass transfer from the gaseous phase can be described using stagnant film theory geistlinger et al 2005 holocher et al 2003 miller et al 1990 as 4 m a q o u t a v k c w p g r t k h where a is the specific interfacial area per unit volume of

outer boundary of the stagnant film ml 3 p g is the pressure of the gas cluster ml 1t 2 and k h is the dimensionless gas to water henry s constant the specific interfacial area of the injected gas

drainage curve p c s w which is equivalent to the free energy loss during drainage of water filled pores the mass transfer coefficient is also a difficult parameter to measure mass transfer was expected to be rate limited because of the high aqueous velocities of the experiments therefore a classically defined root square velocity dependent coefficient was assumed levich 1962 and defined as

this study are listed in table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 visualization of mass transfer influenced gas migration an example experiment experiment 0 5 b is shown in fig 2 the aqueous velocity was varied from a relatively high 0 045 cm s to moderate 0 024 cm s to low 0 005 cm s velocity then back to the original high 0 045 cm s velocity and the results are representative of the behaviour observed in all experiments gas flow occurred as a collection of single channels which can be seen as dark areas in the sand pack in fig 2a d outlined in white although the overall gas pattern appeared as a collection of single channels gas flow only occurred in one channel at a given time during the high aqueous flow rate 0 045 cm s gas migrated vertically with minor lateral movement as a result of pore scale heterogeneity fig 2a a dissolved co2 plume pink hue extended from the gas channel in the direction of flow the height of that plume referred to here as the arrested plume height was 8 2 0 9 cm above the injection needle for most of the 0 045 cm s flow period fig 2e the arrested plume height showed minor variation as a result of pore scale gas dynamics importantly this height was lower than the maximum height of the gas channel which grew to 15 cm above the injection needle and no change in color was observed in that upper section this suggests that the aqueous velocity was sufficiently high to strip all co2 from the vertically flowing gas this co2 was replaced by background gases nitrogen and oxygen which partition from the aqueous phase to the gaseous phase this multicomponent mass transfer is important to the studied system and is discussed in detail in section 3 2 decreasing the aqueous velocity to 0 024 cm s increased the arrested plume height to 12 6 0 9 cm still less than the height of the flow cell fig 2b a further decrease in aqueous velocity to 0 005 cm s resulted in the plume reaching the top of the flow cell fig 2c and a return to 0 045 cm s returned the arrested plume height to 8 8 0 9 cm fig 2d the measured arrested plume heights for all experiments are shown in table 1 with good repeatability between replicates conducted in different sand packs minor variation in arrested plume height is the result of variations between sand packings where minor variations in porosity and pore scale heterogeneity are expected as the flow cell is emptied and repacked results shown in fig 2 suggest that although gas reached the top of the flow cell when subjected to an aqueous velocity of 0 024 cm s co2 reached the top of the flow cell only once the aqueous velocity had been decreased to 0 005 cm s this is supported by analysis of the co2 concentrations in the sweep gas fig 2f at high aqueous velocities and low arrested plume heights no co2 was detected in the sweep gas that is the injected co2 exited the flow cell entirely by aqueous expression with no surface expression importantly this was the case even when gas reached the top of the flow cell fig 2e at 0 024 cm s because that gas did not contain co2 at low aqueous velocities substantial co2 was detected in the sweep gas with a maximum flux of 27 6 gm 2day 1 across the triplicate sets this is less than the injected flux of 110 3 gm 2day 1 and shows that at this lowest aqueous velocity 25 of the injected co2 exited by surface expression with the remainder by aqueous expression 3 2 effect of dissolved atmospheric gases in addition to showing the arrested plume height the visualization technique also showed that the height of the gas phase fig 2a d extended well above the arrested plume height during much of the experiments fig 2e a gas height greater than an arrested plume height is the result of multicomponent gas dissolution governing the mass transfer from the flowing gas phase the influent water in this system was in equilibrium with the atmosphere and contained dissolved atmospheric gases mainly nitrogen and oxygen these background gas concentrations create a competition between multiple components as the gaseous co2 dissolves to the aqueous phase when gas to water mass transfer occurs in the presence of background dissolved gases gas partitions both from the gaseous phase co2 to the aqueous phase and from the aqueous phase to the gaseous phase nitrogen and oxygen as the flowing aqueous phase strips co2 from the gaseous phase lower gas to water henry s constant nitrogen and oxygen which are relatively mobile with respect to co2 higher gas to water henry s constant partition from the aqueous phase to the gaseous phase while simultaneously achieving equilibrium of the partial pressures within the gaseous phase this bi directional partitioning causes the volume of the gaseous phase to be sustained and allows continued buoyant migration albeit of co2 depleted gas this illustrates that multicomponent mass transfer in aquifer systems that have dissolved background gases can have a large influence on the interaction of a flowing gas phase with the flowing aqueous phase 3 3 mass transfer induced dynamic instability the interaction between gas flow and the associated mass transfer resulted in dynamic effects governed by the irregularity and heterogeneity inherent in porous media systems in previous experiments of air injection at similar injection rates and in the same sand by van de ven and mumford van de ven and mumford 2019 gas migration occurred as a single disconnected channel in these single channels gas migration is influenced by local drainage and imbibition events depending on the pore scale heterogeneity of the media ji et al 1993 mumford et al 2010 in this study however a steady state single gas channel did not form instead a single channel would initially migrate co2 would partition from that single finger into the aqueous phase and then a new single gas channel would form it is hypothesised that mass transfer from the migrating gas phase causes instabilities in the gas channel allowing imbibition of the surrounding water phase into drained pores at specific gas water interfaces as the radii of curvature were affected due to mass transfer from the gas to the water an example is shown in fig 3 where an originally connected channel fig 3a is fragmented as mass is lost from a narrow section of the gas channel fig 3b as a result of this fragmentation vertically flowing gas finds a new path of least resistance fig 3b circumventing the original path to the left creating a new single flowing gas channel which then begins to dissolve to the aqueous phase fig 3c this mass transfer induced instability caused a dynamic gas migration pathway the dynamic discontinuity in the migrating gas phase was also observed in the measured gas flux in the surface layer at a low aqueous velocity fig 2c the co2 flux at the surface fig 2f was episodic with variable but significant spikes in the flux this episodic flux is generated both by the discontinuous gas dynamics small clusters reaching the surface and time varying dissolution rates from the gas channel observations of this mass transfer induced gas dynamics have not been previously reported and are an area of research which needs to be extended to better understand its effects on gas migration and trapping and how this influences aqueous versus surface expression at various scales 3 4 estimation of arrested plume height the measured arrested plume heights of the 24 combinations of gas injection rate and aqueous velocities including four replicates were compared to estimates using eq 9 although the system being modeled is unavoidably multicomponent as discussed in section 3 2 we assumed that the mass of the component of interest co2 partitions to the aqueous phase at a higher rate than the background gases n2 and o2 partition to the gaseous phase as a result of a higher concentration gradient of that component and a higher affinity for dissolution low henry s constant this assumption is supported by the observation that the gas finger grew much slower above the arrested plume height where it is dominated by n2 and o2 than below it where it is dominated by co2 this is seen in fig 2e where the slope of the gas height over time at an aqueous velocity of 0 045 cm s decreases after the arrested height is established therefore the component of interest will be the dominant species dictating the arrested height of the aqueous plume the primary drainage curve of the sand used in this study was characterized by hegele 2014 using a brooks corey brooks and corey 1964 model more information can be found in the supplementary material because eq 9 is dependent on a specific water saturation but the gas saturation throughout a gas channel varies the average gas saturation of a channel was assumed to be 0 33 van de ven and mumford 2019 and φ and ψ were calculated at this saturation gas channels which form during upward gas flow are irregular in shape dictated by the porous media and the resulting flow path fig 2a d shows that the cross section of the gas channel is variable over the height of the flow cell and its three dimensional shape has not been characterized in this study or in the literature the effective cross sectional area of the flowing gas channel a therefore is difficult to estimate to incorporate the uncertainty of this parameter in the model the shape of a was calculated using the area of a circle or a square creating an upper and lower uncertainty envelop respectively for the estimate using eq 9 resulting in a cylindrical or prismatic channel respectively along with uncertainty of the shape its width is uncertain gas channel widths over the height of the channel in this study and van de ven and mumford 2019 measured 4 to 8 times the average grain size during discontinuous gas flow 2 9 5 7 mm respectively which agrees with other work in the literature measuring channels widths in similar sands elder and benson 1999 selker et al 2007 however within that range the width of a gas channel increases with increasing injection rate elder and benson 1999 selker et al 2007 van de ven and mumford 2019 therefore the average widths used in the estimate of a were varied between 3 and 3 4 mm circular diameter and square width respectively for a gas injection rate of 0 1 ml min 3 7 and 4 2 mm for 0 5 ml min and 4 1 and 4 6 mm for 1 ml min fig 4 shows the comparison of the measured and predicted arrested plume heights with respect to the aqueous velocity the estimates made using eq 9 encompassed the experimental data with arrested plume height decreasing steeply as velocities increased to approximately 0 1 cm s and becoming asymptotic as velocity continued to increase this asymptotic behaviour shows that the mass transfer from the gaseous phase reaches a limit at which further increase in aqueous velocity only marginally affects the arrested plume height as expected using a root square velocity dependence for the mass transfer coefficient eq 7 the agreement between the experimental data and the screening level model suggests a consideration of rate limited mass transfer combined with an estimate of the interfacial area of a gas channel can be used to estimate the influence of mass transfer on gas migration co2 partitioned from the gaseous to aqueous phase faster than the background gases partitioned from the aqueous to gaseous phase this result supports the assumption that a single component gas was adequate for modelling co2 because it is highly mobile compared to oxygen and nitrogen 1 2 orders of magnitude for o2 and n2 therefore the gas phase below the arrested plume height was dominated by the mass transfer of co2 essentially single component allowing arrested plume height to be used as a proxy for the co2 dominated gas phase height the application of this model to other gas components of interest e g methane requires further investigation to assess whether this assumption is valid and whether the simulation of a multicomponent gas phase is required 4 conclusions the competition between vertical gas flow and water flow in the subsurface was shown to affect the environmental expression of subsurface ghgs the findings of this study offer novel observations of this interaction and suggest that the gas flow rate and the aqueous velocity are key system parameters which strongly influence the amount of mass that dissolves in the aqueous phase or that reaches the surface it was also found that the rate of mass transfer from the gaseous to aqueous phase can influence the gas dynamics by either arresting the vertical gas migration to prevent surface expression or causing instability of the flowing gas phase to create migration pathways that have not been previously reported in studies of immiscible fluid flow interestingly as a result of multicomponent mass transfer the height of gas within the system is not equal to the height of the injected gas component s plume and is dependent on the relative contrast in henry s constants of components within the system this work highlights that dissolved background gases influence mass transfer in subsurface systems and require careful consideration the results of this study provide the following implications for subsurface flowing gases for a variety of applications e g stray gas migration carbon sequestration energy storage and waste disposal in deep multicomponent subsurface systems mass transfer may result in a significant fraction of mass loading to the aqueous phase and less mass reaching the surface the effects of systems with relatively smaller contrasts in henry s constants between components e g methane oxygen and nitrogen requires future investigation to quantify the proportionality of environmental expressions the estimation of subsurface leakage rates is not a trivial effort and consideration of mass transfer is needed to accurately estimate total leakage rates immediate environmental expression in the aqueous phase does not limit the risk for surface expression entirely as aqueous plumes develop and biological degradation occurs dissolved mass may flow or partition to the atmosphere creating a latent surface expression of the subsurface ghg in systems whose native pore water contains dissolved gases e g dissolved atmospheric gases or noble gases competition of mass transfer from gas to water and water to gas can cause significant alteration in gas composition such that surface expression of the leak may not contain the gas species of concern this impacts leak identification and assessment at the surface e g gas efflux measurements and observation of flowing gas in water wells or standing water as the measured and observed gas may not present atmospheric concern however may be indicative of a groundwater concern the environmental expression of subsurface gases such as carbon dioxide and methane are highly dependent on subsurface characteristics this notion may further complicate closing bottom up versus top down estimates of emissions from leaking gas sources future research needs to consider the implication of the competition of gas flow and mass transfer in heterogeneous systems and look to better understand the potential impacts for ghg emissions and degradation of groundwater quality declaration of competing

18288,attachment to solids is an important process for determining nanomaterial transport and their fate in environments here we revealed distinct behaviours in the attachment of silver nanoparticles agnps to kaolin and bacterial cells we found preferential attachment of agnps to the edges of kaolin decreasing ph or adding metal ions promoted agnp kaolin attachment due to the increase of positive charge on kaolin s surfaces multivalent cations mg2 and ca2 induced stronger enhancement than monovalent cations na k and ag which demonstrated the positive role of electrostatic interaction in agnp kaolin attachment however the presence of metal ions inhibited agnp binding to bacterial cells the inhibitive effect was significantly correlated with solubility product of metal ions which implied a chemical reaction mechanism in agnp cell attachment in kaolin system humic acid ha can considerably inhibit agnp attachment and diminish the enhanced effects induced by metal ions in contrast in bacterial cell system ha reduced the inhibitive effect of metal ions for agnp adsorption although ha itself had negligible effect on agnp cell attachment taken together our results demonstrated the contribution of electrostatic attraction versus chemical interaction to the attachment of agnps to kaolin or bacterial cells providing fundamental support to understand the attachment of nanomaterials to inorganic and organic solids in the environments graphical abstract image 1 keywords nanomaterial attachment kaolin bacterial cell environmental fate 1 introduction silver nanoparticle agnp is one of the widely used nanomaterials for antimicrobial and other applications le ouay and stellacci 2015 the ecological risk of agnps is under special concern because of their strong ecotoxicological effects möhler et al 2018 it has been demonstrated that nanoparticles tend to attach to solids in wetlands rivers and soils known as heteroaggregation once they enter the environments cornelis et al 2014 espinasse et al 2018 markus et al 2016 for example most of the agnps 80 are removed via attaching to activated sludge in wastewater treatment plants choi et al 2017 the attached agnps also settle with solid particles in natural waters posing risk in aquatic sediments quik et al 2012 wang et al 2018 direct agnp cell contact enhances agnp s antibacterial activity bondarenko et al 2013 but the heteroaggregation between agnps and other particles such as microbial colloids and mineral particles can reduce effective agnp exposure leading to the overall decreased toxicity bertuccio and tilton 2017 huynh et al 2014 hence to predict agnp s fate and risk in the environments it is critical to understand their interactions with environmental solid matrices quantifying the heteroaggregation is challenging due to the complexity and uncertainty of natural environments that contain various inorganic and organic substrates guo and santschi 1997 hochella et al 2008 meesters et al 2016 totsche et al 2018 the potentially different mechanisms in the attachment of agnps to organic and inorganic colloids are not explicitly elucidated yet binding of nanomaterials with clay particles can be generally explained by electrostatic theory established in colloid science many studies have investigated the impact of environmental chemistry on the heteroaggregation between engineered nanoparticles metal metal oxide and graphene and mineral particles in which process homoaggregation frequently occurs liu et al 2015a sotirelis and chrysikopoulos 2017 wang et al 2015a it is well established that nanoparticles tend to aggregate in aqueous environments zhang et al 2012 but lowering particle concentration can reduce their homoaggregation rates metreveli et al 2015 the concentrations of discharged nanomaterials are very low largely in ng l range in environments li et al 2016 markus et al 2016 currently few ng l of agnps are detected in surface waters most of which are likely to be present as individual particles free or attached metcalfe et al 2018 peters et al 2018 therefore it is more meaningful to quantify the heteroaggregation of individual agnps to reflect realistic environmental scenarios where agnp homoaggregation is expected to be very limited in many environments mineral particles are covered by organic materials and microbes such as bacteria that are abundant in ground waters open oceans sediments and soils flemming and wuertz 2019 grossart et al 2003 newcomb et al 2017 the direct contact between nanoparticles and these solids has been reported to play a critical role in nanomaterial transport and fate for instance the internalization of nanoparticles by daphnia was correlated with surface attachment affinity of nanoparticles to algae in a food web geitner et al 2016 hanna et al recently demonstrated that gold nanoparticles bound to escherichia coli cells inducing the formation of large bacterial aggregates which reduced the availability of bacteria to caenorhabditis elegans hanna et al 2018 a previous study showed that positively charged nanoparticles have higher affinity with bacteria that are negatively charged on the surfaces than negatively charged nanoparticles as a result of electrostatic interaction el badawy et al 2011 however numerous reports have demonstrated that negatively charged agnps also readily bind to cells dror ehre et al 2009 padmos et al 2015 suggesting that colloidal electrostatics cannot solely explain agnp bacterium attachment how agnp bacterium binding occurs under the influence of multiple environmental factors has remained elusive here we systematically compared the attachment of agnps to kaolin and bacterial cell which was designated as model inorganic and organic colloid respectively we evaluated attachment kinetics and attachment rate the agnp colloid interfaces were visualized by electron microscopy uv vis absorption spectrometry uvas was used to quantify agnp attachment we hypothesized that the different mechanisms governing the heteroaggregation of agnps with kaolin and bacterial cells were reflected in their potentially different binding behaviours under the impact of various environmental factors quantitative understanding agnp attachment to these two environmental colloids at varying ph ionic strength or dissolved organic matter dom concentration conditions may enable a comprehensive model to predict transport of agnps in environmental systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials silver nanoparticles were synthesized and concentrated according to the method reported by dong et al 2017 the chemical reagents of agno3 nabh4 nano3 kno3 ca no3 2 mg no3 2 and humic acid ha were purchased from sigma aldrich kaolin powders were purchased from kaolin malaysia sdn bhd inactive bacterial cells were obtained by dehydrating bacterial cells pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 that have grown in lysogeny broth lb overnight with serial concentrations of ethanol 50 70 90 and 100 followed by freeze drying 2 2 characterizing agnps kaolin and inactive bacterial cell the surface plasmon resonance spr of uncoated agnps was examined by uvas uv 2600 shimadzu japan previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of uvas to measure nanoparticle concentration haiss et al 2007 sikder et al 2017 we also obtained that agnp concentration was proportional to the peak absorbance apeak of agnp dispersion fig s1 to measure nanoparticulate ag concentration therefore the apeak of agnp suspension were analysed using uvas we also measured mass concentration of dissolved and total ag in agnp suspensions by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms icap q icp ms thermo fisher scientific to analyse dissolved ag concentration separating agnps from dissolved ag was performed by centrifugation 20 000 g 3 h 4 c centrifuge 5430r eppendorf the ag in the supernatant were designated as the dissolved ag to analyse total ag concentration agnp suspension was digested by 70 hno3 at 60 c the morphology of agnps kaolin and cells were analysed by transmission electron microscopy tem jeol 1400plus jeol tem images were analysed by imagej to measure size distribution the hydrodynamic diameter of agnp stock kaolin and bacterial cells that were stored in deionized water were measured by dynamic light scattering dls zetasizer nano malvern instruments their zeta ζ potential at defined ph see supplementary information were measured using zetasizer nano instrument the specific surface area and pore size of kaolin and cells were analysed using brunauer emmett teller bet and barrett joyner halenda bjh method respectively quadrsorb si quantachrome instruments 2 3 analysing agnp kaolin and agnp cell interface the attachment of agnps to kaolin or bacteria was visualized by tem and scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 7200f jeol energy dispersive x ray edx analysis was performed to examine elemental compositions using sem instrument fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir irprestige 21 shmadzu and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps axis supra kratos analytical were used to analyse surface chemistry the sample for ftir and xps were prepared by mixing kaolin or cell suspension 0 5 g l with agnps 10 mg l for 2 h 250 rpm 30 c followed by pelleting with centrifugation 4000 g 20 min washing with deionized water and freeze dying only slight detachment of agnps from kaolin or cells was detected during the washing process treating kaolin or cells with agno3 50 mg l ag were performed as the control 2 4 attachment kinetics and attachment ratio measurement for the purpose of easy detection we applied relatively high concentrations of agnps 0 10 mg l for attachment experiments silver ions always coexist with agnps and can be adsorbed by kaolin or cells making direct quantification of agnp attachment difficult by mass based analytical techniques such as icp ms and atomic absorption spectroscopy because the spr measured by uvas is associated with nanoparticulate ag which is advantageous to use uvas to quantify the change of agnp concentration during attachment experiment and meanwhile avoid the interference of ag that are primarily dispersed or released by agnp dissolution if any for attachment experiments apeak was measured and designated as agnp concentration unless otherwise stated to examine attachment kinetics time resolved attachment of agnps to 0 5 g l kaolin or cells was measured the apeak of initial agnp suspension was 1 26 at 394 nm total ag 8 56 mg l dissolved ag 0 34 mg l adding agnps in deionized water was performed as the control temperature was set at 30 c ph was adjusted to 8 9 the unattached agnps were obtained by filtrating through 0 2 μm membrane filter and were quantified using uvas at designated time intervals the agnp losses due to filtration were analysed by the control study fig s2 the apeak of unattached agnps were calibrated according to the correlation the amount of attached agnps were calculated according to apeak differences between initial dispersion and the filtrates to evaluate attachment ratio attachment of varying concentrations of agnps to kaolin or cells were measured initial agnp dispersions were prepared by diluting a concentrated agnp stock with apeak of 2 373 total ag 20 25 mg l dissolved ag 0 39 mg l by various dilution factors silver nanoparticle suspensions were mixed with kaolin or cells 0 5 g l by vigorous shaking 30 c overnight to reach equilibrium silver ions 0 50 mg l were used as the controls separating unattached agnps from kaolin or cells was performed by filtration 0 2 μm membrane filter the filtrates were analysed by uvas to calculate adsorption capacity apeak was converted to mass based concentration 2 5 influence of ph ionic species and humic acid on agnp attachment to investigate ph effect attachment of agnps to kaolin or cells at ph 7 8 or 9 0 1 was performed by mixing agnps with kaolin or cell suspension 0 5 g l by shaking at 30 c overnight in triplicate the unattached agnps were obtained by filtration the apeak of the filtrates were measured using uvas additionally we compared the attachment of varying concentrations of agnps to kaolin or cells 0 5 g l at ph 7 or 9 to measure the effects of environmental ions variable concentrations of agno3 nano3 kno3 ca no3 2 or mg no3 2 was added into the agnp kaolin or agnp cell mixture to avoid agnp aggregation metal ions were added at the concentrations below the critical levels 12 mm for monovalent cations 0 6 mm for divalent cations based on aggregation kinetics of agnps in nano3 or mg no3 2 solution fig s3 the apeak of initial agnp suspensions were 1 2 1 5 at 392 2 nm the working concentration was 0 1 and 0 5 g l for kaolin and cell system respectively their ph values were adjusted to 8 0 1 centrifuging 3000 g was performed to separate unattached agnps from kaolin 10 min or cells 30 min the apeak of unattached agnps were measured using uvas and calibrated by the control studies fig s4 the amount of attached agnps can be calculated by 1 a a peak initial a peak unattached we defined enhanced attachment ea according to 2 ea a a control where acontrol was the amount of agnps attached to kaolin or cells without adding any metal ions a positive and negative value of ea represented the increase and decrease of agnp attachment in the presence of metal ions respectively to further quantify the correlation between ea and metal ion concentration we defined enhanced attachment factor eaf according to 3 eaf dea dc where c was the concentration of metal ions to simplify eaf calculation linear fitting was performed the slope of the regression line was equal to eaf cations may induce agnp aggregation depending on their concentrations although very low concentrations of metal ions 1 2 mm for na k and ag 0 1 mm for mg2 and ca2 were used to minimize homoaggregation for attachment experiments to normalize potential changes of apeak upon the addition of metal ions the efa of specific metal ions i was further calibrated by 4 eaf eaf i eaf blank where eafblank was calculated based on the blank control studies in which kaolin or bacterial cells were not present fig s5 eafi was calculated according to eq 3 to investigate the influence of dom ha was used as a representative 0 20 mg l of ha were added to agnp kaolin or agnp cell mixture the ph was controlled at 8 0 1 to investigate the combined effects of dom and metal ions attachment of agnps exposed to nano3 0 10 mm or mg no3 2 0 0 2 mm together with 5 mg l ha was performed the dispersed agnps were relatively stable on the basis of very subtle variations of uv vis absorption curves of the agnps fig s6 the agnp attachment was quantified by the method mentioned above 2 6 statistics analysis the software originpro v 8 0724 or pasw statistics v 18 0 were used to perform the statistical analysis all r2 were calculated as adjusted r2 values for statistical significance analysis and refers to p value 0 05 0 01 and 0 001 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of agnps kaolin and inactive bacterial cells the average diameter of uncoated agnps was 16 7 4 8 nm by analysing tem images fig 1 a the synthesized agnp suspension had the apeak of 0 6 0 9 at 392 2 nm and were concentrated to reach an apeak of 2 4 2 9 fig 1b the concentrations of dissolved and nanoparticulate ag in agnp stocks can be found in table s1 most of the ag 96 were in nanoparticulate form in agnp stocks tem micrograph shows the planar aluminium phyllosilicate structure of kaolin with their sizes ranging from few hundred nanometres to several micrometres the inactivated bacterial cells can maintain integrated cell shape we focused on physicochemical interactions to exclude biological activities that were very complex and beyond the scope of this work the characteristic parameters of synthesized agnps kaolin and cells were summarized in table s2 the hydrodynamic sizes of kaolin and cells were 0 5 3 μm fig 1c the specific surface area of kaolin and cells was measured of 11 6 and 21 8 m2 g respectively no large surface pores 5 nm were detected indicating that agnps exclusively interacted with particle s surface kaolin cells and agnps were negatively charged in stocks 3 2 attachment kinetics and attachment ratio silver nanoparticles can be readily adsorbed by kaolin or cells fig 2 a the uncoated agnps were relatively stable during attachment experiments as we did not observe obvious change of apeak or uv vis absorption curve profile for the control because agnps can move in a way similar as dissolved chemicals in solution alexander et al 2013 they may be able to quickly diffuse to substrate surfaces as proposed that adsorption of agnps to other particles may be an irreversible process kinetically controlled praetorius et al 2014a fig 2a shows that more than half of the dispersed agnps attached to cells during the initial 30 min reducing the availability of active binding sites until saturation in comparison the agnp kaolin attachment rate was much smaller in order to measure agnp attachment ratio we exposed kaolin or bacterial cells to varying concentrations of agnps overnight 12 h the agnp attachment linearly increased with increasing agnp concentration in the small concentration range fig 2b increasing ag exposure to relatively high concentrations 4 mg l agnps for kaolin 30 mg l ag for bacterial cells did not lead to apparent change of attachment probably due to saturation of binding sites kaolin were to some extent able to adsorb agnps but ag adsorption was very small bacterial cells displayed much stronger agnp or ag adsorption capacity than kaolin as indicated by the calculated attachment ratio that was in the order of cell agnp cell ag kaolin agnp kaolin ag fig 2c these analyses were similar as the results of langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherm modelling see supplementary information fig s7 and table s3 as compared with the large discrepancy in attachment ratio between agnps and ag in kaolin system nearly same attachment ratio of agnps and ag was calculated in bacterial cell system probably indicating different interactions of nanoparticulate and ionic ag with the two particles which was discussed below 3 3 analysis of agnp kaolin and agnp cell interfaces tem and sem images showed the preferential accumulation of agnps at the edges of kaolin and their proximity compared with relatively homogeneous attachment on cell surfaces fig 3 a and b the edge surfaces that accounted for less than one fourth of the total surfaces macht et al 2011 attracted most of the agnps in kaolin the ag intensity measured by edx was not strong in kaolin fig 3c but xps detected relatively apparent intensity at 374 and 367 ev that was assigned to ag 3d fig 3d xps results showed very small ag adsorption onto kaolin compared with large agnp adsorption which was in accordance with the attachment ratio shown in fig 2 the wide spectra can be found in fig s8 xps detected higher intensity of ag than agnps in bacterial cells even individual agnps contain thousands of ag atoms probably implying stronger affinity of ag than agnps towards cell surfaces the interactions between particles are frequently described by classical derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory wang et al 2015b we cannot exclude hydrogen force bridging hydrophobic effect or steric force which was largely associated with organic coating boal et al 2000 tan et al 2017 for uncoated agnps the involvement of these forces in agnp attachment process may be limited we assumed that van de waals force vvdw electrostatic interaction vel and chemical bonding vch had the main contribution nel et al 2009 wang et al 2015b kaolin features a 1 1 type clay mineral comprising one silica tetrahedral basal plane and one alumina octahedral basal plane where their surfaces are heterogeneously charged dill 2016 liu et al 2015b ftir spectra analysis presented that kaolin s surfaces were related to si o si si o al al oh or si oh fig s9a and table s4 metal ions can interact with these ligands through cation exchange or inner sphere complexation srivastava et al 2005 it may be difficult for nanoparticles to replace kaolin surface cations considering relatively large size of nanoparticles the vch that was related to the reaction of agnps with al o or si o is yet to be determined we proposed that vvdw and vel primarily governed agnp kaolin attachment previous studies showed that kaolin can adsorb graphene oxide and titanium oxide nanoparticles as a result of electrostatic attraction feng et al 2017 huang et al 2016 labille et al 2015 liu et al also reported that the heteroaggregation between bare agnps and clay was attributed to vel in which high electrolyte concentration were required to screen surface charge to reduce their binding energy barrier liu et al 2015a for kaolin si o surfaces are permanently negatively charged at ph 3 whereas al o surfaces and edges have anisotropic electrical property with the isoelectric point of al o surfaces at ph around 6 and the point of zero net charge of edges at ph around 7 gupta and miller 2010 herrington et al 1992 although kaolin s ζ potential was measured of 20 2 0 8 mv at ph 5 3 table s2 the edges could be more positively charged to attract negatively charged agnps for bacteria ftir spectra analysis revealed that cell surfaces contained coo 1396 cm 1 c n 1454 cm 1 n h 1647 and 1539 cm 1 c o c and c c 1085 and 1238 cm 1 and phosphoryl groups 1200 900 cm 1 fig s9b and table s5 these functional groups may be associated with lipopolysaccharides proteins and phospholipids in bacterial outer membrane and had high affinity with ag doyle et al 1980 vijayaraghavan and yun 2008 nanoparticle surface atoms can readily interact with various organics including many ligands boles et al 2016 blood proteins chen et al 2017 and dom philippe and schaumann 2014 through chemical bond in coordination complex the vch between the surface ag of agnps and bacterial surface ligands may account for the agnp cell attachment it is not common that metals entirely cover whole outer membrane due to chemical heterogeneity of cell surfaces french et al 2013 some domains may have relatively stronger ag affinity to accumulate more agnps as indicated by tem and sem images 3 4 effects of ph on agnp attachment to investigate ph effect we exposed agnp dispersion apeak1 29 0 11 total ag 8 46 mg l dissolved ag 58 μg l to 0 5 g l kaolin or cell suspension at different ph the amount of attached agnps decreased from 96 to 27 in kaolin suspension but slightly increased from 35 to 48 in cell suspension when ph increased from 7 to 9 fig 4 a in addition we measured the attachment of varying concentrations of agnps apeak 0 13 1 04 at ph 7 and 9 respectively the amounts of attached agnps linearly increased upon the exposure of increasing agnp concentrations fig s10 we calculated the attachment ratio by linear regression of the amounts of attached agnps against the initial agnp concentrations when ph increased from 7 to 9 attachment ratio decreased from 99 to 31 in kaolin system but increased from 76 to 81 in cell system fig 4b these opposite trends might suggest different mechanisms in the attachment of agnps to kaolin and bacterial cells it has been reported that decreasing ph supressed adsorption of metal ions onto clay as a result of competition from proton h arias and sen 2009 srivastava et al 2005 lowering ph can induce pronation of hydroxy groups on kaolin surfaces srivastava et al 2005 particularly on the broken edges where al o and si o were more active hu and yang 2013 resulting in the increase of positive charge density on surfaces fig 4c this can promote the adsorption of negatively charged agnps fig 4c shows that the absolute ζ potential values of bacterial cell and agnps both decreased when decreasing ph in this case declined repulsive force between negatively charged agnps and negatively charged cells would be expected on a basis of electrostatic interaction which should favour agnp cell attachment instead decreased agnp attachment was observed by decreasing ph suggesting other mechanism involved in agnp cell attachment process increasing ph can induce deprotonation of some functional membrane groups such as carboxyl amino and phosphate leading to increased metal ion sorption by complexation plette et al 1996 likewise the enhanced agnp cell attachment at high ph condition may be governed by a similar chemical interaction mechanism 3 5 effects of metal ions on agnp attachment the addition of metal ions including na k ca2 mg2 or ag promoted the adsorption of agnps onto kaolin in a concentration dependent manner fig s11a furthermore divalent cations mg2 and ca2 induced much stronger promotion than monovalent cations ag k and na fig 5 a we measured that kaolin s ζ potential became more positive with the addition of these metal ions fig 5b we linearly fitted ζ potential against cation concentrations the slope was designated as ζ influence factor fig 5c shows the relationship between ζ potential factor and eaf which was strongly associated with valence of metal ions kaolin can adsorb various metal ions bradl 2004 matłok et al 2015 multivalent cations were more efficient than monovalent cations to decrease debye length and thus reduce the energy barrier for agnp kaolin attachment based on dlvo theory smith et al 2016 in contrast adding metal ions caused the decrease of agnp bacterium attachment fig s11b the inhibitive effect was in the order of na k mg2 ca2 ag metals can be easily adsorbed by bacterial cells wang and chen 2009 which may be linked with metal ion s physicochemical properties zamil et al 2009 we correlated a variety of metal parameters including ionic radius electronegativity standard redox potential ionic index covalent index and solubility with eaf positive association with metal solubility products ksp was identified fig s12 and table s6 fig 5d shows that decreases in eaf were significantly associated with increases of negative logarithms of solubility product constants pksp of metal oxalate that was used to represent metal ion s chemical reaction activity with bacterial surfaces suggesting a role of covalent binding in agnp cell attachment these findings were consistent with those indicated by the relationship between metal ion s bactericidal activities and their solubility products workentine et al 2008 even different metal ions with different affinities with cells competed for binding sites on cell surface doyle et al 1980 this might explain the ksp related inhibition for agnp cell attachment ions can diffuse much quicker than nanoparticles and first occupy the reactive sites leading to the reduced binding sites for agnps on bacterial surfaces the metal ions with higher affinity towards bacterial surface molecules such as ag would be expected to cause stronger competition and thus larger decline of agnp attachment 3 6 effects of humic acid on agnp attachment fig 6 a shows that agnp attachment ratio sharply decreased from 50 to 10 by increasing ha concentration from 0 to 1 mg l in kaolin system increasing ha concentration from 1 to 5 mg l did not induce apparent change of agnp kaolin attachment interestingly we measured synchronous decreases of kaolin s ζ potential with the addition of ha which was significantly correlated with the decline of agnp attachment fig 6b dom can be adsorbed by kaolin particularly onto the relatively positively charged alumina panel and edges neutralizing kaolin s surface charge vermeer et al 1998 high concentrations of ha 1 mg l may be able to completely diminish kaolin s effectively positive charge this would decrease the attractive force between agnps and kaolin we cannot exclude the involvement of steric hinderance or ha s competition for surface binding sites reported in previous studies geitner et al 2017 wang et al 2015a it is more likely that electrostatic interaction mainly accounted for the binding of agnps to kaolin since adding metal ions which led to increase of kaolin s ζ potential kaolin became more positively charged reverted eaf from negative to positive as examined below in bacterial cell system agnp cell attachment was not sensitive to ha as agnp adsorption only slightly decreased upon adding ha up to a concentration of 20 mg l fig 6a a previous report demonstrated that ha can be readily adsorbed by nanoparticles on surface praetorius et al 2014b the uncoated agnps might be able to adsorb ha but the surface ha may undergo exchange with other biomolecules depending on their affinity with nanoparticle surfaces hadjidemetriou and kostarelos 2017 if chemical interaction mediated the agnp adsorption by cells the adsorbed ha could be replaced by some membrane molecules with strong ag affinity such as those containing arginine lysine histidine and cysteine eckhardt et al 2013 then the agnp cell attachment would be irrelevant to the presence of ha the ha effect was further evaluated in metal ion ha complex system in kaolin suspension with the presence of 0 10 mm na or 0 0 2 mm mg2 the addition of 5 mg l of ha caused the decrease of agnp attachment ratio from 67 to 5 fig s13a fig 6c shows the cumulative results from the positive effects of metal ions and the negative effects of ha adding ha to na or mg2 exposed kaolin induced the decrease of eaf values which was consistent with the attachment efficiency profile of agnp glass bead attachment measured in multiple ionic strength and ha concentration conditions geitner et al 2017 in ha metal ion dual system the free or adsorbed ha can complex with metal ions wan and liu 2006 wu et al 2002 which neutralized ha s negative charge and reduced ha s negative influence on agnp kaolin attachment in cell system no obvious difference was observed about the eaf between in the presence and in the absence of ha but the presence of ha reduced the negative influence of na or mg2 figs 6d and s13b this might be attributed to the complexation between ha and metal ions in the liquid which reduced effective na or mg2 to compete with agnps for the limited binding sites on bacterial surfaces and thus diminished their inhibitive effects 4 conclusions by quantifying the attachment of agnps to kaolin and bacterial cells under the impact of variable environmental factors ph ionic species and humic acid this work revealed distinct mechanisms in heteroaggregation of agnps with mineral and organic particles the presence of metal ions especially the multivalent cations significantly enhances the attachment of agnps to kaolin however humic acid tends to stabilize kaolin and prevent agnp kaolin attachment at low concentrations we found that the heteroaggregation between agnps and kaolin was strongly correlated with kaolin s zeta potential suggesting a role of electrostatic attraction in agnp kaolin attachment in contrast lowering ph or adding metal ions inhibited agnp cell attachment the inhibitive effect was associated with solubility product of metal salts which suggests the chemical interaction mechanism in agnp binding to bacterial cells humic acid itself had little impact on agnp cell attachment but it may complex with metal ions so that their effective concentrations in solution will be reduced as a result it can mitigate metal ion s competition for agnp adsorption by bacterial cells declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

18288,attachment to solids is an important process for determining nanomaterial transport and their fate in environments here we revealed distinct behaviours in the attachment of silver nanoparticles agnps to kaolin and bacterial cells we found preferential attachment of agnps to the edges of kaolin decreasing ph or adding metal ions promoted agnp kaolin attachment due to the increase of positive charge on kaolin s surfaces multivalent cations mg2 and ca2 induced stronger enhancement than monovalent cations na k and ag which demonstrated the positive role of electrostatic interaction in agnp kaolin attachment however the presence of metal ions inhibited agnp binding to bacterial cells the inhibitive effect was significantly correlated with solubility product of metal ions which implied a chemical reaction mechanism in agnp cell attachment in kaolin system humic acid ha can considerably inhibit agnp attachment and diminish the enhanced effects induced by metal ions in contrast in bacterial cell system ha reduced the inhibitive effect of metal ions for agnp adsorption although ha itself had negligible effect on agnp cell attachment taken together our results demonstrated the contribution of electrostatic attraction versus chemical interaction to the attachment of agnps to kaolin or bacterial cells providing fundamental support to understand the attachment of nanomaterials to inorganic and organic solids in the environments graphical abstract image 1 keywords nanomaterial attachment kaolin bacterial cell environmental fate 1 introduction silver nanoparticle agnp is one of the widely used nanomaterials for antimicrobial and other applications le ouay and stellacci 2015 the ecological risk of agnps is under special concern because of their strong ecotoxicological effects möhler et al 2018 it has been demonstrated that nanoparticles tend to attach to solids in wetlands rivers and soils known as heteroaggregation once they enter the environments cornelis et al 2014 espinasse et al 2018 markus et al 2016 for example most of the agnps 80 are removed via attaching to activated sludge in wastewater treatment plants choi et al 2017 the attached agnps also settle with solid particles in natural waters posing risk in aquatic sediments quik et al 2012 wang et al 2018 direct agnp cell contact enhances agnp s antibacterial activity bondarenko et al 2013 but the heteroaggregation between agnps and other particles such as microbial colloids and mineral particles can reduce effective agnp exposure leading to the overall decreased toxicity bertuccio and tilton 2017 huynh et al 2014 hence to predict agnp s fate and risk in the environments it is critical to understand their interactions with environmental solid matrices quantifying the heteroaggregation is challenging due to the complexity and uncertainty of natural environments that contain various inorganic and organic substrates guo and santschi 1997 hochella et al 2008 meesters et al 2016 totsche et al 2018 the potentially different mechanisms in the attachment of agnps to organic and inorganic colloids are not explicitly elucidated yet binding of nanomaterials with clay particles can be generally explained by electrostatic theory established in colloid science many studies have investigated the impact of environmental chemistry on the heteroaggregation between engineered nanoparticles metal metal oxide and graphene and mineral particles in which process homoaggregation frequently occurs liu et al 2015a sotirelis and chrysikopoulos 2017 wang et al 2015a it is well established that nanoparticles tend to aggregate in aqueous environments zhang et al 2012 but lowering particle concentration can reduce their homoaggregation rates metreveli et al 2015 the concentrations of discharged nanomaterials are very low largely in ng l range in environments li et al 2016 markus et al 2016 currently few ng l of agnps are detected in surface waters most of which are likely to be present as individual particles free or attached metcalfe et al 2018 peters et al 2018 therefore it is more meaningful to quantify the heteroaggregation of individual agnps to reflect realistic environmental scenarios where agnp homoaggregation is expected to be very limited in many environments mineral particles are covered by organic materials and microbes such as bacteria that are abundant in ground waters open oceans sediments and soils flemming and wuertz 2019 grossart et al 2003 newcomb et al 2017 the direct contact between nanoparticles and these solids has been reported to play a critical role in nanomaterial transport and fate for instance the internalization of nanoparticles by daphnia was correlated with surface attachment affinity of nanoparticles to algae in a food web geitner et al 2016 hanna et al recently demonstrated that gold nanoparticles bound to escherichia coli cells inducing the formation of large bacterial aggregates which reduced the availability of bacteria to caenorhabditis elegans hanna et al 2018 a previous study showed that positively charged nanoparticles have higher affinity with bacteria that are negatively charged on the surfaces than negatively charged nanoparticles as a result of electrostatic interaction el badawy et al 2011 however numerous reports have demonstrated that negatively charged agnps also readily bind to cells dror ehre et al 2009 padmos et al 2015 suggesting that colloidal electrostatics cannot solely explain agnp bacterium attachment how agnp bacterium binding occurs under the influence of multiple environmental factors has remained elusive here we systematically compared the attachment of agnps to kaolin and bacterial cell which was designated as model inorganic and organic colloid respectively we evaluated attachment kinetics and attachment rate the agnp colloid interfaces were visualized by electron microscopy uv vis absorption spectrometry uvas was used to quantify agnp attachment we hypothesized that the different mechanisms governing the heteroaggregation of agnps with kaolin and bacterial cells were reflected in their potentially different binding behaviours under the impact of various environmental factors quantitative understanding agnp attachment to these two environmental colloids at varying ph ionic strength or dissolved organic matter dom concentration conditions may enable a comprehensive model to predict transport of agnps in environmental systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials silver nanoparticles were synthesized and concentrated according to the method reported by dong et al 2017 the chemical reagents of agno3 nabh4 nano3 kno3 ca no3 2 mg no3 2 and humic acid ha were purchased from sigma aldrich kaolin powders were purchased from kaolin malaysia sdn bhd inactive bacterial cells were obtained by dehydrating bacterial cells pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 that have grown in lysogeny broth lb overnight with serial concentrations of ethanol 50 70 90 and 100 followed by freeze drying 2 2 characterizing agnps kaolin and inactive bacterial cell the surface plasmon resonance spr of uncoated agnps was examined by uvas uv 2600 shimadzu japan previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of uvas to measure nanoparticle concentration haiss et al 2007 sikder et al 2017 we also obtained that agnp concentration was proportional to the peak absorbance apeak of agnp dispersion fig s1 to measure nanoparticulate ag concentration therefore the apeak of agnp suspension were analysed using uvas we also measured mass concentration of dissolved and total ag in agnp suspensions by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms icap q icp ms thermo fisher scientific to analyse dissolved ag concentration separating agnps from dissolved ag was performed by centrifugation 20 000 g 3 h 4 c centrifuge 5430r eppendorf the ag in the supernatant were designated as the dissolved ag to analyse total ag concentration agnp suspension was digested by 70 hno3 at 60 c the morphology of agnps kaolin and cells were analysed by transmission electron microscopy tem jeol 1400plus jeol tem images were analysed by imagej to measure size distribution the hydrodynamic diameter of agnp stock kaolin and bacterial cells that were stored in deionized water were measured by dynamic light scattering dls zetasizer nano malvern instruments their zeta ζ potential at defined ph see supplementary information were measured using zetasizer nano instrument the specific surface area and pore size of kaolin and cells were analysed using brunauer emmett teller bet and barrett joyner halenda bjh method respectively quadrsorb si quantachrome instruments 2 3 analysing agnp kaolin and agnp cell interface the attachment of agnps to kaolin or bacteria was visualized by tem and scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 7200f jeol energy dispersive x ray edx analysis was performed to examine elemental compositions using sem instrument fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir irprestige 21 shmadzu and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps axis supra kratos analytical were used to analyse surface chemistry the sample for ftir and xps were prepared by mixing kaolin or cell suspension 0 5 g l with agnps 10 mg l for 2 h 250 rpm 30 c followed by pelleting with centrifugation 4000 g 20 min washing with deionized water and freeze dying only slight detachment of agnps from kaolin or cells was detected during the washing process treating kaolin or cells with agno3 50 mg l ag were performed as the control 2 4 attachment kinetics and attachment ratio measurement for the purpose of easy detection we applied relatively high concentrations of agnps 0 10 mg l for attachment experiments silver ions always coexist with agnps and can be adsorbed by kaolin or cells making direct quantification of agnp attachment difficult by mass based analytical techniques such as icp ms and atomic absorption spectroscopy because the spr measured by uvas is associated with nanoparticulate ag which is advantageous to use uvas to quantify the change of agnp concentration during attachment experiment and meanwhile avoid the interference of ag that are primarily dispersed or released by agnp dissolution if any for attachment experiments apeak was measured and designated as agnp concentration unless otherwise stated to examine attachment kinetics time resolved attachment of agnps to 0 5 g l kaolin or cells was measured the apeak of initial agnp suspension was 1 26 at 394 nm total ag 8 56 mg l dissolved ag 0 34 mg l adding agnps in deionized water was performed as the control temperature was set at 30 c ph was adjusted to 8 9 the unattached agnps were obtained by filtrating through 0 2 μm membrane filter and were quantified using uvas at designated time intervals the agnp losses due to filtration were analysed by the control study fig s2 the apeak of unattached agnps were calibrated according to the correlation the amount of attached agnps were calculated according to apeak differences between initial dispersion and the filtrates to evaluate attachment ratio attachment of varying concentrations of agnps to kaolin or cells were measured initial agnp dispersions were prepared by diluting a concentrated agnp stock with apeak of 2 373 total ag 20 25 mg l dissolved ag 0 39 mg l by various dilution factors silver nanoparticle suspensions were mixed with kaolin or cells 0 5 g l by vigorous shaking 30 c overnight to reach equilibrium silver ions 0 50 mg l were used as the controls separating unattached agnps from kaolin or cells was performed by filtration 0 2 μm membrane filter the filtrates were analysed by uvas to calculate adsorption capacity apeak was converted to mass based concentration 2 5 influence of ph ionic species and humic acid on agnp attachment to investigate ph effect attachment of agnps to kaolin or cells at ph 7 8 or 9 0 1 was performed by mixing agnps with kaolin or cell suspension 0 5 g l by shaking at 30 c overnight in triplicate the unattached agnps were obtained by filtration the apeak of the filtrates were measured using uvas additionally we compared the attachment of varying concentrations of agnps to kaolin or cells 0 5 g l at ph 7 or 9 to measure the effects of environmental ions variable concentrations of agno3 nano3 kno3 ca no3 2 or mg no3 2 was added into the agnp kaolin or agnp cell mixture to avoid agnp aggregation metal ions were added at the concentrations below the critical levels 12 mm for monovalent cations 0 6 mm for divalent cations based on aggregation kinetics of agnps in nano3 or mg no3 2 solution fig s3 the apeak of initial agnp suspensions were 1 2 1 5 at 392 2 nm the working concentration was 0 1 and 0 5 g l for kaolin and cell system respectively their ph values were adjusted to 8 0 1 centrifuging 3000 g was performed to separate unattached agnps from kaolin 10 min or cells 30 min the apeak of unattached agnps were measured using uvas and calibrated by the control studies fig s4 the amount of attached agnps can be calculated by 1 a a peak initial a peak unattached we defined enhanced attachment ea according to 2 ea a a control where acontrol was the amount of agnps attached to kaolin or cells without adding any metal ions a positive and negative value of ea represented the increase and decrease of agnp attachment in the presence of metal ions respectively to further quantify the correlation between ea and metal ion concentration we defined enhanced attachment factor eaf according to 3 eaf dea dc where c was the concentration of metal ions to simplify eaf calculation linear fitting was performed the slope of the regression line was equal to eaf cations may induce agnp aggregation depending on their concentrations although very low concentrations of metal ions 1 2 mm for na k and ag 0 1 mm for mg2 and ca2 were used to minimize homoaggregation for attachment experiments to normalize potential changes of apeak upon the addition of metal ions the efa of specific metal ions i was further calibrated by 4 eaf eaf i eaf blank where eafblank was calculated based on the blank control studies in which kaolin or bacterial cells were not present fig s5 eafi was calculated according to eq 3 to investigate the influence of dom ha was used as a representative 0 20 mg l of ha were added to agnp kaolin or agnp cell mixture the ph was controlled at 8 0 1 to investigate the combined effects of dom and metal ions attachment of agnps exposed to nano3 0 10 mm or mg no3 2 0 0 2 mm together with 5 mg l ha was performed the dispersed agnps were relatively stable on the basis of very subtle variations of uv vis absorption curves of the agnps fig s6 the agnp attachment was quantified by the method mentioned above 2 6 statistics analysis the software originpro v 8 0724 or pasw statistics v 18 0 were used to perform the statistical analysis all r2 were calculated as adjusted r2 values for statistical significance analysis and refers to p value 0 05 0 01 and 0 001 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of agnps kaolin and inactive bacterial cells the average diameter of uncoated agnps was 16 7 4 8 nm by analysing tem images fig 1 a the synthesized agnp suspension had the apeak of 0 6 0 9 at 392 2 nm and were concentrated to reach an apeak of 2 4 2 9 fig 1b the concentrations of dissolved and nanoparticulate ag in agnp stocks can be found in table s1 most of the ag 96 were in nanoparticulate form in agnp stocks tem micrograph shows the planar aluminium phyllosilicate structure of kaolin with their sizes ranging from few hundred nanometres to several micrometres the inactivated bacterial cells can maintain integrated cell shape we focused on physicochemical interactions to exclude biological activities that were very complex and beyond the scope of this work the characteristic parameters of synthesized agnps kaolin and cells were summarized in table s2 the hydrodynamic sizes of kaolin and cells were 0 5 3 μm fig 1c the specific surface area of kaolin and cells was measured of 11 6 and 21 8 m2 g respectively no large surface pores 5 nm were detected indicating that agnps exclusively interacted with particle s surface kaolin cells and agnps were negatively charged in stocks 3 2 attachment kinetics and attachment ratio silver nanoparticles can be readily adsorbed by kaolin or cells fig 2 a the uncoated agnps were relatively stable during attachment experiments as we did not observe obvious change of apeak or uv vis absorption curve profile for the control because agnps can move in a way similar as dissolved chemicals in solution alexander et al 2013 they may be able to quickly diffuse to substrate surfaces as proposed that adsorption of agnps to other particles may be an irreversible process kinetically controlled praetorius et al 2014a fig 2a shows that more than half of the dispersed agnps attached to cells during the initial 30 min reducing the availability of active binding sites until saturation in comparison the agnp kaolin attachment rate was much smaller in order to measure agnp attachment ratio we exposed kaolin or bacterial cells to varying concentrations of agnps overnight 12 h the agnp attachment linearly increased with increasing agnp concentration in the small concentration range fig 2b increasing ag exposure to relatively high concentrations 4 mg l agnps for kaolin 30 mg l ag for bacterial cells did not lead to apparent change of attachment probably due to saturation of binding sites kaolin were to some extent able to adsorb agnps but ag adsorption was very small bacterial cells displayed much stronger agnp or ag adsorption capacity than kaolin as indicated by the calculated attachment ratio that was in the order of cell agnp cell ag kaolin agnp kaolin ag fig 2c these analyses were similar as the results of langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherm modelling see supplementary information fig s7 and table s3 as compared with the large discrepancy in attachment ratio between agnps and ag in kaolin system nearly same attachment ratio of agnps and ag was calculated in bacterial cell system probably indicating different interactions of nanoparticulate and ionic ag with the two particles which was discussed below 3 3 analysis of agnp kaolin and agnp cell interfaces tem and sem images showed the preferential accumulation of agnps at the edges of kaolin and their proximity compared with relatively homogeneous attachment on cell surfaces fig 3 a and b the edge surfaces that accounted for less than one fourth of the total surfaces macht et al 2011 attracted most of the agnps in kaolin the ag intensity measured by edx was not strong in kaolin fig 3c but xps detected relatively apparent intensity at 374 and 367 ev that was assigned to ag 3d fig 3d xps results showed very small ag adsorption onto kaolin compared with large agnp adsorption which was in accordance with the attachment ratio shown in fig 2 the wide spectra can be found in fig s8 xps detected higher intensity of ag than agnps in bacterial cells even individual agnps contain thousands of ag atoms probably implying stronger affinity of ag than agnps towards cell surfaces the interactions between particles are frequently described by classical derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory wang et al 2015b we cannot exclude hydrogen force bridging hydrophobic effect or steric force which was largely associated with organic coating boal et al 2000 tan et al 2017 for uncoated agnps the involvement of these forces in agnp attachment process may be limited we assumed that van de waals force vvdw electrostatic interaction vel and chemical bonding vch had the main contribution nel et al 2009 wang et al 2015b kaolin features a 1 1 type clay mineral comprising one silica tetrahedral basal plane and one alumina octahedral basal plane where their surfaces are heterogeneously charged dill 2016 liu et al 2015b ftir spectra analysis presented that kaolin s surfaces were related to si o si si o al al oh or si oh fig s9a and table s4 metal ions can interact with these ligands through cation exchange or inner sphere complexation srivastava et al 2005 it may be difficult for nanoparticles to replace kaolin surface cations considering relatively large size of nanoparticles the vch that was related to the reaction of agnps with al o or si o is yet to be determined we proposed that vvdw and vel primarily governed agnp kaolin attachment previous studies showed that kaolin can adsorb graphene oxide and titanium oxide nanoparticles as a result of electrostatic attraction feng et al 2017 huang et al 2016 labille et al 2015 liu et al also reported that the heteroaggregation between bare agnps and clay was attributed to vel in which high electrolyte concentration were required to screen surface charge to reduce their binding energy barrier liu et al 2015a for kaolin si o surfaces are permanently negatively charged at ph 3 whereas al o surfaces and edges have anisotropic electrical property with the isoelectric point of al o surfaces at ph around 6 and the point of zero net charge of edges at ph around 7 gupta and miller 2010 herrington et al 1992 although kaolin s ζ potential was measured of 20 2 0 8 mv at ph 5 3 table s2 the edges could be more positively charged to attract negatively charged agnps for bacteria ftir spectra analysis revealed that cell surfaces contained coo 1396 cm 1 c n 1454 cm 1 n h 1647 and 1539 cm 1 c o c and c c 1085 and 1238 cm 1 and phosphoryl groups 1200 900 cm 1 fig s9b and table s5 these functional groups may be associated with lipopolysaccharides proteins and phospholipids in bacterial outer membrane and had high affinity with ag doyle et al 1980 vijayaraghavan and yun 2008 nanoparticle surface atoms can readily interact with various organics including many ligands boles et al 2016 blood proteins chen et al 2017 and dom philippe and schaumann 2014 through chemical bond in coordination complex the vch between the surface ag of agnps and bacterial surface ligands may account for the agnp cell attachment it is not common that metals entirely cover whole outer membrane due to chemical heterogeneity of cell surfaces french et al 2013 some domains may have relatively stronger ag affinity to accumulate more agnps as indicated by tem and sem images 3 4 effects of ph on agnp attachment to investigate ph effect we exposed agnp dispersion apeak1 29 0 11 total ag 8 46 mg l dissolved ag 58 μg l to 0 5 g l kaolin or cell suspension at different ph the amount of attached agnps decreased from 96 to 27 in kaolin suspension but slightly increased from 35 to 48 in cell suspension when ph increased from 7 to 9 fig 4 a in addition we measured the attachment of varying concentrations of agnps apeak 0 13 1 04 at ph 7 and 9 respectively the amounts of attached agnps linearly increased upon the exposure of increasing agnp concentrations fig s10 we calculated the attachment ratio by linear regression of the amounts of attached agnps against the initial agnp concentrations when ph increased from 7 to 9 attachment ratio decreased from 99 to 31 in kaolin system but increased from 76 to 81 in cell system fig 4b these opposite trends might suggest different mechanisms in the attachment of agnps to kaolin and bacterial cells it has been reported that decreasing ph supressed adsorption of metal ions onto clay as a result of competition from proton h arias and sen 2009 srivastava et al 2005 lowering ph can induce pronation of hydroxy groups on kaolin surfaces srivastava et al 2005 particularly on the broken edges where al o and si o were more active hu and yang 2013 resulting in the increase of positive charge density on surfaces fig 4c this can promote the adsorption of negatively charged agnps fig 4c shows that the absolute ζ potential values of bacterial cell and agnps both decreased when decreasing ph in this case declined repulsive force between negatively charged agnps and negatively charged cells would be expected on a basis of electrostatic interaction which should favour agnp cell attachment instead decreased agnp attachment was observed by decreasing ph suggesting other mechanism involved in agnp cell attachment process increasing ph can induce deprotonation of some functional membrane groups such as carboxyl amino and phosphate leading to increased metal ion sorption by complexation plette et al 1996 likewise the enhanced agnp cell attachment at high ph condition may be governed by a similar chemical interaction mechanism 3 5 effects of metal ions on agnp attachment the addition of metal ions including na k ca2 mg2 or ag promoted the adsorption of agnps onto kaolin in a concentration dependent manner fig s11a furthermore divalent cations mg2 and ca2 induced much stronger promotion than monovalent cations ag k and na fig 5 a we measured that kaolin s ζ potential became more positive with the addition of these metal ions fig 5b we linearly fitted ζ potential against cation concentrations the slope was designated as ζ influence factor fig 5c shows the relationship between ζ potential factor and eaf which was strongly associated with valence of metal ions kaolin can adsorb various metal ions bradl 2004 matłok et al 2015 multivalent cations were more efficient than monovalent cations to decrease debye length and thus reduce the energy barrier for agnp kaolin attachment based on dlvo theory smith et al 2016 in contrast adding metal ions caused the decrease of agnp bacterium attachment fig s11b the inhibitive effect was in the order of na k mg2 ca2 ag metals can be easily adsorbed by bacterial cells wang and chen 2009 which may be linked with metal ion s physicochemical properties zamil et al 2009 we correlated a variety of metal parameters including ionic radius electronegativity standard redox potential ionic index covalent index and solubility with eaf positive association with metal solubility products ksp was identified fig s12 and table s6 fig 5d shows that decreases in eaf were significantly associated with increases of negative logarithms of solubility product constants pksp of metal oxalate that was used to represent metal ion s chemical reaction activity with bacterial surfaces suggesting a role of covalent binding in agnp cell attachment these findings were consistent with those indicated by the relationship between metal ion s bactericidal activities and their solubility products workentine et al 2008 even different metal ions with different affinities with cells competed for binding sites on cell surface doyle et al 1980 this might explain the ksp related inhibition for agnp cell attachment ions can diffuse much quicker than nanoparticles and first occupy the reactive sites leading to the reduced binding sites for agnps on bacterial surfaces the metal ions with higher affinity towards bacterial surface molecules such as ag would be expected to cause stronger competition and thus larger decline of agnp attachment 3 6 effects of humic acid on agnp attachment fig 6 a shows that agnp attachment ratio sharply decreased from 50 to 10 by increasing ha concentration from 0 to 1 mg l in kaolin system increasing ha concentration from 1 to 5 mg l did not induce apparent change of agnp kaolin attachment interestingly we measured synchronous decreases of kaolin s ζ potential with the addition of ha which was significantly correlated with the decline of agnp attachment fig 6b dom can be adsorbed by kaolin particularly onto the relatively positively charged alumina panel and edges neutralizing kaolin s surface charge vermeer et al 1998 high concentrations of ha 1 mg l may be able to completely diminish kaolin s effectively positive charge this would decrease the attractive force between agnps and kaolin we cannot exclude the involvement of steric hinderance or ha s competition for surface binding sites reported in previous studies geitner et al 2017 wang et al 2015a it is more likely that electrostatic interaction mainly accounted for the binding of agnps to kaolin since adding metal ions which led to increase of kaolin s ζ potential kaolin became more positively charged reverted eaf from negative to positive as examined below in bacterial cell system agnp cell attachment was not sensitive to ha as agnp adsorption only slightly decreased upon adding ha up to a concentration of 20 mg l fig 6a a previous report demonstrated that ha can be readily adsorbed by nanoparticles on surface praetorius et al 2014b the uncoated agnps might be able to adsorb ha but the surface ha may undergo exchange with other biomolecules depending on their affinity with nanoparticle surfaces hadjidemetriou and kostarelos 2017 if chemical interaction mediated the agnp adsorption by cells the adsorbed ha could be replaced by some membrane molecules with strong ag affinity such as those containing arginine lysine histidine and cysteine eckhardt et al 2013 then the agnp cell attachment would be irrelevant to the presence of ha the ha effect was further evaluated in metal ion ha complex system in kaolin suspension with the presence of 0 10 mm na or 0 0 2 mm mg2 the addition of 5 mg l of ha caused the decrease of agnp attachment ratio from 67 to 5 fig s13a fig 6c shows the cumulative results from the positive effects of metal ions and the negative effects of ha adding ha to na or mg2 exposed kaolin induced the decrease of eaf values which was consistent with the attachment efficiency profile of agnp glass bead attachment measured in multiple ionic strength and ha concentration conditions geitner et al 2017 in ha metal ion dual system the free or adsorbed ha can complex with metal ions wan and liu 2006 wu et al 2002 which neutralized ha s negative charge and reduced ha s negative influence on agnp kaolin attachment in cell system no obvious difference was observed about the eaf between in the presence and in the absence of ha but the presence of ha reduced the negative influence of na or mg2 figs 6d and s13b this might be attributed to the complexation between ha and metal ions in the liquid which reduced effective na or mg2 to compete with agnps for the limited binding sites on bacterial surfaces and thus diminished their inhibitive effects 4 conclusions by quantifying the attachment of agnps to kaolin and bacterial cells under the impact of variable environmental factors ph ionic species and humic acid this work revealed distinct mechanisms in heteroaggregation of agnps with mineral and organic particles the presence of metal ions especially the multivalent cations significantly enhances the attachment of agnps to kaolin however humic acid tends to stabilize kaolin and prevent agnp kaolin attachment at low concentrations we found that the heteroaggregation between agnps and kaolin was strongly correlated with kaolin s zeta potential suggesting a role of electrostatic attraction in agnp kaolin attachment in contrast lowering ph or adding metal ions inhibited agnp cell attachment the inhibitive effect was associated with solubility product of metal salts which suggests the chemical interaction mechanism in agnp binding to bacterial cells humic acid itself had little impact on agnp cell attachment but it may complex with metal ions so that their effective concentrations in solution will be reduced as a result it can mitigate metal ion s competition for agnp adsorption by bacterial cells declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

severely contaminated with crude oil since then limited research has focused on the microbial community ecology of the groundwater and their impact on the associated contamination here the microbial community ecology bacterial archaeal and eukaryotic and how it relates to the characteristics of the hydrocarbon contaminants were examined for the first time since the 1991 event this study was conducted using 15 wells along the main groundwater flow direction and detected several potential hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms such as hyphomicrobiaceae porphyromonadaceae and eurotiomycetes the beta diversity of the microbial communities correlated significantly with total petroleum hydrocarbon tph concentrations and salinity the tph consisted mainly of polar compounds present as an unresolved complex mixture ucm of a highly recalcitrant nature based on the proportions of tph to dissolved organic carbon doc the results indicate that some minor biodegradation has occurred within highly contaminated aquifer zones however overall the results from this study suggest that the observed variations in tph concentrations among the sampled wells are mainly induced by mixing dilution with pristine groundwater rather than by biodegradation of the contaminants the findings make an important contribution to better understand the fate of the groundwater pollution in kuwait with important implications for the design of future remediation efforts graphical abstract image 1 keywords biodegradation community analysis groundwater hydrocarbon legacy spill oil 1 introduction during the 1991 gulf war a large portion of crude oil wells in kuwait were destroyed and set aflame the fires were burning for almost 7 months before eventually being extinguished by large amounts of seawater al duwaisan and al naseem 2011 mukhopadhyay et al 2008 an estimated 20 million barrels of crude oil gushed from the destroyed wells into the environment resulting in the largest crude oil spill in history al duwaisan and al naseem 2011 literathy 1992 as a consequence kuwait s main fresh water aquifer was left contaminated with both crude oil and salt water al duwaisan and al naseem 2011 mukhopadhyay et al 2008 despite the significant impact on the environment limited research has been conducted to assess the extent of the contamination and its fate mainly due to site access restrictions and unexploded landmines in a recent study the biodegradation potential of the contaminated groundwater was investigated for the first time bruckberger et al 2019b albeit only at a single location sample well p18 in the umm al aish region in northern kuwait a key and surprising result of that study was that the tph portion of the contaminant at the investigated site showed only minor biodegradation and was characterised by a recalcitrant unresolved complex mixture ucm the ucm mostly comprised of polar compounds 97 likely formed through weathering processes over the past 25 years bruckberger et al 2019b these types of polar compounds have been shown to be highly recalcitrant and to persist in the environment over long periods of time bruckberger et al 2019b similar ucms are commonly found at legacy hydrocarbon spills and appear to accumulate lang et al 2009 reddy et al 2002 wang et al 1994 upon exposure of hydrocarbon contamination biodegradation typically occurs with simple hydrocarbon structures degraded first such as n alkanes and branched alkanes followed by more complex and larger compounds leahy and colwell 1990 the rate of biodegradation can vary depending on the conditions present at the site contaminant bioavailability and chemical composition and the availability of electron acceptors davis et al 1999 franzmann et al 2002 röling and van verseveld 2002 in addition the biodegrading microbial community itself has been shown to depend on other environmental factors such as temperature rayner et al 2007 ph or shelton et al 2014 salinity as for example observed along a 90 km crude contaminated transect in louisiana us shelton et al 2016 salinity is known to result in decreased biodegradation rates especially if the microbial community is not adapted to these extreme conditions de souza silva and fay 2012 head et al 2014 riis et al 2003 the biodegradation rate of contaminants is impacted by multi domain interactions between species in microbial communities for example previous research has shown an enhanced biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah in soil and liquid media where interspecies co metabolism between bacterial fungal consortia occurred boonchan et al 2000 in that study the bioavailability of the contaminant was first altered by fungal peroxidation which then allowed white rot fungi and bacterial cultures to facilitate an increased biodegradation of benzo a pyrene kotterman et al 1998 while a wide range of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria in contaminated groundwater environments have been well studied in the past aburto et al 2009 franzmann et al 1996 2002 imfeld et al 2008 táncsics et al 2010 degrading archaea were mostly investigated in extreme high salinity environments members of the taxa haloarchaeae haloferax haloarcula and halobacterium have been identified as crude oil degraders al mailem et al 2010 however interspecies dynamics of archaea with other domains such as eukaryotes at highly weathered spills which have remained in the environment over long periods of time have received limited attention the recent kuwait microcosm study identified known hydrocarbon degrading taxa such as hyphomicrobiaceae pseudomonadaceae and comamonadaceae bruckberger et al 2019b however the larger microbial community structure and their impact on the fate of the gulf war hydrocarbon contamination within the broader groundwater ecosystem is still unknown here we report the findings of an investigation of the bacterial archaeal and eukaryotic communities along the highly impacted groundwater system in the umm al aish region of northern kuwait the microbial community compositions and environmental conditions were explored at 15 individual wells along a transect within the contaminated fresh water aquifer and compared to the distribution of the residual contaminant insights into the microbial community structure and how the structure responds to variations in groundwater conditions is essential in order to gain a better understanding of the processes that affect the long term fate of the contaminants in kuwait s fresh groundwater resources 2 materials methods 2 1 groundwater samples groundwater samples were obtained in november 2014 from 15 wells in the umm al aish region in northern kuwait the sampled wells are located at varying distances from

statistical analysis on selected environmental parameters tph ec no3 so4 2 do was used for exploration of the best correlation to the species abundance dissimilarities of three domains the same ordination as above was used and rank correlation analysis was performed using the bio env function of the sinkr package taylor 2014 correlation between otu numbers of all three domains with tph and ec was analysed by the spearman method using the cor test function of the stats package team r core 2014 3 results 3 1 contamination characterisation and sources a total of 15 wells in the umm al aish region in northern kuwait all located along a single transect were analysed supplementary fig 1 supplementary table 1 the tph present at the location comprised predominately of polar compounds 97 polar compounds 3 aromatics and 0 aliphatics and present as a ucm bruckberger et al 2019a targeted compound specific analysis of groundwater from the location p18 mukhopadhyay et al 2008 only found naphthalene 0 0875 μg l present above reporting limits for the 16 pahs who 1996 1998 suggesting targeting specific pahs would afford no results the absence of water insoluble aliphatics also restricted other common hydrocarbon parameters that could be assessed such as n alkanes methylalkanes isoprenoids bicyclic alkanes drimanes steranes tricyclics terpanes and hopanes samples from the source area p18 p33ua and p33ub were the only samples that contained identifiable components alkylnaphthalenes and alkyldibenzothiophenes from the gc ms scan data on evaluating every ion chromatogram from m z 45 to m z 600 and are shown in supplementary figs 8 and 9 as well as the distribution of these components in the water equilibrated with fresh crude oil rgc from raudhatain oil field that is the likely source of the petroleum contamination the tph from the groundwater samples show the presence of alkylnaphthalenes 2 methylnaphthalene removed 1 methylnaphthalene depleted altered distributions of dimethylnaphthalenes and trimethylnaphthalenes and dibenzothiophenes dibenzothiophene and difficult to assess distributions of methyldibenzothiophenes due to their low relative abundances it has been previously demonstrated that the distribution of alkylnaphthalenes can be affected by biodegradation with specific isomers depleted or removed fisher et al 1996 comparison of the alkylnaphthalenes and dibenzothiophenes in these samples and water equilibrated with rgc crude oil a non biodegraded distribution suggests the p33ua groundwater has been affected the least by biodegradation further comparison of the resistant isomers 1 2 dimethylnaphthalene 1 4 6 1 3 5 trimethylnaphthalene 1 2 4 trimethylnaphthalene 1 2 5 trimethylnaphthalene and dibenzothiophene showed similar relative abundances in the water equilibrated with the rgc crude oil and the p33ua and p33ub groundwater suggesting these compounds have been largely unaffected by biodegradation and that the rgc crude oil is a good match for the original crude oil that was released and resulting in the petroleum contamination for the potential sources of the polar compound ucms in the groundwater samples the likely sources are metabolites from the biodegradation of the crude oil bruckberger et al 2019a direct input from the polar compounds originally contained in the fresh crude oil and input from pyrogenic compounds as a result of the crude oil fires input of the pyrogenic compounds was discounted as the products from the fires produce lower molecular weight components as observed for aldehydes and ketones formed from the emissions of petroleum fires booher and janke 1997 likely as a result of cracking reactions and there are no significant inputs from pyrogenic specific pahs killops and massoud 1992 that have been found in the groundwater at the location mukhopadhyay et al 2008 which would likely be present if the polar compound ucms were due to a pyrogenic inputs in addition pyrogenic pahs are largely limited to parent structures with no associated alkyl homologues killops and massoud 1992 and do not result in complex mixtures therefore it is difficult to explain how this process could form polar compound ucms the pyrogenic components formed would likely have been removed as smoke emissions with co2 co and aerosols consisting of microdroplets of the crude oil direct input of the polar compounds present in the fresh crude oil was discounted based on the distribution of the polar compound ucm and the relatively large proportion of resistant compounds dimethylnaphthalenes relative to the polar compound ucm in the water equilibrated with the fresh crude oil rgc compared to the tph in the ground water samples supplementary fig 8 the polar compound ucm from the water soluble components of the fresh crude oil is significantly lighter than the polar ucm present in the tph from the groundwater for the total tph response supplementary fig 8 the relative abundance of the dimethylnaphthalenes where 1 2 dimethylnaphthalene is largely unaffected by biodegradation is not visible compared to the polar compound ucm in the tph groundwater sample p33ua whereas as the dimethylnaphthalenes are clearly visible and a significant peak height compared the polar compound ucm in the water equilibrated with the crude oil rgc therefore the much higher proportion of the polar compound ucm in the groundwater samples suggests the polar compound ucm in the groundwater samples are not likely sourced directly from crude oil the premise that the polar compound ucm at the site have been formed from the partial biodegradation forming metabolites of the crude oil has been suggested bruckberger et al 2019a this premise can account for the complexity of the polar compound ucm formed i e metabolites from biodegraded petroleum consisting of a ucm and why the polar compound ucm is larger and heavier than the original polar compounds present in the fresh crude oil rgc and the strong correlation with doc and ec supplementary fig 4 as the crude oil likely travelled into the subsurface with the seawater used to fight the fires and the polar compound ucms observed in the groundwater in this study are consistent in complexity and molecular weight ranges as reported for other studies bruckberger et al 2019a lang et al 2009 3 2 contamination distribution and environmental factors the highest ec and doc and tph concentrations were observed in wells p33ua 6390 μs cm 38 mg l and 7 7 mg l respectively p33ub 9960 μs cm 41 mg l 7 3 mg l respectively and p18 7510 μs cm 35 mg l 6 5 mg l respectively total ion chromatograms tics of the tph extracts showed the presence of a ucm or hump with decreasing concentration along the transect fig 1 supplementary table 1 with two locations near the end of the transect p59ub p61ub having tph concentrations below the limits of reporting 0 05 mg l and above detections limits 0 015 mg l locations p33ua p33ub and p18 had the broadest ucms while other groundwater samples had a more narrow ucm profile and less observable peaks fig 1 between the highest contaminated samples p33ua p33ub and p18 and p19 the changes in the ucm shape corresponded to a 20 45 decrease of the tph portion supplementary table 1 a change in the concentration of tph relative to doc was detected between the most highly contaminated wells p33ua p33ub and p18 and the downgradient p19 well supplementary fig 2 between p19 and p61 the ratio of tph to doc remained stable supplementary fig 2 aromatic components alkylnaphthalenes and alkyldibenzothiophenes were observed at locations p18 p33ua and p33ub but not further downgradient ec decreased along the transect groundwater samples and showed a strong positive correlation with tph supplementary fig 3 and doc supplementary fig 4 other environmental parameters measured in the groundwater including dna concentrations of the extracts are shown in supplementary table 1 sulfate so4 2 was found in all wells and ranged from 28 mg l p61ub to 414 mg l p33u while phosphate po4 was below the detection limit in most wells 3 3 bacterial community bacterial diversity showed lower faith s pd measurements and number of otus at wells p32ub and p60ub compared to the other wells supplementary fig 5 bacterial otu numbers were not correlated with tph or ec when using the spearman method hyphomicrobiaceae porphyromonadaceae uncultured bacterium clone otub7 genbank hq395119 1 and candidate division zb2 phylum od1 were abundant in the groundwater with tph levels 6 5 mg l p33ua p33ub p18 fig 2 samples from wells p18 p33ua and p33ub showed a significant correlation with members belonging to alpha and deltaproteobacteria and known hydrocarbon degraders anaerolinea as well as candidate class zb2 candidate phylum od1 when fitted onto ordination fig 3 a beta diversity patterns represented in the nmds ordination showed significant correlation with the environmental factors tph and ec samples clustering furthest away from p18 p33ua and p33ub were not significantly affected by these environmental factors and showed correlation with beta and gammaproteobacteria clostridia and nitrospira fig 3a further along the transect where lower tph concentrations persisted p32u p61ub highly abundant bacterial families 2 included members of nocardioidaceae comamonadaceae and microbacteriaceae well p58ua did not cluster closely with other samples and correlated with bacteria belonging to clostridiaceae rhodobacteraceae rhodocyclaceae and comamonadaceae fig 3a 3 4 archaeal community archaeal communities had the lowest faith s pd and otu numbers in samples collected at well p33ub supplementary fig 6 total otu numbers were not correlated with ec or tph concentrations the marine benthic group mbga was present in all samples while other taxa including nitrososphaeraceae and cenarchaeaceae were found to be less abundant in samples with the highest tph and ec p18 p33ua p33ub fig 4 well p58ua showed a low abundance of sequences similar to an uncultured clone yla114 compared to the other wells but a high abundance of methanobacteriaceae which was also detected at p61ub fig 4 archaeal community structure showed a significant correlation with tph concentrations and do fig 3b a significant correlation of well p33ub with mbga and p33ua with pgrfc26 was detected and they clustered away from the rest of the samples fig 3b 3 5 eukaryotic community among the wells along the investigated aquifer section p33ub had the highest alpha diversity and the numbers of otus for eukaryotes supplementary fig 7 total otu numbers were not correlated with ec or tph concentrations sample p58ub was excluded from the 18s rrna gene data analysis due to low read numbers the most abundant taxa included the fungal taxon sordaromycetes at most wells whereas the fungi eurotiomycetes was predominantly identified in wells p33ua p33ub p18 p32u p19 and p59ua fig 5 with significant correlation with most of these wells fig 3c among the physical chemical water parameters tested tph ec no3 so4 2 do tph showed the most significant correlation with the eukaryotic community structure fig 3c 4 discussion groundwater wells that showed the highest contaminant concentrations p18 p33ua p33ub also showed an increased abundance of organisms potentially involved in biodegradation however the hydrocarbon contaminant present in those samples also appeared to be the least biodegraded based on 1 the doc tph ratio supplementary figs 2 and 2 the presence of resolvable peaks fig 1 on the ucm i e as biodegradation proceeds the resolvable peaks on the ucm are lost and 3 the fact that they still contained aromatic components alkylnaphthalenes and alkyldibenzothiophenes comparing the identified contaminant characteristics and the measured parameters of the transect samples to findings from the previous kuwait microcosm study that examined the biodegradability of the contaminants at well p18 under various treatments bruckberger et al 2019b a similar ratio of doc and tph predicted by their linear correlation was observed in the transect samples supplementary table 1 supplementary fig 2 the minor changes of doc in the transect samples in this study are most likely attributed to the loss of a small portion of the biodegradable tph further corroborating the findings of the previous microcosm study bruckberger et al 2019b the contaminant in the microcosms was shown to consist of 97 polar compounds this finding is consistent with a highly weathered and recalcitrant pollutant persisting in kuwait s groundwater bruckberger et al 2019b at other highly contaminated legacy sites low biodegradation rates have shown to result from the presence of toxic contaminant concentrations accumulation of toxic metabolites low bioavailability of the contaminant or other unfavourable environmental conditions as for example observed along an oil gradient in north east china liang et al 2009 but also at other sites ham et al 2004 prommer et al 2002 in addition a positive correlation and similar decreases of tph and ec supplementary fig 3 as well as doc and ec supplementary fig 4 along the investigated transect was observed therefore the decrease of contaminant concentrations along the transect studied here appears to be due to a combination of a limited biodegradation occurring between the most contaminated wells p33ua p33ub and p18 and p19 fig 1 supplementary fig 2 supplementary table 1 and more importantly due to dilution of tph doc and ec supplementary figs 3 and 4 downstream of well p19 the groundwater microbial communities as measured by the alpha diversity of bacterial archaeal and the eukaryotic communities as measured by faith s pd showed no obvious trend relating to tph or ec this contrasts with findings from previous research that found a loss of diversity due to hydrocarbon contaminated sediments along the gulf of mexico sutton et al 2013 in kuwait the contaminated groundwater has persisted for a long period of time 25 years which may have resulted in stable and diverse communities along the transect based on varying physical and chemical conditions correlation analysis revealed that tph ec and do were the most significant parameters influencing the bacterial and archaeal community structure anaerobic and methanogenic organisms were detected at several sites along the transect anoxic conditions at wells p33ua and p33ub could be dominating as suggested by low do and tdn concentrations supplementary table 1 and the presence of bacterial families involved in methane cycling candidate division envops12 which significantly correlated with the highly contaminated wells p33ua and p33ub has previously been detected in a methanogenic bioreactor siniscalchi et al 2017 members of families syntrophaceae fig 2 found in high abundance and syntrophobacteriaceae fig 3a correlated with the wells having the highest tph and ec p18 p33ua p33ub have been reported to be key players in the methanogenic degradation of crude oil while providing acetate or hydrogen to methanogens gray et al 2011 and have also been detected in methanogenic sediment serving in syntrophic relationships with methane producing species leloup et al 2007 plugge et al 2011 porphyromonadaceae another family known to have syntrophic relationships with methanogens esquivel elizondo et al 2016 was correlated with wells p18 p33ua and p33ub and is also able to digest oil refinery waste under methanogenic conditions hahnke et al 2015 wang et al 2016 members of family hyphomicrobiaceae were detected in the high tph samples in this study and in the previous microcosm study bruckberger et al 2019b this family has also been associated with recalcitrant polar compounds formed from weathered diesel bruckberger et al 2018 other possible degraders found at the wells p18 p33ua and p33ub included members of candidate division zb2 od1 which has been reported to be a main contributor to the biodegradation of recalcitrant compounds of crude oil in saline soil li et al 2012 yu et al 2011 comparisons of the bacterial community identified in the previous microcosm study investigating p18 bruckberger et al 2019b found some similarities and further insights on conditions likely present along the transect for example otub7 present in p33ua and p33ub was previously found enriched in anaerobic and sulfate reducing microcosms consisting of p18 groundwater further indicating anoxic conditions bruckberger et al 2019b interestingly otub7 was previously found in oil water emulsions from an oil field in malaysia indicating that the location of wells p33ua and p33ub may be closest to the original point of contaminant infiltration li et al 2012 yu et al 2011 also present although mainly at the highly contaminated wells were order mle1 48 class tk17 and tk17 unknown both of phylum chloroflexi which were enriched under anaerobic conditions in the microcosm study suggesting anoxic preferences of these taxa bruckberger et al 2019b wells further from the original contaminant source p19 p61ub on the other hand showed enrichment of nitrososphaeracea an aerobic ammonia oxidising soil archaeon stieglmeier et al 2014 actinomycetales a common soil bacteria taxa often found in uncontaminated environments lee and hwang 2002 poomthongdee et al 2015 was more abundant in wells with lower contaminated however their abundance decreased in the higher contaminated wells suggesting a sensitivity to the weathered contaminant cenarchaea similarly was present in low abundance in highly contaminated wells but in higher abundance in the lower contaminated wells this taxa has previously been found decreased in marine samples after being exposed to oil after only 72 h liu et al 2017 which appears to be similar in this contaminated groundwater system the uncultured archaeal clone yla114 was identified in multiple wells along the transect yla114 has previously been associated with a highly biodegraded contaminant in a methanogenic oil reservoir shelton et al 2016 members of the rhizobiaceae and chromatiaceae families were also found in most groundwater wells along the transect and in the previous research for well p18 bruckberger et al 2019b these families have been detected in coastal salt marshes at the gulf coast impacted by the deepwater horizon spill beazley et al 2012 lamendella et al 2014 and in a marine ecosystem impacted by seeping crude oil in southern california hawley et al 2014 interestingly wells p58ua and p61ub showed high abundances of methanobacteriaceae and methanosarcinaceae despite having do concentrations not considered anoxic 3 01 and 4 84 mg l respectively these wells also had high abundances of xanthomonadaceae p58ua and comamonadaceae which have previously been found to have a strong positive association with methanobacteriales and methanomicrobiales in anaerobic digesters hao et al 2016 they were also found enriched in anaerobic microcosms investigating hydrocarbon derived contaminants bruckberger et al 2018 no previous analysis of the eukaryotic community in the contaminated groundwater has been undertaken however this study revealed the presence of eurotiomycetes and sordariomycetes and a significant correlation of their presence with highly contaminated wells this suggests either their tolerance to the contaminants or an active involvement in the biodegradation processes eurotiomycetes have been identified in other studies from oil contaminated soil obtained from the gulf of mexico al nasrawi 2012 and are known to have the ability to transform pahs aranda 2016 previous work has also investigated the microbial diversity and possible links with the concentration of oil contamination finding only a 10 loss of fungi but up to 90 loss of the bacteria and archaeal diversity liang et al 2009 indicating greater fungal resilience as result of extinguishing the oil well fires with seawater and thus introducing an increased salinity in conjunction with the crude oil contaminant doc and tph into the originally fresh groundwater lens it remains difficult to clearly elucidate which of the two factors was more significant in reshaping the pre war microbial community composition ec values measured in the 15 wells ranged from 1760 to 9960 μs cm indicative of brackish water rather than fresh groundwater approximately 0 1500 μs cm suggesting the presence of diluted seawater at all tested wells which likely enhanced the presence of salt tolerant possibly marine microbial species such as mbga figs 4 and 3b 5 conclusion this study investigated the microbial communities and current associated crude oil contamination along a 1st gulf war impacted groundwater system in kuwait microorganisms commonly associated with hydrocarbon derived contaminants from the three microbial domains were present in the samples with the community structure significantly correlated with contaminant concentrations tph and or ec concentrations the community structure and taxonomic diversity suggest anoxic or methanogenic conditions are currently present at specific sections along the transect mainly highly contaminated wells p33ua p33ub and p18 enrichment of methanogens and methanotrophs at these wells indicate complex syntrophic relationships and tolerance to the contaminant the contaminant shows a highly weathered character 97 polars with a large ucm with few if any resolvable peaks present and likely low biodegradability a linear correlation in decreasing contaminant concentrations hydrocarbon derived doc and tph with ec and narrower smoother ucms were found in wells further away from the highly contaminated locations indicating dilution rather than significant biodegradation occurs toward the terminal point of the transect findings here indicate the presence of organisms that are capable of facilitating contaminant biodegradation however there is strong indication that the biodegradation extent of the recalcitrant contaminant has remained minimal therefore it is expected that the contaminants will further persist in the aquifer under the current conditions i e in the absence of any active intervention declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

18289,during the first gulf war 1991 a large number of oil wells were destroyed and oil fires subsequently extinguished with seawater as a result kuwait s sparse fresh groundwater resources were severely contaminated with crude oil since then limited research has focused on the microbial community ecology of the groundwater and their impact on the associated contamination here the microbial community ecology bacterial archaeal and eukaryotic and how it relates to the characteristics of the hydrocarbon contaminants were examined for the first time since the 1991 event this study was conducted using 15 wells along the main groundwater flow direction and detected several potential hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms such as hyphomicrobiaceae porphyromonadaceae and eurotiomycetes the beta diversity of the microbial communities correlated significantly with total petroleum hydrocarbon tph concentrations and salinity the tph consisted mainly of polar compounds present as an unresolved complex mixture ucm of a highly recalcitrant nature based on the proportions of tph to dissolved organic carbon doc the results indicate that some minor biodegradation has occurred within highly contaminated aquifer zones however overall the results from this study suggest that the observed variations in tph concentrations among the sampled wells are mainly induced by mixing dilution with pristine groundwater rather than by biodegradation of the contaminants the findings make an important contribution to better understand the fate of the groundwater pollution in kuwait with important implications for the design of future remediation efforts graphical abstract image 1 keywords biodegradation community analysis groundwater hydrocarbon legacy spill oil 1 introduction during the 1991 gulf war a large portion of crude oil wells in kuwait were destroyed and set aflame the fires were burning for almost 7 months before eventually being extinguished by large amounts of seawater al duwaisan and al naseem 2011 mukhopadhyay et al 2008 an estimated 20 million barrels of crude oil gushed from the destroyed wells into the environment resulting in the largest crude oil spill in history al duwaisan and al naseem 2011 literathy 1992 as a consequence kuwait s main fresh water aquifer was left contaminated with both crude oil and salt water al duwaisan and al naseem 2011 mukhopadhyay et al 2008 despite the significant impact on the environment limited research has been conducted to assess the extent of the contamination and its fate mainly due to site access restrictions and unexploded landmines in a recent study the biodegradation potential of the contaminated groundwater was investigated for the first time bruckberger et al 2019b albeit only at a single location sample well p18 in the umm al aish region in northern kuwait a key and surprising result of that study was that the tph portion of the contaminant at the investigated site showed only minor biodegradation and was characterised by a recalcitrant unresolved complex mixture ucm the ucm mostly comprised of polar compounds 97 likely formed through weathering processes over the past 25 years bruckberger et al 2019b these types of polar compounds have been shown to be highly recalcitrant and to persist in the environment over long periods of time bruckberger et al 2019b similar ucms are commonly found at legacy hydrocarbon spills and appear to accumulate lang et al 2009 reddy et al 2002 wang et al 1994 upon exposure of hydrocarbon contamination biodegradation typically occurs with simple hydrocarbon structures degraded first such as n alkanes and branched alkanes followed by more complex and larger compounds leahy and colwell 1990 the rate of biodegradation can vary depending on the conditions present at the site contaminant bioavailability and chemical composition and the availability of electron acceptors davis et al 1999 franzmann et al 2002 röling and van verseveld 2002 in addition the biodegrading microbial community itself has been shown to depend on other environmental factors such as temperature rayner et al 2007 ph or shelton et al 2014 salinity as for example observed along a 90 km crude contaminated transect in louisiana us shelton et al 2016 salinity is known to result in decreased biodegradation rates especially if the microbial community is not adapted to these extreme conditions de souza silva and fay 2012 head et al 2014 riis et al 2003 the biodegradation rate of contaminants is impacted by multi domain interactions between species in microbial communities for example previous research has shown an enhanced biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah in soil and liquid media where interspecies co metabolism between bacterial fungal consortia occurred boonchan et al 2000 in that study the bioavailability of the contaminant was first altered by fungal peroxidation which then allowed white rot fungi and bacterial cultures to facilitate an increased biodegradation of benzo a pyrene kotterman et al 1998 while a wide range of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria in contaminated groundwater environments have been well studied in the past aburto et al 2009 franzmann et al 1996 2002 imfeld et al 2008 táncsics et al 2010 degrading archaea were mostly investigated in extreme high salinity environments members of the taxa haloarchaeae haloferax haloarcula and halobacterium have been identified as crude oil degraders al mailem et al 2010 however interspecies dynamics of archaea with other domains such as eukaryotes at highly weathered spills which have remained in the environment over long periods of time have received limited attention the recent kuwait microcosm study identified known hydrocarbon degrading taxa such as hyphomicrobiaceae pseudomonadaceae and comamonadaceae bruckberger et al 2019b however the larger microbial community structure and their impact on the fate of the gulf war hydrocarbon contamination within the broader groundwater ecosystem is still unknown here we report the findings of an investigation of the bacterial archaeal and eukaryotic communities along the highly impacted groundwater system in the umm al aish region of northern kuwait the microbial community compositions and environmental conditions were explored at 15 individual wells along a transect within the contaminated fresh water aquifer and compared to the distribution of the residual contaminant insights into the microbial community structure and how the structure responds to variations in groundwater conditions is essential in order to gain a better understanding of the processes that affect the long term fate of the contaminants in kuwait s fresh groundwater resources 2 materials methods 2 1 groundwater samples groundwater samples were obtained in november 2014 from 15 wells in the umm al aish region in northern kuwait the sampled wells are located at varying distances from the main contamination source supplementary fig 1 and screened at varying depths supplementary table 1 the main contamination source has been identified in previous research and is located at the low point of the topographical depression in the catchment where the oil contaminant accumulated mukhopadhyay et al 2008 2017 groundwater samples were obtained in a similar manner as previously described

curtis dissimilarities using the nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds technique via the metamds function in vegan oksanen et al 2017 in order to investigate significant taxa the most abundant taxa 4 present in at least 5 samples was selected and fitted on the nmds using the envfit function of the vegan package oksanen et al 2017 and then visualised with ggplot2 oksanen et al 2017 additionally statistical analysis on selected environmental parameters tph ec no3 so4 2 do was used for exploration of the best correlation to the species abundance dissimilarities of three domains the same ordination as above was used and rank correlation analysis was performed using the bio env function of the sinkr package taylor 2014 correlation between otu numbers of all three domains with tph and ec was analysed by the spearman method using the cor test function of the stats package team r core 2014 3 results 3 1 contamination characterisation and sources a total of 15 wells in the umm al aish region in northern kuwait all located along a single transect were analysed supplementary fig 1 supplementary table 1 the tph present at the location comprised predominately of polar compounds 97 polar compounds 3 aromatics and 0 aliphatics and present as a ucm bruckberger et al 2019a targeted compound specific analysis of groundwater from the location p18 mukhopadhyay et al 2008 only found naphthalene 0 0875 μg l present above reporting limits for the 16 pahs who 1996 1998 suggesting targeting specific pahs would afford no results the absence of water insoluble aliphatics also restricted other common hydrocarbon parameters that could be assessed such as n alkanes methylalkanes isoprenoids bicyclic alkanes drimanes steranes tricyclics terpanes and hopanes samples from the source area p18 p33ua and p33ub were the only samples that contained identifiable components alkylnaphthalenes and alkyldibenzothiophenes from the gc ms scan data on evaluating every ion chromatogram from m z 45 to m z 600 and are shown in supplementary figs 8 and 9 as well as the distribution of these components in the water equilibrated with fresh crude oil rgc from raudhatain oil field that is the likely source of the petroleum contamination the tph from the groundwater samples show the presence of alkylnaphthalenes 2 methylnaphthalene removed 1 methylnaphthalene depleted altered distributions of dimethylnaphthalenes and trimethylnaphthalenes and dibenzothiophenes dibenzothiophene and difficult to assess distributions of methyldibenzothiophenes due to their low relative abundances it has been previously demonstrated that the distribution of alkylnaphthalenes can be affected by biodegradation with specific isomers depleted or removed fisher et al 1996 comparison of the alkylnaphthalenes and dibenzothiophenes in these samples and water equilibrated with rgc crude oil a non biodegraded distribution suggests the p33ua groundwater has been affected the least by biodegradation further comparison of the resistant isomers 1 2 dimethylnaphthalene 1 4 6 1 3 5 trimethylnaphthalene 1 2 4 trimethylnaphthalene 1 2 5 trimethylnaphthalene and dibenzothiophene showed similar relative abundances in the water equilibrated with the rgc crude oil and the p33ua and p33ub groundwater suggesting these compounds have been largely unaffected by biodegradation and that the rgc crude oil is a good match for the original crude oil that was released and resulting in the petroleum contamination for the potential sources of the polar compound ucms in the groundwater samples the likely sources are metabolites from the biodegradation of the crude oil bruckberger et al 2019a direct input from the polar compounds originally contained in the fresh crude oil and input from pyrogenic compounds as a result of the crude oil fires input of the pyrogenic compounds was discounted as the products from the fires produce lower molecular weight components as observed for aldehydes and ketones formed from the emissions of petroleum fires booher and janke 1997 likely as a result of cracking reactions and there are no significant inputs from pyrogenic specific pahs killops and massoud 1992 that have been found in the groundwater at the location mukhopadhyay et al 2008 which would likely be present if the polar compound ucms were due to a pyrogenic inputs in addition pyrogenic pahs are largely limited to parent structures with no associated alkyl homologues killops and massoud 1992 and do not result in complex mixtures therefore it is difficult to explain how this process could form polar compound ucms the pyrogenic components formed would likely have been removed as smoke emissions with co2 co and aerosols consisting of microdroplets of the crude oil direct input of the polar compounds present in the fresh crude oil was discounted based on the distribution of the polar compound ucm and the relatively large proportion of resistant compounds dimethylnaphthalenes relative to the polar compound ucm in the water equilibrated with the fresh crude oil rgc compared to the tph in the ground water samples supplementary fig 8 the polar compound ucm from the water soluble components of the fresh crude oil is significantly lighter than the polar ucm present in the tph from the groundwater for the total tph response supplementary fig 8 the relative abundance of the dimethylnaphthalenes where 1 2 dimethylnaphthalene is largely unaffected by biodegradation is not visible compared to the polar compound ucm in the tph groundwater sample p33ua whereas as the dimethylnaphthalenes are clearly visible and a significant peak height compared the polar compound ucm in the water equilibrated with the crude oil rgc therefore the much higher proportion of the polar compound ucm in the groundwater samples suggests the polar compound ucm in the groundwater samples are not likely sourced directly from crude oil the premise that the polar compound ucm at the site have been formed from the partial biodegradation forming metabolites of the crude oil has been suggested bruckberger et al 2019a this premise can account for the complexity of the polar compound ucm formed i e metabolites from biodegraded petroleum consisting of a ucm and why the polar compound ucm is larger and heavier than the original polar compounds present in the fresh crude oil rgc and the strong correlation with doc and ec supplementary fig 4 as the crude oil likely travelled into the subsurface with the seawater used to fight the fires and the polar compound ucms observed in the groundwater in this study are consistent in complexity and molecular weight ranges as reported for other studies bruckberger et al 2019a lang et al 2009 3 2 contamination distribution and environmental factors the highest ec and doc and tph concentrations were observed in wells p33ua 6390 μs cm 38 mg l and 7 7 mg l respectively p33ub 9960 μs cm 41 mg l 7 3 mg l respectively and p18 7510 μs cm 35 mg l 6 5 mg l respectively total ion chromatograms tics of the tph extracts showed the presence of a ucm or hump with decreasing concentration along the transect fig 1 supplementary table 1 with two locations near the end of the transect p59ub p61ub having tph concentrations below the limits of reporting 0 05 mg l and above detections limits 0 015 mg l locations p33ua p33ub and p18 had the broadest ucms while other groundwater samples had a more narrow ucm profile and less observable peaks fig 1 between the highest contaminated samples p33ua p33ub and p18 and p19 the changes in the ucm shape corresponded to a 20 45 decrease of the tph portion supplementary table 1 a change in the concentration of tph relative to doc was detected between the most highly contaminated wells p33ua p33ub and p18 and the downgradient p19 well supplementary fig 2 between p19 and p61 the ratio of tph to doc remained stable supplementary fig 2 aromatic components alkylnaphthalenes and alkyldibenzothiophenes were observed at locations p18 p33ua and p33ub but not further downgradient ec decreased along the transect groundwater samples and showed a strong positive correlation with tph supplementary fig 3 and doc supplementary fig 4 other environmental parameters measured in the groundwater including dna concentrations of the extracts are shown in supplementary table 1 sulfate so4 2 was found in all wells and ranged from 28 mg l p61ub to 414 mg l p33u while phosphate po4 was below the detection limit in most wells 3 3 bacterial community bacterial diversity showed lower faith s pd measurements and number of otus at wells p32ub and p60ub compared to the other wells supplementary fig 5 bacterial otu numbers were not correlated with tph or ec when using the spearman method hyphomicrobiaceae porphyromonadaceae uncultured bacterium clone otub7 genbank hq395119 1 and candidate division zb2 phylum od1 were abundant in the groundwater with tph levels 6 5 mg l p33ua p33ub p18 fig 2 samples from wells p18 p33ua and p33ub showed a significant correlation with members belonging to alpha and deltaproteobacteria and known hydrocarbon degraders anaerolinea as well as candidate class zb2 candidate phylum od1 when fitted onto ordination fig 3 a beta diversity patterns represented in the nmds ordination showed significant correlation with the environmental factors tph and ec samples clustering furthest away from p18 p33ua and p33ub were not significantly affected by these environmental factors and showed correlation with beta and gammaproteobacteria clostridia and nitrospira fig 3a further along the transect where lower tph concentrations persisted p32u p61ub highly abundant bacterial families 2 included members of nocardioidaceae comamonadaceae and microbacteriaceae well p58ua did not cluster closely with other samples and correlated with bacteria belonging to clostridiaceae rhodobacteraceae rhodocyclaceae and comamonadaceae fig 3a 3 4 archaeal community archaeal communities had the lowest faith s pd and otu numbers in samples collected at well p33ub supplementary fig 6 total otu numbers were not correlated with ec or tph concentrations the marine benthic group mbga was present in all samples while other taxa including nitrososphaeraceae and cenarchaeaceae were found to be less abundant in samples with the highest tph and ec p18 p33ua p33ub fig 4 well p58ua showed a low abundance of sequences similar to an uncultured clone yla114 compared to the other wells but a high abundance of methanobacteriaceae which was also detected at p61ub fig 4 archaeal community structure showed a significant correlation with tph concentrations and do fig 3b a significant correlation of well p33ub with mbga and p33ua with pgrfc26 was detected and they clustered away from the rest of the samples fig 3b 3 5 eukaryotic community among the wells along the investigated aquifer section p33ub had the highest alpha diversity and the numbers of otus for eukaryotes supplementary fig 7 total otu numbers were not correlated with ec or tph concentrations sample p58ub was excluded from the 18s rrna gene data analysis due to low read numbers the most abundant taxa included the fungal taxon sordaromycetes at most wells whereas the fungi eurotiomycetes was predominantly identified in wells p33ua p33ub p18 p32u p19 and p59ua fig 5 with significant correlation with most of these wells fig 3c among the physical chemical water parameters tested tph ec no3 so4 2 do tph showed the most significant correlation with the eukaryotic community structure fig 3c 4 discussion groundwater wells that showed the highest contaminant concentrations p18 p33ua p33ub also showed an increased abundance of organisms potentially involved in biodegradation however the hydrocarbon contaminant present in those samples also appeared to be the least biodegraded based on 1 the doc tph ratio supplementary figs 2 and 2 the presence of resolvable peaks fig 1 on the ucm i e as biodegradation proceeds the resolvable peaks on the ucm are lost and 3 the fact that they still contained aromatic components alkylnaphthalenes and alkyldibenzothiophenes comparing the identified contaminant characteristics and the measured parameters of the transect samples to findings from the previous kuwait microcosm study that examined the biodegradability of the contaminants at well p18 under various treatments bruckberger et al 2019b a similar ratio of doc and tph predicted by their linear correlation was observed in the transect samples supplementary table 1 supplementary fig 2 the minor changes of doc in the transect samples in this study are most likely attributed to the loss of a small portion of the biodegradable tph further corroborating the findings of the previous microcosm study bruckberger et al 2019b the contaminant in the microcosms was shown to consist of 97 polar compounds this finding is consistent with a highly weathered and recalcitrant pollutant persisting in kuwait s groundwater bruckberger et al 2019b at other highly contaminated legacy sites low biodegradation rates have shown to result from the presence of toxic contaminant concentrations accumulation of toxic metabolites low bioavailability of the contaminant or other unfavourable environmental conditions as for example observed along an oil gradient in north east china liang et al 2009 but also at other sites ham et al 2004 prommer et al 2002 in addition a positive correlation and similar decreases of tph and ec supplementary fig 3 as well as doc and ec supplementary fig 4 along the investigated transect was observed therefore the decrease of contaminant concentrations along the transect studied here appears to be due to a combination of a limited biodegradation occurring between the most contaminated wells p33ua p33ub and p18 and p19 fig 1 supplementary fig 2 supplementary table 1 and more importantly due to dilution of tph doc and ec supplementary figs 3 and 4 downstream of well p19 the groundwater microbial communities as measured by the alpha diversity of bacterial archaeal and the eukaryotic communities as measured by faith s pd showed no obvious trend relating to tph or ec this contrasts with findings from previous research that found a loss of diversity due to hydrocarbon contaminated sediments along the gulf of mexico sutton et al 2013 in kuwait the contaminated groundwater has persisted for a long period of time 25 years which may have resulted in stable and diverse communities along the transect based on varying physical and chemical conditions correlation analysis revealed that tph ec and do were the most significant parameters influencing the bacterial and archaeal community structure anaerobic and methanogenic organisms were detected at several sites along the transect anoxic conditions at wells p33ua and p33ub could be dominating as suggested by low do and tdn concentrations supplementary table 1 and the presence of bacterial families involved in methane cycling candidate division envops12 which significantly correlated with the highly contaminated wells p33ua and p33ub has previously been detected in a methanogenic bioreactor siniscalchi et al 2017 members of families syntrophaceae fig 2 found in high abundance and syntrophobacteriaceae fig 3a correlated with the wells having the highest tph and ec p18 p33ua p33ub have been reported to be key players in the methanogenic degradation of crude oil while providing acetate or hydrogen to methanogens gray et al 2011 and have also been detected in methanogenic sediment serving in syntrophic relationships with methane producing species leloup et al 2007 plugge et al 2011 porphyromonadaceae another family known to have syntrophic relationships with methanogens esquivel elizondo et al 2016 was correlated with wells p18 p33ua and p33ub and is also able to digest oil refinery waste under methanogenic conditions hahnke et al 2015 wang et al 2016 members of family hyphomicrobiaceae were detected in the high tph samples in this study and in the previous microcosm study bruckberger et al 2019b this family has also been associated with recalcitrant polar compounds formed from weathered diesel bruckberger et al 2018 other possible degraders found at the wells p18 p33ua and p33ub included members of candidate division zb2 od1 which has been reported to be a main contributor to the biodegradation of recalcitrant compounds of crude oil in saline soil li et al 2012 yu et al 2011 comparisons of the bacterial community identified in the previous microcosm study investigating p18 bruckberger et al 2019b found some similarities and further insights on conditions likely present along the transect for example otub7 present in p33ua and p33ub was previously found enriched in anaerobic and sulfate reducing microcosms consisting of p18 groundwater further indicating anoxic conditions bruckberger et al 2019b interestingly otub7 was previously found in oil water emulsions from an oil field in malaysia indicating that the location of wells p33ua and p33ub may be closest to the original point of contaminant infiltration li et al 2012 yu et al 2011 also present although mainly at the highly contaminated wells were order mle1 48 class tk17 and tk17 unknown both of phylum chloroflexi which were enriched under anaerobic conditions in the microcosm study suggesting anoxic preferences of these taxa bruckberger et al 2019b wells further from the original contaminant source p19 p61ub on the other hand showed enrichment of nitrososphaeracea an aerobic ammonia oxidising soil archaeon stieglmeier et al 2014 actinomycetales a common soil bacteria taxa often found in uncontaminated environments lee and hwang 2002 poomthongdee et al 2015 was more abundant in wells with lower contaminated however their abundance decreased in the higher contaminated wells suggesting a sensitivity to the weathered contaminant cenarchaea similarly was present in low abundance in highly contaminated wells but in higher abundance in the lower contaminated wells this taxa has previously been found decreased in marine samples after being exposed to oil after only 72 h liu et al 2017 which appears to be similar in this contaminated groundwater system the uncultured archaeal clone yla114 was identified in multiple wells along the transect yla114 has previously been associated with a highly biodegraded contaminant in a methanogenic oil reservoir shelton et al 2016 members of the rhizobiaceae and chromatiaceae families were also found in most groundwater wells along the transect and in the previous research for well p18 bruckberger et al 2019b these families have been detected in coastal salt marshes at the gulf coast impacted by the deepwater horizon spill beazley et al 2012 lamendella et al 2014 and in a marine ecosystem impacted by seeping crude oil in southern california hawley et al 2014 interestingly wells p58ua and p61ub showed high abundances of methanobacteriaceae and methanosarcinaceae despite having do concentrations not considered anoxic 3 01 and 4 84 mg l respectively these wells also had high abundances of xanthomonadaceae p58ua and comamonadaceae which have previously been found to have a strong positive association with methanobacteriales and methanomicrobiales in anaerobic digesters hao et al 2016 they were also found enriched in anaerobic microcosms investigating hydrocarbon derived contaminants bruckberger et al 2018 no previous analysis of the eukaryotic community in the contaminated groundwater has been undertaken however this study revealed the presence of eurotiomycetes and sordariomycetes and a significant correlation of their presence with highly contaminated wells this suggests either their tolerance to the contaminants or an active involvement in the biodegradation processes eurotiomycetes have been identified in other studies from oil contaminated soil obtained from the gulf of mexico al nasrawi 2012 and are known to have the ability to transform pahs aranda 2016 previous work has also investigated the microbial diversity and possible links with the concentration of oil contamination finding only a 10 loss of fungi but up to 90 loss of the bacteria and archaeal diversity liang et al 2009 indicating greater fungal resilience as result of extinguishing the oil well fires with seawater and thus introducing an increased salinity in conjunction with the crude oil contaminant doc and tph into the originally fresh groundwater lens it remains difficult to clearly elucidate which of the two factors was more significant in reshaping the pre war microbial community composition ec values measured in the 15 wells ranged from 1760 to 9960 μs cm indicative of brackish water rather than fresh groundwater approximately 0 1500 μs cm suggesting the presence of diluted seawater at all tested wells which likely enhanced the presence of salt tolerant possibly marine microbial species such as mbga figs 4 and 3b 5 conclusion this study investigated the microbial communities and current associated crude oil contamination along a 1st gulf war impacted groundwater system in kuwait microorganisms commonly associated with hydrocarbon derived contaminants from the three microbial domains were present in the samples with the community structure significantly correlated with contaminant concentrations tph and or ec concentrations the community structure and taxonomic diversity suggest anoxic or methanogenic conditions are currently present at specific sections along the transect mainly highly contaminated wells p33ua p33ub and p18 enrichment of methanogens and methanotrophs at these wells indicate complex syntrophic relationships and tolerance to the contaminant the contaminant shows a highly weathered character 97 polars with a large ucm with few if any resolvable peaks present and likely low biodegradability a linear correlation in decreasing contaminant concentrations hydrocarbon derived doc and tph with ec and narrower smoother ucms were found in wells further away from the highly contaminated locations indicating dilution rather than significant biodegradation occurs toward the terminal point of the transect findings here indicate the presence of organisms that are capable of facilitating contaminant biodegradation however there is strong indication that the biodegradation extent of the recalcitrant contaminant has remained minimal therefore it is expected that the contaminants will further persist in the aquifer under the current conditions i e in the absence of any active intervention declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no
