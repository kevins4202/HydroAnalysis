16800,despite the clear ecological significance of the microbiomes inhabiting groundwater and connected ecosystems our current understanding of their habitats functionality and the ecological processes controlling their assembly have been limited in this study an efficient pipeline combining geochemistry high throughput fluidigmtm functional gene amplification and sequencing was developed to analyze the suspended and attached microbial communities inhabiting five groundwater monitoring wells in the illinois basin usa the dominant taxa in the suspended and the attached microbial communities exhibited significantly different spatial and temporal changes in both alpha and beta diversity further analyses of representative functional genes affiliated with n2 fixation nifh methane oxidation pmoa and sulfate reduction dsrb and apra suggested functional redundancy within the shallow aquifer microbiomes while more diversified functional gene taxa were observed for the suspended microbial communities than the attached ones except for pmoa different levels of changes over time and space were observed between these functional genes notably deterministic and stochastic ecological processes shaped the assembly of microbial communities and functional gene reservoirs differently while homogenous selection was the prevailing process controlling assembly of microbial communities the neutral processes e g dispersal limitation drift and others were more important for the functional genes the results suggest complex and changing shallow aquifer microbiomes whose functionality and assembly vary even between the spatially proximate habitats and fractions this research underscored the importance to include all the interface components for a more holistic understanding of the biogeochemical processes in aquifer ecosystems which is also instructive for practical applications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords shallow aquifer

nutrients akob and küsel 2011 griebler and lueders 2009 hug et al 2015 within the saturated capillary fringe and vadose zones in subsurface microorganisms can reside in two distinct phases i e planktonic and biofilm and significant differences in community composition structure and activity between free living and attached communities are commonly accepted smith et al 2018 while most studies on shallow aquifer microbiomes have focused on easily accessible free living or suspended organisms a large proportion of microbial biomass dwelling on mineral surfaces or in rocks have been relatively under investigated alfreider et al 1997 flemming and wuertz 2019 hug et al 2015 lazar et al 2019 the community composition overlapped between the two habitats is typically less than 30 barnhart et al 2013 flynn et al 2008 flynn et al 2013 a study using microscopic cell counts demonstrated that the organisms attached to groundwater sediments were orders of magnitude higher than those suspended in the groundwater hazen et al 1991 this finding has been corroborated by many studies on pristine aquifers e g sandy glaciers sandstone limestone and marlstone formations suggesting that the ecological and geochemical significance of attached microbial communities need to be considered for these ecosystems flynn et al 2008 flynn et al 2013 flynn et al 2012 hug et al 2015 king et al 2017 lee and lee 2018 evaluation of functionalities based on a variety of genetic genomic and multi omic analyses demonstrated complex microbe environment interactions in aquifer some studies suggest that differences in microbial communities do not necessarily correlate with the ecosystem processes due to functional redundancy fields et al 2006 zelaya et al 2019 in other studies however abundance and or expression of the specific functional genes associated with elemental cycling showed active response to the chemical gradients or external perturbation these are typically more pronounced in the contaminated sites oil and gas reservoirs where both organic or inorganic substrates e g hydrocarbon methane metals metalloids nitrate sulfate and ammonium were significantly higher than the pristine background fields et al 2006 he et al 2018 schwab et al 2017 wegner et al 2019 xu et al 2010 another study also implied a strong relationship between the abundance of different c cycling functional genes and their specific enzymatic activities in different soil samples implying that activity of enzymes may be predicted by the abundance of associated functional genes trivedi et al 2016

homogenizing dispersal drift and others danczak et al 2018 ning et al 2019 ning et al 2020 several studies on this topic in relation to aquifer microbiomes have been done in systems with spatial or temporal changes or with different levels of perturbation danczak et al 2018 fillinger et al 2019 yan et al 2020 zelaya et al 2019 in most studies deterministic processes imposed strong selection for community assembly while their relative contribution was case dependent and associated with ambient geochemistry hydrodynamic conductivity connectivity or distance between the habitats gulmann et al 2015 yan et al 2020 zelaya et al 2019 comparatively stronger selection was suggested for assembly of the attached microbial communities graham et al 2017 however our current understanding of the sediment associated subsurface microbial community assembly is limited in this work we applied an in situ incubation technique with representative aquifer material derived from five shallow groundwater monitoring wells selected at a large scale carbon capture and storage ccs demonstration project finley 2014 the specific objectives were to enhance the understanding of 1 microbial population distribution between suspended and attached phases of the shallow aquifer ecosystems 2 the environmental factors that drive temporal and spatial changes of subsurface microbiome composition 3 the microbial genetic response to dynamic subsurface geochemical conditions and 4 the contributions of deterministic vs stochastic processes to the assembly of the microbial communities and functional gene reservoirs heterogeneous spatial distribution and temporal changes in the microbial community structure and functional genes as well as their assemblies were systematically investigated and evaluated in the five wells 2 methods and material 2 1 sampling sites samples for this study were collected from a large scale ccs demonstration project illinois basin decatur project ibdp at decatur illinois usa finley 2014 in this project one million tons of co2 were injected into a deep sandstone formation during 2011 2015 within the shallow groundwater monitoring net see section s1 1 in the supplementary information si five monitoring wells were selected table 1 and fig s1 wells g101 g102 g103 and g104 are screened in the upper pennsylvanian bedrock with the intervals in the range of 41 4 43 4 m below land surface wells g101 and g102 were installed 15 m northeast and northwest respectively of the co2 injection well ccs1 well g103 was installed 61 m northwest of ccs1 and g104 was approximately 610 m northwest of ccs1 fig s1 well 04ug is screened in the upper glasford formation an unconsolidated quaternary glacial deposit this well has a screened interval from 18 6 to 20 1 m below land surface and is about 18 m southwest of g104 fig s1 and table 1 the upper pennsylvanian bedrock is domintated by quartz and clay with small amounts of dolomite 0 9 and pyrite comparatively sediment in silty glasford formation consists of significantly higher amount of quartz 55 5 58 5 and dolomite 16 9 22 8 than the upper pennsylvanian bedrock table 1 although the depth of g104 was similar to the other three g wells its hydraulic conductivity was about one order of magnitude higher than the other wells based on darcy s law using observed water levels and calculated hydraulic conductivity values the groundwater flow rates in four bedrock wells were estimated to be 1 0 1 5 meters year coady and mehnert 2011 locke and iranmanesh 2015 2 2 sample collection and sample pretreatment for this study both suspended and attached organisms were sampled to better represent the native groundwater microbiomes table s1 a series of traps were prepared by filling nylon bags with autoclaved aquifer material previously collected from same boreholes and at the same screened interval under study the aquifer material was manually crashed and the particles with size ranging from 0 2 1 6 mm were collected and rinsed with nanopure water the air dried aquifer material was then autoclaved aliquoted and packed with nylon bags that had been sequentially washed with 70 ethanol and sterile nanopure water the traps were lowered into each selected well at the level of the well screen for microbial attachment flynn et al 2008 these in situ sediment microcosms were deployed on october 17 2017 and remained there for 3 6 months so that active microbial populations could colonize the sand in the traps water and trap samples were collected initially during sediment trap deployment and subsequently at each sampling time i e 3 and 6 months before filtering planktonic cells from groundwater or retrieving in situ traps for attached microbe sampling groundwater was pumped out of the well using an electric submersible pump during pumping the physical and geochemical parameters e g ph temperature electrical potential and conductivity were monitored overtime until all the readings were stabilized groundwater samples for geochemical analyses were filtered in the field using 0 45 μm flow through cartridge filters geotech environmental equipment inc co usa for analysis of dissolved inorganic carbon dic 3 ml of groundwater was collected using a degassed syringe then injected into a stoppered 70 ml serum bottle previously purged using o2 free ultrapure n2 gas and 1 ml 50 w w phosphoric acid the samples for dissolved organic carbon were stored in amber glass bottles and preserved using h2so4 with the final concentration 0 5 v v the samples were stored on ice in a cooler before transported back to the laboratory and kept refrigerated before use the planktonic cells in groundwater were filtered from three liters of groundwater using a 90 mm nylon membrane with pore size 0 2 μm duplicate planktonic cell samples were collected for each site and at each sampling campaign meanwhile duplicate in situ traps were retrieved from each well at the three and six month sampling campaigns all the microbial samples i e filter membranes and sediment traps were individually packed in separate whirl pak sampling bags nasco wi usa and promptly transferred into a cooler filled with dry ice on the same day all the microbiological samples were transported back to the laboratory at the illinois state geological survey urbana il upon arrival they were transferred to a 20 c freezer and stored for future analyses 2 3 geochemical analyses geochemical parameters such as ph specific conductance dissolved oxygen oxidation reduction potential eh of the produced water were measured in situ dong et al 2014b a total of 24 cations were quantified using us epa method 200 7 epa 1994 the concentration of ferrous iron fe ii and sulfide were measured as described previously shao and butler 2007 the anions i e cl br f so4 2 no3 po4 3 were measured using a dionxtm ics 1500 ion chromatography thermo fisher scientific mi usa pfaff 1993 alkalinity total dissolved solids ammonium n dissolved inorganic carbon dic and nonvolatile organic carbon were analyzed using the methods sm 2320b sm 2540c us epa 350 1 and sm 5310b respectively locke and iranmanesh 2015 locke et al 2018 2 4 molecular analyses genomic dna was extracted from the filter membranes or a 0 5 g aliquot of sand from the sediment traps using a modified phenol chloroform extraction method dong et al 2014a unless mentioned a negative control sterile water was put through the same extraction process to ensure no contamination was introduced during dna preparation the quality and integrity of the extracted dna were assessed as described dong et al 2014b amplicon sequencing was performed to understand the spatial and temporal distribution of microbial communities and their metabolic potential based on the preliminary screening see section s1 2 in si a total of 12 pairs of primers targeting the functional genes associated with microbial c n and s metabolism and the 16s rrna genes for both bacteria and archaea were selected for multiplex pcr amplification table s2 the amplicons for the targeted ribosomal rna and the functional genes were amplified and barcoded using a fluidigm access array and biomark hd system fluidigm corporation ca usa following the manufacturer s recommendations see section s1 3 in si multiplex pcr amplification and sequencing were conducted in the roy j carver biotechnology center at the university of illinois urbana champaign bioinformatic and statistical analyses were performed as described in s1 4 of the si 2 5 nucleotide sequence accession numbers the sequences reported in this study have been deposited in ncbi genbank with the bioproject number prjna706996 3 results 3 1 dynamic geochemical conditions in the sampling wells although the wells under investigation were not far away from each other fig s1 distinguishing geochemical properties were observed between them most of groundwater constituents exhibited significant differences between the wells anova p 0 05 except for sulfide fe ii no3 n and non volatile organic carbon nvoc anova p 0 10 0 83 fig 1 and table s3 all the groundwater samples exhibited circumneutral ph fig 1a well 04ug screened in the shallower upper glasford formation showed significantly higher and dynamic dissolved oxygen do and redox potential eh than the four bedrock wells g101 g104 fig 1b c in addition the concentrations of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 in the g101 g104 samples were significantly lower than that in well 04ug while s ii was lower in well 04ug than the others fig 1g and h table s3 in terms of nitrogen compounds relatively low concentrations of nh4 was consistently detected in all the wells while no3 was below detection limit in most samples except for 04ug and g102 at sporadic time points fig 1j and i spatial heterogeneity in chemical composition was also observed between g101 g104 the proximate wells screening the same geological formation fig 1 in each of the four wells the geochemical conditions were relatively stable during the 6 months of monitoring period except for dissolved sulfide and fe ii concentrations fig 1h i 3 2 distinct microbial structure and taxonomic composition associated with sample types alpha diversity profiles based on inverse simpson index invsimpson showed that at the same time point the overall otu diversity and evenness were significantly higher for the suspended microbial communities than their attached counterparts t test p 0 025 in addition among all the wells the shallower 04ug exhibited the most variable diversity for the suspended microbial communities over six months in comparison significantly lower diversity and more stable microbial communities with the invsimpson values consistently less than 40 were observed for the attached fraction in contrast to the highly variable suspended ones fig 2 the suspended and attached microbial communities exhibited distinct microbial population composition although proteobacteria were the most dominant phylum in both communities they were significantly enriched in the sediment matrix fig s2 the orders bacteroidales omnitrophales sphingobacteriales and victivallales along with several proteobacterial orders e g methyloccoccales burkholderiales desulfobacterales methylophiales gallionellales accounted for the majority of the suspended microbial communities the dominant orders in the attached samples however were exclusively affiliated with proteobacteria e g desulfobacterales desulfobulbales geobacterales methyloccoccales and desulfuromonadales fig 3 due to the limitation of the pore size our work were focused on the microorganisms with typical size several hundred nanometers to several micrometers but the organisms in lower nanometer size e g cpr bacteria and dpann archaea detected in earlier studies on other aquifers he et al 2021 luef et al 2015 were potentially overlooked comparison of the 20 most dominant otus in the suspended and attached microbial communities showed distinct patterns depending on sample fraction fig 4 only three otus i e an unclassified desulfobulbaceae a methylobacter and an unclassified methylococcaceae were among the major phylotypes 1 in both sample fractions while the others were significant in only one sample fraction for example sulfurospirillum desulfocapsa geothrix and multiple geobacter spp were the major otus in the attached microbial communities while methylococcaceae methylophilus sideroxydans and methylovolum were among the most significant free living phylotypes fig 4 in addition cumulatively relative abundance for the core otus that were detected in at least half of the samples was significantly higher in the attached microbial communities compared to that in the suspended ones fig s3 and section s2 1 in the si this suggested that the shared core phylotypes made up the majority of the populations in the attached microbial communities while the transient ones accounted for the majority in the suspended communities 3 3 spatial and temporal microbial distribution the microbial communities inhabiting the wells showed different extents of dissimilarity depending on the sample source the shallower 04ug communities were most dissimilar from those found in wells g101 g104 which was supported by a bray curtis analysis model figs 5 a and s4 the samples from 04ug were 85 88 89 53 suspended and 73 6 77 06 attached in dissimilarity from those derived from g101 g104 fig s4 in comparison lower dissimilarities of 63 88 75 92 suspended and 55 74 63 67 attached were observed among the samples taken from wells g101 g104 completed in the same formation fig s4 it should be noted that although well g104 was somewhat distant from the wells g101 g103 the community dissimilarity between these samples was comparable the changes in microbial community composition after three and six months were observed within each well the greatest change was observed in the shallower 04ug well consistent with the highly variable alpha diversity in this well fig 2 using simper analysis the contribution of the specific populations to the quarterly changes in the microbial community composition in each well was assessed and the major taxa that contributed to 1 of the observed change were identified these major taxa contributed 34 6 57 5 to the changes at different time points seen with the suspended microbial communities compared with 43 1 67 7 in the attached ones tables s5 and s6 specifically the prevailing otus in the attached microbial communities e g geobacter and unclassified deltaproteobacteria are among the major taxa contributing the greatest to the changes in the biofilm table s6 3 4 environmental drivers for subsurface microbial structure along space and time canonical correspondence analysis cca showed that generally the microbial communities were clustered based on the sampling type and well fig 5 the suspended and the attached microbial communities from the shallower and more oxidized 04ug well samples were significantly different from those for the other wells permanova p 0 05 for the suspended microbial community composition factors such as so4 2 do eh and nitrate were important for well 04ug while na cl and s ii were most important for wells g101 g103 fig 5b comparatively similar driving factors were observed for the attached microbial communities except that the deeper g101 g103 were also influenced by fe ii and alkalinity fig 5c 3 5 functional genes among the 12 functional genes tested dsrb pmoa apra and nifh associated with cycling of c n s in the aquifer ecosystems were selected for further analyses see section s2 2 in si analyses of these functional gene sequences showed that the majority were assigned to a relatively small number of otus for example the top 5 otus of dsrb and nifh genes comprised 69 5 and 69 7 of the sequencing reads for the suspended and attached fractions respectively the least diversity was observed with pmoa with 5 and 6 otus comprising 95 of the sequencing reads in the suspended and attached samples respectively the closest phylogenetic references identified for these dominant genotypes illustrated the diversity of potential functional populations found in different wells or at different time points figs 6 s5 s7 functional gene composition changed differentially between wells and with time for the functional genes identified for the suspended microbial communities the pair wise dissimilarity for samples derived from the same well ranged from 36 6 to 93 7 with a relatively stronger effect along time changes observed for apra and dsrb in contrast the changes for the attached microbial communities between three and six months were generally lower than the suspended counterparts fig 7 a different pattern was observed for pmoa a stable composition with less than 40 dissimilarity was observed for all the suspended microbial communities lower than any other functional gene however pmoa gene composition was more variable in the attached communities for most of the wells with the highest dissimilarity index 82 6 in well 04ug fig 7 further assessment of pmoa genes indicated that more than 90 of the changes were derived from the large change in abundance of the most dominant otus instead of the overall gene variant composition pcoa analyses based on the bray curtis dissimilarity model between the samples showed distinct shifts in the functional genes based mainly by when and where they were taken or the fraction under study fig 8 overall the distribution of the functional genes exhibited significant difference between the sampling wells permanova f 3 2 11 0 p 0 0002 specifically the 04ug samples exhibited less similarity with the other wells for all the 4 functional genes in both suspended and attached phases suggesting its relative independence permanova p 0 05 fig 8 interestingly the dissimilarity in the functional genes between the suspended and attached microbial communities showed different patterns for apra dsrb and nifh the functional gene composition for wells g101 g104 were generally separated by the sample type fig 8a c unlikely the low diversity pmoa gene was sample dependent as the suspended and attached phases from the same well were more closely associated than the sample based difference fig 8d 3 6 ecological drivers of microbial community and potential functional population assembly to understand the assembly processes that determine the formation of local communities the distribution of microbial populations and potential community functionalities i e designated by distribution of functional genes icamp a phylogenetic bin based null model was applied ning et al 2020 this method overcomes the constraints imposed by classical statistical approaches based on the pairwise turnovers of the whole community composition instead the icamp model differentiates the microbial groups functional genes on finer biological organization levels ning et al 2020 based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis the deterministic process homogenous selection was the most significant and was responsible for 69 and 83 of the suspended and the attached community composition respectively notably higher contributions from the stochastic process of dispersal limitation was suggested for the suspended microbial communities than the attached ones 22 vs 4 fig 9 a for the functional genes homogenous selection was much less than that observed for the overall community assembly based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis the execption to this was nifh in the attached samples fig 9 for dsrb pmoa and apra relative contribution of homogeneous selection was typically less than 30 instead the stochastic processes e g drift and others played significant roles for assembly of the functional gene pools while significantly higher contribution was observed for the suspended samples compared with the attached ones for dsrb and nifh similar contribution was identified between the two fractions for pmoa and apra fig 9b e the importance of dispersal limitation varied depending on the functional genes with the highest contribution of this process observed for dsrb in the attached samples fig 9b comparable contribution by dispersal limitation was observed for nifh in the suspended samples and apra gene communities in both fractions 41 46 fig 9c and e in contrast this process did not appear to be an important driver for assembly of nifh genes in the attached samples and pmoa gene pools in both fractions fig 9c stochasicity was calculated to assess the impacts by the stochastic processes e g birth death speciation extinction and immigration ning et al 2020 the stochasicity was much lower for the 16s rrna genes than the functional genes in terms of individual sampling well homogenous selection contributed most for assembly of the microbial communities with the exception for 04ug in that dispersal limitation played comparable role fig s8a comparatively drift and other processes were consistently important for assembly of the functional gene reserviors while the significance of dispersal limitation or homogenous selection varied depending on the types of the gene fig s8b e 4 discussion an understanding of the stability functionality resilience and assembly of subsurface microbiomes is critical for both fundamental ecological questions and engineering applications fields et al 2006 the integration of geochemistry multiplex pcr high throughput sequencing of amplified genes and statistical analyses used in the present study provide a comprehensive investigation of a few heterogeneous and dynamic shallow aquifer ecosystems our work presents fine resolution for the shallow aquifer microbiomes in that suspended and attached microbial communities distinctively respond to the varying degrees of geochemical fluctuation over space and time even when they are in close proximity the most similar work was the study on the shallow and pristine confined aquifer of us doe enigma oak ridge field research center which provides valuable information about the high spatiotemporal variability at the scale at tens of meters zelaya et al 2019 with the focus solely on the suspended microbial communities however this earlier work did not show the distinct pattens for the attached microbial communities in a series of recent studies on the hainich critical zone exploratory cze in central germany differential microbial structure and functional populations between groundwater fracture surface and rock matrices were identified which provide insights of the fraction dependent microbial communities dwelling aquifer lazar et al 2019 schwab et al 2017 wegner et al 2019 yan et al 2020 the linkage between microbial structure functional groups and the metabolic potential suggested in our study underscores the significance to consider both suspended and attached microbial communities this will allow more accurate understanding of the subsurface ecosystems and provide means to predict the biogeochemical processes 4 1 distinct planktonic and attached microbial distribution the significantly different suspended and attached microbial communities in terms of diversity composition and features e g core and prevailing taxa figs 2 5a s2 s4 may be shaped by the unique micro environments in the two fractions typically pristine subsurface habitats are oligotrophic with limited carbon nitrogen and energy sources in groundwater akob and küsel 2011 hazen et al 1991 schwab et al 2017 wegner et al 2019 however flow conditions nutrient availabilities and motility dispersal can create distinct micro environments for the free living and the biofilm associated organisms in comparison the capacities to retain water sorb nutrients and protect cells against rapidly changing geochemistry by biofilm establish superior habitat for colonization of actively growing organisms and mutualism compared with those characterized in groundwater for long time scale stoodley et al 2002 our observations of partial overlapped but distinctly distributed free living and surface associated species are in line with other work on subsurface ecosystems flynn et al 2008 flynn et al 2013 zhou et al 2012 in situ bioreactors christensen et al 2018 king et al 2017 and microcosms barnhart et al 2013 similar with the reports by flynn et al 2008 and 2012 no more than 7 8 to 14 1 of the otus are shared between the fractions but account for 25 67 of the sequence abundance in our work in addition the major members for the attached communities are strikingly low in the groundwater and vice versa such preferential enrichment of specific species in different fractions of the subsurface agrees with a metagenomic study at the u s doe uranium contaminated shallow groundwater remediation test site in rifle co in which the dominant suspended phylotypes are only the rare species in the attached fraction fig 4 hug et al 2015 interestingly in the earlier studies conducted on the adjacent mahomet aquifer a confined pristine aquifer located about 20 miles northeast of our site the suspended and attached microbial communities exhibited comparable microbial diversity flynn et al 2008 flynn et al 2013 flynn et al 2012 this inconsistency with our observation of lower diversity in attached microbial communities than that in the suspended counterparts fig 2 and 3 is unlikely due to insufficient colonization see section s3 1 in si instead the geological formation in these earlier studies e g banner formation differs from the glasford and upper pennsylvanian formations in this work where the geochemistry and microbial structure are not expected to be identical in addition as demonstrated in many earlier studies a significant fraction of the aquifer microbiomes is attached to the sedimentary porous media rather than in the free living phase alfreider et al 1997 flemming and wuertz 2019 griebler and lueders 2009 hug et al 2015 if such scenario occurs in our systems too the main phylotypes of the less diversified attached communities are generally more preferentially enriched in the whole system assessment of the preferentially enriched taxa in the suspended versus attached microbial communities suggests that the two fractions may exert varying biogeochemical roles for example the phylotypes of known methanotrophs e g methylophilus meliorbacter methylomonas and methylovulum that oxidize c1 compounds e g methane and or methanol iguchi et al 2011 locke et al 2018 oshkin et al 2016 wartiainen et al 2006 are among the prevailing and core ecotypes in the free living microbial communities the sideroxydans affiliated otu is phylogenetically related with the species capable of oxidizing iron with natural humic acids or using co2 as the carbon source hädrich et al 2019 wessel et al 2014 in comparison the major attached taxa show close phylogenetic relation with some known sulfur metabolizers growing on sulfate thiosulfate and or sulfite e g desulfobacterales desulfobulbaceae desulfocapsa and desulfobacula spp muyzer and stams 2008 additionally the potential metal reducers e g geobacter geothrix and rhodoferax spp finneran et al 2003 lovley and walker 2019 mehta kolte and bond 2012 are among the major phylotypes in the attached fraction the potential fraction based biogeochemical processes suggested by uneven microbial distribution also imply geochemical gradient between groundwater and biofilm 4 2 spatial and temporal changes of the subsurface microbiomes our observations of spatial and time dependent varition in microbial communities inhabiting proximate subsurface niches are reflective of the intimate interactions between groundwater and the mineral components in the sediments these interactions create physical and chemical variation ranging from micrometer to kilometer scales and thus mediate the biogeochemical processes e g weathering nitrogen cylcing and carbon cycling driven by groundwater microbiomes akob and küsel 2011 griebler and lueders 2009 unlike the contaminated sites with elevated concentrations of metals metalloids halogenated solvents or hydrocarbons fields et al 2006 he et al 2018 xu et al 2010 the environmental variation in pristine subsurface ecosystems primarily comprise of natural geochemical biogeochemical changes studies have demostrated that the hydrochemical factors e g groundwater residence time geochemistry nutrient supply dispersal of microbes and pulse of seasonal recharge can create spatially heterogenous and temporally changing environmental conditions in pristine subsurface ecosystems these can directly and indirectly influence the structure metabolic potential and activity of the organisms residing these habitats griebler and lueders 2009 gulmann et al 2015 hug et al 2015 lin et al 2011 nemergut et al 2013 smith et al 2018 wegner et al 2019 zelaya et al 2019 zhou et al 2012 the heterogeneous and dynamically changing suspended microbiomes observed in this study are reflective of the complex subsurface environmental conditions deriven from the introduction of nutrients changes of water geochemistry or migration of microbial populations from the surface flux recharge or between geological strata smith et al 2018 for example pronounced water level changes induced by hydrological dynamics in groundwater can lead to seasonal patterns of the sediment microbial communities in the proximate oligotrophic porous aquifer lin et al 2011 zhou et al 2012 in this study wells g101 g104 monitor groundwater within a relatively confined geological stratum which has not seen much influence from recent meteoric water recharge and has limited water transmissivity with the overlaying horizons in comparison the shallower 04ug well with oxygenated water is probably subject to active recharge from the surface or the overlying tiskilwa formation locke et al 2018 watson et al 2020 in addition although wells g101 g104 monitor the same geological formation and are similar in the depth the distinct geochemical properties for g104 table s3 suggest that it is likely more influenced by hydraulic connections to shallower formation s wimmer et al 2021 for g101 g103 that are only tens of meters distant with each other the differing hydraulic conductivity may explain heterogenous groundwater retenion time and water rock interactions associated with the variable geochemical conditions dong et al 2014b wegner et al 2019 zelaya et al 2019 4 3 functionalities for the subsurface microbiomes as suggested by the functional genes relationship between the functionalities and microbial community structure has been an important ecological question for subsurface ecosystems the functionalities of the microbiota shaped by inter related microbial pools nutrient input energy resource and the ambient environmental conditions are implied in this work the consistent presence of nifh genes suggests that n2 fixation is an important nitrogen source our observations that no3 concentrations are below detection limit in most samples and low concentrations of nh4 were consistently detected in all the samples fig 1 differ from other aquifer ecosystems with active no3 or nh4 introduction e g agricultural and contaminated sites where nitrification denitrification dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra or ammonia oxidation were often identified küsel et al 2016 stoliker et al 2016 wells et al 2018 for example the aquifers with different hydrochemical settings and land use along the hainich groundwater transect in germany have groundwater microbiomes that are mainly driven by nitrification denitrification and anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox while n2 fixation is marginal wegner et al 2019 field and laboratory incubation studies also suggest that under anoxic conditions and with limiting labile organic compounds anammox and denitrification potentially exist while nitrification may be enhanced when oxic eutrophic surface water is introduced under carbon rich conditions dnra would become predominant once o2 was depleted schwab et al 2017 stoliker et al 2016 wegner et al 2019 in our study there was no evidence for active no3 or nh4 introduction from the overlaying formations thus n2 fixation may outcompete other n metabolizing processes in the deeper and n limiting environments to form more bioavailable n substrates the consistent and abundant functional genes of sulfate reduction e g dsrb and apra and methane oxidation pmoa suggest these two processes may be among the energy sources at the ibdp site in the decatur area it has been documented that drift gas containing 22 5 99 5 methane formed in the glacially deeply buried soils from decay of peats and organic rich silts since these glacial deposits reside within a confined saturated formation they are anaerobic and thus favorable for methanogenesis significant methane levels were measured from vacuum wells at locations near the ibdp site meents 1960 in mahomet aquifer located about 20 miles northeast of our studied site variable concentrations of methane were reported in the shallow groundwater wells flynn et al 2008 flynn et al 2013 flynn et al 2012 yamamoto et al 2019 coal solids are also found in the pennsylvanian formation and may provide subsurface microbial communities with organic carbon to generate ch4 adams et al 1984 strapoc et al 2008 these suggest that methane production is common in the glacial deposit of decatur area the lack of mcra pcr products in the preliminary experiment to assess feasibility of the primer sets see section s1 2 in the si detection of pmoa genes and prevalence of methane oxidizers in the suspended microbial communities suggest that aerobic methane oxidization may be critical to explain the fate of methane even in the anoxic wells different strategies are implied by the suspended versus attached microbiota to maintain the overall functional stability earlier studies suggested that the microbiome functionalities in groundwater are stable and may be uncoupled from microbial community structure due to functional redundancy fields et al 2006 zelaya et al 2019 with the attached communities in our study however the structure and richness for the functional genes follow generally similar stability fig 6 7 s5 s7 therefore we propose that there are possible resiliency in functionality by the suspended communities while the conserved functionalities for the attached biofilm communities are more associated with the relatively stable microbial structure this can be explained from several perspectives firstly the source of microbial populations may vary between the free living and attached communities as the free living communities represent the microbial membership from a much larger physical environment than the sediment the possibility to introduce the new taxa with more diversified genetic traits with the flowing groundwater than the selectively colonized biofilm species is expected flynn et al 2008 flynn et al 2013 hug et al 2015 secondly the resistance to the external perturbation between the two fractions differs disturbance by external chemical stressors may be milder for the attached microbial cohorts than those within the groundwater thirdly the attached microbial communities may form biofilm that provides stability for cells mediates surface adhesion and serves as a scaffold for cells enzymes and antibiotics to attach algburi et al 2017 flemming and wingender 2010 the suspended microbiota in contrast are void of such protection and may be more vulnerable to external disturbances ben maamar et al 2015 flynn et al 2008 zelaya et al 2019 4 4 influential ecological processes for community and functioning assembly it is well accepted that both stochastic and deterministic processes operate simultaneously in the assembly of local communities in terms of diversity distribution and succession ning et al 2019 stegen et al 2013 stegen et al 2015 the prevailing contribution by homogenous selection on the community assembly and the variable stochasticity for microbial consortia derived from different wells fig s8 are in line with the previous aquifer studies covering wide geographical area e g hainich critical zone exploratory in germany and the licking aquifer and enigma oak ridge field research center tn in u s danczak et al 2018 fillinger et al 2019 herrmann et al 2019 yan et al 2020 zelaya et al 2019 in these earlier studies increasing selection stress and stronger competition cost for colonization were generally associated with the aquifers with lower flow velocity in contrast in the areas with higher flow velocity hydraulic conductivity nutrient input or uniform hydrochemistry stochastic processes dominate and typically result in more diversified microbial communities with higher turnover rates danczak et al 2018 hädrich et al 2019 yan et al 2020 therefore it was hypothesized that more interconnected communities experiencing lower turnover are susceptible to homogenizing selection in contrast the less inter connected microbial communities experiencing higher turnover are more likely affected by stochastic processes danczak et al 2018 in addition our observation of more significant contribution by dispersal limitation to the suspended microbial communities than the attached ones fig 9a suggests proliferation of specific taxonomic groups in the attached fraction induced by fine scale hydrodynamic niche differentiation and geochemistry besemer et al 2012 besemer et al 2009 as active microbial competition in porous medium can select against biofilm formation and result in dispersal limitation coyte et al 2016 this stochastic biological process may not be significant for attached microbial consortia our work also provides finer resolution about the patterns for assembly of potential functional populations based on the functional gene analyses which is not evident in the overall community composition the strong stochasticity for functional genes figs 9 and s8 is supported by the competitive lottery model that ecological niches are colonized randomly from a pool of species with similar ecological function in this hypothesis integrating both neutral and functional aspects available space within the niche is expected to be colonized by whichever suitable species happens to arrive and inhabit first burke et al 2011 munday 2004 based on the model the functional populations can be reflective of the taxonomic groups alternatively a given function may be broadly distributed across a variety of phylotypes instead of a specific taxonomic group burke et al 2011 munday 2004 in a previously published work on the microbial communities associated with a group of marine green macroalgae ulva australis the specific functional genes were assigned to a broad range of bacteria which differed from sample to sample it suggests that the core functions are not restricted to the particular taxonomic groups burke et al 2011 such scenario occurs for some of our otus for the functional genes under study other otus however are shared between samples or sample types figs 6 s5 s7 it suggests that the taxa with specific trophic or ecological properties are able to occupy the niches within an ecosystem whoever gets there first wins the lottery for that specific space munday 2004 however their changes overtime may reshape the potential functional populations within the niches driven by random components e g dispersal limitation drift or other processes as determined fig 9 and s8 5 conclusions and environmental significance heterogeneous microbial distribution and changes along different time points in response to the environmental disturbance at the high turnover rates are observed within systems tens of meters apart and at the frequency of months while distinct microbial structure and diversity between groundwater versus sediment fractions have been widely observed in the subsurface ecosystems flynn et al 2008 flynn et al 2013 smith et al 2018 this work further suggests that the difference in possible repercussion for stability and resilience in terms of biochemical potential may vary between specific functional populations and metabolic processes more importantly identification of different controlling ecological processes for assembly of the microbial communities and functional genes implies considerable biological patterns that cannot be directly inferred from the species diversity or the free living microbial consortia burke et al 2011 schwab et al 2017 therefore the weight of the free living and attached microbial communities to the overall biogeochemical processes needs careful consideration and assessment when studying the aquifer microbiomes as quantitative analyses have not been included in the present study the follow up work will be focused on applying qpcr and other meta omic approaches to quantitatively analyze the fraction dependent biomass distribution active populations and expressed functional genes to explore the active microbe environment interactions in terms of the changes along space and time in addition to the fundamental significance this work also presents potential instruction for practical applications such as biomonitoring bioremediation and bioaugmentation systematic understanding of the fraction dependent microbial distribution the physiological potential and their assemblies will facilitate the determination of critical factors that relate the community structure to the functions beyond what is just available from the simple analyses king et al 2017 for example the suspended microorganisms are more sensitive to geochemical changes and thus can be applied as the indicators for natural or anthropogenic environmental perturbation e g contaminant leakage meanwhile remediation of regulated metals metalloids may be relied on the development of attached metal metabolizing populations in

16800,despite the clear ecological significance of the microbiomes inhabiting groundwater and connected ecosystems our current understanding of their habitats functionality and the ecological processes controlling their assembly have been limited in this study an efficient pipeline combining geochemistry high throughput fluidigmtm functional gene amplification and sequencing was developed to analyze the suspended and attached microbial communities inhabiting five groundwater monitoring wells in the illinois basin usa the dominant taxa in the suspended and the attached microbial communities exhibited significantly different spatial and temporal changes in both alpha and beta diversity further analyses of representative functional genes affiliated with n2 fixation nifh methane oxidation pmoa and sulfate reduction dsrb and apra suggested functional redundancy within the shallow aquifer microbiomes while more diversified functional gene taxa were observed for the suspended microbial communities than the attached ones except for pmoa different levels of changes over time and space were observed between these functional genes notably deterministic and stochastic ecological processes shaped the assembly of microbial communities and functional gene reservoirs differently while homogenous selection was the prevailing process controlling assembly of microbial communities the neutral processes e g dispersal limitation drift and others were more important for the functional genes the results suggest complex and changing shallow aquifer microbiomes whose functionality and assembly vary even between the spatially proximate habitats and fractions this research underscored the importance to include all the interface components for a more holistic

2017 lee and lee 2018 evaluation of functionalities based on a variety of genetic genomic and multi omic analyses demonstrated complex microbe environment interactions in aquifer some studies suggest that differences in microbial communities do not necessarily correlate with the ecosystem processes due to functional redundancy fields et al 2006 zelaya et al 2019 in other studies however abundance

sample pretreatment for this study both suspended and attached organisms were sampled to better represent the native groundwater microbiomes table s1 a series of traps were prepared by filling nylon bags with autoclaved aquifer material previously collected from same boreholes and at the same screened interval under study the aquifer material was manually crashed and the particles with size ranging from 0 2 1 6 mm were collected and rinsed with nanopure water the air dried aquifer material was then autoclaved aliquoted and packed with nylon bags that had been sequentially washed with 70 ethanol and sterile nanopure water the traps were lowered into each selected well at the level of the well screen for microbial attachment flynn et al 2008 these in situ sediment microcosms were deployed on october 17 2017 and remained there for 3 6 months so that active microbial populations could colonize the sand in the traps water and trap samples were collected initially during sediment trap deployment and subsequently at each sampling time i e 3 and 6 months before filtering planktonic cells from groundwater or retrieving in situ traps for attached microbe sampling groundwater was pumped out of the well using an electric submersible pump during pumping the physical and geochemical parameters e g ph temperature electrical potential and conductivity were monitored overtime until all the readings were stabilized groundwater samples for geochemical analyses were filtered in the field using 0 45 μm flow through cartridge filters geotech environmental equipment inc co usa for

although the wells under investigation were not far away from each other fig s1 distinguishing geochemical properties were observed between them most of groundwater constituents exhibited significant differences between the wells anova p 0 05 except for sulfide fe ii no3 n and non volatile organic carbon nvoc anova p 0 10 0 83 fig 1 and table s3 all the groundwater samples exhibited circumneutral ph fig 1a well 04ug screened in the shallower upper glasford formation showed significantly higher and dynamic dissolved oxygen do and redox potential eh than the four bedrock wells g101 g104 fig 1b c in addition the concentrations of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 in the g101 g104 samples were significantly lower than that in well 04ug while s ii was lower in well 04ug than the others fig 1g and h table s3 in terms of nitrogen compounds relatively low concentrations of nh4 was consistently detected in all the wells while no3 was below detection limit in most samples except for 04ug and g102 at sporadic time points fig 1j and i spatial heterogeneity in chemical composition was also observed between g101 g104 the proximate wells screening the same geological formation fig 1 in each of the four wells the geochemical conditions were relatively stable during the 6 months of monitoring period except for dissolved sulfide and fe ii concentrations fig 1h i 3 2 distinct microbial structure and taxonomic composition associated with sample types alpha diversity profiles based on inverse simpson index invsimpson showed that at the same time point the overall otu diversity and evenness were significantly higher for the suspended microbial communities than their attached counterparts t test p 0 025 in addition among all the wells the shallower 04ug exhibited the most variable diversity for the suspended microbial communities over six months in comparison significantly lower diversity and more stable microbial communities with the invsimpson values consistently less than 40 were observed for the attached fraction in contrast to the highly variable suspended ones fig 2 the suspended and attached microbial communities exhibited distinct microbial population composition although proteobacteria were the most dominant phylum in both communities they were significantly enriched in the sediment matrix fig s2 the orders bacteroidales omnitrophales sphingobacteriales and victivallales along with several proteobacterial orders e g methyloccoccales burkholderiales desulfobacterales methylophiales gallionellales accounted for the majority of the suspended microbial communities the dominant orders in the attached samples however were exclusively affiliated with proteobacteria e g desulfobacterales desulfobulbales geobacterales methyloccoccales and desulfuromonadales fig 3 due to the limitation of the pore size our work were focused on the microorganisms with typical size several hundred nanometers to several micrometers but the organisms in lower nanometer size e g cpr bacteria and dpann archaea detected in earlier studies on other aquifers he et al 2021 luef et al 2015 were potentially overlooked comparison of the 20 most dominant otus in the suspended and attached microbial communities showed distinct patterns depending on sample fraction fig 4 only three otus i e an unclassified desulfobulbaceae a methylobacter and an unclassified methylococcaceae were among the major phylotypes 1 in both sample fractions while the others were significant in only one sample fraction for example sulfurospirillum desulfocapsa geothrix and multiple geobacter spp were the major otus in the attached microbial communities while methylococcaceae methylophilus sideroxydans and methylovolum were among the most significant free living phylotypes fig 4 in addition cumulatively relative abundance for the core otus that were detected in at least half of the samples was significantly higher in the attached microbial communities compared to that in the suspended ones fig s3 and section s2 1 in the si this suggested that the shared core phylotypes made up the majority of the populations in the attached microbial communities while the transient ones accounted for the majority in the suspended communities 3 3 spatial and temporal microbial distribution the microbial communities inhabiting the wells showed different extents of dissimilarity depending on the sample source the shallower 04ug communities were most dissimilar from those found in wells g101 g104 which was supported by a bray curtis analysis model figs 5 a and s4 the samples from 04ug were 85 88 89 53 suspended and 73 6 77 06 attached in dissimilarity from those derived from g101 g104 fig s4 in comparison lower dissimilarities of 63 88 75 92 suspended and 55 74 63 67 attached were observed among the samples taken from wells g101 g104 completed in the same formation fig s4 it should be noted that although well g104 was somewhat distant from the wells g101 g103 the community dissimilarity between these samples was comparable the changes in microbial community composition after three and six months were observed within each well the greatest change was observed in the shallower 04ug well consistent with the highly variable alpha diversity in this well fig 2 using simper analysis the contribution of the specific populations to the quarterly changes in the microbial community composition in each well was assessed and the major taxa that contributed to 1 of the observed change were identified these major taxa contributed 34 6 57 5 to the changes at different time points seen with the suspended microbial communities compared with 43 1 67 7 in the attached ones tables s5 and s6 specifically the prevailing otus in the attached microbial communities e g geobacter and unclassified deltaproteobacteria are among the major taxa contributing the greatest to the changes in the biofilm table s6 3 4 environmental drivers for subsurface microbial structure along space and time canonical correspondence analysis cca showed that generally the microbial communities were clustered based on the sampling type and well fig 5 the suspended and the attached microbial communities from the shallower and more oxidized 04ug well samples were significantly different from those for the other wells permanova p 0 05 for the suspended microbial community composition factors such as so4 2 do eh and nitrate were important for well 04ug while na cl and s ii were most important for wells g101 g103 fig 5b comparatively similar driving factors were observed for the attached microbial communities except that the deeper g101 g103 were also influenced by fe ii and alkalinity fig 5c 3 5 functional genes among the 12 functional genes tested dsrb pmoa apra and nifh associated with cycling of c n s in the aquifer ecosystems were selected for further analyses see section s2 2 in si analyses of these functional gene sequences showed that the majority were assigned to a relatively small number of otus for example the top 5 otus of dsrb and nifh genes comprised 69 5 and 69 7 of the sequencing reads for the suspended and attached fractions respectively the least diversity was observed with pmoa with 5 and 6 otus comprising 95 of the sequencing reads in the suspended and attached samples respectively the closest phylogenetic references identified for these dominant genotypes illustrated the diversity of potential functional populations found in different wells or at different time points figs 6 s5 s7 functional gene composition changed differentially between wells and with time for the functional genes identified for the suspended microbial communities the pair wise dissimilarity for samples derived from the same well ranged from 36 6 to 93 7 with a relatively stronger effect along time changes observed for apra and dsrb in contrast the changes for the attached microbial communities between three and six months were generally lower than the suspended counterparts fig 7 a different pattern was observed for pmoa a stable composition with less than 40 dissimilarity was observed for all the suspended microbial communities lower than any other functional gene however pmoa gene composition was more variable in the attached communities for most of the wells with the highest dissimilarity index 82 6 in well 04ug fig 7 further assessment of pmoa genes indicated that more than 90 of the changes were derived from the large change in abundance of the most dominant otus instead of the overall gene variant composition pcoa analyses based on the bray curtis dissimilarity model between the samples showed distinct shifts in the functional genes based mainly by when and where they were taken or the fraction under study fig 8 overall the distribution of the functional genes exhibited significant difference between the sampling wells permanova f 3 2 11 0 p 0 0002 specifically the 04ug samples exhibited less similarity with the other wells for all the 4 functional genes in both suspended and attached phases suggesting its relative independence permanova p 0 05 fig 8 interestingly the dissimilarity in the functional genes between the suspended and attached microbial communities showed different patterns for apra dsrb and nifh the functional gene composition for wells g101 g104 were generally separated by the sample type fig 8a c unlikely the low diversity pmoa gene was sample dependent as the suspended and attached phases from the same well were more closely associated than the sample based difference fig 8d 3 6 ecological drivers of microbial community and potential functional population assembly to understand the assembly processes that determine the formation of local communities the distribution of microbial populations and potential community functionalities i e designated by distribution of functional genes icamp a phylogenetic bin based null model was applied ning et al 2020 this method overcomes the constraints imposed by classical statistical approaches based on the pairwise turnovers of the whole community composition instead the icamp model differentiates the microbial groups functional genes on finer biological organization levels ning et al 2020 based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis the deterministic process homogenous selection was the most significant and was responsible for 69 and 83 of the suspended and the attached community composition respectively notably higher contributions from the stochastic process of dispersal limitation was suggested for the suspended microbial communities than the attached ones 22 vs 4 fig 9 a for the functional genes homogenous selection was much less than that observed for the overall community assembly based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis the execption to this was nifh in the attached samples fig 9 for dsrb pmoa and apra relative contribution of homogeneous selection was typically less than 30 instead the stochastic processes e g drift and others played significant roles for assembly of the functional gene pools while significantly higher contribution was observed for the suspended samples compared with the attached ones for dsrb and nifh similar contribution was identified between the two fractions for pmoa and apra fig 9b e the importance of dispersal limitation varied depending on the functional genes with the highest contribution of this process observed for dsrb in the attached samples fig 9b comparable contribution by dispersal limitation was observed for nifh in the suspended samples and apra gene communities in both fractions 41 46 fig 9c and e in contrast this process did not appear to be an important driver for assembly of nifh genes in the attached samples and pmoa gene pools in both fractions fig 9c stochasicity was calculated to assess the impacts by the stochastic processes e g birth death speciation extinction and immigration ning et al 2020 the stochasicity was much lower for the 16s rrna genes than the functional genes in terms of individual sampling well homogenous selection contributed most for assembly of the microbial communities with the exception for 04ug in that dispersal limitation played comparable role fig s8a comparatively drift and other processes were consistently important for assembly of the functional gene reserviors while the significance of dispersal limitation or homogenous selection varied depending on the types of the gene fig s8b e 4 discussion an understanding of the stability functionality resilience and assembly of subsurface microbiomes is critical for both fundamental ecological questions and engineering applications fields et al 2006 the integration of geochemistry multiplex pcr high throughput sequencing of amplified genes and statistical analyses used in the present study provide a comprehensive investigation of a few heterogeneous and dynamic shallow aquifer ecosystems our work presents fine resolution for the shallow aquifer microbiomes in that suspended and attached microbial communities distinctively respond to the varying degrees of geochemical fluctuation over space and time even when they are in close proximity the most similar work was the study on the shallow and pristine confined aquifer of us doe enigma oak ridge field research center which provides valuable information about the high spatiotemporal variability at the scale at tens of meters zelaya et al 2019 with the focus solely on the suspended microbial communities however this earlier work did not show the distinct pattens for the attached microbial communities in a series of recent studies on the hainich critical zone exploratory cze in central germany differential microbial structure and functional populations between groundwater fracture surface and rock matrices were identified which provide insights of the fraction dependent microbial communities dwelling aquifer lazar et al 2019 schwab et al 2017 wegner et al 2019 yan et al 2020 the linkage between microbial structure functional groups and the metabolic potential suggested in our study underscores the significance to consider both suspended and attached microbial communities this will allow more accurate understanding of the subsurface ecosystems and provide means to predict the biogeochemical processes 4 1

groundwater akob and küsel 2011 hazen et al 1991 schwab et al 2017 wegner et al 2019 however flow conditions nutrient availabilities and motility dispersal can create distinct micro environments for the free living and the biofilm associated organisms in comparison the capacities to retain water sorb nutrients and protect cells against rapidly changing geochemistry by biofilm establish superior habitat for colonization of actively growing organisms and mutualism compared with those characterized in groundwater for long time scale stoodley et al 2002 our observations of partial overlapped but distinctly distributed free living and surface associated species are in line with other work on subsurface ecosystems flynn et al 2008 flynn et al 2013 zhou et al 2012 in situ bioreactors christensen et al 2018 king et al 2017 and microcosms barnhart et al 2013 similar with the reports by flynn et al 2008 and 2012 no more than 7 8 to 14 1 of the otus are shared between the fractions but account for 25 67 of the sequence abundance in our work in addition the major members for the attached communities are strikingly low in the groundwater and vice versa such preferential enrichment of specific species in different fractions of the subsurface agrees with a metagenomic study at the u s doe uranium contaminated shallow groundwater remediation test site in rifle co in which the dominant suspended phylotypes are only the rare species in the attached fraction fig 4 hug et al 2015 interestingly in the earlier studies conducted on the adjacent mahomet aquifer a confined pristine aquifer located about 20 miles northeast of our site the suspended and attached microbial communities exhibited comparable microbial diversity flynn et al 2008 flynn et al 2013 flynn et al 2012 this inconsistency with our observation of lower diversity in attached microbial communities than that in the suspended counterparts fig 2 and 3 is unlikely due to insufficient colonization see section s3 1 in si instead the geological formation in these earlier studies e g banner formation differs from the glasford and upper pennsylvanian formations in this work where the geochemistry and microbial structure are not expected to be identical in addition as demonstrated in many earlier studies a significant fraction of the aquifer microbiomes is attached to the sedimentary porous media rather than in the free living phase alfreider et al 1997 flemming and wuertz 2019 griebler and lueders 2009 hug et al 2015 if such scenario occurs in our systems too the main phylotypes of the less diversified attached communities are generally more preferentially enriched in the whole system assessment of the preferentially enriched taxa in the suspended versus attached microbial communities suggests that the two fractions may exert varying biogeochemical roles for example the phylotypes of known methanotrophs e g methylophilus meliorbacter methylomonas and methylovulum that oxidize c1 compounds e g methane and or methanol iguchi et al 2011 locke et al 2018 oshkin et al 2016 wartiainen et al 2006 are among the prevailing and core ecotypes in the free living microbial communities the sideroxydans affiliated otu is phylogenetically related with the species capable of oxidizing iron with natural humic acids or using co2 as the carbon source hädrich et al 2019 wessel et al 2014 in comparison the major attached taxa show close phylogenetic relation with some known sulfur metabolizers growing on sulfate thiosulfate and or sulfite e g desulfobacterales desulfobulbaceae desulfocapsa and desulfobacula spp muyzer and stams 2008 additionally the potential metal reducers e g geobacter geothrix and rhodoferax spp finneran et al 2003 lovley and walker 2019 mehta kolte and bond 2012 are among the major phylotypes in the attached fraction the potential fraction based biogeochemical processes suggested by uneven microbial distribution also imply geochemical gradient between groundwater and biofilm 4 2 spatial and temporal changes of the subsurface microbiomes our observations of spatial and time dependent varition in microbial communities inhabiting proximate subsurface niches are reflective of the intimate interactions between groundwater and the mineral components in the sediments these interactions create physical and chemical variation ranging from micrometer to kilometer scales and thus mediate the biogeochemical processes e g weathering nitrogen cylcing and carbon cycling driven by groundwater microbiomes akob and küsel 2011 griebler and lueders 2009 unlike the contaminated sites with elevated concentrations of metals metalloids halogenated solvents or hydrocarbons fields et al 2006 he et al 2018 xu et al 2010 the environmental variation in pristine subsurface ecosystems primarily comprise of natural geochemical biogeochemical changes studies have demostrated that the hydrochemical factors e g groundwater residence time geochemistry nutrient supply dispersal of microbes and pulse of seasonal recharge can create spatially heterogenous and temporally changing environmental conditions in pristine subsurface ecosystems these can directly and indirectly influence the structure metabolic potential and activity of the organisms residing these habitats griebler and lueders 2009 gulmann et al 2015 hug et al 2015 lin et al 2011 nemergut et al 2013 smith et al 2018 wegner et al 2019 zelaya et al 2019 zhou et al 2012 the heterogeneous and dynamically changing suspended microbiomes observed in this study are reflective of the complex subsurface environmental conditions deriven from the introduction of nutrients changes of water geochemistry or migration of microbial populations from the surface flux recharge or between geological strata smith et al 2018 for example pronounced water level changes induced by hydrological dynamics in groundwater can lead to seasonal patterns of the sediment microbial communities in the proximate oligotrophic porous aquifer lin et al 2011 zhou et al 2012 in this study wells g101 g104 monitor groundwater within a relatively confined geological stratum which has not seen much influence from recent meteoric water recharge and has limited water transmissivity with the overlaying horizons in comparison the shallower 04ug well with oxygenated water is probably subject to active recharge from the surface or the overlying tiskilwa formation locke et al 2018 watson et al 2020 in addition although wells g101 g104 monitor the same geological formation and are similar in the depth the distinct geochemical properties for g104 table s3 suggest that it is likely more influenced by hydraulic connections to shallower formation s wimmer et al 2021 for g101 g103 that are only tens of meters distant with each other the differing hydraulic conductivity may explain heterogenous groundwater retenion time and water rock interactions associated with the variable geochemical conditions dong et al 2014b wegner et al 2019 zelaya et al 2019 4 3 functionalities for the subsurface microbiomes as suggested by the functional genes relationship between the functionalities and microbial community structure has been an important ecological question for subsurface ecosystems the functionalities of the microbiota shaped by inter related microbial pools nutrient input energy resource and the ambient environmental conditions are implied in this work the consistent presence of nifh genes suggests that n2 fixation is an important nitrogen source our observations that no3 concentrations are below detection limit in most samples and low concentrations of nh4 were consistently detected in all the samples fig 1 differ from other aquifer ecosystems with active no3 or nh4 introduction e g agricultural and contaminated sites where nitrification denitrification dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra or ammonia oxidation were often identified küsel et al 2016 stoliker et al 2016 wells et al 2018 for example the aquifers with different hydrochemical settings and land use along the hainich groundwater transect in germany have groundwater microbiomes that are mainly driven by nitrification denitrification and anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox while n2 fixation is marginal wegner et al 2019 field and laboratory incubation studies also suggest that under anoxic conditions and with limiting labile organic compounds anammox and denitrification potentially exist while nitrification may be enhanced when oxic eutrophic surface water is introduced under carbon rich conditions dnra would become predominant once o2 was depleted schwab et al 2017 stoliker et al 2016 wegner et al 2019 in our study there was no evidence for active no3 or nh4 introduction from the overlaying formations thus n2 fixation may outcompete other n metabolizing processes in the deeper and n limiting environments to form more bioavailable n substrates the consistent and abundant functional genes of sulfate reduction e g dsrb and apra and methane oxidation pmoa suggest these two processes may be among the energy sources at the ibdp site in the decatur area it has been documented that drift gas containing 22 5 99 5 methane formed in the glacially deeply buried soils from decay of peats and organic rich silts since these glacial deposits reside within a confined saturated formation they are anaerobic and thus favorable for methanogenesis significant methane levels were measured from vacuum wells at locations near the ibdp site meents 1960 in mahomet aquifer located about 20 miles northeast of our studied site variable concentrations of methane were reported in the shallow groundwater wells flynn et al 2008 flynn et al 2013 flynn et al 2012 yamamoto et al 2019 coal solids are also found in the pennsylvanian formation and may provide subsurface microbial communities with organic carbon to generate ch4 adams et al 1984 strapoc et al 2008 these suggest that methane production is common in the glacial deposit of decatur area the lack of mcra pcr products in the preliminary experiment to assess feasibility of the primer sets see section s1 2 in the si detection of pmoa genes and prevalence of methane oxidizers in the suspended microbial communities suggest that aerobic methane oxidization may be critical to explain the fate of methane even in the anoxic wells different strategies are implied by the suspended versus attached microbiota to maintain the overall functional stability earlier studies suggested that the microbiome functionalities in groundwater are stable and may be uncoupled from microbial community structure due to functional redundancy fields et al 2006 zelaya et al 2019 with the attached communities in our study however the structure and richness for the functional genes follow generally similar stability fig 6 7 s5 s7 therefore we propose that there are possible resiliency in functionality by the suspended communities while the conserved functionalities for the attached biofilm communities are more associated with the relatively stable microbial structure this can be explained from several perspectives firstly the source of microbial populations may vary between the free living and attached communities as the free living communities represent the microbial membership from a much larger physical environment than the sediment the possibility to introduce the new taxa with more diversified genetic traits with the flowing groundwater than the selectively colonized biofilm species is expected flynn et al 2008 flynn et al 2013 hug et al 2015 secondly the resistance to the external perturbation between the two fractions differs disturbance by external chemical stressors may be milder for the attached microbial cohorts than those within the groundwater thirdly the attached microbial communities may form biofilm that provides stability for cells mediates surface adhesion and serves as a scaffold for cells enzymes and antibiotics to attach algburi et al 2017 flemming and wingender 2010 the suspended microbiota in contrast are void of such protection and may be more vulnerable to external disturbances ben maamar et al 2015 flynn et al 2008 zelaya et al 2019 4 4 influential ecological processes for community and functioning assembly it is well accepted that both stochastic and deterministic processes operate simultaneously in the assembly of local communities in terms of diversity distribution and succession ning et al 2019 stegen et al 2013 stegen et al 2015 the prevailing contribution by homogenous selection on the community assembly and the variable stochasticity for microbial consortia derived from different wells fig s8 are in line with the previous aquifer studies covering wide geographical area e g hainich critical zone exploratory in germany and the licking aquifer and enigma oak ridge field research center tn in u s danczak et al 2018 fillinger et al 2019 herrmann et al 2019 yan et al 2020 zelaya et al 2019 in these earlier studies increasing selection stress and stronger competition cost for colonization were generally associated with the aquifers with lower flow velocity in contrast in the areas with higher flow velocity hydraulic conductivity nutrient input or uniform hydrochemistry stochastic processes dominate and typically result in more diversified microbial communities with higher turnover rates danczak et al 2018 hädrich et al 2019 yan et al 2020 therefore it was hypothesized that more interconnected communities experiencing lower turnover are susceptible to homogenizing selection in contrast the less inter connected microbial communities experiencing higher turnover are more likely affected by stochastic processes danczak et al 2018 in addition our observation of more significant contribution by dispersal limitation to the suspended microbial communities than the attached ones fig 9a suggests proliferation of specific taxonomic groups in the attached fraction induced by fine scale hydrodynamic niche differentiation and geochemistry besemer et al 2012 besemer et al 2009 as active microbial competition in porous medium can select against biofilm formation and result in dispersal limitation coyte et al 2016 this stochastic biological process may not be significant for attached microbial consortia our work also provides finer resolution about the patterns for assembly of potential functional populations based on the functional gene analyses which is not evident in the overall community composition the strong stochasticity for functional genes figs 9 and s8 is supported by the competitive lottery model that ecological niches are colonized randomly from a pool of species with similar ecological function in this hypothesis integrating both neutral and functional aspects available space within the niche is expected to be colonized by whichever suitable species happens to arrive and inhabit first burke et al 2011 munday 2004 based on the model the functional populations can be reflective of the taxonomic groups alternatively a given function may be broadly distributed across a variety of phylotypes instead of a specific taxonomic group burke et al 2011 munday 2004 in a previously published work on the microbial communities associated with a group of marine green macroalgae ulva australis the specific functional genes were assigned to a broad range of bacteria which differed from sample to sample it suggests that the core functions are not restricted to the particular taxonomic groups burke et al 2011 such scenario occurs for some of our otus for the functional genes under study other otus however are shared between samples or sample types figs 6 s5 s7 it suggests that the taxa with specific trophic or ecological properties are able to occupy the niches within an ecosystem whoever gets there first wins the lottery for that specific space munday 2004 however their changes overtime may reshape the potential functional populations within the niches driven by random components e g dispersal limitation drift or other processes as determined fig 9 and s8 5 conclusions and environmental significance heterogeneous microbial distribution and changes along different time points in response to the environmental disturbance at the high turnover rates are observed within systems tens of meters apart and at the frequency of months while distinct microbial structure and diversity between groundwater versus sediment fractions have been widely observed in the subsurface ecosystems flynn et al 2008 flynn et al 2013 smith et al 2018 this work further suggests that the difference in possible repercussion for stability and resilience in terms of biochemical potential may vary between specific functional populations and metabolic processes more importantly identification of different controlling ecological processes for assembly of the microbial communities and functional genes implies considerable biological patterns that cannot be directly inferred from the species diversity or the free living microbial consortia burke et al 2011 schwab et al 2017 therefore the weight of the free living and attached microbial communities to the overall biogeochemical processes needs careful consideration and assessment when studying the aquifer microbiomes as quantitative analyses have not been included in the present study the follow up work will be focused on applying qpcr and other meta omic approaches to quantitatively analyze the fraction dependent biomass distribution active populations and expressed functional genes to explore the active microbe environment interactions in terms of the changes along space and time in addition to the fundamental significance this work also presents potential instruction for practical applications such as biomonitoring bioremediation and bioaugmentation systematic understanding of the fraction dependent microbial distribution the physiological potential and their assemblies will facilitate the determination of critical factors that relate the community structure to the functions beyond what is just available from the simple analyses king et al 2017 for example the suspended microorganisms are more sensitive to geochemical changes and thus can be applied as the indicators for natural or anthropogenic environmental perturbation e g contaminant leakage meanwhile remediation of regulated metals metalloids may be relied on the development of attached metal metabolizing populations in

16801,bathing or showering is one of the main pathways of water consumption the shower head as an important part of our bathing facilities is directly related to water saving and bathing satisfaction to design a water saving and comfortable shower it is extremely important to know its likely outflow parameters in the resent research the shower head structure and the water jet characteristics and the lagrangian control volume cv element integration method is used to establish a theoretical model describing the motion of the jet from the spray holes of a shower head the model also includes a method of calculation of the spraying force considering the velocity distribution over the jet cross section the model can be used to predict jet parameters spraying force water temperature drop and sprayed water volume distribution to validate the predictions experiments are conducted to measure the spraying force temperature drop and sprayed water volume distribution for the shower head comparisons between experiments and predictions show that the prediction accuracy of the model is satisfactory and the model can be adopted to evaluate the performance of the shower head in addition using the model the salient jet parameters for the spraying hole are also simulated and the influences of the flow rate and the size of the spraying hole on the motion of the jet can be assessed these results guide research and development into water conservation energy conservation and comfort when showering graphical abstract how to know the outflow parameters at any distance from the shower panel image graphical abstract keywords shower head outflow parameters modeling water conservation satisfaction 1 introduction bathing is one of the main contributors to water consumption and shower facilities are directly related to water saving and energy saving in the process of using water with the continuous improvement of consumers quality of life the requirements for the performance and comfort of bathing facilities are increasing as a key component of bathing facilities the shower head is directly related to bathing quality shower comfort and saving water and energy adeyeye et al 2016 minami et al 2015 estrada perez et al 2017 in the past the shower manufacturers mostly made structural improvements to the shower based on design experience or simple test results to obtain better outflow performance fabian 1988 male et al 2001 yuch 1992 however these methods result in limited improvements to shower design restricting further improvement in shower quality and comfort the further to improve the design of the shower it is necessary to understand the flow characteristics of the water inside and outside the shower azuma et al 2010 used numerical simulation to study the characteristics of the bathroom air distribution during showering especially the air flow caused by the water flow generated by the shower nozzle murakami et al 2015 analyzed methods of measurement of the spraying force of the shower head in relation to the optimal flow rate the present authors huang and zhang et al 2013 conducted a numerical simulation on the flow characteristics in a single function shower to reveal the influence of the pressure distribution in the shower on the flow distribution across the spray orifice niwa et al 2016 focused on a hot water saving shower head and studied the relationship between feeling and physical characteristics during showering based on the spread of bacteria in the air and the effect on human health estrada perez et al 2017 used particle image velocimetry piv to experimentally investigate the spray field from a shower and other spray facilities and analyzed the type of spray and droplet velocity on the spread of bacteria in the air and human health recently kenway et al 2019 used the method of dynamic simulation to explore the influence of the performance of or technical changes to the shower on the loss of hot water in addition in other areas of engineering some research progress cruz mazo et al 2016 montanero et al 2020 has been made in the areas of micro atomization jetting and droplet formation these studies have played an important role in promoting research and development on the shower in water saving energy saving and satisfaction for the design of an energy saving water saving and comfortable shower it is necessary to know the relevant outflow parameters of the shower in advance such as water spraying force water temperature spraying coverage area etc in the national standards related to bathing facilities in several countries there are some requirements for the afore mentioned outflow parameters for the purpose of water saving energy saving and bathing satisfaction china national standardization administration 2010 american national standard 2006 asme 2016 unfortunately the existing research into the flow characteristics of showers seldom pays attention to the outflow parameter prediction for this reason the purpose of this article is to establish a theoretical model for the outflow of the shower which can be used to predict the key outflow parameters of the shower so as to guide the design of the shower head or evaluate the designed shower in water saving energy saving and satisfaction terms 2 theoretical model to understand the parameters of the shower we analyze the jet like motion emanating from the small holes on the shower lee et al 1990 used the lagrangian control volume cv element integration method to describe the buoyant motion of the jet and this method has been widely used to simulate the plume motion in underwater oil spills yapa et al 2001 chen et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 in present work this method will also be used to describe the water jets issuing from the small holes on the shower if only one jet for small hole on the shower is considered according to the basic idea of the lagrangian control volume cv element integration method the jet trajectory can be divided into a series of cv elements according to the time sequence of motion of the jet fig 1 in each cv element the fluid has cross sectional average properties such as position velocity and concentration and the conservation equations in the cv can be established as follows the mass conservation in the cv can be expressed as 1 d m d t ρ g q e where m is the mass of fluid in the cv ρ g is the surrounding air density q e is the entrainment rate for surrounding air and t is the time if the friction between the jet interface and the surrounding air is neglected the equation for the conservation of momentum in the cv in three dimensional coordinates can be expressed as 2 d d t m u x u g x ρ g q e 3 d d t m u y u g y ρ g q e 4 d d t m u z u g z ρ g q e ρ ρ g g π r 2 h where u x u y and u z represent the velocities of fluid in the cv in the x y and z directions while u g x u g y and u g z are the velocities of the surrounding air in the x y and z directions respectively ρ and ρ g are the gas liquid mixture density in the cv and the air density respectively r is the radius of the jet and h is the thickness of the cv the mass concentration conservation equation in the cv can be expressed as 5 d d t m c c m g d m d t where c is the mass concentration of water in the cv and c m g is the mass concentration of water in the surrounding air the heat balance in the cv can be expressed as 6 d d t c m t c g t g ρ g q e where c g and c are the specific heat capacities of the surrounding air and the air water mixture in the cv respectively t and t g are the temperature of gas liquid mixture in the cv and the temperature of the surrounding air respectively eq 6 can be used to calculate the temperature of the water in the jet the specific heat capacity of the air water mixture in the cv depends on the mass concentrations of air and water which can be determined by 7 c c g c g c w c w where c g and c w are the specific heat capacities of air and water respectively c g and c w denote the mass concentrations of air and water in the cv respectively the mixture density ρ can be expressed as 8 ρ β w ρ w 1 β w ρ g 9 β w c w ρ w where β w is the mass concentration of water in the cv considering shear and forced entrainments the entrainment flow rate can be expressed as frick 1984 10 q e q s q f where q s and q f are the shear and forced entrainment rates respectively if the surrounding air flow is ignored there is only shear entrainment q s the shear entrainment is related to the relative velocity between the jet and the surrounding air if the surrounding air velocity is 0 then the shear entrainment can be expressed as frick 1984 11 q s 2 π r h α v where α is the entrainment coefficient v is the velocity of the jet from the kinetic energy and momentum equations the entrainment coefficient is given lee et al 1990 by 12 α 2 0 057 0 054 sin φ h 2 h e v g ρ w ρ ρ r where φ is the angle between the axis of the jet and the horizontal e set to2 solving this series of equations the jet parameters such as velocity jet radius temperature and water mass concentration in each cv at different times can be obtained so that we can understand the motion of the jet from a small hole on the shower from obtained jet trajectories for all holes on the shower head we can further obtain the spraying area and water volume distribution for the shower head further details of the method of calculation of the spraying force for the shower head are given below first we consider the calculation of jet force for single orifice on the shower head a cv within the jet is taken and it is supposed that there is a horizontal plate under the cv fig 2 the momentum of the fluid in the cv is converted into the jet force of the water flow on the plate and the force exerted by the cv on the plate is numerically equal to the force f exerted by the plate on the cv assuming the cv is very thin and the fluid gravity in cv and the entrainment rate can be ignored the vertical momentum equation can be written as 13 f β ρ a v 2 cos θ where f denotes jet force on a single hole on the shower head a is the cross sectional area of the jet θ is the angle between jet velocity and the vertical direction and β is the momentum correction factor it should be noted that the velocity obtained by the lagrangian cv element integration method is the average jet cross sectional velocity and the actual jet cross sectional velocity distribution is non uniform to calculate the jet force more accurately the non uniformity of the jet cross sectional velocity distribution needs to be considered and β is used to correct the momentum due to the non uniformity of the section velocity distribution the momentum correction coefficient is related to the velocity distribution of the jet cross section which can be expressed as 14 β 1 a 0 r u v 2 2 π r d r to estimate momentum correction coefficient β it is necessary to obtain the cross sectional velocity distribution for an axisymmetric jet the velocity distribution on the jet cross section can be expressed as abramovich 1963 15 u u m e r 2 r 2 where u is the velocity at a point on the chosen section u m is the maximum velocity at the axis on the chosen section and r is the radius of the jet for the vertical spraying of the shower the contribution of water gravity to the velocity needs to be considered so eq 15 can be rewritten as 16 u u m e r 2 r 2 g t cos θ the second term on the right hand side of eq 16 represents the projection of the gravitational velocity on the jet axis substituting eq 16 into eq 14 eq 14can be rewritten as 17 β 1 a 0 r u v 2 2 π r d r 1 v 2 1 2 u m 2 1 e 2 2 g t u m 1 e 1 cos θ g t cos θ 2 from the law of the conservation of mass it follows that 18 a v 2 π 0 r u r d r substituting eq 16 into eq 18 the maximum axis velocity as a function of the average velocity of the jet section can be obtained as 19 u m v g t cos θ 1 e 1 substituting eq 19 into eq 17 eq 17can be rewritten as 20 β 1 v 2 1 2 v g t cos θ 1 e 1 2 1 e 2 2 g t v g t cos θ cos θ g t cos θ 2 eq 20 shows that β will eventually become a function of the average velocity of jet section substituting eq 20 into eq 13 the vertical jet force for a single hole can be calculated assuming all small holes on the shower head deliver the same flow rate the total spraying force in the vertical direction for the shower head can be expressed as 21 f i 1 n f i i 1 n β i ρ i a i v i 2 cos θ i where n is the number of holes on the shower head so far the motion of the jet equations and spraying force calculation formulae for the shower have been given from these equations we can obtain the motion of the jet parameters as well as the water temperature spraying force water spraying area and water volume distribution 3 calculation method to solve the aforementioned equations the necessary initial conditions on the jet need to be given the initial position of the jet for each small hole can be taken as the center of the small hole and the initial diameter of the jet can be taken as the diameter of the hole the initial temperature can be taken as the water temperature at the hole exit the initial jet velocity can be taken as the hole exit velocity and the direction of initial jet velocity depends on the spraying angle of the hole the angle between the hole axis and the vertical the flow rates through each small hole on the shower panel are assumed to be the same the exit velocity from a small hole can be determined from the flow rate of the shower head as 22 v 0 q v n π 4 d 2 q π 4 d 2 where q v is the flow rate for the shower head and q represents the flow rate through each spraying hole n is the number of holes on the shower head and d is the diameter of each hole since the entrainment effect does not appear the initial density of the jet can be taken as that of the water the equations can be solved by numerical techniques and we have compiled numerical calculation program codes for simulating the motion of the jet and predicting the outflow parameters of shower head in the calculation the time step is taken as δ t 0 1 r 0 v r 0 is the radius of the small hole on the shower head as recommended by lee et al 1990 4 simulation and analysis of shower jet parameters according to the above theoretical model and method of calculation the motion of the jet and the outflow parameters for a shower head fig 3 produced by easo co ltd were simulated the panel of this shower is in the shape of a small arc fig 3 left there are 48 holes with the same diameter on the panel fig 3 right the 48 holes are evenly distributed around four circles on the panel the radii of the four circles from inside to outside are 13mm 21 8mm 30 5mm and39mm respectively and the numbers of holes on the four circles are 3 9 16 and 21 respectively in addition the holes on the four circumferences have different spraying angles the angle between the hole axis and the vertical which are 1 05 2 6 4 15 and 5 71 from the inside to the outside the shower head is divided into five types according to the diameter of the holes which are 0 6mm 0 7mm 0 8mm 0 95mm and 1 2 mm respectively the solution of the theoretical model can be generally described as follows first the mass of each cv can be found using eq 1 second the velocity of each cv can be obtained by using eqs 2 to 4 whence the displacement can also be obtained from velocity third the mass concentration and temperature of each cv can be obtained by using eqs 5 and 6 by integrating these results over all such cvs the complete parameters of the single hole jet can be obtained combining the jet parameters of all small holes the outflow parameters of the shower can be obtained since the spraying holes are evenly distributed along the circumference in present work only the two dimensional motion of the jet for shower head is simulated in addition the influence of the slightly arc shape of the shower panel on the vertical position of the spraying hole is ignored during calculations that is the vertical positions of all holes on the shower are assumed to be the same fig 4 shows the vertical distance difference between the holes the vertical position difference between the spraying holes on the four circles on the panel is very small and the maximum vertical position spacing will not exceed 4mm during the simulation the origin of the coordinates is at the center of the shower panel the z axis is vertically downward and the x axis is horizontal fig 5 illustrates the simulated jet trajectories for the spraying holes on the four circles on the shower panel demonstrating the influences of the flow rate of the shower and the diameter of the hole on the trajectory of the jet we find that as the flow rate from the shower increases the displacement of jet in the horizontal direction will increase and that of the outermost jet will be the most increased the outermost hole has a larger spraying angle increasing the displacement in the horizontal direction will increase the area of coverage of the spray when the flow rate is kept constant as the diameter of the spraying hole increases the displacement of the jet in the horizontal direction will be significantly reduced and the jet trajectories will become more curved the reason for this is that when the diameter of the spraying orifice is increased the outflow velocity of the jet will decrease and the initial momentum obtained will become smaller at this time the influence of gravity on jet will become apparent so the jet trajectory will bend downwards under the action of gravity this will reduce water spraying coverage the jet trajectory depends on the jet velocity so it is necessary for us to evaluate the change in the jet velocity because the flow rates through all small holes are assumed to be equal the changes in the jet velocities for all holes along the respective jet axis are similar so we need only consider the velocity of the jet at one of the holes fig 6 shows simulated variations in jet velocity along the jet axis the jet velocity increases when increasing the flow rate of the shower and decreases with increasing hole diameter however for different flow rates and different hole sizes we can still find some differences in the change in velocity when the diameter of the hole is 0 6mm the velocity gradually reduces along the axis when the flow rate is small 4 l min the velocity decreases more slowly when the diameter of the spraying orifice increases to 0 8mm the velocity at the larger flow rate 8l min decreases slowly along the axis while the velocity at small flow rate 4l min increases slowly when the diameter of the spraying orifice increases to 1 2mm the jet velocities for the three flow rates increase gradually along the axis the variation in jet velocity can be explained from the perspective of jet dynamics that is the motion of the jet of the shower head is driven by the initial momentum and gravity in the case of a larger flow rate and a smaller size hole the initial momentum of the jet will be larger and the initial momentum will play a dominant role during the motion of the jet in this case as the initial momentum decays the velocity of the jet will gradually decrease while in the case of a smaller flow rate and a larger size spraying hole the initial momentum of the jet is small at this time gravity plays a dominant role during the motion of the jet and the jet will gradually accelerate along the axis the further to explain the influences of initial momentum and gravity on jet velocity we will assess the change in froude number fr which can be used to characterize the ratio of inertial force and gravity fr can be defined as f r v 0 g d fig 7 shows variations of froude number with hole size fr increases as the flow rate increases and decreases as the diameter of the hole increases when the flow reaches 8l min through a 0 6 mm hole fr is about 128 at this time the inertial force is dominant and the initial momentum will dominate the motion of the jet when the flow rate is 4l min through a 1 2 mm hole fr will decrease to about 11 3 gravity exerts the dominant influence on the motion of the jet in the late stage of the motion of the jet gravity may play a dominant role due to the decay of the initial momentum fig 8 demonstrates the simulated variations of the jet radius along the jet axis when the diameter of the hole is unchanged the larger the flow rate the greater the jet radius the change of jet radius needs to be explained in terms of entrainment effect since the entrainment flow rate is proportional to the relative velocity of the jet and the surrounding air eq 11 the greater the flow rate from the shower the greater the jet velocity and the stronger the shear entrainment which entrains more air eventually causing the jet to become thicker fig 8 also presents that when the diameter of the spraying orifice is small the jet radius increases gradually along the axis and when the diameter of the spraying orifice is larger the jet radius decreases in a regular manner along the axis the change of jet radius with the orifice size also needs to be explained in term of jet dynamics as mentioned above the motion of the jet is mainly driven by the initial momentum and gravity for small spraying holes especially when the flow rate is large the initial momentum plays a dominant role in the motion of the jet because the surrounding air is continuously entrained the initial momentum will decay continuously the velocity of the jet will gradually decrease and its radius will gradually increase for larger spraying holes especially at smaller flow rates the initial momentum is small and gravity plays a dominant role in the motion of the jet at this time the velocity of the jet increases along the axis under the action of gravity so that the jet radius will gradually decrease fig 9 shows the simulated variations in the water volumetric content along the jet axis the water content in the jet gradually decreases along the jet axis due to entrainment of air when the flow rate increases the entrainment is enhanced due to the increase of the jet velocity and more air will enter the jet so the water content of the jet will decrease with the increase of the flow rate this also explains the reason for the foam produced in the shower it is caused by the water air mixture sprayed on the skin especially at a high flow rate the spraying force delivered by a shower head is important for bathing satisfaction and in several countries standards for bathing facilities there are relevant requirements covering this issue american national standards institute 2006 asme 2016 china national standardization management committee 2019 so we simulated the changes in spraying force change of the shower fig 10 illustrates the simulated variations of the spraying force with the vertical distance from the shower panel the spraying force increases with increasing flow rate and decreases with increasing size of the spraying hole for a shower with a higher flow rate and a smaller hole diameter the jet has a larger initial momentum and the contribution of the initial momentum to the spraying force is the dominant factor in this case as the distance from the shower panel increases the momentum is gradually dissipated due to entrainment of the surrounding air which causes the spraying force to decrease with increasing vertical distance while for a shower with a larger spraying hole size and a smaller flow rate the initial momentum of the jet is smaller and the relative contribution of gravity to the spraying force will be greater in this case as the distance from the shower panel increases the jet will gradually accelerate and the spraying force will gradually increase in china s national standards for bathroom facilities for the sake of energy saving there are certain requirements for the temperature drop of the water flowing from the shower china national standardization administration 2010 so we need to know the temperature of the outflowing water fig 11 shows the simulated variations of the water jet temperature with increasing vertical distance from the shower panel in the simulation the initial temperature of the jet is the water temperature in the shower which is taken as 315k and the external environment temperature is taken as 295 k from fig 11 as the distance from the shower panel increases the water temperature gradually decays due to heat exchange between the hot water and the surrounding cooler air we also find that the flow rate and the size of the spraying hole have a certain effect on the temperature drop that is as the flow rate increases the attenuation of the water temperature will become larger along the vertical direction in addition the temperature drop for the shower with larger spraying hole is significantly lower than that for the shower with smaller spraying hole the reason for these temperature changes is the entrainment effect the greater the flow rate the greater the jet velocity which entrains more cold air in the jet so that the water temperature drops more rapidly when the size of the spraying hole increases the jet becomes slower and the entrainment weakens slowing the rate of cooling 5 experimental measurement of key parameters in this work we conducted relevant experiments on the shower head manufactured by easo co ltd the spraying force the volume distribution of spraying water and the water temperature drop were measured which can be used to validate the predicted results of the model the experimental conditions and the physical properties of air and water are taken as follows the ambient temperature is 22 c and the air density and viscosity are 1 2 k g m 3 and 1 81 10 5 p a s respectively the temperature of the hot water in the shower is between 35 and 42 c the density of water is between 991 and 994 k g m 3 and the viscosity is between 0 62 10 3 and 0 72 10 3 p a s the prediction considers the changes in water density and viscosity with temperature in the simulation the specific heat capacities of water and air are taken as 4 2 10 3 j k g c and 1005 j k g c respectively 5 1 spraying force the spraying force delivered by the shower head directly affects bathing satisfaction and a spraying force that is too strong or too weak makes bathers uncomfortable minami et al 2015 okamoto et al 2015 there are some requirements for the spraying force enshrined in the standards of several countries american national standards institute 2006 asme 2016 china national standardization management committee 2019 for example in the relevant american standard it is required that the minimum spray force at the nozzle outlet for high efficiency shower heads and hand held showers should not be less than 0 56n when the dynamic pressure is 140 k p a in the relevant chinese standards the average spraying force at a position 400mm from the outlet for the hand held shower head is required to be no less than 0 85n when the dynamic pressure is within the range of 0 1 to 0 3mpa for this reason we conducted measurements of the spraying force under different working conditions for several makes of shower with different hole diameters 0 6mm 0 7mm 0 8mm and 0 95mm the spraying force measurement configuration is shown in fig 12 a dfs r 0002 type dynamometer accurate to 0 01n is connected to the curved panel and the shower is installed above the curved panel the vertical distance between the shower head and the curved panel can be adjusted as required when the shower sprays water the curved panel will bear the spraying force of the water and transfer the force to the dynamometer the value recorded on the dynamometer includes the net spraying force and the weight of the curved panel we then turned off the shower whereupon the reading of the dynamometer is the weight of the curved panel as well as the residual water thereon subtracting the dynamometer reading when the shower is spraying from the dynamometer reading after the shower is closed we obtain the net spraying force of the shower to minimize the influence of residual water on the curved panel on the measured results the curved panel is made of hydrophobic materials we provide an example to illustrate the processing of experimental data and fig 13 shows the data measured by the dynamometer it can be found that there are three stages in the change of the reading on the dynamometer in the first stage the reading is maintained at about 1 23n this stage corresponds to the shower spraying stage the reading at that time included the net spraying force and the weight of the curved panel when the shower is turned off suddenly the reading dropped steeply in a linear manner over time representing the second stage this stage is very short lasting only a few seconds until the water column in the air has completely fallen thereafter that the change in the dynamometer reading enters the third stage due to the slow fall of the residual water on the curved panel the reading changes in a non linear manner and slowly decreases until it tends to a stable value when the second stage transitions to the third stage there is a significant inflection point in the readings the reading in the first stage minus the reading at the inflection point should be equal to the net spraying force according to this method we can obtain the injection force under the required working conditions we measured the spraying forces for several showers with different spray hole sizes under different working conditions inspection of tables 1 and 2 allows comparisons between the predicted and the measured spraying forces at different positions the overall predicted spraying force change trend with flow rate and spraying hole size is consistent with the measured results and the average relative error of the prediction is about 23 81 the predicted value is slightly lower than the measured value especially when the spraying force is smaller the discrepancy between the predicted and the measured results may be caused by three factors first in the measurement the reading of the dynamometer includes the net spraying force and the weight of curved panel as well as the residual water attached thereto the net spray force is obtained by subtracting the weight of the curved panel and the residual water from the reading of the dynamometer this may cause the measured spraying force to include part of the weight of the residual water so that the measured value may be slightly higher especially when the spray force is small the residual water will have a greater effect on the measured value second in the model it is assumed that the flow rates through each hole is equal despite the inevitable variations therein third the spray of water droplets formed by the jet on the curved panel is discontinuous which will cause certain fluctuations in the measured value however in any case the prediction of model on spraying force is basically acceptable to designers 5 2 spraying coverage and volume distribution of water the spraying coverage and the volume distribution of spraying water for the shower head are extremely important for water saving and personal satisfaction with the performance of the shower and there are certain requirements for this in the bathing facility standards in china and several other countries american national standards institute 2006 asme 2016 china national standardization administration 2010 for example in china the requirements for spraying coverage and water volume distribution are as follows in a circular area with a diameter of 120mm the ratio of the received water volume to the total water volume is required to be within the range of 40 70 while in a circular area with a diameter of 420mm it is required to be no less than 95 the test location is required to be 600mm from the shower panel for this reason we measured the volume distribution of spraying water from the shower the measurement is conducted in accordance with the method specified in the chinese standard gb t 23447 2009 and the measurement configuration is shown in fig 14 during the measurement a water collecting pan composed of concentric cylinders is placed directly under the shower and the water volume distribution of the shower is characterized by measuring the amount of water falling into each annular cavity of the water collecting pan over a period of time the size of the concentric cylinders is slightly different from the size specified by the chinese national standard but it will not have a substantial influence on the measured water distribution the diameter of the innermost ring is 50 8mm and the annular gap in each concentric cylinder is 25 4mm by measuring the volume of water falling into each annular gap within a given time the distribution of water in the radial direction can be obtained fig 15 depicts the comparison between the predicted and measured water volume distributions the flow rate through the shower is 5l min the size of the holes is 0 7mm and measurements are taken at 400mm from the outlet of the shower the predicted value is obtained from the distribution and number of spray holes in the shower panel predicting the trajectory of the jet for each spray hole and jet diameter from fig 15 the predicted water spraying coverage is in good agreement with the experimental results and the predicted water volume distribution is consistent with the measured results except that the water volumes within r 25 4 m m and 50 8 r 76 2 m m are somewhat different the slight difference between predicted and measured values is mainly due to a certain manufacturing error in the inclination angle of the holes we measured the inclination angle of the holes on the shower heads tested this comparison also shows that the model can be used to predict the jet trajectory of the shower nozzle 5 3 water temperature drop the water temperature during the shower is directly related to the perceived level of user satisfaction and the temperature drop of the flowing water may also involve energy consumption analysis zingano 2001 for the sake of energy conservation in china s national standards for bathroom facilities there is special requirement for the water temperature drop of the shower that is under a dynamic pressure of 0 25 0 02 m p a the water temperatures difference between locations at 150 10 m m and 750 10 m m from the shower panel cannot exceed 3 c china national standardization administration 2010 we conducted water temperature drop measurements under different conditions for a type of shower with 0 8 mm diameter holes in this experiment the water is heated to the required temperature with a bj 101 type heating rod and the temperature is controlled within 4 the temperature drop in the water flow is measured with a yet 720l type thermometer fig 16 to 0 1 c the thermometer has two probes which can be used for simultaneous measurement of the water temperature at two locations it is difficult to maintain a constant temperature in the shower we kept the water temperature in the shower to within a range of fluctuation range of less than 0 5 c during these measurements table 3 lists the measured and predicted water temperature drops under different conditions the predicted temperature drop is calculated using the average water temperature in the shower as the initial temperature from table 3 we can find that the change in the temperature drop with the flow rate and the water temperature in the shower is consistent with the measured result and the average relative error of the prediction is about 22 02 in addition we can also find that when the temperature drop is small the error in our prediction is large but for a large temperature drop the prediction is reasonable this is mainly due to uncontrollable fluctuations in the temperature of the water inside the shower resulting in a certain degree of uncertainty in the measured temperature drop for small temperature drops the uncertainty in measured values is larger in addition we can also find the temperature drop is affected by the water temperature in the shower the higher the water temperature in the shower the greater the temperature drop combined with fig 11 we can infer that the temperature drop from the shower head will be greater when the water temperature in the shower is high the spray holes are small and the flow rate is large a larger temperature drop induces a greater loss of thermal energy from the hot water therefore the temperature drop for the shower should be minimized to save energy based on the comparison of measured and predicted data the predictive model of the outflow parameters is deemed satisfactory for design purposes the model can be used to let the designer know in advance whether the designed shower head can meet the relevant national standards in addition the performance of the designed shower head can also be evaluated in terms of water and energy conservation and user satisfaction 6 conclusions lagrangian cv element integration method is used to establish a theoretical model describing the motion of the jet and the spraying force of the spraying orifice of the shower the model can realize the prediction of the relevant outflow parameters of the shower head such as the spraying force the temperature drop in the flow and the volume distribution of the spray the measured data show that the predicted results arising from use of the model are consistent with the measured results the average discrepancies in the predicted spraying force and temperature drop are 24 and 22 respectively deemed acceptable to the designer the predicted and measured results show that the spraying force is affected by the initial momentum of jet and gravity for a shower with a higher flow rate and a smaller hole diameter the jet has greater initial momentum and the contribution of the initial momentum to the spraying force is the dominant factor at this time as the distance from the shower panel increases as the surrounding air is continuously entrained the momentum is gradually dissipated and the spraying force will gradually decrease for a shower with a larger hole size and a smaller flow rate the initial momentum of the jet is smaller and the effects of gravity become more apparent at this time as the distance from the shower panel increases the jet will gradually accelerate so that the spraying force will gradually increase understanding the change in spraying force is conducive to obtaining a satisfying shower for the variation in temperature of water jet the predicted and measured results show that the flow rate and the hole size have a certain influence on the temperature attenuation of the water jet as the flow rate increases the attenuation of the water temperature will increase with the vertical distance from the holes the temperature drop for the shower with larger spraying holes is significantly lower than that for the shower with smaller spraying holes in addition the greater the difference between the water temperature in the shower and the ambient air temperature the larger the temperature drop in the water jet understanding the temperature change of the water jet is helpful to the energy saving design of such showers using the predictive model other parameters of the jet for shower are also simulated such as jet trajectory velocity and jet diameter the influences of flow rate and hole size of the shower on these parameters are investigated

facilities are directly related to water saving and energy saving in the process of using water with the continuous improvement of consumers quality of life the requirements for the performance and comfort of bathing facilities are increasing as a key component of bathing facilities the shower head is directly related to bathing quality shower comfort and saving water and energy adeyeye et al 2016 minami et al 2015 estrada perez et al 2017 in the past the shower manufacturers mostly made structural improvements to the shower based on design experience or simple test results to obtain better outflow performance fabian 1988 male et al 2001 yuch 1992 however these methods result in limited improvements to shower design restricting further improvement in shower quality and comfort the further to improve the design of the shower it is necessary to understand the flow characteristics of the water inside and outside the shower azuma et al 2010 used numerical simulation to study the characteristics of the bathroom air distribution during showering especially the air flow caused by the water flow generated by the shower nozzle murakami et al 2015 analyzed methods of measurement of the spraying force of the shower head in relation to the optimal flow rate the present authors huang and zhang et al 2013 conducted a numerical simulation on the flow characteristics in a single function shower to reveal the influence of the pressure distribution in the shower on the flow distribution across the spray orifice niwa et al 2016 focused on a hot water saving shower head and studied the relationship between feeling and physical characteristics during showering based on the spread of bacteria in the air and the effect on human health estrada perez et al 2017 used particle image velocimetry piv to experimentally investigate the spray field from a shower and other spray facilities and analyzed the type of spray and droplet velocity on the spread of bacteria in the air and human health recently kenway et al 2019 used the method of dynamic simulation to explore the influence of the performance of or technical changes to the shower on the loss of hot water in addition in other areas of engineering some research progress cruz mazo et al 2016 montanero et al 2020 has been made in the areas of micro atomization jetting and droplet formation these studies have played an important role in promoting research and development on the shower in water saving energy saving and satisfaction for the design of an energy saving water saving and comfortable shower it is necessary to know the relevant outflow parameters of the shower in advance such as water spraying force water temperature spraying coverage area etc in the national standards related to bathing facilities in several countries there are some requirements for the afore mentioned outflow parameters for the purpose of water saving energy saving and bathing satisfaction china national standardization administration 2010 american national standard 2006 asme 2016 unfortunately the existing research into the flow characteristics of showers seldom pays attention to the outflow parameter prediction for this reason the purpose of this article is to establish a theoretical model for the outflow of the shower which can be used to predict the key outflow parameters of the shower so as to guide the design of the shower head or evaluate the designed shower in water saving energy saving and satisfaction terms 2 theoretical model to understand the parameters of the shower we analyze the jet like motion emanating from the small holes on the shower lee et al 1990 used the lagrangian control volume cv element integration method to describe the buoyant motion of the jet and this method has been widely used to simulate the plume motion in underwater oil spills yapa et al 2001 chen et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 in present work this method will also be used to describe the water jets issuing from the small holes on the shower if only one jet for small hole on the shower is considered according to the basic idea of the lagrangian control volume cv element integration method the jet trajectory can be divided into a series of cv elements according to the time sequence of motion of the jet fig 1 in each cv element the fluid has cross sectional average properties such as position velocity and concentration and the conservation equations in the cv can be established as follows the mass conservation in the cv can be expressed as 1 d m d t ρ g q e where m is the mass of fluid in the cv ρ g is the surrounding air density q e is the entrainment rate for surrounding air and t is the time if the friction between the jet interface and the surrounding air is neglected the equation for the conservation of momentum in the cv in three dimensional coordinates can be expressed as 2 d d t m u x u g x ρ g q e 3 d d t m u y u g y ρ g q e 4 d d t m u z u g z ρ g q e ρ ρ g g π r 2 h where u x u y and u z represent the velocities of fluid in the cv in the x y and z directions while u g x u g y and u g z are the velocities of the surrounding air in the x y and z directions respectively ρ and ρ g are the gas liquid mixture density in the cv and the air density respectively r is the radius of the jet and h is the thickness of the cv the mass concentration conservation equation in the cv can be expressed as 5 d d t m c c m g d m d t where c is the mass concentration of water in the cv and c m g is the mass concentration of water in the surrounding air the heat balance in the cv can be expressed as 6 d d t c m t c g t g ρ g q e where c g and c are the specific heat capacities of the surrounding air and the air water mixture in the cv respectively t and t g are the temperature of gas liquid mixture in the cv and the temperature of the surrounding air respectively eq 6 can be used to calculate the temperature of the water in the jet the specific heat capacity of the air water mixture in the cv depends on the mass concentrations of air and water which can be determined by 7 c c g c g c w c w where c g and c w are the specific heat capacities of air and water respectively c g and c w denote the mass concentrations of air and water in the cv respectively the mixture density ρ can be expressed as 8 ρ β w ρ w 1 β w ρ g 9 β w c w ρ w where β w is the mass concentration of water in the cv considering shear and forced entrainments the entrainment flow rate can be expressed as frick 1984 10 q e q s q f where q s and q f are the shear and forced entrainment rates respectively if the surrounding air flow is ignored there is only shear entrainment q s the shear entrainment is related to the relative velocity between the jet and the surrounding air if the surrounding air velocity is 0 then the shear entrainment can be expressed as frick 1984 11 q s 2 π r h α v where α is the entrainment coefficient v is the velocity of the jet from the kinetic energy and momentum equations the entrainment coefficient is given lee et al 1990 by 12 α 2 0 057 0 054 sin φ h 2 h e v g ρ w ρ ρ r where φ is the angle between the axis of the jet and the horizontal e set to2 solving this series of equations the jet parameters such as velocity jet radius temperature and water mass concentration in each cv at different times can be obtained so that we can understand the motion of the jet from a small hole on the shower from obtained jet trajectories for all holes on the shower head we can further obtain the spraying area and water volume distribution for the shower head further details of the method of calculation of the spraying force for the shower head are given below first we consider the calculation of jet force for single orifice on the shower head a cv within the jet is taken and it is supposed that there is a horizontal plate under the cv fig 2 the momentum of the fluid in the cv is converted into the jet force of the water flow on the plate and the force exerted by the cv on the plate is numerically equal to the force f exerted by the plate on the cv assuming the cv is very thin and the fluid gravity in cv and the entrainment rate can be ignored the vertical momentum equation can be written as 13 f β ρ a v 2 cos θ where f denotes jet force on a single hole on the shower head a is the cross sectional area of the jet θ is the angle between jet velocity and the vertical direction and β is the momentum correction factor it should be noted that the velocity obtained by the lagrangian cv element integration method is the average jet cross sectional velocity and the actual jet cross sectional velocity distribution is non uniform to calculate the jet force more accurately the non uniformity of the jet cross sectional velocity distribution needs to be considered and β is used to correct the momentum due to the non uniformity of the section velocity distribution the momentum correction coefficient is related to the velocity distribution of the jet cross section which can be expressed as 14 β 1 a 0 r u v 2 2 π r d r to estimate momentum correction coefficient β it is necessary to obtain the cross sectional velocity distribution for an axisymmetric jet the velocity distribution on the jet cross section can be expressed as abramovich 1963 15 u u m e r 2 r 2 where u is the velocity at a point on the chosen section u m is the maximum velocity at the axis on the chosen section and r is the radius of the jet for the vertical spraying of the shower the contribution of water gravity to the velocity needs to be considered so eq 15 can be rewritten as 16 u u m e r 2 r 2 g t cos θ the second term on the right hand side of eq 16 represents the projection of the gravitational velocity on the jet axis substituting eq 16 into eq 14 eq 14can be rewritten as 17 β 1 a 0 r u v 2 2 π r d r 1 v 2 1 2 u m 2 1 e 2 2 g t u m 1 e 1 cos θ g t cos θ 2 from the law of the conservation of mass it follows that 18 a v 2 π 0 r u r d r substituting eq 16 into eq 18 the maximum axis velocity as a function of the average velocity of the jet section can be obtained as 19 u m v g t cos θ 1 e 1 substituting eq 19 into eq 17 eq 17can be rewritten as 20 β 1 v 2 1 2 v g t cos θ 1 e 1 2 1 e 2 2 g t v g t cos θ cos θ g t cos θ 2 eq 20 shows that β will eventually become a function of the average velocity of jet section substituting eq 20 into eq 13 the vertical jet force for a single hole can be calculated assuming all small holes on the shower head deliver the same flow rate the total spraying force in the vertical direction for the shower head can be expressed as 21 f i 1 n f i i 1 n β i ρ i a i v i 2 cos θ i where n is the number of holes on the shower head so far the motion of the jet equations and spraying force calculation formulae for the shower have been given from these equations we can obtain the motion of the jet parameters as well as the water temperature spraying force water spraying area and water volume distribution 3 calculation method to solve the aforementioned equations the necessary initial conditions on the jet need to be given the initial position of the jet for each small hole can be taken as the center of the small hole and the initial diameter of the jet can be taken as the diameter of the hole the initial temperature can be taken as the water temperature at the hole exit the initial jet velocity can be taken as the hole exit velocity and the direction of initial jet velocity depends on the spraying angle of the hole the angle between the hole axis and the vertical the flow rates through each small hole on the shower panel are assumed to be the same the exit velocity from a small hole can be determined from the flow rate of the shower head as 22 v 0 q v n π 4 d 2 q π 4 d 2 where q v is the flow rate for the shower head and q represents the flow rate through each spraying hole n is the number of holes on the shower head and d is the diameter of each hole since the entrainment effect does not appear the initial density of the jet can be taken as that of the water the equations can be solved by numerical techniques and we have compiled numerical calculation program codes for simulating the motion of the jet and predicting the outflow parameters of shower head in the calculation the time step is taken as δ t 0 1 r 0 v r 0 is the radius of the small hole on the shower head as recommended by lee et al 1990 4 simulation and analysis of shower jet parameters according to the above theoretical model and method of calculation the motion of the jet and the outflow parameters for a shower head fig 3 produced by easo co ltd were simulated the panel of this shower is in the shape of a small arc fig 3 left there are 48 holes with the same diameter on the panel fig 3 right the 48 holes are evenly distributed around four circles on the panel the radii of the four circles from inside to outside are 13mm 21 8mm 30 5mm and39mm respectively and the numbers of holes on the four circles are 3 9 16 and 21 respectively in addition the holes on the four circumferences have different spraying angles the angle between the hole axis and the vertical which are 1 05 2 6 4 15 and 5 71 from the inside to the outside the shower head is divided into five types according to the diameter of the holes which are 0 6mm 0 7mm 0 8mm 0 95mm and 1 2 mm respectively the solution of the theoretical model can be generally described as follows first the mass of each cv can be found using eq 1 second the velocity of each cv can be obtained by using eqs 2 to 4 whence the displacement can also be obtained from velocity third the mass concentration and temperature of each cv can be obtained by using eqs 5 and 6 by integrating these results over all such cvs the complete parameters of the single hole jet can be obtained combining the jet parameters of all small holes the outflow parameters of the shower can be obtained since the spraying holes are evenly distributed along the circumference in present work only the two dimensional motion of the jet for shower head is simulated in addition the influence of the slightly arc shape of the shower panel on the vertical position of the spraying hole is ignored during calculations that is the vertical positions of all holes on the shower are assumed to be the same fig 4 shows the vertical distance difference between the holes the vertical position difference between the spraying holes on the four circles on the panel is very small and the maximum vertical position spacing will not exceed 4mm during the simulation the origin of the coordinates is at the center of the shower panel the z axis is vertically downward and the x axis is horizontal fig 5 illustrates the simulated jet trajectories for the spraying holes on the four circles on the shower panel demonstrating the influences of the flow rate of the shower and the diameter of the hole on the trajectory of the jet we find that as the flow rate from the shower increases the displacement of jet in the horizontal direction will increase and that of the outermost jet will be the most increased the outermost hole has a larger spraying angle increasing the displacement in the horizontal direction will increase the area of coverage of the spray when the flow rate is kept constant as the diameter of the spraying hole increases the displacement of the jet in the horizontal direction will be significantly reduced and the jet trajectories will become more curved the reason for this is that when the diameter of the spraying orifice is increased the outflow velocity of the jet will decrease and the initial momentum obtained will become smaller at this time the influence of gravity on jet will become apparent so the jet trajectory will bend downwards under the action of gravity this will reduce water spraying coverage the jet trajectory depends on the jet velocity so it is necessary for us to evaluate the change in the jet velocity because the flow rates through all small holes are assumed to be equal the changes in the jet velocities for all holes along the respective jet axis are similar so we need only consider the velocity of the jet at one of the holes fig 6 shows simulated variations in jet velocity along the jet axis the jet velocity increases when increasing the flow rate of the shower and decreases with increasing hole diameter however for different flow rates and different hole sizes we can still find some differences in the change in velocity when the diameter of the hole is 0 6mm the velocity gradually reduces along the axis when the flow rate is small 4 l min the velocity decreases more slowly when the diameter of the spraying orifice increases to 0 8mm the velocity at the larger flow rate 8l min decreases slowly along the axis while the velocity at small flow rate 4l min increases slowly when the diameter of the spraying orifice increases to 1 2mm the jet velocities for the three flow rates increase gradually along the axis the variation in jet velocity can be explained from the perspective of jet dynamics that is the motion of the jet of the shower head is driven by the initial momentum and gravity in the case of a larger flow rate and a smaller size hole the initial momentum of the jet will be larger and the initial momentum will play a dominant role during the motion of the jet in this case as the initial momentum decays the velocity of the jet will gradually decrease while in the case of a smaller flow rate and a larger size spraying hole the initial momentum of the jet is small at this time gravity plays a dominant role during the motion of the jet and the jet will gradually accelerate along the axis the further to explain the influences of initial momentum and gravity on jet velocity we will assess the change in froude number fr which can be used to characterize the ratio of inertial force and gravity fr can be defined as f r v 0 g d fig 7 shows variations of froude number with hole size fr increases as the flow rate increases and decreases as the diameter of the hole increases when the flow reaches 8l min through a 0 6 mm hole fr is about 128 at this time the inertial force is dominant and the initial momentum will dominate the motion of the jet when the flow rate is 4l min through a 1 2 mm hole fr will decrease to about 11 3 gravity exerts the dominant influence on the motion of the jet in the late stage of the motion of the jet gravity may play a dominant role due to the decay of the initial momentum fig 8 demonstrates the simulated variations of the jet radius along the jet axis when the diameter of the hole is unchanged the larger the flow rate the greater the jet radius the change of jet radius needs to be explained in terms of entrainment effect since the entrainment flow rate is proportional to the relative velocity of the jet and the surrounding air eq 11 the greater the flow rate from the shower the greater the jet velocity and the stronger the shear entrainment which entrains more air eventually causing the jet to become thicker fig 8 also presents that when the diameter of the spraying orifice is small the jet radius increases gradually along the axis and when the diameter of the spraying orifice is larger the jet radius decreases in a regular manner along the axis the change of jet radius with the orifice size also needs to be explained in term of jet dynamics as mentioned above the motion of the jet is mainly driven by the initial momentum and gravity for small spraying holes especially when the flow rate is large the initial momentum plays a dominant role in the motion of the jet because the surrounding air is continuously entrained the initial momentum will decay continuously the velocity of the jet will gradually decrease and its radius will gradually increase for larger spraying holes especially at smaller flow rates the initial momentum is small and gravity plays a dominant role in the motion of the jet at this time the velocity of the jet increases along the axis under the action of gravity so that the jet radius will gradually decrease fig 9 shows the simulated variations in the water volumetric content along the jet axis the water content in the jet gradually decreases along the jet axis due to entrainment of air when the flow rate increases the entrainment is enhanced due to the increase of the jet velocity and more air will enter the jet so the water content of the jet will decrease with the increase of the flow rate this also explains the reason for the foam produced in the shower it is caused by the water air mixture sprayed on the skin especially at a high flow rate the spraying force delivered by a shower head is important for bathing satisfaction and in several countries standards for bathing facilities there are relevant requirements covering this issue american national standards institute 2006 asme 2016 china national standardization management committee 2019 so we simulated the changes in spraying force change of the shower fig 10 illustrates the simulated variations of the spraying force with the vertical distance from the shower panel the spraying force increases with increasing flow rate and decreases with increasing size of the spraying hole for a shower with a higher flow rate and a smaller hole diameter the jet has a larger initial momentum and the contribution of the initial momentum to the spraying force is the dominant factor in this case as the distance from the shower panel increases the momentum is gradually dissipated due to entrainment of the surrounding air which causes the spraying force to decrease with increasing vertical distance while for a shower with a larger spraying hole size and a smaller flow rate the initial momentum of the jet is smaller and the relative contribution of gravity to the spraying force will be greater in this case as the distance from the shower panel increases the jet will gradually accelerate and the spraying force will gradually increase in china s national standards for bathroom facilities for the sake of energy saving there are certain requirements for the temperature drop of the water flowing from the shower china national standardization administration 2010 so we need to know the temperature of the outflowing water fig 11 shows the simulated variations of the water jet temperature with increasing vertical distance from the shower panel in the simulation the initial temperature of the jet is the water temperature in the shower which is taken as 315k and the external environment temperature is taken as 295 k from fig 11 as the distance from the shower panel increases the water temperature gradually decays due to heat exchange between the hot water and the surrounding cooler air we also find that the flow rate and the size of the spraying hole have a certain effect on the temperature drop that is as the flow rate increases the attenuation of the water temperature will become larger along the vertical direction in addition the temperature drop for the shower with larger spraying hole is significantly lower than that for the shower with smaller spraying hole the reason for these temperature changes is the entrainment effect the greater the flow rate the greater the jet velocity which entrains more cold air in the jet so that the water temperature drops more rapidly when the size of the spraying hole increases the jet becomes slower and the entrainment weakens slowing the rate of cooling 5 experimental measurement of key parameters in this work we conducted relevant experiments on the shower head manufactured by easo co ltd the spraying force the volume distribution of spraying water and the water temperature drop were measured which can be used to validate the predicted results of the model the experimental conditions and the physical properties of air and water are taken as follows the ambient temperature is 22 c and the air density and viscosity are 1 2 k g m 3 and 1 81 10 5 p a s respectively the temperature of the hot water in the shower is between 35 and 42 c the density of water is between 991 and 994 k g m 3 and the viscosity is between 0 62 10 3 and 0 72 10 3 p a s the prediction considers the changes in water density and viscosity with temperature in the simulation the specific heat capacities of water and air are taken as 4 2 10 3 j k g c and 1005 j k g c respectively 5 1 spraying force the spraying force delivered by the shower head directly affects bathing satisfaction and a spraying force that is too strong or too weak makes bathers uncomfortable minami et al 2015 okamoto et al 2015 there are some requirements for the spraying force enshrined in the standards of several countries american national standards institute 2006 asme 2016 china national standardization management committee 2019 for example in the relevant american standard it is required that the minimum spray force at the nozzle outlet for high efficiency shower heads and hand held showers should not be less than 0 56n when the dynamic pressure is 140 k p a in the relevant chinese standards the average spraying force at a position 400mm from the outlet for the hand held shower head is required to be no less than 0 85n when the dynamic pressure is within the range of 0 1 to 0 3mpa for this reason we conducted measurements of the spraying force under different working conditions for several makes of shower with different hole diameters 0 6mm 0 7mm 0 8mm and 0 95mm the spraying force measurement configuration is shown in fig 12 a dfs r 0002 type dynamometer accurate to 0 01n is connected to the curved panel and the shower is installed above the curved panel the vertical distance between the shower head and the curved panel can be adjusted as required when the shower sprays water the curved panel will bear the spraying force of the water and transfer the force to the dynamometer the value recorded on the dynamometer includes the net spraying force and the weight of the curved panel we then turned off the shower whereupon the reading of the dynamometer is the weight of the curved panel as well as the residual water thereon subtracting the dynamometer reading when the shower is spraying from the dynamometer reading after the shower is closed we obtain the net spraying force of the shower to minimize the influence of residual water on the curved panel on the measured results the curved panel is made of hydrophobic materials we provide an example to illustrate the processing of experimental data and fig 13 shows the data measured by the dynamometer it can be found that there are three stages in the change of the reading on the dynamometer in the first stage the reading is maintained at about 1 23n this stage corresponds to the shower spraying stage the reading at that time included the net spraying force and the weight of the curved panel when the shower is turned off suddenly the reading dropped steeply in a linear manner over time representing the second stage this stage is very short lasting only a few seconds until the water column in the air has completely fallen thereafter that the change in the dynamometer reading enters the third stage due to the slow fall of the residual water on the curved panel the reading changes in a non linear manner and slowly decreases until it tends to a stable value when the second stage transitions to the third stage there is a significant inflection point in the readings the reading in the first stage minus the reading at the inflection point should be equal to the net spraying force according to this method we can obtain the injection force under the required working conditions we measured the spraying forces for several showers with different spray hole sizes under different working conditions inspection of tables 1 and 2 allows comparisons between the predicted and the measured spraying forces at different positions the overall predicted spraying force change trend with flow rate and spraying hole size is consistent with the measured results and the average relative error of the prediction is about 23 81 the predicted value is slightly lower than the measured value especially when the spraying force is smaller the discrepancy between the predicted and the measured results may be caused by three factors first in the measurement the reading of the dynamometer includes the net spraying force and the weight of curved panel as well as the residual water attached thereto the net spray force is obtained by subtracting the weight of the curved panel and the residual water from the reading of the dynamometer this may cause the measured spraying force to include part of the weight of the residual water so that the measured value may be slightly higher especially when the spray force is small the residual water will have a greater effect on the measured value second in the model it is assumed that the flow rates through each hole is equal despite the inevitable variations therein third the spray of water droplets formed by the jet on the curved panel is discontinuous which will cause certain fluctuations in the measured value however in any case the prediction of model on spraying force is basically acceptable to designers 5 2 spraying coverage and volume distribution of water the spraying coverage and the volume distribution of spraying water for the shower head are extremely important for water saving and personal satisfaction with the performance of the shower and there are certain requirements for this in the bathing facility standards in china and several other countries american national standards institute 2006 asme 2016 china national standardization administration 2010 for example in china the requirements for spraying coverage and water volume distribution are as follows in a circular area with a diameter of 120mm the ratio of the received water volume to the total water volume is required to be within the range of 40 70 while in a circular area with a diameter of 420mm it is required to be no less than 95 the test location is required to be 600mm from the shower panel for this reason we measured the volume distribution of spraying water from the shower the measurement is conducted in accordance with the method specified in the chinese standard gb t 23447 2009 and the measurement configuration is shown in fig 14 during the measurement a water collecting pan composed of concentric cylinders is placed directly under the shower and the water volume distribution of the shower is characterized by measuring the amount of water falling into each annular cavity of the water collecting pan over a period of time the size of the concentric cylinders is slightly different from the size specified by the chinese national standard but it will not have a substantial influence on the measured water distribution the diameter of the innermost ring is 50 8mm and the annular gap in each concentric cylinder is 25 4mm by measuring the volume of water falling into each annular gap within a given time the distribution of water in the radial direction can be obtained fig 15 depicts the comparison between the predicted and measured water volume distributions the flow rate through the shower is 5l min the size of the holes is 0 7mm and measurements are taken at 400mm from the outlet of the shower the predicted value is obtained from the distribution and number of spray holes in the shower panel predicting the trajectory of the jet for each spray hole and jet diameter from fig 15 the predicted water spraying coverage is in good agreement with the experimental results and the predicted water volume distribution is consistent with the measured results except that the water volumes within r 25 4 m m and 50 8 r 76 2 m m are somewhat different the slight difference between predicted and measured values is mainly due to a certain manufacturing error in the inclination angle of the holes we measured the inclination angle of the holes on the shower heads tested this comparison also shows that the model can be used to predict the jet trajectory of the shower nozzle 5 3 water temperature drop the water temperature during the shower is directly related to the perceived level of user satisfaction and the temperature drop of the flowing water may also involve energy consumption analysis zingano 2001 for the sake of energy conservation in china s national standards for bathroom facilities there is special requirement for the water temperature drop of the shower that is under a dynamic pressure of 0 25 0 02 m p a the water temperatures difference between locations at 150 10 m m and 750 10 m m from the shower panel cannot exceed 3 c china national standardization administration 2010 we conducted water temperature drop measurements under different conditions for a type of shower with 0 8 mm diameter holes in this experiment the water is heated to the required temperature with a bj 101 type heating rod and the temperature is controlled within 4 the temperature drop in the water flow is measured with a yet 720l type thermometer fig 16 to 0 1 c the thermometer has two probes which can be used for simultaneous measurement of the water temperature at two locations it is difficult to maintain a constant temperature in the shower we kept the water temperature in the shower to within a range of fluctuation range of less than 0 5 c during these measurements table 3 lists the measured and predicted water temperature drops under different conditions the predicted temperature drop is calculated using the average water temperature in the shower as the initial temperature from table 3 we can find that the change in the temperature drop with the flow rate and the water temperature in the shower is consistent with the measured result and the average relative error of the prediction is about 22 02 in addition we can also find that when the temperature drop is small the error in our prediction is large but for a large temperature drop the prediction is reasonable this is mainly due to uncontrollable fluctuations in the temperature of the water inside the shower resulting in a certain degree of uncertainty in the measured temperature drop for small temperature drops the uncertainty in measured values is larger in addition we can also find the temperature drop is affected by the water temperature in the shower the higher the water temperature in the shower the greater the temperature drop combined with fig 11 we can infer that the temperature drop from the shower head will be greater when the water temperature in the shower is high the spray holes are small and the flow rate is large a larger temperature drop induces a greater loss of thermal energy from the hot water therefore the temperature drop for the shower should be minimized to save energy based on the comparison of measured and predicted data the predictive model of the outflow parameters is deemed satisfactory for design purposes the model can be used to let the designer know in advance whether the designed shower head can meet the relevant national standards in addition the performance of the designed shower head can also be evaluated in terms of water and energy conservation and user satisfaction 6 conclusions lagrangian cv element integration method is used to establish a theoretical model describing the motion of the jet and the spraying force of the spraying orifice of the shower the model can realize the prediction of the relevant outflow parameters of the shower head such as the spraying force the temperature drop in the flow and the volume distribution of the spray the measured data show that the predicted results arising from use of the model are consistent with the measured results the average discrepancies in the predicted spraying force and temperature drop are 24 and 22 respectively deemed acceptable to the designer the predicted and measured results show that the spraying force is affected by the initial momentum of jet and gravity for a shower with a higher flow rate and a smaller hole diameter the jet has greater initial momentum and the contribution of the initial momentum to the spraying force is the dominant factor at this time as the distance from the shower panel increases as the surrounding air is continuously entrained the momentum is gradually dissipated and the spraying force will gradually decrease for a shower with a larger hole size and a smaller flow rate the initial momentum of the jet is smaller and the effects of gravity become more apparent at this time as the distance from the shower panel increases the jet will gradually accelerate so that the spraying force will gradually increase understanding the change in spraying force is conducive to obtaining a satisfying shower for the variation in temperature of water jet the predicted and measured results show that the flow rate and the hole size have a certain influence on the temperature attenuation of the water jet as the flow rate increases the attenuation of the water temperature will increase with the vertical distance from the holes the temperature drop for the shower with larger spraying holes is significantly lower than that for the shower with smaller spraying holes in addition the greater the difference between the water temperature in the shower and the ambient air temperature the larger the temperature drop in the water jet understanding the temperature change of the water jet is helpful to the energy saving design of such showers using the predictive model other parameters of the jet for shower are also simulated such as jet trajectory velocity and jet diameter the influences of flow rate and hole size of the shower on these parameters are investigated

16802,the suspended sludge and carrier attached biofilms of three different hybrid moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr systems were investigated with respect to their transformation potential for a broad range of micropollutants mps as well as their microbial community composition for this purpose laboratory scale batch experiments were conducted with the separated suspended sludge and the carrier attached biofilm of every system in triplicate for all batches the removal of 31 mps as well as the composition of the microbial community were analyzed the carrier attached biofilms from two hybrid mbbr systems showed a significant higher overall transformation potential in comparison to the respective suspended sludge especially for the mps trimethoprim diclofenac mecoprop climbazole and the human metabolite 10 11 dihydro 10 hydroxycarbamazepine consistently higher pseudo first order transformation rates could be observed in all three systems the analysis of the taxonomic composition revealed taxa showing higher relative abundances in the carrier attached biofilms e g nitrospirae and chloroflexi and in the suspended biomasses e g bacteroidetes and betaproteobacteria correlations of the biodiversity indices and the mp biotransformation rates resulted in significant positive associations for 11 compounds in suspended sludge but mostly negative associations for the carrier attached biofilms the distinct differences in mp removal between suspended sludge and carrier attached biofilm of the three different mbbr systems were also reflected by a statistically significant link between the occurrence of specific bacterial taxa acidibacter nitrospira and rhizomicrobium and mp transformation rates of certain mps even though the identified correlations might not necessarily be of causal nature some of the identified taxa might serve as suitable indicators for the transformation potential of suspended sludge or carrier attached biofilms graphical abstract

introduction municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps using conventional activated sludge cas primarily have the purpose to exploit the activity of microbial communities for the oxidation of carbon and ammonia reduction of nitrate and in some plants the accumulation of phosphate however the effluents of conventional wwtps still contain numerous micropollutants mps such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps which are continuously released into the aquatic environment richardson and ternes 2014 garcia rodriguez et al 2014 some of these compounds such as the non steroidal anti inflammatory agent diclofenac have been shown to cause adverse effects in aquatic organisms and thus pose a serious threat for the aquatic environment mehinto et al 2010 this urges the need for engineering solutions to improve the removal of mps in wwtps luo et al 2014 grandclément et al 2017 zupanc et al 2013 petrie et al 2014 advanced physico chemical treatment options in particular ozonation and activated carbon treatment turned out to be very effective options to considerably decrease the concentrations of a broad range of mps and already have been installed in several municipal wwtps le paulouë and langlais 1999 geering 1999 eggen et al 2014 however the use of ozonation is still under debate since oxidative transformation products tps and depending on the composition of the wastewater also known toxic by products such as bromate and ndma can be formed joss et al 2008 von gunten and hoigne 1994 oya et al 2008 to reduce the risks accompanied by tps and by products ozonation steps are usually operated with subsequent post treatments such as sand filtration or activated carbon treatment bourgin et al 2018 couto et al 2019 reungoat et al 2012 even though advanced treatment by ozonation or activated carbon treatment are more effective biofilm based treatment processes like the moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr technology might also be an option for an improved mp removal and have already been applied in various wastewater treatment configurations kermani et al 2008 rusten et al 2006 ødegaard 2006 in mbbr systems the biomass consists of suspended sludge and biofilms growing on small plastic carrier elements that are kept in constant motion in a continuously mixed bioreactor di trapani et al 2008 the carriers provide a surface area for attachment of slower growing bacteria phanwilai et al 2020 which enhances the development of a specific microbial community di trapani et al 2013 and increases the biotransformation of a number of mps compared to cas helness and ødegaard 1999 mazioti et al 2017 a combination of the mbbr technology and cas treatment is called integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas progress or hybrid mbbr and can be operated either in parallel or in series mannina and viviani 2009 krzeminski et al 2012 the ability to retrofit existing cas configurations is a significant advantage of hybrid mbbr systems other advantages of the hybrid mbbr compared to the stand alone mbbr is the presence of a significant suspended growth biomass population johnson et al 2007 a lower membrane surface requirement and a continuous operation at optimal conditions which results in energy efficient operation lariyah et al 2016 al rekabi 2015 tee et al 2016 several studies investigated the potential of mp transformation in hybrid mbbr systems and presented for various compounds considerably higher removal rates with carrier attached biofilm than with the suspended activated sludge with sludge retention times srt of 3 to maximal 12 days falås et al 2013 jewell et al 2016b henning et al 2019 casas et al 2015 nevertheless knowledge about the transformation potential of carrier attached biofilms in comparison to suspended sludge and to which extent this potential is comparable between different hybrid mbbrs is still scarce moreover so far only little is known about microbial community characteristics of carrier attached biofilms even though it can be expected to be a main driver for an enhanced mp removal some authors investigated the microbial community composition but without considering mp removal zhou et al 2018 fu et al 2010 biswas et al 2014 even though several authors explicitly stated the need for a more profound understanding of the role of the microbial community for mp transformation nguyen et al 2021 henning et al 2019 shao et al 2018 ribera pi et al 2020 to our knowledge so far only three studies directly compared the mp transformation potential with the microbial composition or the diversity of the predominant microbial community of carrier attached biofilms torresi et al 2016 for example analyzed the impact of biofilm thickness on mp biotransformation nitrification and biodiversity they have shown that by using a thicker biofilm 500 μm microbial biodiversity increased and the biotransformation kinetics of more than 60 of the targeted compounds were maximized in a subsequent study they investigated the biofilm structure and diversity in a three stage mbbr system compared to a single stage configuration and their relationship to microbial functions torresi et al 2018 a first statistical evaluation of the relationship of different taxa from an mbbr carrier attached biofilm with mp transformation was performed by liang et al 2021 they analyzed the relationship between the biofilm community and the mp removal in an mbbr during a feast famine regime with the result that 88 taxonomic groups were identified as potential biomarkers for the transformation of certain mps however while these three named studies investigated the carrier attached biofilm no study is known to us investigating the transformation potential for a broad range of mps as well as the microbial community composition including the biodiversity of both the carrier attached biofilm and the suspended sludge from different hybrid mbbrs using carrier attached biofilms and the corresponding suspended sludge from different hybrid mbbrs gives the opportunity to directly compare the transformation potential and microbial composition of carrier attached biofilms and suspended sludge taken from the same reactor without the influence of different wastewater compositions and treatment conditions therefore the objectives of the present study were i to compare the transformation potential of the carrier attached biofilm and the suspended sludge of three hybrid mbbr systems in their removal of 31 mps under controlled laboratory conditions ii to analyze the predominant microbial communities of the carrier attached biofilm and the suspended sludge with regard to biodiversity microbial composition and the identification of specialized and core organisms by 16s rrna amplicon sequencing iii to identify relationships between mp transformation and the microbial communities of the corresponding matrices 2 material and methods 2 1 characteristics of wwtps and sampling of biomass carriers suspended sludge and effluent for the lab experiments were collected from two full scale hybrid mbbrs and one bench scale sequencing batch reactor sbr system one full scale hybrid mbbr mbbr 1 is part of a wwtp located in bad ragaz switzerland which receives primarily domestic wastewater with a load of 25 500 population equivalents pe and an average influent volume of 3 200 m³ d the biological activated sludge treatment with simultaneous p precipitation of this wwtp is divided into two equally sized lines each separated into three compartments with an effective volumetric ratio of 1 5 3 the first two compartments consist of a denitrifying compartment and a following aerobic compartment 2 mg l o2 without carriers falås et al 2013 the third compartment with a higher aeration rate 3 mg l o2 was operated as a hybrid mbbr mbbr 1 filled with activated sludge and carrier materials anoxkaldnes biofilmchip m sweden with a filling ratio of 35 both biomasses were used for biomass sampling the second full scale hybrid mbbr mbbr 2 is part of a wwtp located in klippan sweden which treats municipal wastewater with a load of 13 000 pe similar to the wwtp in bad ragaz the biological activated sludge treatment stage of the klippan wwtp with simultaneous p precipitation is also divided into two similarly dimensioned lines each consisting of four compartments the first two compartments of each line are operated as anoxic denitrification steps with added industrial potato residues as an additional carbon source followed by an aerobic sludge compartment 2 mg

consisted of two fully automated sbrs with a volume of 12 liters each both reactors alternated between nitrifying 2 3 hydraulic retention time hrt and denitrifying 1 3 hrt conditions in each cycle the first reactor was operated as cas treatment with 12 h hrt and 12 d srt and was fed with the effluent of the primary clarifier of the wwtp in koblenz germany 220 000 pe 60 000 m³ d the effluent of this reactor was transferred into the second reactor which was additionally equipped with carriers anoxkaldnes k1 sweden 35 filling ratio and operated with 2 5 d hrt and 12 d srt biomass for batch

supporting information figure s1 as an overview table 1 summarizes the investigated systems characteristics 2 2 batch experiments lab scale batch experiments were performed with the separated suspended sludge and the carrier attached biofilm of every system in triplicate in 200 ml schott glass bottles the amount of suspended sludge as well as the number of carriers added to the corresponding effluent was adjusted to a biomass of 1 g l and the final volume of each batch was 100 ml the batches were continuously shaken 100 rpm and purged with air to establish oxic conditions the oxygen concentration was controlled intermittently throughout the experiment and was always 7 mg l data not shown a compound mixture with 31 mps table s1 dissolved in deionized water was added to each batch to achieve a spiking concentration of 1 µg l over 72 h samples for mp analysis were withdrawn from the batches at regular intervals resulting in 10 sampling points the samples were

using an illumina miseq in paired end mode 2 250 bp 2 4 data processing after a quality check with solexaqa software cox et al 2010 paired end reads were binned with pear software zhang et al 2014 and demultiplexed in the following the sequences were processed on the mothur platform schloss et al 2009 according to the miseq sop kozich et al 2013 in short sequences were filtered by removing sequences with ambiguous base calls and homopolymers longer than 8 nt and then aligned with the silva database v128 quast et al 2013 subsequently the vsearch algorithm rognes et al 2016 was used for

criteria were applied on the remaining genera 70 of the cumulative contribution of the simper analysis present in all three sludge or carrier attached systems and a minimum relative abundance of 0 05 2 5 micropollutant analysis the 31 spiked mps were analyzed by lc ms ms using an agilent 1260 lc coupled to a sciex qtrap 5500 ms according to the method previously described by falås et al 2016 the samples were measured with direct injection without further pretreatment biological transformation rate constants kbiol were estimated assuming first order kinetics and negligible sorption according to eq 1 whereby s is the mp concentration µg l xbiomass the biomass concentration g l and kbiol is the pseudo first order rate constant in l g d 1 d s d t k b i o l x b i o m a s s s biomass concentrations xbiomass were measured as suspended solids for the sludge and as biofilm solids for the carriers the suspended solids concentration was calculated according to european standard en 872 by the difference in weight of filtered samples using gf 6 glass fiber filter 1 6 µm vwr before and after heating at 105 c for 12 h biofilm solids were estimated from the weight difference of three dried carriers 105 c for 12 h in three replicates before and after removal of the biofilm biofilm of the colonized carriers was removed by ultrasonication in hcl 3 m followed by thorough brushing with soapy and deionized water modified from falås et al 2012 the residual percentage of each mp was calculated according to eq 2 by comparing the start ct 0h and end ct 72h concentration of the respective substance 2 r e s i d u a l c t 72 h c t 0 h 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 micropollutant transformation and kinetics lab scale batch experiments with either suspended sludge or carriers collected from the three mbbr systems 1 3 were carried out in triplicate to investigate the transformation of 31 mps table s1 mp concentration in the corresponding biomass samples was acquired over 72 h via lc ms ms and residual percentages were calculated according to eq 2 table s2 the selected target compounds feature a relatively high polarity and for several of them sludge wastewater distribution coefficients have been reported to be considerably below 500 l kg ternes et al 2004 hence even though not for all compounds an influence of sorption to the suspended solids or the carrier attached biofilms can be completely excluded the observed removal could mainly be attributed to transformation processes to elucidate specific differences in mp transformation efficiency between the six different biomasses from the three systems biomass normalized kbiol of all mps were calculated table s3 the median of the kbiol of the 31 mps was between 0 12 mbbr 2 and 0 16 l g d mbbr 3 for the suspended sludge and between 0 14 and 0 43 l g d for the carrier attached biofilms fig 1 applying a kruskal wallis test significant differences chi² 20 44 p 0 01 on kbiol values were found among the six biomasses from the three systems for both mbbr 1 and mbbr 2 the carrier attached biomasses performed significantly better tukey post hoc test z 2 83 p 0 01 than the suspended sludge from the same system suggesting an increased potential for mp transformation the median as well as the mean of the kbiol values determined in the batch with carriers from mbbr 1 were more than three times higher than in the batch with the corresponding suspended sludge moreover kbiol from this batch was about two times higher than in the batches with the carriers from the other two systems which indicates a considerably high transformation potential of the carrier attached biomass of mbbr 1 consistent with the increased kbiol values of the carrier attached biomasses from mbbr 1 and mbbr 2 the median of the kbiol determined for the carrier attached biomass from mbbr 3 was also higher than that determined for the corresponding suspended sludge however in case of mbbr 3 the difference on rate constants could not be confirmed to be statistically significant this might be explained by the considerably higher srt in mbbr 3 12 d compared to mbbr 1 3 d and mbbr 2 5 d the analysis of the 31 spiked mps revealed that five compounds were persistent upon incubation 20 transformation in all batch experiments table s3 carbamazepine cbz diatrizoate venlafaxine fluconazole and primidone this is in accordance with other studies investigating the biological transformation of those compounds during biological wastewater treatment kaiser et al 2014 kormos et al 2010 ternes 1998 schlüsener et al 2015 these compounds were not taken into consideration for the further assessment of the investigated biological treatment systems for a more compound specific comparison of sludge vs carrier mediated transformation performance the kbiol of the individual degradable mps in sludge and carrier containing batches were compared for each individual systems by student s t test normal distribution of kbiol replicates was assumed significant differences p 0 05 between the rate constants determined in batches with sludge kbiol sludge and carriers kbiol carriers are shown in fig 2 for each system according to the following eq 3 k b i o l s l u d g e k b i o l c a r r i e r 2 k b i o l d i f f e r e n c e the non persistent mps could be categorized into four groups according to the difference in their kbiol in sludge and carrier containing batches a statistically significantly higher values in batches with carrier attached biomass in at least two of the three systems b statistically significantly higher values in batches with suspended sludge in at least two of the three systems c no clear trend but statistically significantly higher values in batches with suspended sludge from one system and carrier attached biofilm from another system d no significant values in at least two of the three systems in detail group a consisted of 12 compounds trimethoprim tmp diclofenac dcf mecoprop mcpp climbazole clz 10 11 dihydro 10 hydroxycarbamazepine dhh cbz 2 hydroxycarbamazepine 2 oh cbz 3 hydroxycarbamazepine 3 oh cbz codeine cod iopromide ipm oxazepam ozp erythromycin ery and 10 11 dihydro 10 11 dihydroxycarbamazepine dh dh cbz these mps revealed significantly increased transformation efficiencies in carrier attached biofilms compared to suspended sludges from at least two of the three wastewater treatment systems strikingly five of those compounds namely tmp dcf mcpp clz and dhh cbz even showed significantly higher kbiol in reactions with carrier associated biofilm from all three systems 0 2 11 l g d higher for the compounds tmp and dcf these results were in accordance with previous studies reporting an improved transformation by attached compared to suspended biomasses falås et al 2013 zupanc et al 2013 falås et al 2012 jewell et al 2016b except for climbazole which is known to be transformed by a hydrogenation of the keto group brienza and chiron 2017 all other compounds of the aforementioned five compounds from group a have been reported to be transformed by oxidative reactions while tmp and mcpp can be primarily transformed by an oxidative dealkylation of the phenoxy group jewell et al 2016a juhler et al 2001 hydroxylation reactions have been described to be one of the major primary reactions leading to transformation of dcf jewell et al 2016b and dhh cbz kaiser et al 2014 this might be an indication that independently of the specific mbbr system carrier attached biofilms facilitate especially the removal of compounds transformed by oxidative transformation reactions interestingly in the batches with carrier associated biofilm from mbbr 1 kbiol of tmp dcf and mcpp were also considerably higher 11 5 7 4 7 7 l g d respectively compared to the other investigated batches with carriers from mbbr 2 0 5 0 8 0 9 l g d respectively and mbbr 3 3 0 0 7 0 6 l g d respectively this unique feature of mbbr 1 will be discussed at a later stage a correlation of the residual concentrations table s3 at each time point and for each replicate in all six batches revealed a highly comparable transformation behavior of dcf and mcpp independently of the biomass r² 0 95 table s4 this result supports similar findings of falås et al 2018 and suggests that both chlorinated aromatic compounds might be transformed by related microorganisms and or enzymes the other seven compounds of group a which displayed a faster transformation in carrier attached biofilm from only two of the three systems were the carbamazepine metabolites 3 oh cbz 2 oh cbz and dh dh cbz as well as cod ipm ozp and ery for five compounds 3 oh cbz 2 oh cbz cod ipm and dhdh cbz significantly higher kbiol values were observed only in the carrier attached biofilm from mbbr 1 and mbbr 2 this might be attributed to the low srt of the suspended sludge in these systems 5 d which is not sufficient for nitrification for ipm this would be in accordance with other studies reporting that removal of ipm is restricted to nitrifying activated sludge treatment batt et al 2006 gonzalez gil et al 2021 however for ozp and ery significant differences between suspended sludge and carrier attached biofilm was observed for both mbbr 1 lowest srt of 3 d and mbbr 3 highest srt of 12 d but not for mbbr 2 srt of 5 d this indicates that differences in the transformation potential between the suspended sludge and the carrier attached biofilms cannot solely be attributed to srt looking at the primary transformation revealed that at least for five of the above mentioned compounds removal can also be attributed to oxidative transformation reactions 2 oh cbz was found to be mainly oxidized to carbamazepine iminoquinone by dehydrogenation and cleavage of the carbamoyl moiety 3 oh cbz has been observed to be oxidized to phenoxy radicals leading to dimers and nitro derivatives brezina et al 2015 and the initial transformation reactions of dhdh cbz codeine and iopromide were reported to be dehydrogenations of alcohol moieties kaiser et al 2014 schulz et al 2008 wick et al 2011 in literature the compounds dcf tmp and ozp of group a were described as rather persistent in cas treatment kosjek et al 2012 wick et al 2009 jewell et al 2016b jewell et al 2016a their reported kbiol in batches with nitrifying activated sludge were in the same range as those determined in contact with suspended sludge from the three mbbr systems in this study the considerably higher kbiol in carrier containing batches in our study illustrate the high potential of carrier attached biofilm to transform certain compounds that are not or only to a minor extent transformed in conventional activated sludge treatment only three of in total 26 mps benzotriazole atenolol and clarithromycin were found to exhibit significantly higher transformation rates in batches with suspended sludge from at least two systems and were therefore categorized into group b fig 2 this is in accordance to the results from falås et al 2013 who observed a slightly faster transformation of atenolol as well as a significantly faster transformation of benzotriazole with the suspended sludge compared to the carrier attached biofilm taken from the hybrid biofilm activated sludge stage in mbbr 1 consistently the study of casas et al 2015 revealed only 40 removal of atenolol in a pilot plant consisting of three mbbrs in series in contrast torresi et al 2017 observed higher kbiol values in three different mbbr systems pre denitrifying nitrifying and post denitrifying compared to literature references from conventional activated sludge systems while clarithromycin showed at least for two systems a significantly faster transformation with the suspended biomass erythromycin belonging to the same class of macrolide antibiotics showed an opposing trend and was assigned to group a however the opposing transformation behavior of these structurally closely related compounds with carrier attached and suspended biomass is in accordance with the different main initial transformation reactions reported for both compounds by tezel 2017 while the main primary tps of erythromycin resulted from the cleavage of the cladinose and desosamine moieties known to be catalyzed by glycosidases the dominant tps of clarithromycin could be explained by phosphorylation of the desosamine moiety and hydrolysis of the macrolactone ring tezel 2017 no clear trend could be determined for the five compounds from group c bezafibrate acesulfame terbutryn tramadol and diuron for all these compounds kbiol were significantly higher with either carrier attached or suspended sludge when comparing mbbr 1 and mbbr 3 in batches with carrier attached biofilm from mbbr 2 no significant differences between carrier and sludge rates could be observed within group c interestingly bezafibrate group c and atenolol group b showed a different pattern in their transformation rates even though both are known to be transformed by hydrolysis of their amide moieties quintana et al 2005 radjenovic et al 2009 for the six mps of group d metoprolol acyclovir iopamidol carbendazim sotalol and sulfamethoxazole smx no significant differences in transformation rates between carrier and sludge batches could be detected in at least two of the three wastewater treatment systems comparing the iodinated x ray contrast media iopromide group a and iopamidol both have been described to be initially transformed via oxidation of a primary hydroxyl group kormos et al 2010 schulz et al 2008 yet only iopromide showed a clear trend for an enhanced transformation rate with carrier attached biofilms rather than with suspended sludge consistent with an increased transformation of iopromide by carrier attached biomass table s2 previous studies measured an increased transformation of iopromide however only minor transformation of iopamidol in staged mbbr systems casas et al 2015 tang et al 2017 in addition kovalova et al 2012 showed that the highest removal out of six different analyzed iodinated x ray contrast media icms from hospital wastewater by an membrane bioreactor mbr was for iopromide 31 while the removal was negligible for the other icms these results indicates that biofilm associated microbial communities foster specifically the transformation of iopromide but not of other structurally closely related icms as stated above the transformation of those compounds for which a clear trend of a faster transformation with the carrier attached biofilm was observed group a could be mainly attributed to oxidative reactions on the other hand the transformation efficiency seems to be rather compound specific as the example of iopamidol shows that not all oxidative transformation reactions are generally facilitated like iopamidol also benzotriazole terbutryn metoprolol acyclovir and diuron have been described in literature to be transformed by different oxidative reactions but did not show elevated transformation rates with the carrier attached biofilms however the rather consistent differences in the transformation behavior of the compounds of group a and b between carrier attached biofilms and suspended sludge from the three systems also suggest distinct differences between the microbial communities of the respective biomasses particularly the carrier attached biomass from mbbr 1 is to be highlighted as it revealed the highest averaged kbiol fig 1 as well as the highest overall transformation table s3 which argues for a specific potential of the contributing microorganisms in mp transformation 3 2 taxonomic analysis of the investigated systems 3 2 1 general description of the microbial communities in order to elucidate the described differences in mp transformation efficiency and compare them to differences in the microbial composition 16s rrna amplicon sequencing analysis of sludge and carrier samples from the three examined wastewater treatment systems was performed a first general evaluation was enabled by the calculation of three biodiversity indices the species richness h0 the shannon index h1 and the equitability j which are considered important parameters for understanding microbial community structures hernandez raquet et al 2013 wolff et al 2018 all analyzed samples shared a total number of 9688 operational taxonomic units otus with a sequence similarity of 97 which distinguishes microorganisms down to genus level here otus could be annotated to in total 975 genera at 97 sequence similarity the results for species richness and shannon index in the biomass samples from all three mbbr systems ranged from 1378 mbbr 1 sludge to 2542 mbbr 3 carrier and 4 98 mbbr 1 sludge to 6 2 mbbr 3 carrier respectively table s5 which is comparable to findings for other wastewater microbial communities reported in literature gonzalez martinez et al 2016 wang et al 2016 wolff et al 2018 johnson et al 2015 strikingly for each of the three investigated systems species richness and shannon index were statistically significantly p 0 05 student s t test higher for the carrier attached biomass over the suspended biomass with rather comparable values for equitability also the averaged biodiversity indices of the three different systems revealed higher values for carrier attached biomass compared to suspended biomass letting assume an increased biodiversity in microorganisms attached to the carriers this result complies with findings from other studies analyzing the biodiversity in biocake and aerobic mixed liquor gao et al 2014 or cas and membrane bioreactors silva et al 2010 the different microbial population dynamics could be explained by the occupation of metabolic and territorial niches on the carrier attached biofilm because of different predominant conditions such as low foot to microorganism ratio the long sludge retention or different substrate and redox gradients within the biofilm choi et al 2007 de wever et al 2007 bauer et al 2018 falås et al 2012 in total the microbial communities from all sequenced samples were composed of 63 identified prokaryotic phyla with the seven most dominant proteobacteria bacteroidetes nitrospirae actinobacteria planctomycetes chloroflexi and acidobacteria constituting a minimum of 86 in each of the analyzed biomasses fig 3 a concomitantly the highest relative abundance proportions in each investigated sample could be allocated to proteobacteria fluctuating between 43 mbbr 3 carrier and 70 mbbr 1 sludge even though the shares of phyla and classes in the biomass varied between the three wastewater treatment systems the relative differences between suspended sludge and carrier attached biomass in the same system were in most cases rather comparable table s6 six phyla and 12 classes were significantly enriched in all three carrier attached biomasses compared to the corresponding suspended biomasses while one phylum and six classes showed significantly higher relative abundances in the suspended biomasses student s t test p 0 05 for example nitrospirae on phylum level and alphaproteobacteria on class level were significantly increased in carrier attached biomasses by at least 8 relative abundance whereas bacteroidetes on phylum level and betaproteobacteria on class level were significantly increased in suspended biomasses by at least 7 5 relative abundance fig 3a on otu level a principal component analysis pca was used to visualize similarities between the microbial communities occurring in the different systems biomass matrices as well as similarities between the individual triplicates fig 3b regarding the latter the pca plot illustrates clustering of the triplicates of each biomass indicating a good comparability of the biological replicates and methodical reproducibility the separation of the carrier attached biofilm samples left side from the suspended sludge samples right side along the x axis pc 1 37 3 of variation shows that on otu level the carrier attached and the suspended sludge communities are indeed distinct in some measure in addition the samples are also distributed along the y axis pc 2 31 2 of variation according to their original system with the samples from mbbr 1 in the upper half opposite to the samples from mbbr 2 and the mbbr 3 accumulating in the lower half of the plot hence taxonomy seems to be another feature that distinguishes mbbr 1 from the other two systems further supporting the assumption that the microbial composition reflects to a certain degree the transformation potential of the investigated systems in the following particular attention will be focused on identifying relationships between mp transformation and the microbial communities of the corresponding matrices 3 2 2 classification in core and specialized communities for a more detailed analysis of specific differences between the sludge and carrier communities of the three treatment systems the assigned genera were divided into core communities mutual genera classified according to the criteria described in wolff et al 2018 and specialized communities classified as genera with 70 contribution to the dissimilarities between the investigated systems communities the core communities were determined separately for the three carrier attached biomasses and for the three suspended biomasses of the three investigated mbbrs 74 genera 8 of all genera comprising an average relative abundance of 19 8 in all carrier samples were allocated to the core community of carrier attached biomasses while 45 genera 5 of all genera comprising an average relative abundance of 12 6 in all sludge samples were allocated to the core community of suspended biomasses with both matrices sharing an overlap of 33 genera fig 4 the taxonomic groups with the highest proportion in both core communities were genera from the classes alpha and deltaproteobacteria with deltaproteobacteria displaying a rather similar relative abundance in both communities in line with this most of the 33 genera shared in sludge and carrier core communities e g bdellovibrio phaselicystis and nannocystis also belong to the class of deltaproteobacteria and have been described as prevalent organisms in soil as well as in activated sludge brinkhoff et al 2012 this suggests that these genera can be defined as ubiquitous generalists occurring likely independently of the predominant process conditions in both suspended sludge and carrier attached biofilm alphaproteobacteria on the other hand could be shown to be more prevailing in the core community of the carrier attached biofilms about 3 7 times the relative abundance a major part of the obtained genera within the class of alphaproteobacteria belongs to the orders rhizobiales e g devosia mesorhizobium or variibacter and sphingomonadales e g sphingobium zymomonas or sphingomonas while genera of the order rhizobiales are known to fix nitrogen fischer 1994 the genus sphingomonas within the order of sphingomonadales has been described to have a general high potential of degrading a wide variety of carbon sources including pesticides or other xenobiotics aylward et al 2013 stolz et al 2000 sasaki et al 2005 leys et al 2004 in particular it was found that species of this genus are capable of degrading both enantiomers of the chiral herbicide mecoprop zipper et al 1996 nielsen et al 2013 which is in accordance with the more than six times higher average relative abundance of sphingomonas and the significantly faster transformation of mecoprop in batches with the carrier attached biofilms besides also genera with exclusive presence in one or the other core community were identified such as 41 genera exclusively present in the core community of the carrier attached biomass a considerably higher number compared to only 12 genera which were specific for the core community of the suspended sludge additionally the carrier core community comprised eight phyla abundance proportion of 3 2 solely found in the carrier community together with the results mentioned above it can be assumed that the core community of the three carrier attached biomasses was more diverse which might also increase the number of potential metabolic pathways to transform mps based on a simper analysis the 69 genera that exhibit the highest variation in relative abundance between the different batches were defined as specialized community fig 5 in general about half of the taxa annotated as specialized community revealed no clear tendency to occur predominantly in the suspended or carrier attached biomass fig 5 first section whereas the other half 51 showed a significantly p 0 05 student s t test higher relative abundance in either suspended 21 genera or carrier attached 14 genera biomass in each of the three systems fig 5 second or third section respectively table s7 remarkably genera of phyla or classes that had been found to be enriched in certain biomasses fig 3a such as nitrospirae and alphaproteobacteria for carrier attached biofilms or bacteroidetes and betaproteobacteria for suspended sludge were confirmed as specialized community and were increased in the corresponding biomass although genera in the first section of fig 5 did not show a significant tendency towards a certain biomass matrix there were specific enrichments in individual systems or single matrices detected of which the most striking will be included in the following interpretations one third of the genera with a significantly increased relative abundance in the suspended sludge biomasses belonged to the class of betaproteobacteria followed by sphingobacteriia 19 mostly annotated only to the family level fig 5 second section table s7 concomitantly the families comamonadaceae and saprospiraceae within these classes exhibited the in average highest differences in relative abundance between the sludge and the respective carrier samples 3 7 and 2 2 respectively the most significant genera to be dominant in suspended sludge samples were characterized as aerobic denitrifying bacteria e g rhodoferax lamia or zoogloea as well as bacteria responsible for phosphorus removal e g dechloromonas candidatus microthrix besides also filamentous organisms like haliscomenobacter or candidatus microthrix known to be responsible for sludge separation problems were found to be elevated in the sludge s specialized community the presence of the named genera is typical for the microbial community of cas treatment and comparable with other studies wagner et al 2002 zhao et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 mcilroy et al 2016 nevertheless certain genera displayed a very specific dominance in individual samples as for instance the actinobacterial tetrasphaera being highly enriched in the suspended sludge sample from mbbr 2 or the quite uncharacterized genus chiayiivirga of the family xanthomonadaceae in sludge from mbbr 3 from the same family also the genus thermomonas showed an explicit preference for one sample and was mainly detected in suspended sludge from mbbr 1 the fact that also the abundance of the genera haliangium dechloromonas and zoogloea was shifted towards the sludge from mbbr 1 might explain the separation of this sample from the other sludge samples in the otu based pca fig 3b most of the significantly higher abundant genera in the carrier attached biofilms of the three systems were assigned to aerobic heterotrophic organisms additionally it could be confirmed that carrier attached biofilms seem to promote slow growing organisms like nitrospira doubling time from 13 to 43 h or hyphomicrobium doubling time approx 9 h as well as dimorphic prosthecate bacteria dpb such as woodsholea hyphomicrobium and pedomicrobium badger et al 2006 nowka et al 2015 fig 5 third section dpb are alphaproteobacteria that reproduce in an asymmetric manner rather than by binary fission resulting in a non motile form which has the ability to adhere strongly to surfaces and form biofilms badger et al 2006 the relative abundances of hyphomicrobium rhizomicrobium as well as pedomicrobium all belonging to the order rhizobiales were on average three times higher in the carrier attached biomasses in comparison to the corresponding suspended biomasses consistently hyphomicrobium and rhizomicrobium were also found among the 20 most abundant genera in carrier attached biofilms by cimbritz et al 2019 especially hyphomicrobium an aerobic chemoorganotrophic facultative methylotrophic and denitrifying genus has been described as an important organism associated with mp transformation many species of this genus are able to mineralize pollutants such as aromatic hydrocarbons methyl chloride and various alcohols including methanol badger et al 2006 besides also taxa responsible for cycling iron were found to be generally enriched in all carrier samples such as pedomicrobium rhizomicrobium and acidibacter while pedomicrobium was characterized as a ubiquitous aerobic and heterotrophic genus able to precipitate or oxidize iron bilyy et al 2011 gebers and beese 1988 the anaerobic genera rhizomicrobium and acidibacter in contrast were described as iron reducing bacteria falagán and johnson 2014 ueki et al 2010 the presence of these genera indicates the presence of strong redox gradients in the carrier attached biofilms thus also gradients for the availability of carbon and nitrogen can be assumed this might facilitate biodiversity and to some extent also the capability for degrading relatively recalcitrant mps johnson et al 2014 johnson et al 2015 the predominant redox conditions and the important role for the mp transformation was also described in other studies wolff et al 2018 torresi et al 2019 falås et al 2013 and confirmed the results particularly to be highlighted was also the relative abundance of the nitrifying genus nitrospira being on average seven times higher in the carrier samples compared to the respective sludge samples in the biomass of the carriers from mbbr 1 nitrospira contributed even up to 20 of the whole community and was considerably higher abundant than in the biomasses from the carriers of the other two systems this might also explain the observed separation of the carrier biomasses in the pca fig 3b the otus of this genus could even be annotated down to species level to candidatus nitrospira nitrificans 99 2 sequence identity database ezbiocloud version 2019 05 31 this species belongs to the comammox organisms complete ammonia oxidizer that are able to perform a complete nitrification as they express enzymes for both ammonia and nitrite oxidation to convert ammonia to nitrate the first step oxidation of ammonia to nitrite is catalyzed by the enzyme ammonia monooxygenase amo in comammox organisms as well as in ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob in an environment like the carrier attached biofilm however the growth of comammox bacteria such as the slow growing candidatus nitrospira nitrificans is favored due to the formation of niches and gradients with specific oxygen or nitrite concentrations sobotka et al 2018 in chemostats and well mixed systems like activated sludge treatment on the other hand aobs outcompete the comammox bacteria resulting in their low observed abundances in the sludge samples in general a positive relationship between nitrification and the transformation of certain mps has been discussed xu et al 2016 sathyamoorthy et al 2013 helbling et al 2012 achermann et al 2018 hence based on this literature a specific positive relationship between the high relative abundances of the nitrifying species candidatus nitrospira nitrificans and the relatively high potential of the investigated carrier attached biofilms to transform some compounds known to be initially transformed by oxidative reactions might be assumed but needs to be investigated further some studies explained the positive relationship between nitrifying activity and transformation potential with the ability of the relatively unspecific enzyme amo to co oxidize for example aromatic compounds probably via hydroxylation reactions khunjar et al 2011 yi and harper 2007 yu et al 2018 in contrast the results of achermann et al 2018 pointed toward a non causal relationship as they observed that trends of an increased mp removal at higher srts accompanied by higher nitrifying activity were hardly impeded when the amo enzyme was inhibited 3 3 comparison of the systems microbial communities with their micropollutant removal having elucidated the mp transformation potential of different carrier attached biofilms and the corresponding suspended sludge as well as the details of the taxonomic composition of the investigated matrices we aimed at examining whether there is a general calculable link between these two results first we questioned if biodiversity can be correlated to mp removal in particular to the measured kbiol since only three systems were analyzed the validity of a statistical test is restricted n 3 when correlating pearson product moment correlation the obtained kbiol median or mean of every analyzed mp to the mentioned biodiversity indices for all samples both matrices no significant correlations could be observed data not shown however when performing the correlation separately for the carrier and the sludge values significant results could be obtained table s8 for the suspended sludge calculations resulted in general in positive correlations between kbiol and biodiversity indices significant correlation of the mean kbiol r 0 79 p 0 05 in detail 12 out of 26 non persistent mps showed a significant correlation between transformation performance and at least two biodiversity indices with all being positive except for benzotriazole this result supports the findings from other studies indicating a positive association of the microbial biodiversity and the mp biotransformation rate of specific compounds in conventional biological wastewater treatment johnson et al 2015 torresi et al 2016 stadler and love 2016 in contrast kbiol and biodiversity of the carrier attached biomass correlated generally negatively significant correlation of mean kbiol r 0 93 p 0 05 here too 12 mps displayed a significant correlation to at least two biodiversity indices this included compounds like tmp dcf and mcpp which were detected to be transformed faster in carrier samples these results were in accordance with the overall negative correlations pearson product moment correlation of three stage and single stage mbbr systems as observed by torresi et al 2018 one explanation for the negative correlations could be that rather few but abundant organisms such as nitrospira were decisive for the increased transformation of certain mps the results of the present correlations indicate that biodiversity is an important parameter when describing microbial communities however since for the current study correlations could only be performed for data from three different systems results on the influence of biodiversity on the transformation potential of carriers and suspended sludge in hybrid mbbrs need to be further confirmed by follow up studies these studies should also include sludge from cas systems covering different srts and biofilms from stand alone mbbrs since literature has already shown an influence of srt on the microbial diversity which in turn can influence the transformation potential sun et al 2020 next we performed a mantel test to investigate the relationship of kbiol and relative abundances of taxa for both otu and genus level the resulting significant correlations r 0 78 p 0 001 for both cases support the hypothesis of a clear link between the transformation potential and the microbial community composition a canonical correspondence analysis cca was further used to correlate independent metric variables here kbiol of the analyzed mps with the relative abundances of the 69 genera defined as specialized community of the different batches the tri plot fig 6 summarizes the result of the cca and displays how the specialized community was organized with respect to mp transformation rates by finding features that are statistically significant in terms of explaining the covariance between the given sets of variables the percentage variance of axis 1 horizontally and axis 2 vertically are 30 and 27 respectively in accordance with the pca plot of the microbial community on otu level fig 3b the mbbr 1 upper half and its biomass carrier attached left suspended sludge right are clearly separated from the other two systems lower half in addition also a distinct differentiation could be observed for the sludge from the mbbr 2 in contrast the triplicates of the mbbr 3 suspended sludge grouped with the carrier attached samples of mbbr 3 and 2 the kbiol of terbutryn benzotriazole and tramadol exhibited the strongest associations with the community composition in the suspended sludge samples of mbbr 1 and genera such as thermomonas zoogloea and dokdonella the other suspended sludge samples mbbr 2 and 3 correlated not at all or negatively with the mps and were characterized by the prevalence of taxa like tetrasphaera or saprospiraceae described in previous chapters in accordance with the results of chapter 3 1 most mps including trimethoprim or diclofenac correlated significantly with the composition of the carrier attached biomass of all systems especially with mbbr 1 in addition the relative abundance of genera like acidibacter nitrospira and rhizomicrobium see chapter 3 2 2 resulted in a correlation with the named mps and showed a statistical dependence the results were in accordance with some indicator taxa found by liang et al 2021 for example the genus tk10 has in both studies a highly positive correlation with the kbiol values of sotalol this is also true for the genus planctomyces or members of the order rhizobiales which resulted in good correlations with the kbiol values of diclofenac liang et al 2021 even though this does not necessarily point to a causal relationship these organisms might be rated as biological indicators for the improved transformation of the associated mps in carrier attached biofilms 3 4 practical implications most mps in group a were transformed considerably faster by the carrier attached biofilm compared to the suspended sludge from the two full scale wwtps with low srt of 3 and 5 days fig 2 this indicates that retrofitting of activated sludge processes with low nitrification capacities by the addition of carriers could also improve the mp removal in particular the microbial communities of the carrier attached biofilms seem to have a high potential for an increased transformation of mps transformed by oxidative reactions one prominent example of these mps is diclofenac whose proposed annual average environmental quality standard concentration of 50 ng l is considerably exceeded in many european waters because of its recalcitrance or only minor removal in conventional wwtps loos et al 2018 from a practical perspective this upgrading method is particularly interesting for wwtps in confined areas where space is rather scarce and discharge demands must be met with existing reactor volumes furthermore the study confirmed the hypotheses that common characteristics in the transformation potential of suspended sludge and carrier attached biofilms from hybrid mbbrs are linked to distinct differences in their microbial community composition this is of practical relevance as the understanding of relationships between the transformation performance and specific indicator organisms could foster the optimization and control of hybrid mbbrs but also of biological treatment processes in general nonetheless more studies are needed to investigate the direct role of particular organisms such as the above mentioned genera acidibacter or rhizomicrobium in mp transformation as well as their suitability as indicators of favorable environment conditions for the transformation of certain mps moreover follow up studies are needed to investigate to which extent the results from hybrid mbbrs can also be transferred to general differences between activated sludge and carrier attached biofilms 4 conclusions biofilms from three hybrid mbbr systems showed a significantly higher transformation potential for several mps known to be transformed by oxidative reactions e g tmp dcf mcpp and dhh cbz in comparison with the respective suspended sludge indicating that carrier attached biofilms have in general a higher potential for oxidatively degrading certain mps while for 11 of 31 examined mps transformation was observed to be more effective in batches with carrier attached biofilms only for few mps benzotriazole clarithromycin and atenolol the transformation rates were found to be higher in batches with suspended sludge this supports an overall higher transformation potential of the carrier attached biofilms but also highlights compound specific differences the specific prevalent conditions within carrier attached biofilms lead to the establishment of a biocenosis which was characterized by certain high abundant taxa as well as by a proportionally larger and more diverse core community compared to the suspended sludge together with an increased transformation efficiency this might entail a higher metabolic diversity of carrier attached microorganisms to co metabolize a larger number of organic compounds the difference in microbial composition of carrier attached and suspended biomasses could be mainly attributed to a specialized community of 69 genera for some of them especially acidibacter nitrospira and rhizomicrobium a statistically significant link between their relative abundance and the transformation rates of specific mps could be observed this indicates that only a few specialists may contribute to the variety in mp transformation between carrier attached biofilm and suspended sludge and that these taxa bear the potential to serve as indicator organisms for a high mp transformation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

16802,the suspended sludge and carrier attached biofilms of three different hybrid moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr systems were investigated with respect to their transformation potential for a broad range of micropollutants mps as well as their microbial community composition for this purpose laboratory scale batch experiments were conducted with the separated suspended sludge and the carrier attached biofilm of every system in triplicate for all batches the removal of 31 mps as well as the composition of the microbial community were analyzed the carrier attached biofilms from two hybrid mbbr systems showed a significant higher overall transformation potential in comparison to the respective suspended sludge especially for the mps trimethoprim diclofenac mecoprop climbazole and the human metabolite 10 11 dihydro 10 hydroxycarbamazepine consistently higher pseudo first order transformation rates could be observed in all three systems the analysis of the taxonomic composition revealed taxa showing higher relative abundances in the carrier attached biofilms e g nitrospirae and chloroflexi and in the suspended biomasses e g bacteroidetes and betaproteobacteria correlations of the biodiversity indices and the mp biotransformation rates resulted in significant positive associations for 11 compounds in suspended sludge but mostly negative associations for the carrier attached biofilms the distinct differences in mp removal between suspended sludge and carrier attached biofilm of the three different mbbr systems were also reflected by a statistically significant link between the occurrence of specific bacterial taxa acidibacter nitrospira and rhizomicrobium and mp transformation rates of certain mps even though the identified correlations might not necessarily be of causal nature some of the identified taxa might serve as suitable indicators for the transformation potential of suspended sludge or carrier attached biofilms graphical abstract

introduction municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps using conventional activated sludge cas primarily have the purpose to exploit the activity of microbial communities for the oxidation of carbon and ammonia reduction of nitrate and in some plants the accumulation of phosphate however the effluents of conventional wwtps still contain numerous micropollutants mps such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps which are continuously released into the aquatic environment richardson and ternes 2014 garcia rodriguez et al 2014 some of these compounds such as the non steroidal anti inflammatory agent diclofenac have been shown to cause adverse effects in aquatic organisms and thus pose a serious threat for the aquatic environment mehinto et al 2010 this urges the need for engineering solutions to improve the removal of mps in wwtps luo et al 2014 grandclément et al 2017 zupanc et al 2013 petrie et al 2014 advanced physico chemical treatment options in particular ozonation and activated carbon treatment turned out to be very effective options to considerably decrease the concentrations of a broad range of mps and already have been installed in several municipal wwtps le paulouë and langlais 1999 geering 1999 eggen et al 2014 however the use of ozonation is still under debate since oxidative transformation products tps and depending on the composition of the wastewater also known toxic by products such as bromate and ndma can be formed joss et al 2008 von gunten and hoigne 1994 oya et al 2008 to reduce the risks accompanied by tps and by products ozonation steps are usually operated with subsequent post treatments such as sand filtration or activated carbon treatment bourgin et al 2018 couto et al 2019 reungoat et al 2012 even though advanced treatment by ozonation or activated carbon treatment are more effective biofilm based treatment processes like the moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr technology might also be an option for an improved mp removal and have already been applied in various wastewater treatment configurations kermani et al 2008 rusten et al 2006 ødegaard 2006 in mbbr systems the biomass consists of suspended sludge and biofilms growing on small plastic carrier elements that are kept in constant motion in a continuously mixed bioreactor di trapani et al 2008 the carriers provide a surface area for attachment of slower growing bacteria phanwilai et al 2020 which enhances the development of a specific microbial community di trapani et al 2013 and increases the biotransformation of a number of mps compared to cas helness and ødegaard 1999 mazioti et al 2017 a combination of the mbbr technology and cas treatment is called integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas progress or hybrid mbbr and can be operated either in parallel or in series mannina and viviani 2009 krzeminski et al 2012 the ability to retrofit existing cas configurations is a significant advantage of hybrid mbbr systems other advantages of the hybrid mbbr compared to the stand alone mbbr is the presence of a significant suspended growth biomass population johnson et al 2007 a lower membrane surface requirement and a continuous operation at optimal conditions which results in energy efficient operation lariyah et al 2016 al rekabi 2015 tee et al 2016 several studies investigated the potential of mp transformation in hybrid mbbr systems and presented for various compounds considerably higher removal rates with carrier attached biofilm than with the suspended activated sludge with sludge retention times srt of 3 to maximal 12 days falås et al 2013 jewell et al 2016b henning et al 2019 casas et al 2015 nevertheless knowledge about the transformation potential of carrier attached biofilms in comparison to suspended sludge and to which extent this potential is comparable between different hybrid mbbrs is still scarce moreover so far only little is known about microbial community characteristics of carrier attached biofilms even though it can be expected to be a main driver for an enhanced mp removal some authors investigated the microbial community composition but without considering mp removal zhou et al 2018 fu et al 2010 biswas et al 2014 even though several authors explicitly stated the need for a more profound understanding of the role of the microbial community for mp transformation nguyen et al 2021 henning et al 2019 shao et al 2018 ribera pi et al 2020 to our knowledge so far only three studies directly compared the mp transformation potential with the microbial composition or the diversity of the predominant microbial community of carrier attached biofilms torresi et al 2016 for example analyzed the impact of biofilm thickness on mp biotransformation nitrification and biodiversity they have shown that by using a thicker biofilm 500 μm microbial biodiversity increased and the biotransformation kinetics of more than 60 of the targeted compounds were maximized in a subsequent study they investigated the biofilm structure and diversity in a three stage mbbr system compared to a single stage configuration and their relationship to microbial functions torresi et al 2018 a first statistical evaluation of the relationship of different taxa from an mbbr carrier attached biofilm with mp transformation was performed by liang et al 2021 they analyzed the relationship between the biofilm community and the mp removal in an mbbr during a feast famine regime with the result that 88 taxonomic groups were identified as potential biomarkers for the transformation of certain mps however while these three named studies investigated the carrier attached biofilm no study is known to us investigating the transformation potential for a broad range of mps as well as the microbial community composition including the biodiversity of both the carrier attached biofilm and the suspended sludge from different hybrid mbbrs using carrier attached biofilms and the corresponding suspended sludge from different hybrid mbbrs gives the opportunity to directly compare the transformation potential and microbial composition of carrier attached biofilms and suspended sludge taken from the same reactor without the influence of different wastewater compositions and treatment conditions therefore the objectives of the present study were i to compare the transformation potential of the carrier attached biofilm and the suspended sludge of three hybrid mbbr systems in their removal of 31 mps under controlled laboratory conditions ii to analyze the predominant microbial communities of the carrier attached biofilm and the suspended sludge with regard to biodiversity microbial composition and the identification of specialized and core organisms by 16s rrna amplicon sequencing iii to identify relationships between mp transformation and the microbial communities of the corresponding matrices 2 material and methods 2 1 characteristics of wwtps and sampling of biomass carriers suspended sludge and effluent for the lab experiments were collected from two full scale hybrid mbbrs and one bench scale sequencing batch reactor sbr system one full scale hybrid mbbr mbbr 1 is part of a wwtp located in bad ragaz switzerland which receives primarily domestic wastewater with a load of 25 500 population equivalents pe and an average influent volume of 3 200 m³ d the biological activated sludge treatment with simultaneous p precipitation of this wwtp is divided into two equally sized lines each separated into three compartments with an effective volumetric ratio of 1 5 3 the first two compartments consist of a denitrifying compartment and a following aerobic compartment 2 mg l o2 without carriers falås et al 2013 the third compartment with a higher aeration rate 3 mg l o2 was operated as a hybrid mbbr mbbr 1 filled with activated sludge and carrier materials anoxkaldnes biofilmchip m sweden with a filling ratio of 35 both biomasses were used for biomass sampling the second full scale hybrid mbbr mbbr 2 is part of a wwtp located in klippan sweden which treats municipal wastewater with a load of 13 000 pe similar to the wwtp in bad ragaz the biological activated sludge treatment stage of the klippan wwtp with simultaneous p precipitation is also divided into two similarly dimensioned lines each consisting of four compartments the first two compartments of each line are operated as anoxic denitrification steps with added industrial potato residues as an additional carbon source followed by an aerobic sludge compartment 2 mg l o2 the final nitrifying compartment 3 mg l o2 differs between the two lines one line is operated solely with activated sludge the other line with both sludge and carrier materials anoxkaldnes biofilmchip m sweden with a filling ratio of 40 biomass samples were taken from the compartment containing sludge and carriers the investigated sbr system mbbr 3 was located in koblenz germany and consisted of two fully automated sbrs with a volume of 12 liters each both reactors alternated between nitrifying 2 3 hydraulic retention time hrt and denitrifying 1 3 hrt conditions in each cycle the first reactor was operated as cas treatment with 12 h hrt and 12 d srt and was fed with the effluent of the primary clarifier of the wwtp in koblenz germany 220 000 pe 60 000 m³ d the effluent of this reactor was transferred into the second reactor which was additionally equipped with carriers anoxkaldnes k1 sweden 35 filling ratio and operated with 2 5 d hrt and 12 d srt biomass for batch experiments was taken from the second reactor mbbr 3 a detailed description of the individual reactor design can be found at falås et al 2016 and a schematic of the setup is presented in the supporting information figure s1 as an overview table 1 summarizes the investigated systems characteristics 2 2 batch experiments lab scale batch experiments were performed with the separated suspended sludge and the carrier attached biofilm of every system in triplicate in 200 ml schott glass bottles the amount of suspended sludge as well as the number of carriers added to the corresponding effluent was adjusted to a biomass of 1 g l and the final volume of each batch was 100 ml the batches were continuously shaken 100 rpm and purged with air to establish oxic conditions the oxygen concentration was controlled intermittently throughout the experiment and was always 7 mg l data not shown a compound mixture with 31 mps table s1 dissolved in deionized water was added to each batch to achieve a spiking concentration of 1 µg l over 72 h samples for mp analysis were withdrawn from the batches at regular intervals resulting in 10 sampling points the samples were immediately filtered 0 45 µm regenerated cellulose and stored at 4 c until liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms analysis in addition the basic parameters nitrate nitrogen no3 n dissolved organic carbon doc and ph 7 7 0 7 were controlled throughout the incubation period at the end of the experiment the suspended biomass was centrifuged at 3 500 g for 10 min and the supernatant was discarded the biomass was stored at 20 c for a maximum of three months until dna extraction 2 3 dna extraction and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing to extract dna from the carrier attached biofilm the frozen carriers were crushed and homogenized using a cryomill retsch germany with 3 cycles each 1 min at 30 s speed for dna extraction from suspended sludge the thawed sludge pellet was resuspended in 2 ml g hn buffer 50 mmol l hepes 50 mmol l nacl ph 7 4 and homogenized with a disperser ultra turrax t8 ika staufen germany at ca 20 000 min for 30 s dna was extracted from 0 5 ml of resuspended sludge pellet or 0 5 g crushed carriers using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals eschwege germany according to the manufacturer s instructions concentration and purity of the individual dna extracts were measured by microspectrophotometry nanophotometer p330 implen the 16s rrna gene amplification and library preparation was performed as previously described in wolff et al 2018 by using the primers a519f 5 cag cmg ccg cgg taa 3 and 802r 5 tac nvg ggt atc taa tcc 3 klindworth et al 2013 a volume of 25 µl of the purified and combined dna library equivalent of about 10 ng per sample was used for sequencing the 16s rrna amplicon sequencing was performed by the department of physiology and biochemistry of nutrition of the max rubner institut mri karlsruhe germany using an illumina miseq in paired end mode 2 250 bp 2 4 data processing after a quality check with solexaqa software cox et al 2010 paired end reads were binned with pear software zhang et al 2014 and demultiplexed in the following the sequences were processed on the mothur platform schloss et al 2009 according to the miseq sop kozich et al 2013 in short sequences were filtered by removing sequences with ambiguous base calls and homopolymers longer than 8 nt and then aligned with the silva database v128 quast et al 2013 subsequently the vsearch algorithm rognes et al 2016 was used for checking and removing chimeric sequences the resulting sequences were pre clustered allowing three mismatches classified using silva v128 taxonomy and finally merged to operational taxonomic units otus with a sequence similarity of 97 the calculations of the biodiversity indices were performed by the past software hammer et al 2001 using the relative abundances on otu level similar to wolff et al 2018 a similarity percentage analysis simper on genus level was used to define a specialized community 70 of the cumulative contribution to declare genera as core organisms two further filter criteria were applied on the remaining genera 70 of the cumulative contribution of the simper analysis present in all three sludge or carrier attached systems and a minimum relative abundance of 0 05 2 5 micropollutant analysis the 31 spiked mps were analyzed by lc ms ms using an agilent 1260 lc coupled to a sciex qtrap 5500 ms according to the method previously described by falås et al 2016 the samples were measured with direct injection without further pretreatment biological transformation rate constants kbiol were estimated assuming first order kinetics and negligible sorption according to eq 1 whereby s is the mp concentration µg l xbiomass the biomass concentration g l and kbiol is the pseudo first order rate constant in l g d 1 d s d t k b i o l x b i o m a s s s biomass concentrations xbiomass were measured as suspended solids for the sludge and as biofilm solids for the carriers the suspended solids concentration was calculated according to european standard en 872 by the difference in weight of filtered samples using gf 6 glass fiber filter 1 6 µm vwr before and after heating at 105 c for 12 h biofilm solids were estimated from the weight difference of three dried carriers 105 c for 12 h in three replicates before and after removal of the biofilm biofilm of the colonized carriers was removed by ultrasonication in hcl 3 m followed by thorough brushing with soapy and deionized water modified from falås et al 2012 the residual percentage of each mp was calculated according to eq 2 by comparing the start ct 0h and end ct 72h concentration of the respective substance 2 r e s i d u a l c t 72 h c t 0 h 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 micropollutant transformation and kinetics lab scale batch experiments with either suspended sludge or carriers collected from the three mbbr systems 1 3 were carried out in triplicate to investigate the transformation of 31 mps table s1 mp concentration in the corresponding biomass samples was acquired over 72 h via lc ms ms and residual percentages were calculated according to eq 2 table s2 the selected target compounds feature a relatively high polarity and for several of them sludge wastewater distribution coefficients have been reported to be considerably below 500 l kg ternes et al 2004 hence even though not for all compounds an influence of sorption to the suspended solids or the carrier attached biofilms can be completely excluded the observed removal could mainly be attributed to transformation processes to elucidate specific differences in mp transformation efficiency between the six different biomasses from the three systems biomass normalized kbiol of all mps were calculated table s3 the median of the kbiol of the 31 mps was between 0 12 mbbr 2 and 0 16 l g d mbbr 3 for the suspended sludge and between 0 14 and 0 43 l g d for the carrier attached biofilms fig 1 applying a kruskal wallis test significant differences chi² 20 44 p 0 01 on kbiol values were found among the six biomasses from the three systems for both mbbr 1 and mbbr 2 the carrier attached biomasses performed significantly better tukey post hoc test z 2 83 p 0 01 than the suspended sludge from the same system suggesting an increased potential for mp transformation the median as well as the mean of the kbiol values determined in the batch with carriers from mbbr 1 were more than three times higher than in the batch with the corresponding suspended sludge moreover kbiol from this batch was about two times higher than in the batches with the carriers from the other two systems which indicates a considerably high transformation potential of the carrier attached biomass of mbbr 1 consistent with the increased kbiol values of the carrier attached biomasses from mbbr 1 and mbbr 2 the median of the kbiol determined for the carrier attached biomass from mbbr 3 was also higher than that determined for the corresponding suspended sludge however in case of mbbr 3 the difference on rate constants could not be confirmed to be statistically significant this might be explained by the considerably higher srt in mbbr 3 12 d compared to mbbr 1 3 d and mbbr 2 5 d the analysis of the 31 spiked mps revealed that five compounds were persistent upon incubation 20 transformation in all batch experiments table s3 carbamazepine cbz diatrizoate venlafaxine fluconazole and primidone this is in accordance with other studies investigating the biological transformation of those compounds during biological wastewater treatment kaiser et al 2014 kormos et al 2010 ternes 1998 schlüsener et al 2015 these compounds were not taken into consideration for the further assessment of the investigated biological treatment systems for a more compound specific comparison of sludge vs carrier mediated transformation performance the kbiol of the individual degradable mps in sludge and carrier containing batches were compared for each individual systems by student s t test normal distribution of kbiol replicates was assumed significant differences p 0 05 between the rate constants determined in batches with sludge kbiol sludge and carriers kbiol carriers are shown in fig 2 for each system according to the following eq 3 k b i o l s l u d g e k b i o l c a r r i e r 2 k b i o l d i f f e r e n c e the non persistent mps could be categorized into four groups according to the difference in their kbiol in sludge and carrier containing batches a statistically significantly higher values in batches with carrier attached biomass in at least two of the three systems b statistically significantly higher values in batches with suspended sludge in at least two of the three systems c no clear trend but statistically significantly higher values in batches with suspended sludge from one system and carrier attached biofilm from another system d no significant values in at least two of the three systems in detail group a consisted of 12 compounds trimethoprim tmp diclofenac dcf mecoprop mcpp climbazole clz 10 11 dihydro 10 hydroxycarbamazepine dhh cbz 2 hydroxycarbamazepine 2 oh cbz 3 hydroxycarbamazepine 3 oh cbz codeine cod iopromide ipm oxazepam ozp erythromycin ery and 10 11 dihydro 10 11 dihydroxycarbamazepine dh dh cbz these mps revealed significantly increased transformation efficiencies in carrier attached biofilms compared to suspended sludges from at least two of the three wastewater treatment systems strikingly five of those compounds namely tmp dcf mcpp clz and dhh cbz even showed significantly higher kbiol in reactions with carrier associated biofilm from all three systems 0 2 11 l g d higher for the compounds tmp and dcf these results were in accordance with previous studies reporting an improved transformation by attached compared to suspended biomasses falås et al 2013 zupanc et al 2013 falås et al 2012 jewell et al 2016b except for climbazole which is known to be transformed by a hydrogenation of the keto group brienza and chiron 2017 all other compounds of the aforementioned five compounds from group a have been reported to be transformed by oxidative reactions while tmp and mcpp can be primarily transformed by an oxidative dealkylation of the phenoxy group jewell et al 2016a juhler et al 2001 hydroxylation reactions have been described to be one of the major primary reactions leading to transformation of dcf jewell et al 2016b and dhh cbz kaiser et al 2014 this might be an indication that independently of the specific mbbr system carrier attached biofilms facilitate especially the removal of compounds transformed by oxidative transformation reactions interestingly in the batches with carrier associated biofilm from mbbr 1 kbiol of tmp dcf and mcpp were also considerably higher 11 5 7 4 7 7 l g d respectively compared to the other investigated batches with carriers from mbbr 2 0 5 0 8 0 9 l g d respectively and mbbr 3 3 0 0 7 0 6 l g d respectively this unique feature of mbbr 1 will be discussed at a later stage a correlation of the residual concentrations table s3 at each time point and for each replicate in all six batches revealed a highly comparable transformation behavior of dcf and mcpp independently of the biomass r² 0 95 table s4 this result supports similar findings of falås et al 2018 and suggests that both chlorinated aromatic compounds might be transformed by related microorganisms and or enzymes the other seven compounds of group a which displayed a faster transformation in carrier attached biofilm from only two of the three systems were the carbamazepine metabolites 3 oh cbz 2 oh cbz and dh dh cbz as well as cod ipm ozp and ery for five compounds 3 oh cbz 2 oh cbz cod ipm and dhdh cbz significantly higher kbiol values were observed only in the carrier attached biofilm from mbbr 1 and mbbr 2 this might be attributed to the low srt of the suspended sludge in these systems 5 d which is not sufficient for nitrification for ipm this would be in accordance with other studies reporting that removal of ipm is restricted to nitrifying activated sludge treatment batt et al 2006 gonzalez gil et al 2021 however for ozp and ery significant differences between suspended sludge and carrier attached biofilm was observed for both mbbr 1 lowest srt of 3 d and mbbr 3 highest srt of 12 d but not for mbbr 2 srt of 5 d this indicates that differences in the transformation potential between the suspended sludge and the carrier attached biofilms cannot solely be attributed to srt looking at the primary transformation revealed that at least for five of the above mentioned compounds removal can also be attributed to oxidative transformation reactions 2 oh cbz was found to be mainly oxidized to carbamazepine iminoquinone by dehydrogenation and cleavage of the carbamoyl moiety 3 oh cbz has been observed to be oxidized to phenoxy radicals leading to dimers and nitro derivatives brezina et al 2015 and the initial transformation reactions of dhdh cbz codeine and iopromide were reported to be dehydrogenations of alcohol moieties kaiser et al 2014 schulz et al 2008 wick et al 2011 in literature the compounds dcf tmp and ozp of group a were described as rather persistent in cas treatment kosjek et al 2012 wick et al 2009 jewell et al 2016b jewell et al 2016a their reported kbiol in batches with nitrifying activated sludge were in the same range as those determined in contact with suspended sludge from the three mbbr systems in this study the considerably higher kbiol in carrier containing batches in our study illustrate the high potential of carrier attached biofilm to transform certain compounds that are not or only to a minor extent transformed in conventional activated sludge treatment only three of in total 26 mps benzotriazole atenolol and clarithromycin were found to exhibit significantly higher transformation rates in batches with suspended sludge from at least two systems and were therefore categorized into group b fig 2 this is in accordance to the results from falås et al 2013 who observed a slightly faster transformation of atenolol as well as a significantly faster transformation of benzotriazole with the suspended sludge compared to the carrier attached biofilm taken from the hybrid biofilm activated sludge stage in mbbr 1 consistently the study of casas et al 2015 revealed only 40 removal of atenolol in a pilot plant consisting of three mbbrs in series in contrast torresi et al 2017 observed higher kbiol values in three different mbbr systems pre denitrifying nitrifying and post denitrifying compared to literature references from conventional activated sludge systems while clarithromycin showed at least for two systems a significantly faster transformation with the suspended biomass erythromycin belonging to the same class of macrolide antibiotics showed an opposing trend and was assigned to group a however the opposing transformation behavior of these structurally closely related compounds with carrier attached and suspended biomass is in accordance with the different main initial transformation reactions reported for both compounds by tezel 2017 while the main primary tps of erythromycin resulted from the cleavage of the cladinose and desosamine moieties known to be catalyzed by glycosidases the dominant tps of clarithromycin could be explained by phosphorylation of the desosamine moiety and hydrolysis of the macrolactone ring tezel 2017 no clear trend could be determined for the five compounds from group c bezafibrate acesulfame terbutryn tramadol and diuron for all these compounds kbiol were significantly higher with either carrier attached or suspended sludge when comparing mbbr 1 and mbbr 3 in batches with carrier attached biofilm from mbbr 2 no significant differences between carrier and sludge rates could be observed within group c interestingly bezafibrate group c and atenolol group b showed a different pattern in their transformation rates even though both are known to be transformed by hydrolysis of their amide moieties quintana et al 2005 radjenovic et al 2009 for the six mps of group d metoprolol acyclovir iopamidol carbendazim sotalol and sulfamethoxazole smx no significant differences in transformation rates between carrier and sludge batches could be detected in at least two of the three wastewater treatment systems comparing the iodinated x ray contrast media iopromide group a and iopamidol both have been described to be initially transformed via oxidation of a primary hydroxyl group kormos et al 2010 schulz et al 2008 yet only iopromide showed a clear trend for an enhanced transformation rate with carrier attached biofilms rather than with suspended sludge consistent with an increased transformation of iopromide by carrier attached biomass table s2 previous studies measured an increased transformation of iopromide however only minor transformation of iopamidol in staged mbbr systems casas et al 2015 tang et al 2017 in addition kovalova et al 2012 showed that the highest removal out of six different analyzed iodinated x ray contrast media icms from hospital wastewater by an membrane bioreactor mbr was for iopromide 31 while the removal was negligible for the other icms these results indicates that biofilm associated microbial communities foster specifically the transformation of iopromide but not of other structurally closely related icms as stated above the transformation of those compounds for which a clear trend of a faster transformation with the carrier attached biofilm was observed group a could be mainly attributed to oxidative reactions on the other hand the transformation efficiency seems to be rather compound specific as the example of iopamidol shows that not all oxidative transformation reactions are generally facilitated like iopamidol also benzotriazole terbutryn metoprolol acyclovir and diuron have been described in literature to be transformed by different oxidative reactions but did not show elevated transformation rates with the carrier attached biofilms however the rather consistent differences in the transformation behavior of the compounds of group a and b between carrier attached biofilms and suspended sludge from the three systems also suggest distinct differences between the microbial communities of the respective biomasses particularly the carrier attached biomass from mbbr 1 is to be highlighted as it revealed the highest averaged kbiol fig 1 as well as the highest overall transformation table s3 which argues for a specific potential of the contributing microorganisms in mp transformation 3 2 taxonomic analysis of the investigated systems 3 2 1 general description of the microbial communities in order to elucidate the described differences in mp transformation efficiency and compare them to differences in the microbial composition 16s rrna amplicon sequencing analysis of sludge and carrier samples from the three examined wastewater treatment systems was performed a first general evaluation was enabled by the calculation of three biodiversity indices the species richness h0 the shannon index h1 and the equitability j which are considered important parameters for understanding microbial community structures hernandez raquet et al 2013 wolff et al 2018 all analyzed samples shared a total number of 9688 operational taxonomic units otus with a sequence similarity of 97 which distinguishes microorganisms down to genus level here otus could be annotated to in total 975 genera at 97 sequence similarity the results for species richness and shannon index in the biomass samples from all three mbbr systems ranged from 1378 mbbr 1 sludge to 2542 mbbr 3 carrier and 4 98 mbbr 1 sludge to 6 2 mbbr 3 carrier respectively table s5 which is comparable to findings for other wastewater microbial communities reported in literature gonzalez martinez et al 2016 wang et al 2016 wolff et al 2018 johnson et al 2015 strikingly for each of the three investigated systems species richness and shannon index were statistically significantly p 0 05 student s t test higher for the carrier attached biomass over the suspended biomass with rather comparable values for equitability also the averaged biodiversity indices of the three different systems revealed higher values for carrier attached biomass compared to suspended biomass letting assume an increased biodiversity in microorganisms attached to the carriers this result complies with findings from other studies analyzing the biodiversity in biocake and aerobic mixed liquor gao et al 2014 or cas and membrane bioreactors silva et al 2010 the different microbial population dynamics could be explained by the occupation of metabolic and territorial niches on the carrier attached biofilm because of different predominant conditions such as low foot to microorganism ratio the long sludge retention or different substrate and redox gradients within the biofilm choi et al 2007 de wever et al 2007 bauer et al 2018 falås et al 2012 in total the microbial communities from all sequenced samples were composed of 63 identified prokaryotic phyla with the seven most dominant proteobacteria bacteroidetes nitrospirae actinobacteria planctomycetes chloroflexi and acidobacteria constituting a minimum of 86 in each of the analyzed biomasses fig 3 a concomitantly the highest relative abundance proportions in each investigated sample could be allocated to proteobacteria fluctuating between 43 mbbr 3 carrier and 70 mbbr 1 sludge even though the shares of phyla and classes in the biomass varied between the three wastewater treatment systems the relative differences between suspended sludge and carrier attached biomass in the same system were in most cases rather comparable table s6 six phyla and 12 classes were significantly enriched in all three carrier attached biomasses compared to the corresponding suspended biomasses while one phylum and six classes showed significantly higher relative abundances in the suspended biomasses student s t test p 0 05 for example nitrospirae on phylum level and alphaproteobacteria on class level were significantly increased in carrier attached biomasses by at least 8 relative abundance whereas bacteroidetes on phylum level and betaproteobacteria on class level were significantly increased in suspended biomasses by at least 7 5 relative abundance fig 3a on otu level a principal component analysis pca was used to visualize similarities between the microbial communities occurring in the different systems biomass matrices as well as similarities between the individual triplicates fig 3b regarding the latter the pca plot illustrates clustering of the triplicates of each biomass indicating a good comparability of the biological replicates and methodical reproducibility the separation of the carrier attached biofilm samples left side from the suspended sludge samples right side along the x axis pc 1 37 3 of variation shows that on otu level the carrier attached and the suspended sludge communities are indeed distinct in some measure in addition the samples are also distributed along the y axis pc 2 31 2 of variation according to their original system with the samples from mbbr 1 in the upper half opposite to the samples from mbbr 2 and the mbbr 3 accumulating in the lower half of the plot hence taxonomy seems to be another feature that distinguishes mbbr 1 from the other two systems further supporting the assumption that the microbial composition reflects to a certain degree the transformation potential of the investigated systems in the following particular attention will be focused on identifying relationships between mp transformation and the microbial communities of the corresponding matrices 3 2 2 classification in core and specialized communities for a more detailed analysis of specific differences between the sludge and carrier communities of the three treatment systems the assigned genera were divided into core communities mutual genera classified according to the criteria described in wolff et al 2018 and specialized communities classified as genera with 70 contribution to the dissimilarities between the investigated systems communities the core communities were determined separately for the three carrier attached biomasses and for the three suspended biomasses of the three investigated mbbrs 74 genera 8 of all genera comprising an average relative abundance of 19 8 in all carrier samples were allocated to the core community of carrier attached biomasses while 45 genera 5 of all genera comprising an average relative abundance of 12 6 in all sludge samples were allocated to the core community of suspended biomasses with both matrices sharing an overlap of 33 genera fig 4 the taxonomic groups with the highest proportion in both core communities were genera from the classes alpha and deltaproteobacteria with deltaproteobacteria displaying a rather similar relative abundance in both communities in line with this most of the 33 genera shared in sludge and carrier core communities e g bdellovibrio phaselicystis and nannocystis also belong to the class of deltaproteobacteria and have been described as prevalent organisms in soil as well as in activated sludge brinkhoff et al 2012 this suggests that these genera can be defined as ubiquitous generalists occurring likely independently of the predominant process conditions in both suspended sludge and carrier attached biofilm alphaproteobacteria on the other hand could be shown to be more prevailing in the core community of the carrier attached biofilms about 3 7 times the relative abundance a major part of the obtained genera within the class of alphaproteobacteria belongs to the orders rhizobiales e g devosia mesorhizobium or variibacter and sphingomonadales e g sphingobium zymomonas or sphingomonas while genera of the order rhizobiales are known to fix nitrogen fischer 1994 the genus sphingomonas within the order of sphingomonadales has been described to have a general high potential of degrading a wide variety of carbon sources including pesticides or other xenobiotics aylward et al 2013 stolz et al 2000 sasaki et al 2005 leys et al 2004 in particular it was found that species of this genus are capable of degrading both enantiomers of the chiral herbicide mecoprop zipper et al 1996 nielsen et al 2013 which is in accordance with the more than six times higher average relative abundance of sphingomonas and the significantly faster transformation of mecoprop in batches with the carrier attached biofilms besides also genera with exclusive presence in one or the other core community were identified such as 41 genera exclusively present in the core community of the carrier attached biomass a considerably higher number compared to only 12 genera which were specific for the core community of the suspended sludge additionally the carrier core community comprised eight phyla abundance proportion of 3 2 solely found in the carrier community together with the results mentioned above it can be assumed that the core community of the three carrier attached biomasses was more diverse which might also increase the number of potential metabolic pathways to transform mps based on a simper analysis the 69 genera that exhibit the highest variation in relative abundance between the different batches were defined as specialized community fig 5 in general about half of the taxa annotated as specialized community revealed no clear tendency to occur predominantly in the suspended or carrier attached biomass fig 5 first section whereas the other half 51 showed a significantly p 0 05 student s t test higher relative abundance in either suspended 21 genera or carrier attached 14 genera biomass in each of the three systems fig 5 second or third section respectively table s7 remarkably genera of phyla or classes that had been found to be enriched in certain biomasses fig 3a such as nitrospirae and alphaproteobacteria for carrier attached biofilms or bacteroidetes and betaproteobacteria for suspended sludge were confirmed as specialized community and were increased in the corresponding biomass although genera in the first section of fig 5 did not show a significant tendency towards a certain biomass matrix there were specific enrichments in individual systems or single matrices detected of which the most striking will be included in the following interpretations one third of the genera with a significantly increased relative abundance in the suspended sludge biomasses belonged to the class of betaproteobacteria followed by sphingobacteriia 19 mostly annotated only to the family level fig 5 second section table s7 concomitantly the families comamonadaceae and saprospiraceae within these classes exhibited the in average highest differences in relative abundance between the sludge and the respective carrier samples 3 7 and 2 2 respectively the most significant genera to be dominant in suspended sludge samples were characterized as aerobic denitrifying bacteria e g rhodoferax lamia or zoogloea as well as bacteria responsible for phosphorus removal e g dechloromonas candidatus microthrix besides also filamentous organisms like haliscomenobacter or candidatus microthrix known to be responsible for sludge separation problems were found to be elevated in the sludge s specialized community the presence of the named genera is typical for the microbial community of cas treatment and comparable with other studies wagner et al 2002 zhao et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 mcilroy et al 2016 nevertheless certain genera displayed a very specific dominance in individual samples as for instance the actinobacterial tetrasphaera being highly enriched in the suspended sludge sample from mbbr 2 or the quite uncharacterized genus chiayiivirga of the family xanthomonadaceae in sludge from mbbr 3 from the same family also the genus thermomonas showed an explicit preference for one sample and was mainly detected in suspended sludge from mbbr 1 the fact that also the abundance of the genera haliangium dechloromonas and zoogloea was shifted towards the sludge from mbbr 1 might explain the separation of this sample from the other sludge samples in the otu based pca fig 3b most of the significantly higher abundant genera in the carrier attached biofilms of the three systems were assigned to aerobic heterotrophic organisms additionally it could be confirmed that carrier attached biofilms seem to promote slow growing organisms like nitrospira doubling time from 13 to 43 h or hyphomicrobium doubling time approx 9 h as well as dimorphic prosthecate bacteria dpb such as woodsholea hyphomicrobium and pedomicrobium badger et al 2006 nowka et al 2015 fig 5 third section dpb are alphaproteobacteria that reproduce in an asymmetric manner rather than by binary fission resulting in a non motile form which has the ability to adhere strongly to surfaces and form biofilms badger et al 2006 the relative abundances of hyphomicrobium rhizomicrobium as well as pedomicrobium all belonging to the order rhizobiales were on average three times higher in the carrier attached biomasses in comparison to the corresponding suspended biomasses consistently hyphomicrobium and rhizomicrobium were also found among the 20 most abundant genera in carrier attached biofilms by cimbritz et al 2019 especially hyphomicrobium an aerobic chemoorganotrophic facultative methylotrophic and denitrifying genus has been described as an important organism associated with mp transformation many species of this genus are able to mineralize pollutants such as aromatic hydrocarbons methyl chloride and various alcohols including methanol badger et al 2006 besides also taxa responsible for cycling iron were found to be generally enriched in all carrier samples such as pedomicrobium rhizomicrobium and acidibacter while pedomicrobium was characterized as a ubiquitous aerobic and heterotrophic genus able to precipitate or oxidize iron bilyy et al 2011 gebers and beese 1988 the anaerobic genera rhizomicrobium and acidibacter in contrast were described as iron reducing bacteria falagán and johnson 2014 ueki et al 2010 the presence of these genera indicates the presence of strong redox gradients in the carrier attached biofilms thus also gradients for the availability of carbon and nitrogen can be assumed this might facilitate biodiversity and to some extent also the capability for degrading relatively recalcitrant mps johnson et al 2014 johnson et al 2015 the predominant redox conditions and the important role for the mp transformation was also described in other studies wolff et al 2018 torresi et al 2019 falås et al 2013 and confirmed the results particularly to be highlighted was also the relative abundance of the nitrifying genus nitrospira being on average seven times higher in the carrier samples compared to the respective sludge samples in the biomass of the carriers from mbbr 1 nitrospira contributed even up to 20 of the whole community and was considerably higher abundant than in the biomasses from the carriers of the other two systems this might also explain the observed separation of the carrier biomasses in the pca fig 3b the otus of this genus could even be annotated down to species level to candidatus nitrospira nitrificans 99 2 sequence identity database ezbiocloud version 2019 05 31 this species belongs to the comammox organisms complete ammonia oxidizer that are able to perform a complete nitrification as they express enzymes for both ammonia and nitrite oxidation to convert ammonia to nitrate the first step oxidation of ammonia to nitrite is catalyzed by the enzyme ammonia monooxygenase amo in comammox organisms as well as in ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob in an environment like the carrier attached biofilm however the growth of comammox bacteria such as the slow growing candidatus nitrospira nitrificans is favored due to the formation of niches and gradients with specific oxygen or nitrite concentrations sobotka et al 2018 in chemostats and well mixed systems like activated sludge treatment on the other hand aobs outcompete the comammox bacteria resulting in their low observed abundances in the sludge samples in general a positive relationship between nitrification and the transformation of certain mps has been discussed xu et al 2016 sathyamoorthy et al 2013 helbling et al 2012 achermann et al 2018 hence based on this literature a specific positive relationship between the high relative abundances of the nitrifying species candidatus nitrospira nitrificans and the relatively high potential of the investigated carrier attached biofilms to transform some compounds known to be initially transformed by oxidative reactions might be assumed but needs to be investigated further some studies explained the positive relationship between nitrifying activity and transformation potential with the ability of the relatively unspecific enzyme amo to co oxidize for example aromatic compounds probably via hydroxylation reactions khunjar et al 2011 yi and harper 2007 yu et al 2018 in contrast the results of achermann et al 2018 pointed toward a non causal relationship as they observed that trends of an increased mp removal at higher srts accompanied by higher nitrifying activity were hardly impeded when the amo enzyme was inhibited 3 3 comparison of the systems microbial communities with their micropollutant removal having elucidated the mp transformation potential of different carrier attached biofilms and the corresponding suspended sludge as well as the details of the taxonomic composition of the investigated matrices we aimed at examining whether there is a general calculable link between these two results first we questioned if biodiversity can be correlated to mp removal in particular to the measured kbiol since only three systems were analyzed the validity of a statistical test is restricted n 3 when correlating pearson product moment correlation the obtained kbiol median or mean of every analyzed mp to the mentioned biodiversity indices for all samples both matrices no significant correlations could be observed data not shown however when performing the correlation separately for the carrier and the sludge values significant results could be obtained table s8 for the suspended sludge calculations resulted in general in positive correlations between kbiol and biodiversity indices significant correlation of the mean kbiol r 0 79 p 0 05 in detail 12 out of 26 non persistent mps showed a significant correlation between transformation performance and at least two biodiversity indices with all being positive except for benzotriazole this result supports the findings from other studies indicating a positive association of the microbial biodiversity and the mp biotransformation rate of specific compounds in conventional biological wastewater treatment johnson et al 2015 torresi et al 2016 stadler and love 2016 in contrast kbiol and biodiversity of the carrier attached biomass correlated generally negatively significant correlation of mean kbiol r 0 93 p 0 05 here too 12 mps displayed a significant correlation to at least two biodiversity indices this included compounds like tmp dcf and mcpp which were detected to be transformed faster in carrier samples these results were in accordance with the overall negative correlations pearson product moment correlation of three stage and single stage mbbr systems as observed by torresi et al 2018 one explanation for the negative correlations could be that rather few but abundant organisms such as nitrospira were decisive for the increased transformation of certain mps the results of the present correlations indicate that biodiversity is an important parameter when describing microbial communities however since for the current study correlations could only be performed for data from three different systems results on the influence of biodiversity on the transformation potential of carriers and suspended sludge in hybrid mbbrs need to be further confirmed by follow up studies these studies should also include sludge from cas systems covering different srts and biofilms from stand alone mbbrs since literature has already shown an influence of srt on the microbial diversity which in turn can influence the transformation potential sun et al 2020 next we performed a mantel test to investigate the relationship of kbiol and relative abundances of taxa for both otu and genus level the resulting significant correlations r 0 78 p 0 001 for both cases support the hypothesis of a clear link between the transformation potential and the microbial community composition a canonical correspondence analysis cca was further used to correlate independent metric variables here kbiol of the analyzed mps with the relative abundances of the 69 genera defined as specialized community of the different batches the tri plot fig 6 summarizes the result of the cca and displays how the specialized community was organized with respect to mp transformation rates by finding features that are statistically significant in terms of explaining the covariance between the given sets of variables the percentage variance of axis 1 horizontally and axis 2 vertically are 30 and 27 respectively in accordance with the pca plot of the microbial community on otu level fig 3b the mbbr 1 upper half and its biomass carrier attached left suspended sludge right are clearly separated from the other two systems lower half in addition also a distinct differentiation could be observed for the sludge from the mbbr 2 in contrast the triplicates of the mbbr 3 suspended sludge grouped with the carrier attached samples of mbbr 3 and 2 the kbiol of terbutryn benzotriazole and tramadol exhibited the strongest associations with the community composition in the suspended sludge samples of mbbr 1 and genera such as thermomonas zoogloea and dokdonella the other suspended sludge samples mbbr 2 and 3 correlated not at all or negatively with the mps and were characterized by the prevalence of taxa like tetrasphaera or saprospiraceae described in previous chapters in accordance with the results of chapter 3 1 most mps including trimethoprim or diclofenac correlated significantly with the composition of the carrier attached biomass of all systems especially with mbbr 1 in addition the relative abundance of genera like acidibacter nitrospira and rhizomicrobium see chapter 3 2 2 resulted in a correlation with the named mps and showed a statistical dependence the results were in accordance with some indicator taxa found by liang et al 2021 for example the genus tk10 has in both studies a highly positive correlation with the kbiol values of sotalol this is also true for the genus planctomyces or members of the order rhizobiales which resulted in good correlations with the kbiol values of diclofenac liang et al 2021 even though this does not necessarily point to a causal relationship these organisms might be rated as biological indicators for the improved transformation of the associated mps in carrier attached biofilms 3 4 practical implications most mps in group a were transformed considerably faster by the carrier attached biofilm compared to the suspended sludge from the two full scale wwtps with low srt of 3 and 5 days fig 2 this indicates that retrofitting of activated sludge processes with low nitrification capacities by the addition of carriers could also improve the mp removal in particular the microbial communities of the carrier attached biofilms seem to have a high potential for an increased transformation of mps transformed by oxidative reactions one prominent example of these mps is diclofenac whose proposed annual average environmental quality standard concentration of 50 ng l is considerably exceeded in many european waters because of its recalcitrance or only minor removal in conventional wwtps loos et al 2018 from a practical perspective this upgrading method is particularly interesting for wwtps in confined areas where space is rather scarce and discharge demands must be met with existing reactor volumes furthermore the study confirmed the hypotheses that common characteristics in the transformation potential of suspended sludge and carrier attached biofilms from hybrid mbbrs are linked to distinct differences in their microbial community composition this is of practical relevance as the understanding of relationships between the transformation performance and specific indicator organisms could foster the optimization and control of hybrid mbbrs but also of biological treatment processes in general nonetheless more studies are needed to investigate the direct role of particular organisms such as the above mentioned genera acidibacter or rhizomicrobium in mp transformation as well as their suitability as indicators of favorable environment conditions for the transformation of certain mps moreover follow up studies are needed to investigate to which extent the results from hybrid mbbrs can also be transferred to general differences between activated sludge and carrier attached biofilms 4 conclusions biofilms from three hybrid mbbr systems showed a significantly higher transformation potential for several mps known to be transformed by oxidative reactions e g tmp dcf mcpp and dhh cbz in comparison with the respective suspended sludge indicating that carrier attached biofilms have in general a higher potential for oxidatively degrading certain mps while for 11 of 31 examined mps transformation was observed to be more effective in batches with carrier attached biofilms only for few mps benzotriazole clarithromycin and atenolol the transformation rates were found to be higher in batches with suspended sludge this supports an overall higher transformation potential of the carrier attached biofilms but also highlights compound specific differences the specific prevalent conditions within carrier attached biofilms lead to the establishment of a biocenosis which was characterized by certain high abundant taxa as well as by a proportionally larger and more diverse core community compared to the suspended sludge together with an increased transformation efficiency this might entail a higher metabolic diversity of carrier attached microorganisms to co metabolize a larger number of organic compounds the difference in microbial composition of carrier attached and suspended biomasses could be mainly attributed to a specialized community of 69 genera for some of them especially acidibacter nitrospira and rhizomicrobium a statistically significant link between their relative abundance and the transformation rates of specific mps could be observed this indicates that only a few specialists may contribute to the variety in mp transformation between carrier attached biofilm and suspended sludge and that these taxa bear the potential to serve as indicator organisms for a high mp transformation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

16803,human activities can accelerate the antibiotic resistome prevalence and pose threats to ecological safety and public health globally however antibiotic resistance gene arg mobility and dissemination into bacterial pathogens under anthropogenic disturbances are still poorly understood here we used a metagenomic approach to profile the biogeography of args and pathogenic antibiotic resistant bacteria parb under anthropogenic disturbances along the yarlung tsangpo river results showed the args was dominated by baca gene along the yarlung tsangpo river on the tibetan plateau the arg composition was differently impacted by rapid urbanization and dam construction which urbanization could promote args resistant to sulfonamide and tetracycline whereas dam construction could elevate the resistance to chloramphenicol and aminoglycoside land use pattern was identified as a critical factor influencing arg composition under anthropogenic disturbances as it could directly reflect the land degradation level and indicate the inputs of arg selective chemicals of different human activities moreover despite of the lack of variation in arg relative abundance parb were highly promoted by anthropogenic activities indicating increasing arg dissemination to pathogen we found that human impacted environments harbored high proportion of mobile genetic elements mges and the mge carrying args also increased under anthropogenic disturbances in the pathogenic hosts which confirmed that anthropogenic activities could promote arg horizontal gene transfer furthermore anthropogenic activities could influence parb assembly processes basically stochastic processes dominated parb assembly along the river and with increasing level of anthropogenic activities these processes shifted from undominated stochastic processes to dispersal limitation in summary this study provides useful strategies in watershed resistome management and reduction of arg dissemination to pathogens which should consider the mode and intensity of human activity and its potential influence on horizontal gene transfer and assembly processes graphical abstracts image graphical abstract keywords arg

1928 antibiotics were regarded as the panacea for microbial infections and have since been immensely overused in human therapy veterinary aquaculture and agriculture yang et al 2018 however owing to their extensive application and continuous release antibiotics have led to the rapid spread of antibiotic resistance genes args to environments allen et al 2010 args have been identified as emerging contaminants pruden et al 2006 and are receiving increasing attention from public researchers and governments worldwide bengtsson palme and larsson 2015 karkman et al 2018 furthermore human pathogens share args with environmental microorganisms forsberg et al 2012 pehrsson et al 2016 and args can be disseminated from microorganisms to pathogens through horizontal gene transfer with the help of mobile genetic elements mges such as integrons and transposons in the environment chen et al 2013 thomas and nielsen 2005 once pathogens have acquired args they are considered as pathogenic antibiotic resistant bacteria parb carrying both args and virulence genes vgs liang et al 2020 args allow parb to survive antibiotic therapy and vgs enable them to reside within a host and enhance its potential to cause disease lee et al 2013 wu et al 2008 thus parb rather than args themselves are the high priority and ultimate target for evaluating the health risk of antibiotic resistome martínez et al 2015 river systems are a vital component of freshwater ecosystems and provide crucial resources for human society and ecosystems however they are a reservoir of various biopollutants including args and pathogens which inevitably gather from different wastewater sources marti et al 2014 peng et al 2020 wu et al 2019 and can cause arg transmission to pathogens reducing therapeutic potential against pathogens and leading to high risk for human health ma et al 2019 in recent decades a wide range of investigations have focused on args pathogens and their coexistence patterns in river systems liang et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 with both args and pathogens being ubiquitously detected in river systems however how args are disseminated to pathogens is still under debate a previous study only reported a strong positive correlation between args and pathogens zhang et al 2016 and increasing evidence indicates that the relationship between args and vgs is complex and adjusted in a way that improves the pathogen survival pan et al 2020 revealing the ecological processes underlying parb assembly is essential for the understanding the coexistence pattern of args and pathogens liu et al 2018a although the assembly mechanisms of microbial community structure have previously been reported the ecological mechanisms of parb assembly remain unclear guo et al 2018 basically stochastic and deterministic processes are the main ecological processes driving community assembly with growing evidence that microbial biogeographic patterns are simultaneously shaped by these processes zhou and ning 2017 therefore the relative influence of stochastic and deterministic factors on parb assembly should be investigated to uncover how args are transmitted to pathogens and contribute to the prevention and control of their enrichment and spread in this study we focused on the tibetan plateau a unique region with complex interactions between environmental geographic and hydrological processes which plays a crucial role in the earth s biodiversity and water cycle immerzeel et al 2010 as the longest river on the tibetan plateau the yarlung tsangpo river harbors extensive hydropower potential which plays socioeconomic and ecological roles in china similar to several large rivers worldwide the yarlung tsangpo river has recently experienced increasing anthropogenic activities such as urbanization and hydropower station construction thus the deterioration of water quality in the river and public health in the region due to anthropogenic activities has increasingly attracted the attention of policymakers and researchers although several studies have been conducted to show anthropogenic disturbances on the hydrochemistry or bacterioplankton diversity the emerging biopollutant antibiotic resistome remains largely ignored hren et al 2007 wang et al 2017 anthropogenic disturbances are responsible for the occurrence of args and pathogens in river systems and effluents from various anthropogenic activities such as hospitals municipal treatment plants and pharmaceutical industries could increase args and pathogens in the receiving river jia et al 2017 ju et al 2016 pruden et al 2012 however previous studies mainly focused on the influence of single pollutant sources on args and pathogens at a local scale and our understanding of the effect of anthropogenic activities on antibiotic resistome at the watershed scale is still limited particularly considering the rapid urbanization and hydropower station construction to address this knowledge gap we conducted metagenomic analysis to profile the antibiotic resistome along the yarlung tsangpo river on the tibetan plateau aiming to 1 investigate the effect of different anthropogenic activities on arg distribution at watershed scale and 2 reveal the ecological mechanisms of arg transmission to pathogens 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area sampling procedure and physicochemical analysis the yarlung tsangpo river is situated on the tibetan plateau with a total length of 2 840 km and catchment area of 9 35 105 km2 it originates from a glacier on the northern slope of the himalayas which is considered pristine the urbanized region including the capital of the tibetan autonomous region lhasa city is located midstream along the river and downstream the zangmu dam i e the first dam constructed in the yarlung tsangpo river began operation in 2015 with a reservoir capacity of 8 66 107 m3 sampling was conducted in november 2017 along the yarlung tsangpo river from rinbung county to gyaca county fig 1 seven sites were sampled along the river including two in pristine sites y1 and y2 two in urbanization areas y3 and y4 and three in dam regulation areas y5 y6 and y7 for pristine sites y1 represented those far from anthropogenic activities whereas y2 was near urbanization areas meanwhile y3 was located in the lhasa river which is a tributary of the yarlung tsangpo and serves as an urban river of lhasa city and y4 was situated downstream of the junction of lhasa river finally y5 y6 and y7 were in the reservoir upstream and downstream of the zangmu dam respectively at each sampling site geographical data longitude latitude and distance between sampling sites were recorded by a gpsmap 62s device garmin ks usa table s1 land use information at each sampling site was obtained from the national geomatics center of china and then quantified jun et al 2014 liu et al 2020c land use index was use to indicate the degradation level of multiple lands in the river basin calculated as the sum of different land use weighted by the specific values within 10 km buffer zones around the sampling sites detailed information on land use quantification is provided in the

electrical conductivity ec of river water were determined in situ during sampling by hq40d multiparameter water quality analyzer hach co usa water turbidity was also determined during sample collection with a 2100 p turbidimeter hach co usa to avoid deviation three 2 l water samples were collected at each sampling site within 10 meters along the river and then homogenized as one sample and each sample was obtained at a depth of 50 cm using a hydrobios ruttner sampler altenholz germany from each site 1 5 l of collected water sample was stored in pre sterilized polyethylene bottles at 4 c for dissolved organic carbon doc and total nitrogen tn analysis in the laboratory doc was measured by the elementar liquid toc analyzer frankfurt germany and tn was determined colorimetrically after acid hydrolysis with persulfate digestion 30 min 120 c to gather the microorganisms the remaining 4 5 l of water from each site was equally filtered into three replicate filters using 0 22 μm pore prewashed polycarbonate filters millipore ma usa by vacuum filtration the filters were immediately stored in sterile 50 ml centrifuge tubes at 20 c and then transported to the laboratory for dna extraction antibiotic concentrations at the sampling sites was obtained from a previous study liu et al 2020a conducted in the same study area 2 2 dna extraction metagenomics sequencing and quality filtering total genomic dna was extracted from each filter using the powerwater dna extraction kit mobio carlsbad ca usa based on the manufacturer s protocol dna quantity and quality were determined using gel electrophoresis 1 agarose and spectrophotometry nanodrop nd 2000 thermo scientific de usa the extracted dna was transported to guangdong magigene biotechnology co ltd guangzhou china with dry ice for metagenomics analysis and approximately 5 μg of each dna sample was used for library construction and then sequenced briefly each high quality dna sample was used for 350 bp library construction using nebnext ultra dna library prep kit for illumina neb usa according to the manufacturer s instructions metagenomic sequencing was performed using the illumina hiseq platform 2500 with pe150 strategy the average raw reads were approximately 10 gb for each dna sample and the total data output exceeded 210 gb then metagenomic data were filtered and low quality reads that contained 10 ambiguous nucleotides 40 nucleotides with quality value lower than 38 or having 15 bp overlap with adapter sequences were removed 2 3 metagenomic assembly and bioinformatic analysis after quality filtering clean metagenomic data were de novo assembled using megahit software v1 1 2 with default parameters li et al 2015 assembled contigs with length 500 bp were subsequently used for predicting open reading frames orfs through metagenemark v3 25 following the default instructions zhu et al 2010 and non redundant orfs was acquired using cd hit software v4 6 8 under a criterion of 95 identity and 90 coverage to characterize args the basic local alignment search tool blastx was applied to annotate sequencing reads and predicted orfs against databases downloaded from the antibiotic resistance genes database ardb http ardb cbcb umd edu index html for args contigs were identified as having an arg like sequence if the best blastx hit had a similarity over 90 and an alignment longer than 25 amino acids yang et al 2013 similarly vgs were determined using the virulence factor database vfdb and the bacteria carrying vgs were regarded as potential pathogens zhang et al 2020 contigs containing potential args and vgs were regarded as potential parb liang et al 2020 mges including plasmids insertion sequences iss and integrons were identified using ncbi refseq plasmids databases isfinder databases and integrall databases with default instructions respectively guo et al 2017 the co occurring gene arrangements of args vgs and mges were further conducted to identify if these genes were simultaneously located on the same contig jia et al 2019 2 4 statistical analysis the alpha diversity were assessed by the shannon diversity index for args and pathogens and calculated according to previous protocols liu et al 2018b principal coordinate analysis pcoa was conducted to cluster sampling sites based on args to represent variations in their composition and analysis of similarity anosim was further conducted to confirm significant differences between different samples a heatmap was constructed to show arg relative abundances along the river furthermore bioenv analysis canonical correspondence analysis cca and mantel test were performed to determine the significant drivers affecting arg and parb compositions and the result was examined by monte carlo permutation tests the linear regression between the bray curtis dissimilarity of arg and land use was constructed to profile their relationship a null model test was conducted to evaluate the critical ecological processes shaping arg and parb based on previous literature peng et al 2020 stegen et al 2013 briefly mean nearest taxon distance metric βmntd was calculated to profile pairwise phylogenetic turnover among contigs identified as parb in different samples beta nearest taxon index βnti value was calculated to describe the difference between the observed βmntd and the mean of the null distribution of βmntd normalized by its standard deviation the modified raup crick index rcbray indicated deviation with the empirically observed bray curtis and βnti and rcbray were both used to quantify the relative importance of ecological processes according to text s2 in the supplementary material pearson correlation was used to determine the correlation between variables all statistical analyses were conducted in r version 3 5 1 with the vegan pheatmap and picante packages 3 results 3 1 diversity and relative abundance of antibiotic resistance genes and pathogens overall 119 arg subtypes resistant to 34 kinds of antibiotics were detected in the yarlung tsangpo river the number of arg subtypes in each sample ranged from 80 y1 in the pristine sites to 113 y3 in the urbanization areas the arg relative abundance range was constant along the yarlung tsangpo river with an average relative abundance in the pristine site urbanization area and dam regulation area of 3 59 10 4 3 64 10 4 and 3 51 10 4 of total metagenomic sequences respectively table s2 meanwhile arg diversity was significantly impacted by anthropogenic disturbances and the shannon index was 0 337 in the pristine site but 1 437 and 0 55 in the urbanization and dam regulation area respectively results showed that pathogen i e bacteria carrying vgs relative abundance in pristine sites urbanization areas and dam regulation areas was 0 129 0 121 and 0 129 respectively and did not significantly differ among them pathogen diversity was also in the same range along the river with shannon index of 5 33 5 34 and 5 32 in pristine sites urbanization areas and dam regulation areas respectively the relationship between args and pathogens was examined by pearson correlation analysis and the relative abundance of potential pathogens was not significantly correlated with args r 0 433 p 0 05 3 2 antibiotic resistance genes composition under anthropogenic disturbances differences in arg composition were determined using pcoa the 21 samples collected from yarlung tsangpo river were clearly separated into three groups fig 2 a with one group including all samples from pristine sites and the other two groups containing those from urbanization areas and dam regulation areas respectively this showed that arg composition significantly differed among sampling areas indicating that arg composition was differently impacted by urbanization and dam regulation furthermore anosim confirmed that arg composition varied significantly among sampling areas contrastingly the samples collected in the reservoir upstream and downstream of the dam were clustered into one group indicating that arg composition did not differ significantly along the river reservoir system in the dam regulated area considering arg compositions from different sampling areas fig 2 b c the baca gene resistant to bacitracin was the predominant arg in the yarlung tsangpo river accounting for 91 0 of total args the highest proportion of baca 98 1 was detected in y1 in urbanization and dam regulation areas baca percentage decreased and more diverse args were observed in the urbanization areas sul1 sulfonamide ant3ia spectinomycin tetc tetracycline acrb aminoglycoside and mexb tigecycline were promoted while acrb mdtl chloramphenicol and tolc aminoglycoside were slightly increased in dam regulation areas 3 3 relationship between antibiotic resistance genes and environmental factors the relationship between arg composition and environmental factors was determined by bioenv analysis table s3 and land use index was the optimal single parameter for explaining the variation of arg composition bioenv correlation 0 927 the optimal subset of environmental variables with the best correlation to arg composition were land use index and tn and its bioenv correlation was 0 934 moreover cca analysis showed that all selected variables explained 65 5 of arg variation table 1 land use index had the highest explanation rate for arg composition explaining 40 1 of total variation correlation analysis confirmed that the land use pattern significantly impacted arg composition with land use variation being significantly positively correlated with the dissimilarity of arg composition along the river fig s1 thus land use pattern was identified as the critical factor altering arg composition additionally the land use index was significantly related to total antibiotic concentration along the river r 0 910 p 0 01 and significantly affected antibiotic composition explaining 67 5 of antibiotic variation with statistical significance along the river 3 4 pathogenic antibiotic resistant bacteria identification in total 36 pathogenic species were identified as carrying args fig 3 a neisseria meningitidis 8013 and bordetella pertussis tohama i were the dominant parb along the river parb relative abundance ranged from 1 42 10 6 y1 to 5 97 10 5 y3 along the river anthropogenic activities had significant influence on parb relative abundances which were 3 54 and 1 55 fold higher in urbanization and dam regulation areas respectively than those in pristine sites parb relative abundance was significantly positively correlated with the land use index along the river r 0 758 p 0 01 3 5 mobile genetic element relative abundance and its correlation with pathogenic antibiotic resistant bacteria mge relative abundance ranged from 0 32 y2 to 0 76 y3 of total sequences along the river fig 3b plasmids were the dominant mges in the river accounting for 86 8 of mge relative abundance followed by iss 10 4 and integrons 2 80 the relationship between mges and parb was examined by pearson correlation analysis and parb percentage was significantly positively correlated with mge relative abundance fig 3c r 0 951 p 0 001 moreover we also characterized the coexistence of args and mges of the assembled contigs annotated as potential pathogens based on metagenomic analysis table s4 collectively we acquired 44 contigs harboring args and mges and assigned as pathogens with the largest number of co existing contigs in samples from urbanization areas which accounted for 30 out of 44 contigs in the river for example contigs carrying mges and args were found in citrobacter and acinetobacter in the urbanization area fig 3d in addition most contigs were annotated as citrobacter accounting for 81 9 of all contigs 3 6 null model analysis parb composition was not significantly clustered by sampling areas based on pcoa fig s2 and the environmental factors detected in our investigation could barely explain parb composition table 1 and s3 therefore the null model analysis was used to profile parb assembly processes stochastic processes were more dominant than deterministic processes in parb assembly fig 4 a 80 0 and 20 0 respectively considering stochastic processes dispersal limitation homogenizing dispersal and undominated stochastic processes were included and explained 49 0 4 8 and 26 2 of parb assembly respectively meanwhile deterministic processes including heterogeneous and homogeneous selection explained 15 2 and 4 8 of parb assembly processes respectively the relationship between rcbray and land use variation determined the anthropogenic disturbances on parb assembly processes fig 4b rcbray was significantly associated with land use index variation with rcbray distribution gradually increasing with increasing difference in land use from being consistent with undominated stochastic processes 0 95 rcbray 0 95 to be primarily consistent with dispersal limitation rcbray 0 95 moreover arg assembly processes were also analyzed based on the null model and heterogeneous selection was identified as the most essential process in arg assembly fig s3 4 discussion with human development anthropogenic activities increase in frequency worldwide and human impacted river systems are the most representative surface waters occurring globally in the modern aquatic environment human dominated river systems play a critical role in the occurrence and enrichment of biopollutants including args and pathogens cui et al 2019 xiang et al 2018 however the mechanisms of different anthropogenic disturbances affecting args particularly addressing arg transmission to pathogens still require further investigation at watershed scale this study was conducted in a large pristine river suffering from increasing urbanization and dam construction to describe the antibiotic resistome biogeography under these anthropogenic activities and intending to further elucidate the mechanisms affecting args especially arg dissemination to pathogens under different anthropogenic stresses 4 1 the effect of different anthropogenic activities on args distribution this was the first watershed scale study using metagenomic sequencing approach to reveal different emerging human induced effects on args in the pristine river in this study arg composition showed significant differences between human affected urbanized and dam regulated and pristine sites indicating that anthropogenic activities played critical roles in altering args this result agreed with those of previous investigations which suggested that anthropogenic activities had strong influence on arg occurrence and enrichment ma et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 meanwhile we also found that baca gene was the most common arg subtype along the yarlung tsangpo river and was predominant in the pristine area based on previous investigation baca gene is considered as intrinsic to bacteria and has been found in various bacterial genera in pristine niches hu et al 2013 the yarlung tsangpo river is regarded as being pristine owing to its glacier fed origin and the sparsity of surrounding human population wang et al 2016 and the prevalence of baca gene in the pristine tibetan environment has previously been described chen et al 2016 the dominance of baca gene confirmed that the pristine area in our study was seldom contaminated by anthropogenic activities after flowing into urbanization areas the river increased its arg diversity showing more arg subtypes than before sulfonamide and tetracycline are commonly used antibiotics and their relevant args are frequently detected in highly urbanized areas liu et al 2018a xiang et al 2018 yang et al 2018 our research also found these args to be highly promoted in urbanization areas especially in the y3 site located on the tributary lhasa river feeding into the river the lhasa river flows through the capital of the tibetan autonomous region lhasa city which serves as the center of politics economic activities religion culture and traffic liu et al 2020d therefore its anthropogenic pressures caused by rapid urbanization and associated human activities including antibiotic therapy agricultural runoffs and urban wastewater discharges contribute to a substantial antibiotic input and consequently promote the occurrence evolution and spread of args in surrounding environments liu et al 2020a zhu et al 2017 dam construction showed a different influence on args compared with that of urbanization as their samples were clustered into separate statistically significant groups in the dam regulated area baca still accounted for a high arg proportion and args related to chloramphenicol and aminoglycoside increased which differed from the urbanized area arg composition the zangmu dam was constructed in the natural environment dam construction and management camp might discharge different arg selective chemical compared with those of the urban environment liu et al 2020a interestingly within the dam regulated areas arg composition was relative stable along the river reservoir system as the samples collected in the reservoir upstream and downstream of the dam were clustered into the same group this was inconsistent with results of a previous study which detected the variation of environmental factors caused by dam regulation playing important roles to impact args in a drinking water river reservoir system chen et al 2019b this discrepancy may be attributed to the previous investigation having been conducted in the highly urbanized area with antibiotic concentrations magnitudes higher than those in zangmu dam in our study liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b owing to the low background value in the pristine environment construction and operation of zangmu dam might serve as major sources of arg selective chemicals from the whole river perspective and this effect could be preponderant over the environmental variation caused by dam regulation such as flow rate wu et al 2019 despite urbanization and dam construction significantly affecting arg composition their influence on arg relative abundance was negligible this might be caused by the yarlung tsangpo river suffering from minor anthropogenic disturbances e g the regional gross domestic product in tibet is 30 times lower than that in mega cities such as shanghai this result highlighted that even slight human induced selective pressure would diversify arg composition and thereby promote its health risk to humans and the environment czekalski et al 2015 based on our result land use index had the highest explanation rate for arg variation along the yarlung tsangpo river according to cca and arg dissimilarity was significantly positively correlated with land use dissimilarity which further confirmed the vital effect of land use pattern on args distribution recently several studies claimed that numerous antibiotic and non antibiotic antimicrobial chemicals discharged from human activities could serve as selective agents and play major roles in affecting args even at low concentrations andersson and hughes 2014 lu et al 2018 however it is difficult to quantify all these selective chemicals to explain how anthropogenic activities influence args in particular land use patterns can provide strong evidence of anthropogenic activities along rivers and play an important role in the occurrence of exogenous arg selective agents such as antibiotics and biocides in aquatic ecosystems hong et al 2020 wittmer et al 2010 in this study the land use index was measured by specific weighted values focusing on the land use percentages of cultivated land and artificial surfaces to indicate the land degradation level along the river ometo et al 2000 the land use indices in urbanization and dam regulation areas were higher than those in pristine sites urbanization areas had the highest land use index and cultivated land and artificial surfaces had the highest proportion along the river in dam regulation areas the proportion of artificial surfaces exceeded that of cultivated land this result is reasonable because high human habitation in urbanized areas increased the proportion of cultivated and artificial lands and concrete hydraulic structures increased the artificial surfaces in dam regulated areas we also found that total antibiotic concentration was positively related to the land use index along the yarlung tsangpo which confirmed that land use pattern could provide useful information of pollutant sources of arg selective chemicals hong et al 2020 thus the land use index could effectively reflect the different influence on args of anthropogenic activities including urbanizing and dam regulation 4 2 dissemination of args to pathogens under anthropogenic disturbances biopollutant contamination including args and pathogens is one of the most essential environmental problems in aquatic environments worldwide and leads to economic costs and human health risk petrillo and ogunseitan 2018 notably human pathogens share args with other environmental bacteria and arg acquisition by pathogens is among the most important risk factors for the safety of river ecosystems forsberg et al 2012 therefore our investigation profiled parb carrying both args and vgs to explore the dissemination of args to pathogens according to our results parb relative abundance was differently promoted by urbanization and dam construction being 3 54 and 1 55 times higher respectively than that in pristine areas without difference in arg and pathogen relative abundance this result highlighted the importance of considering the pathogenicity of arg hosts when assessing ecological risk of the antibiotic resistome the promoted parb relative abundance might be caused by anthropogenic activities facilitating the potential arg transmission into pathogens similar results have been detected in previous studies which provided theoretical support for the tendency of args and vgs to coevolve in pathogenic genomes under anthropogenic pressure escudeiro et al 2019 liang et al 2020 arg dissemination in human impacted environments mainly occurs through promiscuous gene transfers between bacterial hosts or genetic locations i e horizontal gene transfers and requires mges as the carriers thus mge presence was investigated to assess the horizontal transfer potential of args among bacteria chen et al 2019a based on our results the change in mge relative abundance under anthropogenic pollution was different between the urbanization and dam construction areas which is similar to the finding of gillings et al gillings et al 2015 the distinct mge relative abundance suggested different horizontal arg transferability under these anthropogenic disturbances which might be responsible for the increased parb relative abundance zhang et al 2020 additionally we found that mge relative abundance was significantly positively correlated with that of parb which confirmed the effect of mges on arg acquisition by pathogens gene arrangement revealed that the contigs carrying args and mges and assigned as pathogens were more frequently detected in the urbanization area than in other areas along the river and this area also showed increased parb relative abundance as these contigs were mostly annotated as citrobacter citrobacter could be regard as the hotspot of arg dissemination in pathogens above all it is concluded that mges play vital roles in the transamination of environmental args to pathogens han et al 2020 sidhu et al 2020 it should be considered that our study was conducted in a relatively underdeveloped region and even minor anthropogenic disturbances could gather mges and contribute to the arg disseminations to pathogens moreover the variation of parb composition can be barely explained by the environmental factors selected in our study therefore our study further assessed this variation based on its assembly processes this is the first study addressing the parb assembly processes by null model analysis and we found that the stochastic processes dominated in parb assembly at the watershed scale along the yarlung tsangpo river stochastic processes comprise random birth death immigration emigration and dispersal events causing patterns of species composition that are indistinguishable from those produced by random chance chave 2004 in contrast deterministic processes involve the ecological selection of abiotic and biotic factors to alter species fitness and consequently determine the composition and coexistence of communities chesson 2000 notably as a dangerous part of args parb had distinct assembly processes compared with those of the whole arg community as arg assembly was primarily dominated by deterministic selection peng et al 2020 this may be one of the reasons that arg and parb communities exhibited a decoupling change under anthropogenic disturbances fang et al 2019 thus we can speculate that every arg category might be randomly grabbed for horizontal gene transfer and every single arg might have equal opportunity to be transmitted to the pathogens we also found that anthropogenic activities could influence parb assembly processes with increasing variation of land degradation the stochastic processes of parb assembly shifted from undominated stochastic processes i e random birth death and reproduction of drift to dispersal limitation i e inhibition of microorganism transportation leading to distinct community structures as stochastic processes dominated parb assembly the distinct immigration of microorganism from different human impacted environments probably played an important role in structuring the parb community the movement of these microorganisms to a long distance location could be restricted and consequently lead to dispersal limitation liu et al 2015 therefore it is suggested that the difference in land use pattern and associated human activities should be considered in large scale ecological parb evaluations in the river ecosystem from the perspective of watershed management the obtained results provide useful information for improving ecological evaluation efficacy for the environmental antibiotic resistome and reducing arg dissemination to pathogens 5 conclusions in summary our study revealed the antibiotic resistome variation under different anthropogenic disturbances along the yarlung tsangpo river on the tibetan plateau arg composition was differently influenced by urbanization and dam construction land use pattern could directly reflect the land degradation level along the river and was identified as a critical factor influencing arg composition moreover despite the lack of variation in arg relative abundance parb were differently promoted by urbanizing and dam construction areas the human impacted environment harbored a high proportion of mges and thereby contributed significantly to parb enrichment furthermore mges carrying args increased in the pathogenic hosts under anthropogenic disturbances which confirmed the importance of mges in arg migration to pathogens moreover anthropogenic activities could also influence the parb assembly processes stochastic processes dominated parb assembly and with increasing level of land degradation these processes shifted from undominated stochastic processes to dispersal limitation thus our study highlighted the importance of parb in revealing the threats posed by environmental antibiotic resistance and provides a useful strategy to control the dissemination of args to pathogens in watershed management supplementary material table

16803,human activities can accelerate the antibiotic resistome prevalence and pose threats to ecological safety and public health globally however antibiotic resistance gene arg mobility and dissemination into bacterial pathogens under anthropogenic disturbances are still poorly understood here we used a metagenomic approach to profile the biogeography of args and pathogenic antibiotic resistant bacteria parb under anthropogenic disturbances along the yarlung tsangpo river results showed the args was dominated by baca gene along the yarlung tsangpo river on the tibetan plateau the arg composition was differently impacted by rapid urbanization and dam construction which urbanization could promote args resistant to sulfonamide and tetracycline whereas dam construction could elevate the resistance to chloramphenicol and aminoglycoside land use pattern was identified as a critical factor influencing arg composition under anthropogenic disturbances as it could directly reflect the land degradation level and indicate the inputs of arg selective chemicals of different human activities moreover despite of the lack of variation in arg relative abundance parb were highly promoted by anthropogenic activities indicating increasing arg dissemination to pathogen we found that human impacted environments harbored high proportion of mobile genetic elements mges and the mge carrying args also increased under anthropogenic disturbances in the pathogenic hosts which confirmed that anthropogenic activities could promote arg horizontal gene transfer furthermore anthropogenic activities could influence parb assembly processes basically stochastic processes dominated parb assembly along the river and with increasing level of anthropogenic activities these processes shifted from undominated stochastic processes to dispersal limitation in summary this study provides useful strategies in watershed resistome management and reduction of arg dissemination to pathogens which should consider the mode and intensity of human activity and its potential influence on horizontal gene transfer and assembly processes graphical abstracts image graphical abstract keywords arg

1928 antibiotics were regarded as the panacea for microbial infections and have since been immensely overused in human therapy veterinary aquaculture and agriculture yang et al 2018 however owing to their extensive application and continuous release antibiotics have led to the rapid spread of antibiotic resistance genes args to environments allen et al 2010 args have been identified as emerging contaminants pruden et al 2006 and are receiving increasing attention from public researchers and governments worldwide bengtsson palme and larsson 2015 karkman et al 2018 furthermore human pathogens share args with environmental microorganisms forsberg et al 2012 pehrsson et al 2016 and args can be disseminated from microorganisms to pathogens through horizontal gene transfer with the help of mobile genetic elements mges such as integrons and transposons in the environment chen et al 2013 thomas and nielsen 2005 once pathogens have acquired args they are considered as pathogenic antibiotic resistant bacteria parb carrying both args and virulence genes vgs liang et al 2020 args allow parb to survive antibiotic therapy and vgs enable them to reside within a host and enhance its potential to cause disease lee et al 2013 wu et al 2008 thus parb rather than args themselves are the high priority and ultimate target for evaluating the health risk of antibiotic resistome martínez et al 2015 river systems are a vital component of freshwater ecosystems and provide crucial resources for human society and ecosystems however they are a reservoir of various biopollutants including args and pathogens which inevitably gather from different wastewater sources marti et al 2014 peng et al 2020 wu et al 2019 and can cause arg transmission to pathogens reducing therapeutic potential against pathogens and leading to high risk for human health ma et al 2019 in recent decades a wide range of investigations have focused on args pathogens and their coexistence patterns in river systems liang et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 with both args and pathogens being ubiquitously detected in river systems however how args are disseminated to pathogens is still under debate a previous study only reported a strong positive correlation between args and pathogens zhang et al 2016 and increasing evidence indicates that the relationship between args and vgs is complex and adjusted in a way that improves the pathogen survival pan et al 2020 revealing the ecological processes underlying parb assembly is essential for the understanding the coexistence pattern of args and pathogens liu et al 2018a although the assembly mechanisms of microbial community structure have previously been reported the ecological mechanisms of parb assembly remain unclear guo et al 2018 basically stochastic and deterministic processes are the main ecological processes driving community assembly with growing evidence that microbial biogeographic patterns are simultaneously shaped by these processes zhou and ning 2017 therefore the relative influence of stochastic and deterministic factors on parb assembly should be investigated to uncover how args are transmitted to pathogens and contribute to the prevention and control of their enrichment and spread in this study we focused on the tibetan plateau a unique region with complex interactions between environmental geographic and hydrological processes which plays a crucial role in the earth s biodiversity and water cycle immerzeel et al 2010 as the longest river on the tibetan plateau the yarlung tsangpo river harbors extensive hydropower potential which plays socioeconomic and ecological roles in china similar to several large rivers worldwide the yarlung tsangpo river has recently experienced increasing anthropogenic activities such as urbanization and hydropower station construction thus the deterioration of water quality in the river and public health in the region due to anthropogenic activities has increasingly attracted the attention of policymakers and researchers although several studies have been conducted to show anthropogenic disturbances on the hydrochemistry or bacterioplankton diversity the emerging biopollutant antibiotic resistome remains largely ignored hren et al 2007 wang et al 2017 anthropogenic disturbances are responsible for the occurrence of args and pathogens in river systems and effluents from various anthropogenic activities such as hospitals municipal treatment plants and pharmaceutical industries could increase args and pathogens in the receiving river jia et al 2017 ju et al 2016 pruden et al 2012 however previous studies mainly focused on the influence of single pollutant sources on args and pathogens at a local scale and our understanding of the effect of anthropogenic activities on antibiotic resistome at the watershed scale is still limited particularly considering the rapid urbanization and hydropower station construction to address this knowledge gap we conducted metagenomic analysis to profile the antibiotic resistome along the yarlung tsangpo river on the tibetan plateau aiming to 1 investigate the effect of different anthropogenic activities on arg distribution at watershed scale and 2 reveal the ecological mechanisms of arg transmission to pathogens 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area sampling procedure and physicochemical analysis the yarlung tsangpo river is situated on the tibetan plateau with a total length of 2 840 km and catchment area of 9 35 105 km2 it originates from a glacier on the northern slope of the himalayas which is considered pristine the urbanized region including the capital of the tibetan autonomous region lhasa city is located midstream along the river and downstream the zangmu dam i e the first dam constructed in the yarlung tsangpo river began operation in 2015 with a reservoir capacity of 8 66 107 m3 sampling was conducted in november 2017 along the yarlung tsangpo river from rinbung county to gyaca county fig 1 seven sites were sampled along the river including two in pristine sites y1 and y2 two in urbanization areas y3 and y4 and three in dam regulation areas y5 y6 and y7 for pristine sites y1 represented those far from anthropogenic activities whereas y2 was near urbanization areas meanwhile y3 was located in the lhasa river which is a tributary of the yarlung tsangpo and serves as an urban river of lhasa city and y4 was situated downstream of the junction of lhasa river finally y5 y6 and y7 were in the reservoir upstream and downstream of the zangmu dam respectively at each sampling site geographical data longitude latitude and distance between sampling sites were recorded by a gpsmap 62s device garmin ks usa table s1 land use information at each sampling site was obtained from the national geomatics center of china and then quantified jun et al 2014 liu et al 2020c land use index was use to indicate the degradation level of multiple lands in the river basin calculated as the sum of different land use weighted by the specific values within 10 km buffer zones around the sampling sites detailed information on land use quantification is provided in the

electrical conductivity ec of river water were determined in situ during sampling by hq40d multiparameter water quality analyzer hach co usa water turbidity was also determined during sample collection with a 2100 p turbidimeter hach co usa to avoid deviation three 2 l water samples were collected at each sampling site within 10 meters along the river and then homogenized as one sample and each sample was obtained at a depth of 50 cm using a hydrobios ruttner sampler altenholz germany from each site 1 5 l of collected water sample was stored in pre sterilized polyethylene bottles at 4 c for dissolved organic carbon doc and total nitrogen tn analysis in the laboratory doc was measured by the elementar liquid toc analyzer frankfurt germany and tn was determined colorimetrically after acid hydrolysis with persulfate digestion 30 min 120 c to gather the microorganisms the remaining 4 5 l of water from each site was equally filtered into three replicate filters using 0 22 μm pore prewashed polycarbonate filters millipore ma usa by vacuum filtration the filters were immediately stored in sterile 50 ml centrifuge tubes at 20 c and then transported to the laboratory for dna extraction antibiotic concentrations at the sampling sites was obtained from a previous study liu et al 2020a conducted in the same study area 2 2 dna extraction metagenomics sequencing and quality filtering total genomic dna was extracted from each filter using the powerwater dna extraction kit mobio carlsbad ca usa based on the manufacturer s protocol dna quantity and quality were determined using gel electrophoresis 1 agarose and spectrophotometry nanodrop nd 2000 thermo scientific de usa the extracted dna was transported to guangdong magigene biotechnology co ltd guangzhou china with dry ice for metagenomics analysis and approximately 5 μg of each dna sample was used for library construction and then sequenced briefly each high quality dna sample was used for 350 bp library construction using nebnext ultra dna library prep kit for illumina neb usa according to the manufacturer s instructions metagenomic sequencing was performed using the illumina hiseq platform 2500 with pe150 strategy the average raw reads were approximately 10 gb for each dna sample and the total data output exceeded 210 gb then metagenomic data were filtered and low quality reads that contained 10 ambiguous nucleotides 40 nucleotides with quality value lower than 38 or having 15 bp overlap with adapter sequences were removed 2 3 metagenomic assembly and bioinformatic analysis after quality filtering clean metagenomic data were de novo assembled using megahit software v1 1 2 with default parameters li et al 2015 assembled contigs with length 500 bp were subsequently used for predicting open reading frames orfs through metagenemark v3 25 following the default instructions zhu et al 2010 and non redundant orfs was acquired using cd hit software v4 6 8 under a criterion of 95 identity and 90 coverage to characterize args the basic local alignment search tool blastx was applied to annotate sequencing reads and predicted orfs against databases downloaded from the antibiotic resistance genes database ardb http ardb cbcb umd edu index html for args contigs were identified as having an arg like sequence if the best blastx hit had a similarity over 90 and an alignment longer than 25 amino acids yang et al 2013 similarly vgs were determined using the virulence factor database vfdb and the bacteria carrying vgs were regarded as potential pathogens zhang et al 2020 contigs containing potential args and vgs were regarded as potential parb liang et al 2020 mges including plasmids insertion sequences iss and integrons were identified using ncbi refseq plasmids databases isfinder databases and integrall databases with default instructions respectively guo et al 2017 the co occurring gene arrangements of args vgs and mges were further conducted to identify if these genes were simultaneously located on the same contig jia et al 2019 2 4 statistical analysis the alpha diversity were assessed by the shannon diversity index for args and pathogens and calculated according to previous protocols liu et al 2018b principal coordinate analysis pcoa was conducted to cluster sampling sites based on args to represent variations in their composition and analysis of similarity anosim was further conducted to confirm significant differences between different samples a heatmap was constructed to show arg relative abundances along the river furthermore bioenv analysis canonical correspondence analysis cca and mantel test were performed to determine the significant drivers affecting arg and parb compositions and the result was examined by monte carlo permutation tests the linear regression between the bray curtis dissimilarity of arg and land use was constructed to profile their relationship a null model test was conducted to evaluate the critical ecological processes shaping arg and parb based on previous literature peng et al 2020 stegen et al 2013 briefly mean nearest taxon distance metric βmntd was calculated to profile pairwise phylogenetic turnover among contigs identified as parb in different samples beta nearest taxon index βnti value was calculated to describe the difference between the observed βmntd and the mean of the null distribution of βmntd normalized by its standard deviation the modified raup crick index rcbray indicated deviation with the empirically observed bray curtis and βnti and rcbray were both used to quantify the relative importance of ecological processes according to text s2 in the supplementary material pearson correlation was used to determine the correlation between variables all statistical analyses were conducted in r version 3 5 1 with the vegan pheatmap and picante packages 3 results 3 1 diversity and relative abundance of antibiotic resistance genes and pathogens overall 119 arg subtypes resistant to 34 kinds of antibiotics were detected in the yarlung tsangpo river the number of arg subtypes in each sample ranged from 80 y1 in the pristine sites to 113 y3 in the urbanization areas the arg relative abundance range was constant along the yarlung tsangpo river with an average relative abundance in the pristine site urbanization area and dam regulation area of 3 59 10 4 3 64 10 4 and 3 51 10 4 of total metagenomic sequences respectively table s2 meanwhile arg diversity was significantly impacted by anthropogenic disturbances and the shannon index was 0 337 in the pristine site but 1 437 and 0 55 in the urbanization and dam regulation area respectively results showed that pathogen i e bacteria carrying vgs relative abundance in pristine sites urbanization areas and dam regulation areas was 0 129 0 121 and 0 129 respectively and did not significantly differ among them pathogen diversity was also in the same range along the river with shannon index of 5 33 5 34 and 5 32 in pristine sites urbanization areas and dam regulation areas respectively the relationship between args and pathogens was examined by pearson correlation analysis and the relative abundance of potential pathogens was not significantly correlated with args r 0 433 p 0 05 3 2 antibiotic resistance genes composition under anthropogenic disturbances differences in arg composition were determined using pcoa the 21 samples collected from yarlung tsangpo river were clearly separated into three groups fig 2 a with one group including all samples from pristine sites and the other two groups containing those from urbanization areas and dam regulation areas respectively this showed that arg composition significantly differed among sampling areas indicating that arg composition was differently impacted by urbanization and dam regulation furthermore anosim confirmed that arg composition varied significantly among sampling areas contrastingly the samples collected in the reservoir upstream and downstream of the dam were clustered into one group indicating that arg composition did not differ significantly along the river reservoir system in the dam regulated area considering arg compositions from different sampling areas fig 2 b c the baca gene resistant to bacitracin was the predominant arg in the yarlung tsangpo river accounting for 91 0 of total args the highest proportion of baca 98 1 was detected in y1 in urbanization and dam regulation areas baca percentage decreased and more diverse args were observed in the urbanization areas sul1 sulfonamide ant3ia spectinomycin tetc tetracycline acrb aminoglycoside and mexb tigecycline were promoted while acrb mdtl chloramphenicol and tolc aminoglycoside were slightly increased in dam regulation areas 3 3 relationship between antibiotic resistance genes and environmental factors the relationship between arg composition and environmental factors was determined by bioenv analysis table s3 and land use index was the optimal single parameter for explaining the variation of arg composition bioenv correlation 0 927 the optimal subset of environmental variables with the best correlation to arg composition were land use index and tn and its bioenv correlation was 0 934 moreover cca analysis showed that all selected variables explained 65 5 of arg variation table 1 land use index had the highest explanation rate for arg composition explaining 40 1 of total variation correlation analysis confirmed that the land use pattern significantly impacted arg composition with land use variation being significantly positively correlated with the dissimilarity of arg composition along the river fig s1 thus land use pattern was identified as the critical factor altering arg composition additionally the land use index was significantly related to total antibiotic concentration along the river r 0 910 p 0 01 and significantly affected antibiotic composition explaining 67 5 of antibiotic variation with statistical significance along the river 3 4 pathogenic antibiotic resistant bacteria identification in total 36 pathogenic species were identified as carrying args fig 3 a neisseria meningitidis 8013 and bordetella pertussis tohama i were the dominant parb along the river parb relative abundance ranged from 1 42 10 6 y1 to 5 97 10 5 y3 along the river anthropogenic activities had significant influence on parb relative abundances which were 3 54 and 1 55 fold higher in urbanization and dam regulation areas respectively than those in pristine sites parb relative abundance was significantly positively correlated with the land use index along the river r 0 758 p 0 01 3 5 mobile genetic element relative abundance and its correlation with pathogenic antibiotic resistant bacteria mge relative abundance ranged from 0 32 y2 to 0 76 y3 of total sequences along the river fig 3b plasmids were the dominant mges in the river accounting for 86 8 of mge relative abundance followed by iss 10 4 and integrons 2 80 the relationship between mges and parb was examined by pearson correlation analysis and parb percentage was significantly positively correlated with mge relative abundance fig 3c r 0 951 p 0 001 moreover we also characterized the coexistence of args and mges of the assembled contigs annotated as potential pathogens based on metagenomic analysis table s4 collectively we acquired 44 contigs harboring args and mges and assigned as pathogens with the largest number of co existing contigs in samples from urbanization areas which accounted for 30 out of 44 contigs in the river for example contigs carrying mges and args were found in citrobacter and acinetobacter in the urbanization area fig 3d in addition most contigs were annotated as citrobacter accounting for 81 9 of all contigs 3 6 null model analysis parb composition was not significantly clustered by sampling areas based on pcoa fig s2 and the environmental factors detected in our investigation could barely explain parb composition table 1 and s3 therefore the null model analysis was used to profile parb assembly processes stochastic processes were more dominant than deterministic processes in parb assembly fig 4 a 80 0 and 20 0 respectively considering stochastic processes dispersal limitation homogenizing dispersal and undominated stochastic processes were included and explained 49 0 4 8 and 26 2 of parb assembly respectively meanwhile deterministic processes including heterogeneous and homogeneous selection explained 15 2 and 4 8 of parb assembly processes respectively the relationship between rcbray and land use variation determined the anthropogenic disturbances on parb assembly processes fig 4b rcbray was significantly associated with land use index variation with rcbray distribution gradually increasing with increasing difference in land use from being consistent with undominated stochastic processes 0 95 rcbray 0 95 to be primarily consistent with dispersal limitation rcbray 0 95 moreover arg assembly processes were also analyzed based on the null model and heterogeneous selection was identified as the most essential process in arg assembly fig s3 4 discussion with human development anthropogenic activities increase in frequency worldwide and human impacted river systems are the most representative surface waters occurring globally in the modern aquatic environment human dominated river systems play a critical role in the occurrence and enrichment of biopollutants including args and pathogens cui et al 2019 xiang et al 2018 however the mechanisms of different anthropogenic disturbances affecting args particularly addressing arg transmission to pathogens still require further investigation at watershed scale this study was conducted in a large pristine river suffering from increasing urbanization and dam construction to describe the antibiotic resistome biogeography under these anthropogenic activities and intending to further elucidate the mechanisms affecting args especially arg dissemination to pathogens under different anthropogenic stresses 4 1 the effect of different anthropogenic activities on args distribution this was the first watershed scale study using metagenomic sequencing approach to reveal different emerging human induced effects on args in the pristine river in this study arg composition showed significant differences between human affected urbanized and dam regulated and pristine sites indicating that anthropogenic activities played critical roles in altering args this result agreed with those of previous investigations which suggested that anthropogenic activities had strong influence on arg occurrence and enrichment ma et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 meanwhile we also found that baca gene was the most common arg subtype along the yarlung tsangpo river and was predominant in the pristine area based on previous investigation baca gene is considered as intrinsic to bacteria and has been found in various bacterial genera in pristine niches hu et al 2013 the yarlung tsangpo river is regarded as being pristine owing to its glacier fed origin and the sparsity of surrounding human population wang et al 2016 and the prevalence of baca gene in the pristine tibetan environment has previously been described chen et al 2016 the dominance of baca gene confirmed that the pristine area in our study was seldom contaminated by anthropogenic activities after flowing into urbanization areas the river increased its arg diversity showing more arg subtypes than before sulfonamide and tetracycline are commonly used antibiotics and their relevant args are frequently detected in highly urbanized areas liu et al 2018a xiang et al 2018 yang et al 2018 our research also found these args to be highly promoted in urbanization areas especially in the y3 site located on the tributary lhasa river feeding into the river the lhasa river flows through the capital of the tibetan autonomous region lhasa city which serves as the center of politics economic activities religion culture and traffic liu et al 2020d therefore its anthropogenic pressures caused by rapid urbanization and associated human activities including antibiotic therapy agricultural runoffs and urban wastewater discharges contribute to a substantial antibiotic input and consequently promote the occurrence evolution and spread of args in surrounding environments liu et al 2020a zhu et al 2017 dam construction showed a different influence on args compared with that of urbanization as their samples were clustered into separate statistically significant groups in the dam regulated area baca still accounted for a high arg proportion and args related to chloramphenicol and aminoglycoside increased which differed from the urbanized area arg composition the zangmu dam was constructed in the natural environment dam construction and management camp might discharge different arg selective chemical compared with those of the urban environment liu et al 2020a interestingly within the dam regulated areas arg composition was relative stable along the river reservoir system as the samples collected in the reservoir upstream and downstream of the dam were clustered into the same group this was inconsistent with results of a previous study which detected the variation of environmental factors caused by dam regulation playing important roles to impact args in a drinking water river reservoir system chen et al 2019b this discrepancy may be attributed to the previous investigation having been conducted in the highly urbanized area with antibiotic concentrations magnitudes higher than those in zangmu dam in our study liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b owing to the low background value in the pristine environment construction and operation of zangmu dam might serve as major sources of arg selective chemicals from the whole river perspective and this effect could be preponderant over the environmental variation caused by dam regulation such as flow rate wu et al 2019 despite urbanization and dam construction significantly affecting arg composition their influence on arg relative abundance was negligible this might be caused by the yarlung tsangpo river suffering from minor anthropogenic disturbances e g the regional gross domestic product in tibet is 30 times lower than that in mega cities such as shanghai this result highlighted that even slight human induced selective pressure would diversify arg composition and thereby promote its health risk to humans and the environment czekalski et al 2015 based on our result land use index had the highest explanation rate for arg variation along the yarlung tsangpo river according to cca and arg dissimilarity was significantly positively correlated with land use dissimilarity which further confirmed the vital effect of land use pattern on args distribution recently several studies claimed that numerous antibiotic and non antibiotic antimicrobial chemicals discharged from human activities could serve as selective agents and play major roles in affecting args even at low concentrations andersson and hughes 2014 lu et al 2018 however it is difficult to quantify all these selective chemicals to explain how anthropogenic activities influence args in particular land use patterns can provide strong evidence of anthropogenic activities along rivers and play an important role in the occurrence of exogenous arg selective agents such as antibiotics and biocides in aquatic ecosystems hong et al 2020 wittmer et al 2010 in this study the land use index was measured by specific weighted values focusing on the land use percentages of cultivated land and artificial surfaces to indicate the land degradation level along the river ometo et al 2000 the land use indices in urbanization and dam regulation areas were higher than those in pristine sites urbanization areas had the highest land use index and cultivated land and artificial surfaces had the highest proportion along the river in dam regulation areas the proportion of artificial surfaces exceeded that of cultivated land this result is reasonable because high human habitation in urbanized areas increased the proportion of cultivated and artificial lands and concrete hydraulic structures increased the artificial surfaces in dam regulated areas we also found that total antibiotic concentration was positively related to the land use index along the yarlung tsangpo which confirmed that land use pattern could provide useful information of pollutant sources of arg selective chemicals hong et al 2020 thus the land use index could effectively reflect the different influence on args of anthropogenic activities including urbanizing and dam regulation 4 2 dissemination of args to pathogens under anthropogenic disturbances biopollutant contamination including args and pathogens is one of the most essential environmental problems in aquatic environments worldwide and leads to economic costs and human health risk petrillo and ogunseitan 2018 notably human pathogens share args with other environmental bacteria and arg acquisition by pathogens is among the most important risk factors for the safety of river ecosystems forsberg et al 2012 therefore our investigation profiled parb carrying both args and vgs to explore the dissemination of args to pathogens according to our results parb relative abundance was differently promoted by urbanization and dam construction being 3 54 and 1 55 times higher respectively than that in pristine areas without difference in arg and pathogen relative abundance this result highlighted the importance of considering the pathogenicity of arg hosts when assessing ecological risk of the antibiotic resistome the promoted parb relative abundance might be caused by anthropogenic activities facilitating the potential arg transmission into pathogens similar results have been detected in previous studies which provided theoretical support for the tendency of args and vgs to coevolve in pathogenic genomes under anthropogenic pressure escudeiro et al 2019 liang et al 2020 arg dissemination in human impacted environments mainly occurs through promiscuous gene transfers between bacterial hosts or genetic locations i e horizontal gene transfers and requires mges as the carriers thus mge presence was investigated to assess the horizontal transfer potential of args among bacteria chen et al 2019a based on our results the change in mge relative abundance under anthropogenic pollution was different between the urbanization and dam construction areas which is similar to the finding of gillings et al gillings et al 2015 the distinct mge relative abundance suggested different horizontal arg transferability under these anthropogenic disturbances which might be responsible for the increased parb relative abundance zhang et al 2020 additionally we found that mge relative abundance was significantly positively correlated with that of parb which confirmed the effect of mges on arg acquisition by pathogens gene arrangement revealed that the contigs carrying args and mges and assigned as pathogens were more frequently detected in the urbanization area than in other areas along the river and this area also showed increased parb relative abundance as these contigs were mostly annotated as citrobacter citrobacter could be regard as the hotspot of arg dissemination in pathogens above all it is concluded that mges play vital roles in the transamination of environmental args to pathogens han et al 2020 sidhu et al 2020 it should be considered that our study was conducted in a relatively underdeveloped region and even minor anthropogenic disturbances could gather mges and contribute to the arg disseminations to pathogens moreover the variation of parb composition can be barely explained by the environmental factors selected in our study therefore our study further assessed this variation based on its assembly processes this is the first study addressing the parb assembly processes by null model analysis and we found that the stochastic processes dominated in parb assembly at the watershed scale along the yarlung tsangpo river stochastic processes comprise random birth death immigration emigration and dispersal events causing patterns of species composition that are indistinguishable from those produced by random chance chave 2004 in contrast deterministic processes involve the ecological selection of abiotic and biotic factors to alter species fitness and consequently determine the composition and coexistence of communities chesson 2000 notably as a dangerous part of args parb had distinct assembly processes compared with those of the whole arg community as arg assembly was primarily dominated by deterministic selection peng et al 2020 this may be one of the reasons that arg and parb communities exhibited a decoupling change under anthropogenic disturbances fang et al 2019 thus we can speculate that every arg category might be randomly grabbed for horizontal gene transfer and every single arg might have equal opportunity to be transmitted to the pathogens we also found that anthropogenic activities could influence parb assembly processes with increasing variation of land degradation the stochastic processes of parb assembly shifted from undominated stochastic processes i e random birth death and reproduction of drift to dispersal limitation i e inhibition of microorganism transportation leading to distinct community structures as stochastic processes dominated parb assembly the distinct immigration of microorganism from different human impacted environments probably played an important role in structuring the parb community the movement of these microorganisms to a long distance location could be restricted and consequently lead to dispersal limitation liu et al 2015 therefore it is suggested that the difference in land use pattern and associated human activities should be considered in large scale ecological parb evaluations in the river ecosystem from the perspective of watershed management the obtained results provide useful information for improving ecological evaluation efficacy for the environmental antibiotic resistome and reducing arg dissemination to pathogens 5 conclusions in summary our study revealed the antibiotic resistome variation under different anthropogenic disturbances along the yarlung tsangpo river on the tibetan plateau arg composition was differently influenced by urbanization and dam construction land use pattern could directly reflect the land degradation level along the river and was identified as a critical factor influencing arg composition moreover despite the lack of variation in arg relative abundance parb were differently promoted by urbanizing and dam construction areas the human impacted environment harbored a high proportion of mges and thereby contributed significantly to parb enrichment furthermore mges carrying args increased in the pathogenic hosts under anthropogenic disturbances which confirmed the importance of mges in arg migration to pathogens moreover anthropogenic activities could also influence the parb assembly processes stochastic processes dominated parb assembly and with increasing level of land degradation these processes shifted from undominated stochastic processes to dispersal limitation thus our study highlighted the importance of parb in revealing the threats posed by environmental antibiotic resistance and provides a useful strategy to control the dissemination of args to pathogens in watershed management supplementary material table

16804,the anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process is regarded as a promising approach to treat antibiotic containing wastewater therefore it is urgent to elucidate the effects of various antibiotics on the anammox process moreover the mechanism of extracellular polymeric substance eps as protective barriers to relieve antibiotic stress remain unclear therefore the single and combined effects of erythromycin etc and sulfamethoxazole smz and interactions between eps and antibiotics were investigated in this study based on a 228 day continuous flow experiment high concentrations of etc and smz had significant inhibitory effects on the nitrogen removal performance of the anammox process with the abundances of corresponding antibiotic resistance genes args increasing in addition the combined inhibitory effect of the two antibiotics on the anammox process was more significant and longer lasting than that of the single however the anammox process was able to quickly recover from deterioration the tolerance of anammox granules to the stress of low concentration antibiotics was probably attributed to the increase in args and secretion of eps molecular docking simulation results showed that proteins in eps could directly bind with smz and etc at the sites of glu 307 hys 191 asp 318 and thr 32 respectively these findings improved our understanding of various antibiotic effects on the anammox process and the interaction mechanism between antibiotics and proteins in eps graphical abstracts image graphical abstract keywords anammox antibiotics args eps molecular docking simulation 1 introduction the prevalence of antibiotic resistance is of great concern for public health with the increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance genes args and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb in various environments wastewater treatment plants wwtps are recognized as sinks of args and arb due to the high level of residual antibiotics guo et al 2017 for example wastewaters from wwtps were generally found to contain sulfamethoxazole smz and its concentration ranged from 0 2 to 2 4 mg l 1 depending on the wastewater treatment stage shelver and shappell 2008 erythromycin etc was also frequently detected in effluents and surface water with the concentration at the μg l 1 level kim et al 2007 wu et al 2014 therefore achieving the simultaneous efficient removal of antibiotics and nitrogen is urgent for current wastewater treatment anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox has been regarded as an efficient biological nitrogen removal technology in antibiotic wastewater treatment due to its low sludge production and operating cost van de graaf et al 1995 notably the performance of the anammox process is frequently affected by operational parameters e g temperature hydraulic retention time substrate concentrations nitrite and ammonia and pollutants in wastewater e g heavy metals nanoparticles antibiotics jin et al 2012 thus it is necessary to clarify the response of anammox bacteria to these inhibitory compounds with the extensive utilization of antibiotics the diverse effects of various antibiotics on the nitrogen removal of the anammox process have been reported previously such as oxytetracycline yang et al 2013 norfloxacin zhang et al 2018b and spiramycin jing et al 2020 in most cases antibiotics commonly coexist with other pollutants thus their co selective pressures on the anammox process have also been studied in recent years fu et al 2020 however most experiments were performed through batch tests in the short term with a focus on biomass properties and nitrogen removal performance few studies have evaluated and compared the single and combined effects of different pollutants on the anammox process in the long term zhang et al 2016 examined the single and combined impacts of oxytetracycline and cu2 and proposed that the formation of a cu oxytetracycline complex reduced the toxicity of both materials to anammox bacteria the performance of the anammox process under individual and combined stresses of oxytetracycline and sulfamethoxazole was also tested zhang et al 2019a the results showed that the resistance of the anammox process to both antibiotics was higher than that of each antibiotic in contrast the combined inhibition of zn2 and tetracycline on the anammox process performance and bacterial activity was more significant fan et al 2019 based on previous results different antibiotics have different influences on anammox consortia zhang et al 2020a therefore it is still necessary to further enrich our knowledge of the performance and microbial responses of anammox bacteria to various antibiotics and the corresponding mechanism previous studies showed that toxic pollutants frequently induce the secretion of extracellular polymeric substance eps which is also an effective barrier for anammox bacteria to resist antibiotics wang et al 2018 it has been reported that the resistance of the anammox system to smz might be related to eps zhang et al 2019a zhang et al zhang et al 2020b proposed that eps addition was able to effectively maintain anammox activity during long term storage under starvation it is concluded that eps plays an important role in protecting anammox bacteria eps contains abundant and diverse proteinaceous components to facilitate adsorption of antibiotics from wastewater via the amine and carboxyl groups yu 2020 zhang et al 2018a reported that the eps of sulfate reducing bacteria srb sludge possessed high hydrophobicity and binding strength between eps and ciprofloxacin however the functions of the anammox eps and its interaction with antibiotics remain to be elucidated etc and smz are typical macrolide and sulfanilamide antibiotics that have been widely used in treating human and animal diseases to date their combined effects on the anammox process have remained unclear therefore this work comprehensively revealed the response of the anammox process to the single and combined stresses of the two antibiotics in addition the potential binding sites between proteins in eps and antibiotics were proposed based on molecular docking simulation which helped to broaden the understanding of eps functions in preventing antibiotic stress 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge inoculation and operational strategy seed sludge was collected from a long term stable upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor with a nitrogen loading rate nlr of 5 94 g n l 1 d 1 four uasb reactors were constructed with an effective volume of 1 0 l and incubated in a thermostatic 35 1 c room fig s1 considering that the inhibitory effects might be related to the anammox granular properties the initial particle size and volatile suspended solids vss of the sludge in four reactors were controlled at 1 4 0 2 mm and 28 0 7 g l 1 respectively three different antibiotics were selected in this study including etc re smz rs and multiple antibiotics etc smz rse the synthetic wastewater used in this study is listed in table s1 ammonium sulfate and sodium nitrite were supplied as substrates at a ratio of 1 1 the substrate concentration was initially controlled at 280 mg l 1 but it was changed according to the process performance the hydraulic retention time hrt was 3 2 h and the influent ph was controlled at 8 0 batch experiment was performed to determine the half maximal inhibitory concentration ic50 of both antibiotics on anammox process in a short term lu et al 2021 the ic50 of smz and etc were 32 and 3 mg l 1 respectively given that the long term exposure to the high strength antibiotics probably destroyed the anammox systems the maximum concentrations were controlled at approximately half of the critical values the concentrations of smz and etc in this study were 0 16 mg l 1 and 0 1 6 mg l 1 respectively the whole experimental period was divided into six phases and the detailed dosing strategy in each reactor is shown in table 1 sludge and water samples were collected regularly from each reactor for the subsequent determination of conventional parameters 2 2 chemical analysis conventional parameters such as nh4 n no2 n and ss were measured daily according to the standard methods federation and apha 2005 dissolved oxygen do ph and temperature were determined using a thermometer and orion star a portable do ph instrument

the end of phase 1 6 on days 66 138 168 196 and 228 genomic dna of the anammox sludge samples was extracted using the power soil dna kit mobio laboratories usa the manufacturer s instructions the concentration and quality of dna were examined by a nanodrop 2000 thermo scientific usa followed by agarose 1 gel electrophoresis the extracted dna was temporarily stored at 20 c for subsequent experiments similarly rna was extracted using the power soil rna kit mobio laboratories usa based on the protocol a sludge sample of 2 g was collected for rna extraction and the quality was also determined using the nanodrop 2 4 high throughput sequencing high throughput sequencing was performed according to fan et al 2019 briefly the dna was amplified using the universal primers 338f 518r and then sequenced on the illumina miseq platform majorbio china original sequences have been deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive sra database under bioproject srp188024 accession numbers srr 10259585 92 2 5 quantification of key genes antibiotic resistance genes sul1 sul2 and ermf functional genes amx and hzsa and intergon encoding gene inti1 were quantified to evaluate the effects of antibiotics on the abundances of args and the expression levels of the functional genes the abundances of args and functional genes were determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr and real time reverse transcription pcr rt pcr respectively the appealing temperature of each gene was listed in table s2 and the detailed procedures are available in the supporting information si 2 6 molecular docking simulation molecular docking was stimulated via the autodock 4 2 6 software package kılıç et al 2021 the two dimensional structures of ligands acquired from the pubchem database https pubchem ncbi nlm nih gov were used after energy minimization optimization by chemdraw 14 0 the crystal structure of the representative anammox related protein pdb id 6eu6 was downloaded from the protein data bank http www1 rcsb org structure 6eu6 pymol2 1 was used to remove the water molecule and the original ligand autodock tools 1 5 6 software was used to optimize the structures of the receptors ammonium transporters and ligands smz and etc docking was performed randomly and the docking box wrapped the entire protein the center coordinates of the box were 7 198 39 633 0 417 the number of lattice points in all directions x y and z was set as 126 115 126 the number of molecular docks was set to 200 and the remaining parameters were default values 2 7 statistical analysis a t test was performed to evaluate the significant differences using spss 18 0 spss inc usa correlation analysis between bacteria and args was conducted using r software r i386 4 0 2 with the psych package network analysis of the microbial community was also performed in r and then visualized by gephi software version 0 9 2 principal component analysis pca was performed and visualized using canoco 4 5 3 results 3 1 difference in the performance under antibiotics stress 3 1 1 nitrogen removal performance the initial influent concentration of substrates nh4 and no2 was maintained at approximately 280 mg l 1 with the hrt of 3 2 h after 7 days of acclimation the nres of the four reactors were stable at a high level of 95 fig 1 in the first phase 8 38 days the nitrogen removal performance of r0 remained stable with the nlr and nitrogen removal rate nrr of 4 3 0 3 g l 1 d 1 and 3 7 0 5 g l 1 d 1 respectively in comparison the nitrogen removal performance of the experimental reactors under the stress of various antibiotics showed different trends table 2 the nlr and nrr of re and rs were generally increased by 9 0 27 2 and 2 7 31 2 respectively the similar response of the anammox process to the two antibiotics indicated that 0 05 mg etc l 1 and 0 5 mg smz l 1 induced a comparative promotion on the anammox performance in contrast the effluent concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n in rse dramatically increased to 123 4 mg l 1 and 214 2 mg l 1 within 5 days and then decreased to 7 0 mg l 1 and 20 4 mg l 1 respectively at the end of this phase correspondingly the nlr and nrr of rse significantly decreased by 49 4 and 36 4 respectively the deterioration of the anammox performance in rse suggested that the toxicity of the combined antibiotics was much stronger than that of the single one the different inhibitory mechanisms of smz and etc implied that there was no antagonism between them thus the effects of two inhibitors are definitely severer than that of the single one to relieve the inhibitory effect of antibiotics the influent concentration of substrates was reduced to 140 mg l 1 however the nitrogen removal efficiency was still as low as 65 2 1 3 thus the influent concentration of nh4 n and no2 n in rse was maintained at 140 mg l 1 from day 30 and nre recovered to 91 6 at the end of the first phase the concentrations of etc and smz increased to 0 1 and 1 mg l 1 in the second phase while the total concentration of antibiotics added in rse was 1 1 mg l 1 the nlr and nrr of re and rs slightly decreased with the average respective values of 4 3 g l 1 d 1 and 4 1 g l 1 d 1 in re and 4 4 g l 1 d 1 and 4 1 g l 1 d 1 in rs simultaneously those of rse continued to decrease to 2 2 0 2 g l 1 d 1 and 2 0 0 2 g l 1 d 1 with further increases in the antibiotic concentrations to 0 2 and 2 mg l 1 in phase 3 a larger reduction could be observed in the three reactors the marked fluctuation during days 98 104 was mainly caused by temporary termination of the reactor operation for three weeks due to the influence of the novel coronavirus the system rapidly was restored within 10 days by reducing the influent substrate concentrations therefore the decline in the process performance of all reactors during phase 3 was primarily attributed to the antibiotic stress instead of operational suspension the most significant operational deterioration occurred in phase 4 with the antibiotic concentrations of 0 4 mg etc l 1 and 4 mg smz l 1 the effluent concentration of no2 n gradually increased under the above conditions and reached to 88 7 mg l 1 in re 197 3 mg l 1 in rs and 95 8 mg l 1 in rse on day 148 although the influent substrate concentrations were reduced to 140 mg l 1 in rs re and 70 mg l 1 in rse from day 152 the nlr and nrr remained at the relatively low levels in the three reactors compared with their initial states in phase 5 higher concentrations of antibiotics further caused a reduction in the nres of re and rse in contrast the nlr and nrr of rs increased respectively by 2 1 and 13 0 during this period suggesting that the microbial community might adapt to the antibiotic stress this phenomenon also appeared in re in phase 6 even though the antibiotic concentration increased the high strength antibiotics did not inhibit the nitrogen removal performance of rs and re but played a positive role in their restoration to evaluate whether the effect of high concentration antibiotics on the anammox process was reversible no antibiotics were added to rse in the last phase the slightly increasing trend of nlr and nrr reconfirmed the reversibility during the whole experimental period the nitrogen removal performance of each reactor was closely related to the antibiotic concentration and the anammox process exhibited an adaptability to high strength antibiotic stress table 2 initially the rse showed a high sensitivity to the addition of the two antibiotics at low concentrations such inhibition largely decreased in the following two phases although the antibiotic concentration increased simultaneously the inhibitory effect of the single antibiotic gradually emerged antibiotic inhibition achieved an approximate maximum significance in all reactors in phase 4 indicating that the effect of etc and smz on the anammox process did not accumulative afterwards all reactors began to recover in the order of rs re and rse manifesting that the combined impact of etc and smz on the nitrogen removal performance of the anammox system was longer and severer than that of the single antibiotic the various responses and corresponding recovery period of the anammox process under antibiotic stress might be due to the difference in the resistance mechanism of args table s2 3 1 2 anammox activity and eps specific anammox activity saa is an important index reflecting the process performance of anammox fig 2 a initially the saa was approximately 340 mg g 1 vss d 1 in all reactors with the addition of antibiotics saa generally increased except for that of rse in the second phase saa dramatically decreased to a low level of 120 mg g 1 vss d 1 from then that of rc remained stable till the end of the experiment while the rest reactors showed a significant deterioration similarly the greatest reduction in saa of the experimental reactors occurred on day 168 with an average value of 24 19 17 28 mg g 1 vss d 1 afterwards rs and re rapidly recovered to the comparative values with those in the second phase while the rse did not appear to recover within such a limited period the trend of saa during the experimental period was generally in line with the nitrogen removal performance in comparison the saa decreased by 70 8 in rs 57 7 in re and 86 5 in rse which verified that the inhibitory effect of multiple antibiotics was significant than that of the single similar conclusions were also reported under other conditions such as the heavy metals and antibiotics fan et al 2019 found that exposure to zinc and tetracycline caused a worse performance moreover such a reduction in saa in rse might be mainly contributed by the side effects of smz because smz showed a stronger inhibition on rs eps has been recognized as a safeguard to prevent the pollutant inhibition zhang et al 2020b the content in rc was relatively stable during the experimental period while antibiotic stress caused significant fluctuations in eps in the experimental reactors especially in rse fig 2b under the initial exposure to the two antibiotics the eps content increased gradually to the maximum value of 187 3 mg g 1vss on day 138 afterwards the eps content continuously decreased with the increasing antibiotic concentrations and then rebounded in the last recovery phase as the main components in eps the ratio of protein polysaccharide pn ps reflected the hydrophobicity of sludge zhang et al 2018a the minimum value of pn ps was 9 3 on day 198 manifesting the poor flocculation ability of the anammox sludge simultaneously nre was as low as 49 8 which was in line with the sludge properties notably nres on days 36 66 138 maintained at a high level with values of 91 6 98 9 and 96 8 respectively correspondingly the pn contents gradually increased during this period it was reported that most proteins in eps are important media for transporting small molecules which showed a strong binding ability in previous studies chen et al 2019 xu et al 2013 this function of pn is in favor of binding antibiotics and further relieving antibiotic stress on anammox bacteria 3 2 microbial responses to the antibiotic pressures 3 2 1 evolution of microbial community the microbial community analysis results showed that the dominant phyla were planctomycetes proteobacteria chloroflexi armatimonadetes and ignavibacteriae among which the most abundant phylum was planctomycetes with the average relative abundance of 37 0 in rc 37 2 in re 36 9 in rs and 35 1 in rse fig 3 the relative abundance of planctomycetes in the control reactor was maintained at 35 56 2 12 in the first three phases and increased slightly to 38 35 4 88 from phase 4 under antibiotic pressure the variations in the microbial community of the experimental reactors showed quite different trends but were similar to each other the relative abundance of planctomycetes showed a significantly increasing trend in phase 2 in all reactors suggesting that low concentration antibiotics might contribute to the increase in planctomycetes specifically the proliferation of candidatus kuenenia the representative genus in planctomycetes was greatly promoted during this period and then reduced in the following phase afterwards the abundance of ca kuenenia in the three experimental reactors recovered to different levels it was interesting that the final abundance of ca kuenenia in re was significantly higher than the initial value while that in rs was lower than the initial values this result suggested that smz had a significant inhibitory and lasting impact on the anammox bacteria but the effect of etc was smaller and temporary simultaneously ca kuenenia also maintained a relatively lower abundance in rse during phase 3 5 indicating that the side effects of smz outweighed the adaptability of anammox bacteria however such inhibition was reversable which could be concluded from the increasing trend in the last phase of recovery the response of proteobacteria to these two antibiotics was also opposite especially burkholderiales at the order level the abundance of proteobacteria was dramatically reduced from 20 5 to 16 7 in re while it increased from 22 2 to 26 2 in rs the different variations indicated that proteobacteria was more sensitive to etc but was tolerant to smz the combined effect of both antibiotics caused a slight decrease in the proteobacteria populations from 21 2 to 20 2 in rse confirming the antagonistic effects between etc and smz on proteobacteria a similar response was also observed for chloroflexi this phylum plays an important role in the flocculation of sludge and may cause sludge bulking when they extensively grow zhang et al 2015 caldilinea was the predominant genus of chloroflexi the eikelboom type 0803 a typical bulking caused filamentous bacterium was morphologically identified to be affiliated with caldilinea kragelund et al 2011 at the genus level several functional bacteria might be involved in the nitrogen removal of this system for example the genome of ignavibacterium album contains a nrfah complex suggesting that this microorganism is able to catalyze the second step of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra which is the reduction of nitrite to ammonium grießmeier et al 2017 nitrosomonas are mainly responsible for nitrification the cooccurrence of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and ca kuenenia was observed in the full scale wastewater treatment systems and they were distributed differently in terms of biomass park et al 2014 nitrosomonas was also the only aob detected in the one stage nitritation anammox systems and was distributed on the surface compared with anammox bacteria in the intra of granules chu et al 2015 although the synthetic wastewater composition was strictly autotrophic heterotrophic bacteria still coexisted in all anammox reactors their survival probably depends on the soluble microbial products and eps cydzik kwiatkowska and zielińska 2016 the pca in fig 3 elucidated a distinct separation between the sludge samples collected in the low stress period and the high stress period which was primarily attributed to the increase in the relative abundances of parcubacteria ca saccharibacteria and nitrospirae under the high strength antibiotic stress 3 3 variations in key genes under different antibiotics stress the abundances of args and the expression level of functional genes changed with increasing antibiotic concentrations fig 4 in general the expression levels of amx and hzsa in the control reactor were higher than those in the three experimental reactors especially in the last two phases the inhibition of antibiotics on functional genes was in line with the decrease in the abundance of ca kuenenia further leading to the deterioration of the process performance in the anammox systems in contrast antibiotic stress showed a promoting effect on the abundances of args with the long term stress of antibiotics the final abundances of sul1 sul2 and ermf in the experimental reactors in phase 6 were significantly higher p 0 05 than those in rc it was noted that the abundances of sul1 and sul2 in rse were generally higher than those in rs indicating that multiple antibiotics might induce the transfer of args the abundance of ermf in re and rse dramatically increased in the last phase and was mainly ascribed to the horizontal transfer of args which was reflected by the similar trend of inti1 although antibiotic stress in rse was removed in phase 6 args and inti1 continuously accumulated and their total abundances peaked at 2 5 106 copies g 1 sludge implying the occurrence of horizontal gene transfer hgt and proliferation of arg carrying bacteria based on the variations in the abundance of inti1 antibiotic stress was likely to be the main driving force for the gene transfer which probably further promoted the occurrence of novel args and arb 4 discussion 4 1 correlations analysis and potential host bacteria of args according to the correlation analysis of the bacteria the top 50 genera in terms of abundance functional and resistance genes table s3 the variations of several genera were significantly correlated with each other 117 pairs and those of args 13 pairs in terms of the dominant top 20 genera fig 5 ca kuenenia was positively correlated with sul1 r 0 894 p 0 05 while phycisphaera gp10 and gp3 exhibited a significantly positive correlation with sul2 r 0 874 r 0 883 r 0 888 p 0 05 in addition nitrospira was also positively correlated with sul2 r 0 835 p 0 05 indicating that these microorganisms were more tolerant to high concentration antibiotic stress and contributed to the nitrogen removal of the process during the inhibitory periods phycisphaera and nitrospira have been reported to be widely detected in wwtps and are involved in nitrification and denitrification fan et al 2020 xia et al 2019 network analysis was conducted to identify the potential host bacteria of args under antibiotic stress fig 5 the three args sul1 sul2 and ermf exhibited connections with 103 genera in total table s4 the potential hosts of args might change with different antibiotic stresses for example ca kuenenia was predicted to carry sul2 and ermf in rse while both genes were independent of this bacterium in systems under single antibiotic stress it was noted that the numbers of potential host bacteria of sul2 and ermf in rse were much higher than those in rs and re reconfirming that multi antibiotic stress prompted the horizontal transfer of both args except for ca kuenenia many of these predicted arg carrying bacteria have been reported to be involved in nitrogen removal or at least detected in denitrification systems such as nitrospira ignavibacterium thauera and comamonas birgitta et al 1998 gumaelius et al 2001 combined with the analysis of the microbial community evolution the potential resistant bacteria with the increasing abundance under antibiotic stress e g ignavibacterium were the major contributors to maintaining nitrogen removal during the inhibitory period there might be a competitive growth between these antibiotic resistant community and nonresistant community under the long term stress of the high concentration antibiotic the former population inevitably outcompeted the latter therefore controlling the extensive proliferation of the arg carrying bacteria is urgent qian et al 2020 proposed that the increase in abiogenetic temperature and anthropogenically sourced salinity provided the opportunity for the advantageous growth of nonresistant community in bacterial ecosystems 4 2 transfer of args implied the co selection of multi antibiotic resistance although args transfer has two processes namely hgt and vertical gene transfer vgt the high prevalence of multi drug resistance mdr should be attributed mainly to the dissemination of mdr strains by point mutations and hgt chang et al 2015 mobile genetic elements mges play an intermediary role in the arg transfer such as plasmids and bacteriophages it was reported that mobile plasmid in the extracellular matrix mainly contributed to the facilitated dissemination of arg through forming substituted aromatic plasmid complexes to antagonize the eps mediated hydrolysis shou et al 2019 many recombinant plasmids carried inti1 tennstedt et al 2003 according to fig 4 the abundances of inti1 and args in rse were generally higher than those in rs and re and the correlation analysis results also indicated that horizontal transfer of resistance genes occurred in the anammox systems resistance gene transfer is recognized as the root of multi antibiotic resistance summers 2006 the abundance of inti1 in rse continuously increased from day 138 and reached the highest value of 4 7 106 copies g 1 sludge in the last phase this maximum value was higher than that of the rest reactors especially the control indicating that inti1 promoted the horizontal transfer of args it was reported that sul genes were normally found in integron and plasmid ho et al 2009 verifying the correlations between the sul gene and inti1 table s3 in addition non antibiotic chemicals specifically heavy metals can also put coselective pressures on the microbial community and further enrich bacteria with multi antibiotic resistance fan et al 2019 metal nanoparticles have been reported to accelerate the plasmid mediated horizontal transfer of args li et al 2020 based on the microbial community analysis antibiotic stress contributed to the population evolution of the anammox system in turn hgt was conductive to maintaining the equilibrium of microbial communities fan et al 2018 also proposed that the rate and direction of hgt significantly affected the structural stability and robustness of the microbial community gene transfer may help systems recover from disturbance to a certain extent it was noted that the total abundances of args and inti1 in re dramatically increased in the last phase while the diversity and richness of the microbial community remained comparable a similar phenomenon was also observed in the other two reactors validating the importance of gene transfer in maintaining population and operation stability 4 3 antibiotic eps complex and args accumulation relieve the stress of antibiotics based on the previous analysis proteins in eps played a vital role in preventing antibiotic and arg invaders through hydrolysis chaloupka 2012 zeta potential is closely related to the structural stability of eps chen et al 2021 to further determine the interaction between eps and antibiotics zeta potentials of the eps antibiotic mixtures were measured and compared fig 6 the original zeta potential of eps was 12 3 mv with adding different concentrations of smz the zeta potential increased to 10 5 mv 2 mg l 1 and 5 9 mv 16 mg l 1 similarly the zeta potential of eps etc mixtures increased to 11 2 mv 0 2 mg l 1 and 7 2 mv 1 6 mg l 1 apparently the higher absolute values of zeta potential reflect the larger electrostatic repulsion and less aggregation in colloid li et al 2016 with the increasing concentrations of antibiotics the zeta potential of eps antibiotic mixtures increased indicating that antibiotics reduced the negative charges on the eps surface and changed the configuration of eps molecular docking simulation was further performed to visualize the connection between antibiotics and proteins in eps as mentioned above the compositions of eps are complex containing numerous polysaccharides and proteins yu 2020 proteomic analysis results showed that 367 proteins were identified in the eps of the anammox sludge sample which were involved in substrate transport ion binding and so on chen et al 2019 however the structures and functions of most proteins remained unclear in the protein database pdb only 15 proteins can be retrieved in ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis which is also the dominant anammox bacteria in this study as the essential for anammox bacteria sensing and assimilation of external ammonium are also the typical domains of the ubiquitous amt rh ammonium transporter thus ammonium transporter id 6eu6 was selected as a representative receptor for molecular docking simulation the optimal binding energy of the receptor 6eu6 and ligand smz was 7 58 kcal mol 1 as shown in fig 7a there were three hydrogen bonds between the receptor binding sites glu 307 hys 191 and asp 318 and the small molecule ligand the distances of these hydrogen bonds were 1 9 1 8 and 2 2 respectively similarly etc was also able to bind with the ammonium transporter at the binding site of thr 32 and the optimal binding energy was 2 74 fig 7b similar combination through h bond was previously simulated between ciprofloxacin and tryptophan residues in biofilm and metal bridge further contributed to detaining ciprofloxacin in the extracellular matrices kang et al 2017 notably the different binding sites of etc and smz indicated that both antibiotics might combine with the protein in eps simultaneously the antibiotic eps complex reduced the side effects of antibiotics on anammox bacteria the increase in the pn content in eps was conductive to the maintenance of stable nitrogen removal performance during the inhibitory period in addition to the external protection of eps the args accumulation also provided an internal protection according to the quantification results of three args their abundances generally increased with the antibiotic concentrations especially in the last phase fig 4 the sul1 gene is generally found in the tn21 type integron while sul2 is usually located on small plasmids of the incq family and another type plasmid ho et al 2009 the expressed products of both genes showed low km values for sulfonamides binding thus the inhibitory effects of sulfonamides on bacterial proliferation were reduced sköld 2000 in terms of the macrolide resistance gene ermf erm encoding methyltransferases catalyze the dimethylation of the 23s rrna nucleotide a2058 vester et al 1995 the conformational change of this drug binding site limited the combination of 23s rrna and macrolides maintaining the normal transcription process svetlov et al 2021 therefore the accumulation and expression of args could help bacteria to tolerate the selection pressure of multi antibiotics 5 conclusions the full scale implementation of anammox process is still a huge challenge especially for the treatment of antibiotic containing wastewater results of this study suggested that the anammox process was able to tolerate the stress of low concentration antibiotics while the high concentration antibiotics exhibited a significant inhibition especially under the multi antibiotic stress the deterioration in the process performance was reversible suggesting that the anammox process has a great potential to treat the wastewater containing multi antibiotics the establishment of systemic resistance was mainly attributed to the eps protection and the args accumulation during the long term acclimation the potential three dimensional structures showing the interaction between extracellular proteins of anammox sludge and antibiotics were also illustrated based on the molecular docking simulation the outcomes of this study are important for clarifying the effect and mechanism of multiple antibiotics on anammox process and for promoting anammox process in the treatment of antibiotic containing

16804,the anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process is regarded as a promising approach to treat antibiotic containing wastewater therefore it is urgent to elucidate the effects of various antibiotics on the anammox process moreover the mechanism of extracellular polymeric substance eps as protective barriers to relieve antibiotic stress remain unclear therefore the single and combined effects of erythromycin etc and sulfamethoxazole smz and interactions between eps and antibiotics were investigated in this study based on a 228 day continuous flow experiment high concentrations of etc and smz had significant inhibitory effects on the nitrogen removal performance of the anammox process with the abundances of corresponding antibiotic resistance genes args increasing in addition the combined inhibitory effect of the two antibiotics on the anammox process was more significant and longer lasting than that of the single however the anammox process was able to quickly recover from deterioration the tolerance of anammox granules to the stress of low concentration antibiotics was probably attributed to the increase in args and secretion of eps molecular docking simulation results showed that proteins in eps could directly bind with smz and etc at the sites of glu 307 hys 191 asp 318 and thr 32 respectively these findings improved our understanding of various antibiotic effects on the anammox process and the interaction mechanism between antibiotics and proteins in eps graphical abstracts image graphical abstract keywords anammox antibiotics args eps molecular docking simulation 1 introduction the prevalence of antibiotic resistance is of great concern for public health with the increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance genes args and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb in various environments wastewater treatment plants wwtps are recognized as sinks of args and arb due to the high level of residual antibiotics guo et al 2017 for example wastewaters from wwtps were generally found to contain sulfamethoxazole smz and its concentration ranged from 0 2 to 2 4 mg l 1 depending on the wastewater treatment stage shelver and shappell 2008 erythromycin etc was also frequently detected in effluents and surface water with the concentration at the μg l 1 level kim et al 2007 wu et al 2014 therefore achieving the simultaneous efficient removal of antibiotics and nitrogen is urgent for current wastewater treatment anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox has been regarded as an efficient biological nitrogen removal technology in antibiotic wastewater treatment due to its low sludge production and operating cost van de graaf et al 1995 notably the performance of the anammox process is frequently affected by operational parameters e g temperature hydraulic retention time substrate concentrations nitrite and ammonia and pollutants in wastewater e g heavy metals nanoparticles antibiotics jin et al 2012 thus it is necessary to clarify the response of anammox bacteria to these inhibitory compounds with the extensive utilization of antibiotics the diverse effects of various antibiotics on the nitrogen removal of the anammox process have been reported previously such as oxytetracycline yang et al 2013 norfloxacin zhang et al 2018b and spiramycin jing et al 2020 in most cases antibiotics commonly coexist with other pollutants thus their co selective pressures on the anammox process have also been studied in recent years fu et al 2020 however most experiments were performed through batch tests in the short term with a focus on biomass properties and nitrogen removal performance few studies have evaluated and compared the single and combined effects of different pollutants on the anammox process in the long term zhang et al 2016 examined the single and combined impacts of oxytetracycline and cu2 and proposed that the formation of a cu oxytetracycline complex reduced the toxicity of both materials to anammox bacteria the performance of the anammox process under individual and combined stresses of oxytetracycline and sulfamethoxazole was also tested zhang et al 2019a the results showed that the resistance of the anammox process to both antibiotics was higher than that of each antibiotic in contrast the combined inhibition of zn2 and tetracycline on the anammox process performance and bacterial activity was more significant fan et al 2019 based on previous results different antibiotics have different influences on anammox consortia zhang et al 2020a therefore it is still necessary to further enrich our knowledge of the performance and microbial responses of anammox bacteria to various antibiotics and the corresponding mechanism previous studies showed that toxic pollutants frequently induce the secretion of extracellular polymeric substance eps which is also an effective barrier for anammox bacteria to resist antibiotics wang et al 2018 it has been reported that the resistance of the anammox system to smz might be related to eps zhang et al 2019a zhang et al zhang et al 2020b proposed that eps addition was able to effectively maintain anammox activity during long term storage under starvation it is concluded that eps plays an important role in protecting anammox bacteria eps contains abundant and diverse proteinaceous components to facilitate adsorption of antibiotics from wastewater via the amine and carboxyl groups yu 2020 zhang et al 2018a reported that the eps of sulfate reducing bacteria srb sludge possessed high hydrophobicity and binding strength between eps and ciprofloxacin however the functions of the anammox eps and its interaction with antibiotics remain to be elucidated etc and smz are typical macrolide and sulfanilamide antibiotics that have been widely used in treating human and animal diseases to date their combined effects on the anammox process have remained unclear therefore this work comprehensively revealed the response of the anammox process to the single and combined stresses of the two antibiotics in addition the potential binding sites between proteins in eps and antibiotics were proposed based on molecular docking simulation which helped to broaden the understanding of eps functions in preventing antibiotic stress 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge inoculation and operational strategy seed sludge was collected from a long term stable upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor with a nitrogen loading rate nlr of 5 94 g n l 1 d 1 four uasb reactors were constructed with an effective volume of 1 0 l and incubated in a thermostatic 35 1 c room fig s1 considering that the inhibitory effects might be related to the anammox granular properties the initial particle size and volatile suspended solids vss of the sludge in four reactors were controlled at 1 4 0 2 mm and 28 0 7 g l 1 respectively three different antibiotics were selected in this study including etc re smz rs and multiple antibiotics etc smz rse the synthetic wastewater used in this study is listed in table s1 ammonium sulfate and sodium nitrite were supplied as substrates at a ratio of 1 1 the substrate concentration was initially controlled at 280 mg l 1 but it was changed according to the process performance the hydraulic retention time hrt was 3 2 h and the influent ph was controlled at 8 0 batch experiment was performed to determine the half maximal inhibitory concentration ic50 of both antibiotics on anammox process in a short term lu et al 2021 the ic50 of smz and etc were 32 and 3 mg l 1 respectively given that the long term exposure to the high strength antibiotics probably destroyed the anammox systems the maximum concentrations were controlled at approximately half of the critical values the concentrations of smz and etc in this study were 0 16 mg l 1 and 0 1 6 mg l 1 respectively the whole experimental period was divided into six phases and the detailed dosing strategy in each reactor is shown in table 1 sludge and water samples were collected regularly from each reactor for the subsequent determination of conventional parameters 2 2 chemical analysis conventional parameters such as nh4 n no2 n and ss were measured daily according to the standard methods federation and apha 2005 dissolved oxygen do ph and temperature were determined using a thermometer and orion star a portable do ph instrument thermo scientific usa the saa and eps were monitored based on previous studies chen et al 2017 zhang et al 2019b zeta potential was measured using a nanosize zs potentiometer malvern instruments co uk the detailed procedures of preparing the mixture samples for zeta potential measurement are described in supplementary materials 2 3 dna and rna extraction the sludge samples of 2 ml were collected at the end of phase 1 6 on days 66 138 168 196 and 228 genomic dna of the anammox sludge samples was extracted using the power soil dna kit mobio laboratories usa the manufacturer s instructions the concentration and quality of dna were examined by a nanodrop 2000 thermo scientific usa followed by agarose 1 gel electrophoresis the extracted dna was temporarily stored at 20 c for subsequent experiments similarly rna was extracted using the power soil rna kit mobio laboratories usa based on the protocol a sludge sample of 2 g was collected for rna extraction and the quality was also determined using the nanodrop 2 4 high throughput sequencing high throughput sequencing was performed according to fan et al 2019 briefly the dna was amplified using the universal primers 338f 518r and then sequenced on the illumina miseq platform majorbio china original sequences have been deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive sra database under bioproject srp188024 accession numbers srr 10259585 92 2 5 quantification of key genes antibiotic resistance genes sul1 sul2 and ermf functional genes amx and hzsa and intergon encoding gene inti1 were quantified to evaluate the effects of antibiotics on the abundances of args and the expression levels of the functional genes the abundances of args and functional genes were determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr and real time reverse transcription pcr rt pcr respectively the appealing temperature of each gene was listed in table s2 and the detailed procedures are available in the supporting information si 2 6 molecular docking simulation molecular docking was stimulated via the autodock 4 2 6 software package kılıç et al 2021 the two dimensional structures of ligands acquired from the pubchem database https pubchem ncbi nlm nih gov were used after energy minimization optimization by chemdraw 14 0 the crystal structure of the representative anammox related protein pdb id 6eu6 was downloaded from the protein data bank http www1 rcsb org structure 6eu6 pymol2 1 was used to remove the water molecule and the original ligand autodock tools 1 5 6 software was used to optimize the structures of the receptors ammonium transporters and ligands smz and etc docking was performed randomly and the docking box wrapped the entire protein the center coordinates of the box were 7 198 39 633 0 417 the number of lattice points in all directions x y and z was set as 126 115 126 the number of molecular docks was set to 200 and the remaining parameters were default values 2 7 statistical analysis a t test was performed to evaluate the significant differences using spss 18 0 spss inc usa correlation analysis between bacteria and args was conducted using r software r i386 4 0 2 with the psych package network analysis of the microbial community was also performed in r and then visualized by gephi software version 0 9 2 principal component analysis pca was performed and visualized using canoco 4 5 3 results 3 1 difference in the performance under antibiotics stress 3 1 1 nitrogen removal performance the initial influent concentration of substrates nh4 and no2 was maintained at approximately 280 mg l 1 with the hrt of 3 2 h after 7 days of acclimation the nres of the four reactors were stable at a high level of 95 fig 1 in the first phase 8 38 days the nitrogen removal performance of r0 remained stable with the nlr and nitrogen removal rate nrr of 4 3 0 3 g l 1 d 1 and 3 7 0 5 g l 1 d 1 respectively in comparison the nitrogen removal performance of the experimental reactors under the stress of various antibiotics showed different trends table 2 the nlr and nrr of re and rs were generally increased by 9 0 27 2 and 2 7 31 2 respectively the similar response of the anammox process to the two antibiotics indicated that 0 05 mg etc l 1 and 0 5 mg smz l 1 induced a comparative promotion on the anammox performance in contrast the effluent concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n in rse dramatically increased to 123 4 mg l 1 and 214 2 mg l 1 within 5 days and then decreased to 7 0 mg l 1 and 20 4 mg l 1 respectively at the end of this phase correspondingly the nlr and nrr of rse significantly decreased by 49 4 and 36 4 respectively the deterioration of the anammox performance in rse suggested that the toxicity of the combined antibiotics was much stronger than that of the single one the different inhibitory mechanisms of smz and etc implied that there was no antagonism between them thus the effects of two inhibitors are definitely severer than that of the single one to relieve the inhibitory effect of antibiotics the influent concentration of substrates was reduced to 140 mg l 1 however the nitrogen removal efficiency was still as low as 65 2 1 3 thus the influent concentration of nh4 n and no2 n in rse was maintained at 140 mg l 1 from day 30 and nre recovered to 91 6 at the end of the first phase the concentrations of etc and smz increased to 0 1 and 1 mg l 1 in the second phase while the total concentration of antibiotics added in rse was 1 1 mg l 1 the nlr and nrr of re and rs slightly decreased with the average respective values of 4 3 g l 1 d 1 and 4 1 g l 1 d 1 in re and 4 4 g l 1 d 1 and 4 1 g l 1 d 1 in rs simultaneously those of rse continued to decrease to 2 2 0 2 g l 1 d 1 and 2 0 0 2 g l 1 d 1 with further increases in the antibiotic concentrations to 0 2 and 2 mg l 1 in phase 3 a larger reduction could be observed in the three reactors the marked fluctuation during days 98 104 was mainly caused by temporary termination of the reactor operation for three weeks due to the influence of the novel coronavirus the system rapidly was restored within 10 days by reducing the influent substrate concentrations therefore the decline in the process performance of all reactors during phase 3 was primarily attributed to the antibiotic stress instead of operational suspension the most significant operational deterioration occurred in phase 4 with the antibiotic concentrations of 0 4 mg etc l 1 and 4 mg smz l 1 the effluent concentration of no2 n gradually increased under the above conditions and reached to 88 7 mg l 1 in re 197 3 mg l 1 in rs and 95 8 mg l 1 in rse on day 148 although the influent substrate concentrations were reduced to 140 mg l 1 in rs re and 70 mg l 1 in rse from day 152 the nlr and nrr remained at the relatively low levels in the three reactors compared with their initial states in phase 5 higher concentrations of antibiotics further caused a reduction in the nres of re and rse in contrast the nlr and nrr of rs increased respectively by 2 1 and 13 0 during this period suggesting that the microbial community might adapt to the antibiotic stress this phenomenon also appeared in re in phase 6 even though the antibiotic concentration increased the high strength antibiotics did not inhibit the nitrogen removal performance of rs and re but played a positive role in their restoration to evaluate whether the effect of high concentration antibiotics on the anammox process was reversible no antibiotics were added to rse in the last phase the slightly increasing trend of nlr and nrr reconfirmed the reversibility during the whole experimental period the nitrogen removal performance of each reactor was closely related to the antibiotic concentration and the anammox process exhibited an adaptability to high strength antibiotic stress table 2 initially the rse showed a high sensitivity to the addition of the two antibiotics at low concentrations such inhibition largely decreased in the following two phases although the antibiotic concentration increased simultaneously the inhibitory effect of the single antibiotic gradually emerged antibiotic inhibition achieved an approximate maximum significance in all reactors in phase 4 indicating that the effect of etc and smz on the anammox process did not accumulative afterwards all reactors began to recover in the order of rs re and rse manifesting that the combined impact of etc and smz on the nitrogen removal performance of the anammox system was longer and severer than that of the single antibiotic the various responses and corresponding recovery period of the anammox process under antibiotic stress might be due to the difference in the resistance mechanism of args table s2 3 1 2 anammox activity and eps specific anammox activity saa is an important index reflecting the process performance of anammox fig 2 a initially the saa was approximately 340 mg g 1 vss d 1 in all reactors with the addition of antibiotics saa generally increased except for that of rse in the second phase saa dramatically decreased to a low level of 120 mg g 1 vss d 1 from then that of rc remained stable till the end of the experiment while the rest reactors showed a significant deterioration similarly the greatest reduction in saa of the experimental reactors occurred on day 168 with an average value of 24 19 17 28 mg g 1 vss d 1 afterwards rs and re rapidly recovered to the comparative values with those in the second phase while the rse did not appear to recover within such a limited period the trend of saa during the experimental period was generally in line with the nitrogen removal performance in comparison the saa decreased by 70 8 in rs 57 7 in re and 86 5 in rse which verified that the inhibitory effect of multiple antibiotics was significant than that of the single similar conclusions were also reported under other conditions such as the heavy metals and antibiotics fan et al 2019 found that exposure to zinc and tetracycline caused a worse performance moreover such a reduction in saa in rse might be mainly contributed by the side effects of smz because smz showed a stronger inhibition on rs eps has been recognized as a safeguard to prevent the pollutant inhibition zhang et al 2020b the content in rc was relatively stable during the experimental period while antibiotic stress caused significant fluctuations in eps in the experimental reactors especially in rse fig 2b under the initial exposure to the two antibiotics the eps content increased gradually to the maximum value of 187 3 mg g 1vss on day 138 afterwards the eps content continuously decreased with the increasing antibiotic concentrations and then rebounded in the last recovery phase as the main components in eps the ratio of protein polysaccharide pn ps reflected the hydrophobicity of sludge zhang et al 2018a the minimum value of pn ps was 9 3 on day 198 manifesting the poor flocculation ability of the anammox sludge simultaneously nre was as low as 49 8 which was in line with the sludge properties notably nres on days 36 66 138 maintained at a high level with values of 91 6 98 9 and 96 8 respectively correspondingly the pn contents gradually increased during this period it was reported that most proteins in eps are important media for transporting small molecules which showed a strong binding ability in previous studies chen et al 2019 xu et al 2013 this function of pn is in favor of binding antibiotics and further relieving antibiotic stress on anammox bacteria 3 2 microbial responses to the antibiotic pressures 3 2 1 evolution of microbial community the microbial community analysis results showed that the dominant phyla were planctomycetes proteobacteria chloroflexi armatimonadetes and ignavibacteriae among which the most abundant phylum was planctomycetes with the average relative abundance of 37 0 in rc 37 2 in re 36 9 in rs and 35 1 in rse fig 3 the relative abundance of planctomycetes in the control reactor was maintained at 35 56 2 12 in the first three phases and increased slightly to 38 35 4 88 from phase 4 under antibiotic pressure the variations in the microbial community of the experimental reactors showed quite different trends but were similar to each other the relative abundance of planctomycetes showed a significantly increasing trend in phase 2 in all reactors suggesting that low concentration antibiotics might contribute to the increase in planctomycetes specifically the proliferation of candidatus kuenenia the representative genus in planctomycetes was greatly promoted during this period and then reduced in the following phase afterwards the abundance of ca kuenenia in the three experimental reactors recovered to different levels it was interesting that the final abundance of ca kuenenia in re was significantly higher than the initial value while that in rs was lower than the initial values this result suggested that smz had a significant inhibitory and lasting impact on the anammox bacteria but the effect of etc was smaller and temporary simultaneously ca kuenenia also maintained a relatively lower abundance in rse during phase 3 5 indicating that the side effects of smz outweighed the adaptability of anammox bacteria however such inhibition was reversable which could be concluded from the increasing trend in the last phase of recovery the response of proteobacteria to these two antibiotics was also opposite especially burkholderiales at the order level the abundance of proteobacteria was dramatically reduced from 20 5 to 16 7 in re while it increased from 22 2 to 26 2 in rs the different variations indicated that proteobacteria was more sensitive to etc but was tolerant to smz the combined effect of both antibiotics caused a slight decrease in the proteobacteria populations from 21 2 to 20 2 in rse confirming the antagonistic effects between etc and smz on proteobacteria a similar response was also observed for chloroflexi this phylum plays an important role in the flocculation of sludge and may cause sludge bulking when they extensively grow zhang et al 2015 caldilinea was the predominant genus of chloroflexi the eikelboom type 0803 a typical bulking caused filamentous bacterium was morphologically identified to be affiliated with caldilinea kragelund et al 2011 at the genus level several functional bacteria might be involved in the nitrogen removal of this system for example the genome of ignavibacterium album contains a nrfah complex suggesting that this microorganism is able to catalyze the second step of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra which is the reduction of nitrite to ammonium grießmeier et al 2017 nitrosomonas are mainly responsible for nitrification the cooccurrence of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and ca kuenenia was observed in the full scale wastewater treatment systems and they were distributed differently in terms of biomass park et al 2014 nitrosomonas was also the only aob detected in the one stage nitritation anammox systems and was distributed on the surface compared with anammox bacteria in the intra of granules chu et al 2015 although the synthetic wastewater composition was strictly autotrophic heterotrophic bacteria still coexisted in all anammox reactors their survival probably depends on the soluble microbial products and eps cydzik kwiatkowska and zielińska 2016 the pca in fig 3 elucidated a distinct separation between the sludge samples collected in the low stress period and the high stress period which was primarily attributed to the increase in the relative abundances of parcubacteria ca saccharibacteria and nitrospirae under the high strength antibiotic stress 3 3 variations in key genes under different antibiotics stress the abundances of args and the expression level of functional genes changed with increasing antibiotic concentrations fig 4 in general the expression levels of amx and hzsa in the control reactor were higher than those in the three experimental reactors especially in the last two phases the inhibition of antibiotics on functional genes was in line with the decrease in the abundance of ca kuenenia further leading to the deterioration of the process performance in the anammox systems in contrast antibiotic stress showed a promoting effect on the abundances of args with the long term stress of antibiotics the final abundances of sul1 sul2 and ermf in the experimental reactors in phase 6 were significantly higher p 0 05 than those in rc it was noted that the abundances of sul1 and sul2 in rse were generally higher than those in rs indicating that multiple antibiotics might induce the transfer of args the abundance of ermf in re and rse dramatically increased in the last phase and was mainly ascribed to the horizontal transfer of args which was reflected by the similar trend of inti1 although antibiotic stress in rse was removed in phase 6 args and inti1 continuously accumulated and their total abundances peaked at 2 5 106 copies g 1 sludge implying the occurrence of horizontal gene transfer hgt and proliferation of arg carrying bacteria based on the variations in the abundance of inti1 antibiotic stress was likely to be the main driving force for the gene transfer which probably further promoted the occurrence of novel args and arb 4 discussion 4 1 correlations analysis and potential host bacteria of args according to the correlation analysis of the bacteria the top 50 genera in terms of abundance functional and resistance genes table s3 the variations of several genera were significantly correlated with each other 117 pairs and those of args 13 pairs in terms of the dominant top 20 genera fig 5 ca kuenenia was positively correlated with sul1 r 0 894 p 0 05 while phycisphaera gp10 and gp3 exhibited a significantly positive correlation with sul2 r 0 874 r 0 883 r 0 888 p 0 05 in addition nitrospira was also positively correlated with sul2 r 0 835 p 0 05 indicating that these microorganisms were more tolerant to high concentration antibiotic stress and contributed to the nitrogen removal of the process during the inhibitory periods phycisphaera and nitrospira have been reported to be widely detected in wwtps and are involved in nitrification and denitrification fan et al 2020 xia et al 2019 network analysis was conducted to identify the potential host bacteria of args under antibiotic stress fig 5 the three args sul1 sul2 and ermf exhibited connections with 103 genera in total table s4 the potential hosts of args might change with different antibiotic stresses for example ca kuenenia was predicted to carry sul2 and ermf in rse while both genes were independent of this bacterium in systems under single antibiotic stress it was noted that the numbers of potential host bacteria of sul2 and ermf in rse were much higher than those in rs and re reconfirming that multi antibiotic stress prompted the horizontal transfer of both args except for ca kuenenia many of these predicted arg carrying bacteria have been reported to be involved in nitrogen removal or at least detected in denitrification systems such as nitrospira ignavibacterium thauera and comamonas birgitta et al 1998 gumaelius et al 2001 combined with the analysis of the microbial community evolution the potential resistant bacteria with the increasing abundance under antibiotic stress e g ignavibacterium were the major contributors to maintaining nitrogen removal during the inhibitory period there might be a competitive growth between these antibiotic resistant community and nonresistant community under the long term stress of the high concentration antibiotic the former population inevitably outcompeted the latter therefore controlling the extensive proliferation of the arg carrying bacteria is urgent qian et al 2020 proposed that the increase in abiogenetic temperature and anthropogenically sourced salinity provided the opportunity for the advantageous growth of nonresistant community in bacterial ecosystems 4 2 transfer of args implied the co selection of multi antibiotic resistance although args transfer has two processes namely hgt and vertical gene transfer vgt the high prevalence of multi drug resistance mdr should be attributed mainly to the dissemination of mdr strains by point mutations and hgt chang et al 2015 mobile genetic elements mges play an intermediary role in the arg transfer such as plasmids and bacteriophages it was reported that mobile plasmid in the extracellular matrix mainly contributed to the facilitated dissemination of arg through forming substituted aromatic plasmid complexes to antagonize the eps mediated hydrolysis shou et al 2019 many recombinant plasmids carried inti1 tennstedt et al 2003 according to fig 4 the abundances of inti1 and args in rse were generally higher than those in rs and re and the correlation analysis results also indicated that horizontal transfer of resistance genes occurred in the anammox systems resistance gene transfer is recognized as the root of multi antibiotic resistance summers 2006 the abundance of inti1 in rse continuously increased from day 138 and reached the highest value of 4 7 106 copies g 1 sludge in the last phase this maximum value was higher than that of the rest reactors especially the control indicating that inti1 promoted the horizontal transfer of args it was reported that sul genes were normally found in integron and plasmid ho et al 2009 verifying the correlations between the sul gene and inti1 table s3 in addition non antibiotic chemicals specifically heavy metals can also put coselective pressures on the microbial community and further enrich bacteria with multi antibiotic resistance fan et al 2019 metal nanoparticles have been reported to accelerate the plasmid mediated horizontal transfer of args li et al 2020 based on the microbial community analysis antibiotic stress contributed to the population evolution of the anammox system in turn hgt was conductive to maintaining the equilibrium of microbial communities fan et al 2018 also proposed that the rate and direction of hgt significantly affected the structural stability and robustness of the microbial community gene transfer may help systems recover from disturbance to a certain extent it was noted that the total abundances of args and inti1 in re dramatically increased in the last phase while the diversity and richness of the microbial community remained comparable a similar phenomenon was also observed in the other two reactors validating the importance of gene transfer in maintaining population and operation stability 4 3 antibiotic eps complex and args accumulation relieve the stress of antibiotics based on the previous analysis proteins in eps played a vital role in preventing antibiotic and arg invaders through hydrolysis chaloupka 2012 zeta potential is closely related to the structural stability of eps chen et al 2021 to further determine the interaction between eps and antibiotics zeta potentials of the eps antibiotic mixtures were measured and compared fig 6 the original zeta potential of eps was 12 3 mv with adding different concentrations of smz the zeta potential increased to 10 5 mv 2 mg l 1 and 5 9 mv 16 mg l 1 similarly the zeta potential of eps etc mixtures increased to 11 2 mv 0 2 mg l 1 and 7 2 mv 1 6 mg l 1 apparently the higher absolute values of zeta potential reflect the larger electrostatic repulsion and less aggregation in colloid li et al 2016 with the increasing concentrations of antibiotics the zeta potential of eps antibiotic mixtures increased indicating that antibiotics reduced the negative charges on the eps surface and changed the configuration of eps molecular docking simulation was further performed to visualize the connection between antibiotics and proteins in eps as mentioned above the compositions of eps are complex containing numerous polysaccharides and proteins yu 2020 proteomic analysis results showed that 367 proteins were identified in the eps of the anammox sludge sample which were involved in substrate transport ion binding and so on chen et al 2019 however the structures and functions of most proteins remained unclear in the protein database pdb only 15 proteins can be retrieved in ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis which is also the dominant anammox bacteria in this study as the essential for anammox bacteria sensing and assimilation of external ammonium are also the typical domains of the ubiquitous amt rh ammonium transporter thus ammonium transporter id 6eu6 was selected as a representative receptor for molecular docking simulation the optimal binding energy of the receptor 6eu6 and ligand smz was 7 58 kcal mol 1 as shown in fig 7a there were three hydrogen bonds between the receptor binding sites glu 307 hys 191 and asp 318 and the small molecule ligand the distances of these hydrogen bonds were 1 9 1 8 and 2 2 respectively similarly etc was also able to bind with the ammonium transporter at the binding site of thr 32 and the optimal binding energy was 2 74 fig 7b similar combination through h bond was previously simulated between ciprofloxacin and tryptophan residues in biofilm and metal bridge further contributed to detaining ciprofloxacin in the extracellular matrices kang et al 2017 notably the different binding sites of etc and smz indicated that both antibiotics might combine with the protein in eps simultaneously the antibiotic eps complex reduced the side effects of antibiotics on anammox bacteria the increase in the pn content in eps was conductive to the maintenance of stable nitrogen removal performance during the inhibitory period in addition to the external protection of eps the args accumulation also provided an internal protection according to the quantification results of three args their abundances generally increased with the antibiotic concentrations especially in the last phase fig 4 the sul1 gene is generally found in the tn21 type integron while sul2 is usually located on small plasmids of the incq family and another type plasmid ho et al 2009 the expressed products of both genes showed low km values for sulfonamides binding thus the inhibitory effects of sulfonamides on bacterial proliferation were reduced sköld 2000 in terms of the macrolide resistance gene ermf erm encoding methyltransferases catalyze the dimethylation of the 23s rrna nucleotide a2058 vester et al 1995 the conformational change of this drug binding site limited the combination of 23s rrna and macrolides maintaining the normal transcription process svetlov et al 2021 therefore the accumulation and expression of args could help bacteria to tolerate the selection pressure of multi antibiotics 5 conclusions the full scale implementation of anammox process is still a huge challenge especially for the treatment of antibiotic containing wastewater results of this study suggested that the anammox process was able to tolerate the stress of low concentration antibiotics while the high concentration antibiotics exhibited a significant inhibition especially under the multi antibiotic stress the deterioration in the process performance was reversible suggesting that the anammox process has a great potential to treat the wastewater containing multi antibiotics the establishment of systemic resistance was mainly attributed to the eps protection and the args accumulation during the long term acclimation the potential three dimensional structures showing the interaction between extracellular proteins of anammox sludge and antibiotics were also illustrated based on the molecular docking simulation the outcomes of this study are important for clarifying the effect and mechanism of multiple antibiotics on anammox process and for promoting anammox process in the treatment of antibiotic containing
