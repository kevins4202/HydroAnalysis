7545,the characteristic intermittency of rainfall includes temporary cessations hiatuses as well as periods of very low intensity within more intense events to understand how these characteristics of rainfall affect overland flow production rainfall simulations involving repeated cycles of on off intermittency were carried out on dryland soils in arid western new south wales australia periods of rain 10 mm h and no rain were applied in alternation with cycle times from 3 min to 25 min in experiments lasting 1 1 5 h results showed that intermittency could delay the onset of runoff by more than 30 min reduce the runoff ratio reduce the peak runoff rate and reduce the apparent event infiltration rate by 30 45 when hiatuses in rainfall were longer than 15 20 min runoff that had resulted from prior rain ceased completely before the recommencement of rain results demonstrate that if rainfall intermittency is not accounted for estimates of infiltrability based on runoff plot data can be systematically in error despite the use of intermittent rain the episodic occurrence of runoff could be predicted successfully by fitting multiple affine horton infiltration equations whose changing f 0 and k f coefficients but uniform values of f c reflected the redistribution of soil moisture and the change in the infiltrability f during hiatuses in rainfall the value of f c varied little among the fitted equations so constituting an affine set of relationships this new approach provides an alternative to the use of steady state methods that are common in rainfall simulation experiments and which typically yield only an estimate of f c the new field results confirm that intermittency affects infiltration and runoff depths and timing at plot scale and on intra event timescales additional work on other soil types and at other spatial and temporal scales is needed to test the generality of these findings keywords rainfall intermittency infiltration runoff affine horton infiltration

horticulture sigua et al 1993 1995 ryan et al 1998 srinivasan et al 2007 bramorski et al 2015 finally the infiltrability of soils that drives rainfall partitioning is by itself an important parameter that correlates with and may partially account for annual net primary productivity in some important ecosystems including croplands stroosnijder 1996 shaver et al 2013 reinhart et al 2015 research on these topics faces many challenges including the difficulties of scaling in the transfer of results beyond the small spatial dimensions usually employed in experimental work shouse et al 1994 han et al 2012 one virtually ubiquitous challenge in seeking to understand the occurrence of overland flow and its various environmental impacts is unravelling the role of the rainfall regime including aspects such as seasonality the depth and intensity of rainfall events the waiting time between events which influences drying time and hence antecedent soil wetness devising measures of rainfall impact energy and erosivity and so forth the intermittency of natural rainfall is an aspect that has been excluded from almost all experimental work which in most cases is carried out using simulated rainfall at a constant high intensity this raises the question of how well surface processes under constant intense rainfall reflect those occurring under natural rainfall where intensity fluctuations and intermittency are almost ubiquitous consequently the effects of intermittency of rainfall on infiltration and overland flow form the subjects of the present paper under the typical experimental conditions adopted in rainfall simulations rainfall intensity i is sustained until runoff begins and then rises toward an hypothetical steady state value r from which the steady state soil infiltrability f is estimated from the difference between rainfall and runoff rates according to the relation 1 f i r in which all terms are in mm h li et al 2011 harden and scruggs 2003 in some studies infiltration is fitted to horton type equations li et al 2011 arnau rosalen et al 2008 models such as the horton and green ampt equations incorporate monotonically declining infiltrability as a function of elapsed time or accumulated infiltration depth although they possess no intrinsic means of analysing infiltration under natural rainfall exhibiting both intermittency and intensity fluctuations they do permit the rate and trajectory of the decline toward the saturated infiltrability f c to be analysed the horton equation used in the present study can be written 2 f f c f 0 f c exp k f t where f is the time varying infiltrability f 0 is the initial pre rainfall infiltration capacity f c the final saturated or steady state infiltration capacity all in mm h t is elapsed time min and kf is the infiltration decay rate constant horton 1939 in this equation f is simply a monotonically declining function of increasing rain duration this equation has found wide application in the rainfall simulation studies cited above that employed constant rainfall intensity however in terms of predicting the occurrence of overland flow f c provides too little information to account for infiltration excess earlier in a rainfall event before f c is reached but when rainfall intensity exceeds f consequently despite the widespread use of constant intensity rainfall simulation and of the estimation of f c using steady state approaches eq 1 an understanding of the time varying rate of infiltration is required to predict the flux of overland flow generated by intermittent rainfall not least because as reinhart and taylor 1954 showed infiltrability recovers during hiatuses in rainfall such that any infiltration excess is reduced after an hiatus of sufficient length reinhart and taylor 1954 speculated that some of this effect might arise from the re development of interception and depression storage capacity during an hiatus nevertheless even if they are exposed to natural intermittent rainfall it is common for the rainfall input to field areas such as runoff plots or small catchments to be described using one or a few simple measures that neglect intermittency rainfall is commonly divided into events using a nominated minimum inter event rainless time mit or analysed as total hourly or daily rainfall and described by measures including depth mm duration h a measure of peak intensity such as i30 mm h and average rainfall rate mm h joel et al 2002 chamizo et al 2012 though the event profile the temporal sequence of intensities within a rainfall event has been considered as a descriptive tool for some time huff 1967 only in a minority of experimental studies is the event profile considered welderufael et al 2009 while intermittency has hardly been considered at all because natural rainfall almost always exhibits intermittency this is a major gap in our methodology and in our understanding of several key hydrologic processes intermittency is taken here to mean the time variation of rainfall intensity such that there are breaks hiatuses in rainfall or periods of very low intensity that do not exceed the soil infiltrability temporary cessations of rainfall may occupy much of the intra event time during a rainfall event because using the mit criterion to separate events allows hiatuses almost as long as the mit to be included in a single event dunkerley 2008 in many cases therefore as commonly defined the duration of a rainfall event may substantially exceed the actual duration of rainfall at intensities sufficient to produce ponding or overland flow this means that the event mean rainfall rate may be less than the typical intensities when rain is actually falling the conditional rainfall rate and that in the case of intermittent rainfall events most events the mean intensity may not be an appropriate descriptor for use in the prediction of overland flow during an hiatus in rainfall the redistribution of soil moisture and the associated regeneration of near surface soil suction allow ponding to partially or wholly dissipate aryal et al 2007 and the infiltrability to recover from the value that had been reached at the time rainfall ceased smith et al 1993 little seems to be known about levels of intermittency in various rainfall regimes frontal convective orographic stratiform arid wet tropical etc or about the extent to which a consideration of intermittency might help to account for the observed variability in runoff depths runoff ratios and fluxes and possibly delivery of sediments nutrients and agrochemicals that result from intermittency within rainfall events that are otherwise comparable in terms of measures like depth duration i30 or mean intensity the climatology of rainfall intermittency is a subject in need of more study as an example for the present arid location in australia dunkerley 2015 demonstrated that shorter smaller and less intense rainfall events tend to exhibit greater intermittency than do longer larger and more intense events whether this is true in other rainfall climates appears to be unknown though intermittency has been considered in approaches to the temporal downscaling of precipitation data this has generally been done using the statistical manipulation of wet and dry intervals and perhaps intensity using imposed probability distributions callau poduje and haberlandt 2017 for instance lombardo et al 2012 and paschalis et al 2014 employed a multiplicative random cascade approach to predict periods of rain or no rain within an event down to a time scale of minutes these approaches fail to capture the tendency for early or late intensity peaks to occur in particular rainfall climates as reflected in the huff curves huff 1967 nor the metric properties of intermittency documented by dunkerley 2015 to the writer s knowledge such metrics have not been included in any published approach to statistical downscaling though molini et al 2010 explored some aspects of causality of variation in rainfall behaviour across a range of short time scales 1 1 soil physics and surface response approaches to plot hydrology various theoretical approaches to the analysis of infiltration but not directly targeting the prediction of overland flow from multiple successive rainfall events as well as intermittent events have been explored a number are based on the green ampt approach modified variously to allow estimation of the redistribution of water within the soil that occurs during hiatuses in rainfall ogden and saghafian 1997 gowdish and muñoz carpena 2009 other approaches to dealing with infiltration under changing rainfall rates and with hiatuses in rainfall have been reported morel seytoux 1978 smith et al 1993 corradini et al 1994 smith et al 1999 corradini et al 2000 these studies track the subsurface redistribution of moisture during hiatuses using various simplifying assumptions and re compute infiltration rates post hiatus model testing has generally been done by comparison with solutions to the richards equation corradini et al 2000 noted that comparison with experimental data would be valuable but observed that they knew of no suitable data it is not clear how one might use field based rainfall simulation or natural rain runoff data from real landscapes to validate soil physics approaches this is because such approaches do not incorporate any soil surface microtopography the influence of plants and organic litter surface stones biological soil crusts or the effects of drop impact or overland flow on the soil surface they cannot thus incorporate the hydrologic effects of the filling or emptying or surface ponding or the consequent delays in the timing of overland flow recorded at runoff plot outlets likewise they are unable to incorporate the routing of overland flow across the soil surface generally regarded as involving the evolution of a flow cascade in which overland flow spills from one depression to another resulting eventually depending on the rainfall character including intensity and duration in integrated runoff this integration collapses progressively during hiatuses in rainfall possibly in a sequence from earliest cessation upslope to last cessation downslope and this also cannot be captured in infiltration theory that considers only the soil column without regard to key processes such as flow routing across the soil surface an additional challenge to all approaches to understanding infiltration under intermittent rainfall is that in the landscape the soil surface condition may change during the rainfall soil aggregate breakdown formation and erosion of soil surface seals changes in microtopography and flow patterns and changes in the intensity of splash arising from varying ponding depths may all affect surface water partitioning torri et al 1999 changes in drop diameters and drop arrival rates may also be influential foley and silburn 2002 the present study consequently instead adopts a surface response approach to the investigation of overland flow this uses the observed difference between applied rainfall depth and measured runoff depth during short intra event time periods to evaluate infiltration capacity and infiltration rate changes and hence to seek an understanding of overland flow production the advantage of this approach over the soil physics scheme just outlined is that it incorporates all of the processes active at the field site that affect overland flow production including soil surface erosion and deposition crusting air entrapment and flow routing the particular research questions addressed using rainfall simulation in the present study are as follows it is emphasised that the experimental findings relate to crusted dryland soils typical of ecologically important runoff source areas dunkerley and brown 1995 but target mechanisms that are likely to have much wider importance 1 during intermittent rainfall how do the metrics of rainfall intermittency such as the durations of rain and rainless intervals and the relative durations of rain and no rain intervals here termed the rainfall duty cycle affect infiltration and runoff depths 2 how does intermittency affect the time to runoff at plot scale 3 how does intermittency affect runoff ratios and peak runoff rates 4 can the time varying infiltrability f of soils exposed to intermittent rainfall including the recovery of f during hiatuses in rainfall and all soil surface and flow routing effects be estimated from plot scale rainfall and runoff data 2 surface responses to intermittent rainfall brief review of prior studies field studies have shown that there can be complex time varying relationships between key soil properties and the nature of incident rainfall darboux et al 2001 knapen et al 2008 most of these are not yet amenable to theoretical analysis but depend on experimental studies of infiltration and runoff in relation to measured soil properties soils prone to crust development for instance are known to exhibit infiltrability that is a function of the moisture content when rain begins le bissonnais and singer 1991 and hence on the drying time between showers levy et al 1984 soil texture also influences the time varying infiltrability hardy et al 1983 and the nature of seals and their effects on infiltration can vary spatially thus low points inundated by short duration or low intensity rain may exhibit reduced infiltrability owing to the development of depositional seals whilst higher points inundated in long duration or high intensity rain may show larger infiltrability torri et al 1999 this has been proposed as one explanation for the dependency of infiltration rate on rainfall intensity at least in field experiments using constant intensity simulated rain dunne et al 1991 influences such as these related to microtopography and to rainfall intensity are not included in the soil physics approach to understanding infiltration torri et al 1999 stressed that models of slope response to rainfall that do not incorporate time varying changes in the soil surface and near surface may well prove to be unsatisfactory several key findings have emerged from the small number of experimental studies that have explicitly examined the effects of intermittent rainfall overland flow may be generated by rain of relatively low intensity if the soil has been wetted up by prior rainfall and showers that primarily wet up soil after a prolonged dry period may result in no overland flow even if they are more intense than the later showers that do result in runoff yair 1983 lange et al 2003 thus the production of overland flow is dependent on the sequence and properties of antecedent rainfalls and cannot adequately be predicted without taking their effects into account moreover infiltrability is known to recover during rainless periods between showers but to decline more rapidly and to a lower value in subsequent rainfalls that follow sufficiently closely in time this effect has been shown for successive rainfalls separated by periods ranging from a week fohrer et al 1999 to 10 min nicolas et al 2007 a limitation of the works mentioned here including the theoretical approaches mentioned earlier is that with the exception of the work of nicolas et al 2007 they concern the effects of successive rainfalls over several days and with rainfalls 1 7 days apart and provide less guidance on the effects of intermittency at intra event timescales from tens of minutes to one or perhaps a few hours or in multiple rainfalls during a single day this forms the focus of the present study 3 field experimental methods the field experiments were conducted at a dryland site in arid western new south wales australia the climate of the field area is arid with an average annual rainfall of about 220 mm and no marked wet or dry seasons vegetation consists primarily of scattered small shrubs and grasses often organised into spatial mosaics that include substantial areas of bare crusted soils and areas of relatively dense vegetation dunkerley brown 1995 the bare zones intergroves act as runoff sources and overland flow moves downslope where infiltration of runon water takes place in vegetated patches groves that show higher soil infiltrability in many cases the soil surface in the runoff source areas is colonised by cyanobacteria and bryophytes eight bounded runoff plots of 0 5 0 5 m were set up along a single contour in a bare intergrove and within a few metres of each other on a slope of about 0 5 the soils within the plots were visually indistinguishable the soil surfaces were essentially planar but carried scattered loose surface quartz granules and a few small pebbles as well as a cyanobacterial crust and occasional plant debris fig 1 plot walls were 10 cm in height and set carefully into the soil surface the corner joins being sealed with a silicone caulking compound the plot surface was open at the downslope end and drained freely into a steel collecting gutter that was set about 2 mm below the elevation of the plot surface in order to allow unrestricted drainage of overland flow the experimental design included the application of simulated rain either continuously at 10 mm h or intermittently with intervals of rainfall at 10 mm h separated by rainless intervals during which operation of a peristaltic pump feeding the rainfall simulator was halted under the control of a computer program see below the objective was to explore the effects of intermittency with no change in the conditional rainfall rate the intensity when actually raining this design was regarded as the only feasible way to explore the effects of intermittency without the confounding effects of varying intensity a consequence of this design is that the mean intensity during intermittent events was lower than the intensity during experiments run under a constant 10 mm h however the focus of this study is intermittency not the effects of different mean intensities or of intensity variation during an event which were addressed by dunkerley 2012 in experiments at a location close to that used for the present experiments the simulated rainfall was generated by a drop forming system consisting of a hermetically sealed chamber equipped with a grid of drop formers and linked to a peristaltic pump whose flow rate was varied at 1 s intervals under the control of a laptop computer on which were stored various design rainfall events having varying intermittency the drop forming module was suspended 2 m above the plot and the whole apparatus was enclosed by a heavy canvas screen to minimise the effects of wind on drop trajectories and on evaporation from the wet soil surface continuous rather than intermittent rainfall was also applied in one series of experiments in order to differentiate the infiltration and runoff behaviour under constant versus intermittent rain all rainfall both constant and intermittent was delivered at 10 mm h which is a typical intensity for rainfall events in the field area dunkerley 2013 most experiments were of 60 min duration though some were extended to 90 120 min as required for runoff to be initiated full details of the field apparatus are contained in dunkerley 2012 and dunkerley 2017 some experiments used square wave on off intermittent rainfall that is with the rain on time the same as the rain off time with rain applied and halted in alternation every 3 6 or 12 min these are referred to as the square wave experiments some of these experiments took more than 1 h to result in runoff in other experiments all of 60 min duration the rain and intervening hiatuses were of varying durations from 10 min to 25 min volumes of rainfall applied to the plots and runoff collected were recorded by weighing both the 1 5 l water supply container and the 500 ml collecting vessel which caught the runoff arriving at the plot outlet to the nearest 1 g every 2 min subsequently apparent event infiltration rates f mm h through the course of the experiments were calculated from 3 f p r t in which p is the event rainfall depth mm r is the event runoff depth mm and t is the event duration h three groups of experiments were conducted the first group constant intensity experiments used rain at a fixed intensity of 10 mm h multiple separate unused plots were used for these experiments all in a dry antecedent condition following some weeks without rainfall the second group of experiments the square wave experiments used rain on off cycles every 3 6 and 12 min for 1 h a single separate unused dry plot was used once only for each of these three experiments three plots in all in all cases the duration of each rain pulse was exactly equal to the duration of the following rainless period with the pattern simply repeated until an hour had elapsed the third group of experiments employed varying durations for both the rain and rainless periods in the range 10 25 min in four different temporal patterns and with the experiment duration in all cases being 1 h experiments in this third group were again each carried out on a different adjacent plot plots 1 4 and all of the plots were all initially dry following some weeks without rain each experiment was then repeated after 7 h of drying time during hot and sunny weather in each case on the same plot 1 2 3 or 4 as used for the initial dry experiment these replicates were designed to see whether and if so how the effects of intermittency varied under dry and damp soil conditions the same plots were re used in the damp condition so that the only factor that varied between the dry antecedent and the damp antecedent experiments was the moisture content of the soil within the plot each individual plot was presumed to have a slightly different pattern of surface stones or soil cracking or other features that might affect the infiltration behaviour and therefore the repeat experiments were always carried out on the same plot after the drying time already mentioned details of all three groups of experiments are set out in tables 1 3 the observed overland flow hydrographs collected at the plot outlets were interpreted using a series of horton infiltration equations as described by dunkerley 2017 a spreadsheet was used to allow the adjustment of the horton equation parameters in order to achieve the best correspondence of predicted runoff rates and observed runoff rates the key parameter adjusted was the initial infiltrability f 0 which was allowed to recover during hiatuses in rainfall and the exponential decay coefficient kf which as noted above may also change during hiatuses such that more rapid decline in infiltrability is seen in later rainfall pulses however in contrast no adjustment to the final infiltrability f c was required as a result of hiatuses since this is essentially a property of the saturated soil consequently a group of what have been termed affine horton equations dunkerley2017 that share a common value of f c were defined a major advantage of this approach as outlined by dunkerley 2017 is that it allows the rate of recovery of f 0 to be estimated from plot runoff data in turn this allows the production of overland flow in both timing and volume to be better predicted than when the only data available are f c especially since in short or very intermittent events f c may never be expressed by the constantly draining soils moreover the use of a notional single value of the initial infiltrability f 0 fails to account for the fact that in successive bursts of rainfall a different value of f 0 has to be fitted to allow for the subsoil redistribution of moisture during the intervening hiatus 3 1 comparison of simulated rainfall events with natural events in the field area given the focus of the present work it is important to consider the intermittency characteristics of natural rainfall in the field area in relation to the simulated rainfall events the natural rainfall was analysed by dunkerley 2015 using a continuous record of more than 10 years tipping bucket data at 0 5 mm resolution delineating events using the minimum inter event time mit criterion and adopting a rainfall rate of 0 5 mm h to define an hiatus he showed that the proportion of rainfall events that were classified as intermittent that is containing at least one not raining period of at least an hour lay in the range 59 75 depending on the mit value adopted moreover for all values of mit examined an average of at least 60 of the total event duration was classed as not raining i e intensity 0 5 mm h and frequently this was comprised of multiple not raining periods of varying duration event mean rainfall rates including the intra event rainless periods were about 5 mm h this is reproduced in the present rainfall simulation experiments by applying rainfall at 10 mm h in events with typically 50 intermittency dunkerley 2017 presented additional detail of the rainfall regime at the field site 4 results 4 1 constant intensity experiments the replicate experiments using rain of fixed 10 mm h intensity all yielded runoff within the first 30 min the mean time to runoff across 11 replicate runs on initially dry soil was 21 4 min and in 4 cases runoff began within 15 min table 1 once initiated runoff was continuous and tended to approach a stable value in the last 10 15 min of each experiment generally at 2 4 mm h average 3 7 mm h two representative hydrographs are presented in fig 2 the final or steady state infiltrability f c was estimated from the last 10 min of data for each experiment table 2 and averaged 6 3 mm h this agrees with prior estimates for these crusted soils derived from both ponded cylinder infiltrometers and small plot rainfall simulation in the same field area dunkerley 2000 of 5 10 mm h overall event infiltration rates in the 11 replicate experiments f averaged 7 6 mm h 4 2 intermittent rainfall experiments there were two sets of experiments rapid square wave tests of 90 min duration 50 rainfall duty cycle and variable duty cycle experiments of 60 min duration as explained above the former were all conducted on dry soil the latter experiments were carried out first on dry soil and repeated 7 h later on the same set of runoff plots to represent damp antecedent conditions the objective of this was to assess the extent to which antecedent soil wetness affected infiltration behaviour and the timing of any periods of runoff under intermittent rain 4 2 1 the square wave experiments 3 6 and 12 min on off cycles on initially dry soil the rapidly pulsed rainfall 3 6 and 12 min square wave experiments each lasting 90 min all yielded continuous runoff at low rates although the onset of runoff required 50 65 min considerably longer than the time lag seen under continuous rainfall table 2 given that rainfall was applied for 50 of the time and the intensity always exceeded f c there is clearly an effect of intermittency on time to runoff that is additional to the halving of the mean rainfall rate this nonlinear response is evident because time to runoff increased by about 300 whereas mean rainfall intensity only declined by 50 in the intermittent rain because of the slow onset of runoff the experiments were extended from 60 min to 90 min runoff rates which rose steadily following the onset of runoff peaked at or close to the end of the experiments at rates of 1 5 mm h 2 3 mm h and 0 85 mm h for the three experiments these rates are generally lower than those reached after only 60 min of continuous rainfall despite the longer experiment duration the apparent event infiltration rates derived from the plot data on rainfall event input and runoff output are informative during the experiments 80 90 of the applied rainfall infiltrated the apparent event infiltration rates estimated using eq 1 above for the 3 6 and 12 min square wave experiments were 4 2 mm h 4 5 mm h and 4 9 mm h moreover the apparent infiltration rate f increased as a power function of the intermittency cycle time according to 4 f 3 62 λ 0 12 where λ is the rain on or off time min with r2 0 999 fig 3 in a related way the event runoff ratio φ declined with increasing intermittency cycle time according to 5 ϕ 2 91 λ 0 01 where λ is the rain on or off time min with r2 0 999 fig 3 to the writer s knowledge this dependency of f and φ on the timing of intermittency has not been reported previously it is important to recall that these are square wave 50 duty cycle experiments that were not intended to mimic natural rainfall but rather to explore some aspects of soil responses to intermittent rainfall 4 2 2 the 60 min variable duty cycle experiments these experiments used rainfall sequences with varying numbers of hiatuses in rainfall and varying durations of rain and rainless periods variable duty cycle to form four different patterns of intermittency the longest hiatus was 25 min and the shortest was 10 min tables 3 and 4 in two of the experiments on initially dry soil no runoff was generated even after 60 min table 4 these two events both included the largest fraction of rainless time a total of 30 min without rain divided into two hiatuses on the tested soils therefore a rainfall event that includes bursts of 10 20 min duration even at intensities exceeding the steady state infiltrability of the soils may not necessarily yield any runoff this conclusion could also be deduced from the continuous rainfall experiments where the average time required for the onset of runoff was 21 4 min table 1 interestingly the average time to runoff in the 60 min experiments was very similar 21 3 min table 4 but was as long as 34 min in one experiment this is readily accounted for by the fact that every experiment began with a period of rainfall with intermittency only activated after 10 20 min in the other six 1 h experiments runoff was generated including from an event with a 20 min rainfall hiatus peak runoff rate was 6 25 mm h notably higher than the rates seen in the 3 6 and 12 min square wave experiments presented above where the conditional intensity of the rainfall was the same but with marked intermittency in the 60 min variable intermittency experiments infiltration and runoff behaviour were similar to what was observed in the 90 min 3 6 and 12 min square wave experiments table 3 fig 2 runoff rates rose steadily after an initial lag time runoff ratios were only moderate averaging 15 8 table 4 in intermittency pattern 1 for instance the 1 h rainfall event was comprised of two 20 min periods of rain separated by a 20 min rainless period on initially dry soil runoff began after 10 min of rain in the first period and renewed runoff began after 6 min in the second period following the 20 min hiatus fig 4 during the second episode of runoff the runoff rate rose more rapidly than during the first runoff episode and reached a rate of 4 mm h at the end of the experiment analysing the infiltration rates separately for the two periods of rainfall the values are 9 0 mm h and 7 5 mm h however using lumped event rainfall and runoff depths the apparent infiltration rate f for the whole 60 min event is 5 6 mm h this is a little larger than the 5 3 mm h estimated from the 12 min square wave experiments this would be expected because although the longer 20 min periods of rain allow the infiltrability to decline more than is possible in shorter periods of rain in the way described by the horton infiltration equation or other similar approaches the longer period of continuous rainfall offers fewer hiatuses for the partial recovery of infiltrability that were present in the 3 6 and 12 min square wave tests the results presented in table 4 and fig 3 show that intermittency pattern 4 which had the longest rainfall hiatus 25 min yielded the lowest peak runoff rate 3 8 mm h and the lowest runoff ratio 7 9 this intermittency pattern yielded no runoff on initially dry soil in contrast intermittency pattern 2 on damp soil with only 10 min hiatuses yielded the highest peak runoff rate 6 3 mm h and the largest runoff ratio 22 9 clearly therefore the timing and sequence of intermittency affect key hydrologic response parameters the behaviour of infiltration and runoff in the other intermittency patterns is set out in table 4 and fig 4 4 3 estimating infiltrability changes from intermittent rainfall the time varying infiltrability of the plot surfaces was estimated as described by dunkerley 2017 by fitting a series of horton infiltration equations refer to eq 2 above coefficients were adjusted manually in a spreadsheet whilst observing superimposed graphs of observed and predicted runoff the procedure could be automated if need be with fitting tolerance criteria established before the optimisation this procedure involves moderate but understandable errors in runoff timing in which the calculated runoff typically begins about 4 min before the observed runoff this is reasoned to reflect the slowing of runoff release from the plot by surface tension effects at edge of the runoff collecting sill during drainage laterally along the collecting gutter and finally during release from the exit pipe at the latter point especially during the slow onset of runoff water was observed to build up until there was sufficient to break the surface tension and release a pulse of flow from these causes a delay in recording runoff of a few minutes can readily be accounted for likewise the simple horton runoff calculation neglects the steering of runoff by the plot microtopography and the delay involved when ponding has to develop and subsequently overtop a low barrier before downslope flow can occur by deepening the flow being routed along subtle preferred flow pathways the microtopography may be able to result in higher flow speeds and higher runoff peaks during rainfall intensity bursts consequently some error in accounting for peak runoff rates in both timing and magnitude is to be expected flow paths across the plots and the collecting gutter configuration can be seen in fig 1 nevertheless the affine horton equations table 5 predicted runoff volumes across the 6 1 h variable duty cycle experiments where runoff was recorded with an rms error of just 4 4 the largest over estimate of runoff volume was 6 6 and largest under estimate of runoff volume was 4 9 for 3 6 and 12 min square wave rainfall a single fitted horton equation predicted runoff timing and volume satisfactorily however for some of the 60 min experiments where periods of rain and no rain lasted 15 or 20 min multiple affine horton equations resulted in better predictions of the multiple occurrences of overland flow during the event as well as providing reasonable estimates of peak runoff rates and runoff depths table 6 5 discussion the results presented above establish that intra event intermittency of rainfall modifies infiltration and runoff production at plot scales given that intermittency is a common feature of rainfall with its burst like character peters and christensen 2002 it may be that intermittency and its effects warrant increased consideration in research on landsurface hydrology at least at plot to hillslope scales the rapid square wave experiments are discussed first given that in these experiments the rain fell for 50 of the elapsed time and that there was little runoff infiltration rates were close to the mean rainfall rate through the whole 90 min averaging 4 2 4 9 mm h these apparent rates are much lower than the actual steady state infiltration rates reached in shorter periods of continuous rainfall such as the 60 min of continuous rainfall at 10 mm h discussed earlier which averaged 7 6 mm h on the other hand infiltration rates corrected for the 50 of event duration which was rainless that is found by multiplying the apparent rates by 2 0 8 4 mm h 9 0 mm h and 9 8 mm h appear to be too high in comparison with the known steady state values for these soils these results reveal that intermittency affects the apparent infiltration rate f this is further explored shortly results of the 1 h variable intermittency experiments confirm that the observed event infiltration rate is influenced by the timing and sequence of rain and rainless periods the more rapid increase in runoff rate during second or subsequent bursts of rainfall suggest further that runoff generation is affected by the more rapid rate at which infiltrability declines once rainfall resumes on soil already partially wetted up by a prior period of rainfall this in turn presumably depends on the rate of subsoil water redistribution and the amount by which soil suction in near surface soils recovers during any preceding rainfall hiatus these effects have not been explored here and would require experiments to be conducted on a set of soils having contrasting textural properties taken together the present results have important implications they suggest that unanalysed intermittency in rainfall in studies for instance where only hourly or daily totals are recorded will hamper the correct interpretation and prediction of infiltrability and hence of the generation of overland flow the time to runoff of 50 65 min as just noted from the square wave experiments shows that during early bursts of rainfall the infiltration rate was equal to the rainfall intensity of 10 mm h and the infiltrability the potential rate of water uptake may have been considerably higher than this employing apparent infiltration rates would yield significant over prediction of runoff depths if applied to storm event data involving rainfall of lower intermittency the apparent infiltration rates are too low and do not directly reflect the actual infiltrability of the soils because the rainfall was intermittent on the other hand using the corrected infiltration rates would underestimate runoff in prolonged rainfall because these estimates exceed the known steady state infiltrability of these soils analysis of event rainfall and runoff depths without knowledge of the effects of intermittency may thus yield misleading estimates of infiltration rates in light of the square wave experiment results much depends on the length of the rain and intervening no rain periods without a knowledge of which the plot hydrology cannot be correctly interpreted a simple hypothetical example may illustrate this more clearly if during an hour rainfall totalling 10 mm and runoff of 2 mm were recorded from an experimental plot the apparent infiltration rate would be 8 mm h however if it is not detected that the hour of rainfall in fact contained 40 min of rainless time followed by 20 min of rain at 30 mm h required to yield the total of 10 mm for the entire hour it would not be possible to reason that the actual infiltrability expressed during those 20 min of rainfall must in fact have been 28 mm h the kind of error that might be made in data reduction evidently depends on the patterns and magnitudes of the intermittency actually present in the local rainfall regime of a study site the conclusion remains clear that if intermittency is not monitored and allowed for in calculating infiltration rates then erroneous estimates will result the full explanation for the results presented here will require additional experimentation during the early stages of rainfall soil suction forces dominate the entry of water into the soil and high suction gradients exist in the near subsurface philip 1957 1959 as the wetting front moves more deeply into the soil the suction gradient declines reducing the soil infiltrability according to the fitted horton equations in the soils tested the infiltrability of initially dry soils was 90 mm h such that initially no runoff was generated from the applied rainfall at 10 mm h if there was a sufficiently long hiatus in rainfall before the infiltrability had declined to 10 mm h no runoff resulted the fitting of affine horton equations showed that if an hiatus in rainfall was sufficiently long the soil infiltrability recovered during the hiatus so as to alter the soil response to a following period of rain if an hiatus is sufficiently long it increases the time lag before the onset of runoff when rain resumes intermittency on short timescales of less than about 10 15 min resulted in this effect occurring repeatedly through multiple successive cycles of rain and no rain such that time to first runoff lengthened to 1 h in some cases when intermittency was present on longer timescales of 15 25 min runoff was produced in each period of rain and there was little effect on time to first runoff the theoretical soil physics approaches to infiltration redistribution and reinfiltration have shown that this kind of behaviour could be expected during hiatuses in rainfall thus smith et al 1993 showed that following an hiatus infiltration rate was higher than would be estimated had the redistribution during the hiatus been neglected during an hiatus redistribution is reasoned to result in an increased depth of the wetting front and a corresponding decline in soil water content through the zone lying between the soil surface and the wetting front the actual form of the water content profile has been variously approximated as a rectangle a segment of an ellipse etc corradini et al 1997 to the best of the writer s knowledge the present results are the first to explore experimentally the effects of various forms of rainfall intermittency on overland flow that include the potential effects of spatially varying wetting depths and overland flow runoff paths as well as soil surface redistribution by splash and or flow the results confirm by direct observation that both intensity fluctuations and intermittency down to hiatus durations of as little as 15 20 min that is on intra event timescales modify both infiltration and overland flow behaviour among the limitations to the present work are the effects of experiment scale effects at the plot dimensions employed here almost certainly do not scale to hillslope dimensions for instance however the present findings could readily be incorporated into hillslope runoff models including cellular models ma et al 2009 in order to explore how the spatial scaling effects might behave the present results confirm that in addition to simple metrics such as the length of hiatuses the internal timing or sequence of rain and no rain periods within an event is significant for the production of overland flow welderufael et al 2009 employed the morin and cluff 1980 runoff model and found that runoff prediction was most successful for early peak rainfall events in which the intensity significantly exceeded the soil infiltrability the first quartile events of huff 1967 in which most rain accumulates in the first 25 of the storm duration with much less success found for rainfall events in which intensity remained close to the soil infiltrability likewise in the same field area as the present work dunkerley 2015 showed how infiltration and runoff rates varied with the position of intensity bursts in simulated rainfall events having the same depth duration and average intensity but no hiatuses he demonstrated that overland flow behaviour timing peak flow rates etc varied greatly depending on whether rainfall exhibited the highest intensity early or late during a shower it is hypothesised here that results of this kind are not completely explicable in terms of infiltration behaviour but involve also the evolution of drainage across the soil surface thus in events with early intensity peaks overland flow paths may be established early in the rainfall event and preferential soil wetting along these flow paths might facilitate enhanced runoff delivery in later possibly smaller intensity peaks these are aspects of the generation of overland flow that have not been investigated and that warrant further study other mechanisms may also contribute to the observed effects of rainfall intermittency on infiltration and runoff behaviour it is hypothesised that the effects of sorptivity philip 1957 which underlie the early phase of high soil infiltrability seen following the onset of rainfall may provide an explanation during the period when imbibition occurs under high suction gradients infiltrability the diffusive movement of water through the soil pore spaces is high and the water uptake reduces the potential runoff ratio for a rainfall event watanabe et al 2012 showed that antecedent volumetric soil moisture θ causes variations in sorptivity s similarly stewart et al 2013 established the dependence of sorptivity on soil wetness such that as saturation declines as might occur during a rainfall hiatus owing to subsurface redistribution and perhaps some evaporation sorptivity increases these findings suggest that following an hiatus in rainfall infiltration might be partly driven by the regeneration of sorptivity and that the repeated occurrence of such episodes of sorptivity renewal under intermittent rainfall could in part account for the need for a series of affine horton infiltration equations it is reasoned that the rate at which sorptivity is regenerated will be dependent on the particular hydraulic properties of the tested soils as well perhaps as the intensity of the rainfall striking the soil surface prior to and following an hiatus and that varying rates would emerge from tests on different soil materials and rainfall patterns in continuous rainfall as commonly used in rainfall simulation experiments sorptivity is usually only an influence on infiltration in the first few minutes of rainfall smettem and clothier 1989 consequently such experiments shed no light on the behaviour of sorptivity in intermittent rainfall additional experiments on different soil materials and eventually under natural rainfall using suitable measures of intermittency will be needed to explore further the effects of intermittency on infiltration and overland flow behaviour a further benefit may flow from a focus on the role of sorptivity especially during intermittent rain a reliance on f c the final steady state infiltrabilty reached after prolonged rainfall may yield little information on the key role of the near surface soil conditions that alter the value of s in the first minutes of rainfall or the first few minutes of each burst of rainfall as is suggested here consequently f c may prove to be of limited value in exploring the effects of landuse such as trampling in grazing landscapes and of litter and plant cover on infiltration and overland flow gifford and hawkins 1978 where rainfall exhibits significant intermittency 6 conclusions there are very few experimental studies addressing intra event intermittency and its effects on infiltration and runoff and it is hoped that the present results draw attention to some of the phenomena that result for the soils and rainfall intensities used in the experiments reported here the key findings in relation to the four research questions posed earlier are as follows 1 intermittency on short timescales 3 min 12 min does not significantly affect time to first runoff runoff is generated continuously once it is initiated and short hiatuses in rainfall after the start of runoff do not result in breaks of runoff nevertheless using the 3 6 and 12 min square wave rainfall simulation experiments apparent infiltration rate equation 1 rises as a power function of the intermittency period and runoff ratio correspondingly declines with increasing intermittency period apparent event infiltration rates are lower than the known final infiltration rates for these soils under prolonged rainfall it is hypothesised that progressively longer square wave intermittency cycles allow deeper penetration of the wetting front and more redistribution time when rain ceases such that the near surface soils maintain a higher infiltrability than when intermittency is present over shorter periods these processes mean that the apparent infiltration rate cannot simply be corrected for the effects of intermittency by making allowance for the aggregate fraction of event time that is rainless because the effect evidently depends on the duration and sequencing of hiatuses in rainfall 2 intermittency that involves longer hiatuses in rainfall of 10 25 min with a subsequent resumption of rainfall have greater effects on infiltration and overland flow behaviour in particular in the presence of intermittency on these timescales the time to first runoff can increase substantially and the peak runoff rates achieved in later bursts of rainfall are reduced in comparison with rain of the same but fixed intensity or indeed in comparison with the effects of intermittency on shorter timescales hiatuses in rainfall can result in the complete cessation of runoff time to runoff can be much shorter in response to second third or subsequent periods of rainfall than from the first rainfall as with the short time period intermittency apparent infiltration rates are lower than the known final infiltrability of the tested soils and cannot readily be corrected by making a simple numerical allowance for the intermittency 3 under intermittent rainfall apparent infiltration rates are reduced by 30 45 in comparison with those from experiments under constant rainfall intensity 5 27 mm h versus a mean of 7 6 mm h under constant intensity rain and runoff ratios are reduced an average of 9 4 runoff versus a mean of 23 4 under constant intensity rain to obtain reliable estimates of soil infiltrability intermittency has to be recorded and allowance made for its effect on apparent infiltration rates the use of hourly rainfall totals for instance when the rain exhibits intermittency would result in erroneous estimates of infiltrability 4 for intermittency on the longer hiatus timescales explored here 10 25 min the horton infiltration parameters can successfully be estimated by using a series of affine equations allowing for the partial recovery of infiltrability during rainfall hiatuses this indeed allows the successful prediction of the timing and fluxes of overland flow this approach has the major advantage that it incorporates a range of possible effects arising at the soil surface including erosion deposition ponding and flow routing additional experimental work will be needed to further clarify the mechanisms in terms of altered capillary drive or near surface sorptivity that underlie the present findings and to extend similar experiments to other soil types to the kinds of rainfall event profiles exhibited by non dryland rainfall

insightful comments which resulted in improvements to the paper 
7545,the characteristic intermittency of rainfall includes temporary cessations hiatuses as well as periods of very low intensity within more intense events to understand how these characteristics of rainfall affect overland flow production rainfall simulations involving repeated cycles of on off intermittency were carried out on dryland soils in arid western new south wales australia periods of rain 10 mm h and no rain were applied in alternation with cycle times from 3 min to 25 min in experiments lasting 1 1 5 h results showed that intermittency could delay the onset of runoff by more than 30 min reduce the runoff ratio reduce the peak runoff rate and reduce the apparent event infiltration rate by 30 45 when hiatuses in rainfall were longer than 15 20 min runoff that had resulted from prior rain ceased completely before the recommencement of rain results demonstrate that if rainfall intermittency is not accounted for estimates of infiltrability based on runoff plot data can be systematically in error despite the use of intermittent rain the episodic occurrence of runoff could be predicted successfully by fitting multiple affine horton infiltration equations whose changing f 0 and k f coefficients but uniform values of f c reflected the redistribution of soil moisture and the change in the infiltrability f during hiatuses in rainfall the value of f c varied little among the fitted equations so constituting an affine set of relationships this new approach provides an alternative to the use of steady state methods that are common in rainfall simulation experiments and which typically yield only an estimate of f c the new field results confirm that intermittency affects infiltration and runoff depths and timing at plot scale and on intra event timescales additional work on other soil types and at other spatial and temporal scales is needed to test the generality of these findings keywords rainfall intermittency infiltration runoff affine horton infiltration

horticulture sigua et al 1993 1995 ryan et al 1998 srinivasan et al 2007 bramorski et al 2015 finally the infiltrability of soils that drives rainfall partitioning is by itself an important parameter that correlates with and may partially account for annual net primary productivity in some important ecosystems including croplands stroosnijder 1996 shaver et al 2013 reinhart et al 2015 research on these topics faces many challenges including the difficulties of scaling in the transfer of results beyond the small spatial dimensions usually employed in experimental work shouse et al 1994 han et al 2012 one virtually ubiquitous challenge in seeking to understand the occurrence of overland flow and its various environmental impacts is unravelling the role of the rainfall regime including aspects such as seasonality the depth and intensity of rainfall events the waiting time between events which influences drying time and hence antecedent soil wetness devising measures of rainfall impact energy and erosivity and so forth the intermittency of natural rainfall is an aspect that has been excluded from almost all experimental work which in most cases is carried out using simulated rainfall at a constant high intensity this raises the question of how well surface processes under constant intense rainfall reflect those occurring under natural rainfall where intensity fluctuations and intermittency are almost ubiquitous consequently the effects of intermittency of rainfall on infiltration and overland flow form the subjects of the present paper under the typical experimental conditions adopted in rainfall simulations rainfall intensity i is sustained until runoff begins and then rises toward an hypothetical steady state value r from which the steady state soil infiltrability f is estimated from the difference between rainfall and runoff rates according to the relation 1 f i r in which all terms are in mm h li et al 2011 harden and scruggs 2003 in some studies infiltration is fitted to horton type equations li et al 2011 arnau rosalen et al 2008 models such as the horton and green ampt equations incorporate monotonically declining infiltrability as a function of elapsed time or accumulated infiltration depth although they possess no intrinsic means of analysing infiltration under natural rainfall exhibiting both intermittency and intensity fluctuations they do permit the rate and trajectory of the decline toward the saturated infiltrability f c to be analysed the horton equation used in the present study can be written 2 f f c f 0 f c exp k f t where f is the time varying infiltrability f 0 is the initial pre rainfall infiltration capacity f c the final saturated or steady state infiltration capacity all in mm h t is elapsed time min and kf is the infiltration decay rate constant horton 1939 in this equation f is simply a monotonically declining function of increasing rain duration this equation has found wide application in the rainfall simulation studies cited above that employed constant rainfall intensity however in terms of predicting the occurrence of overland flow f c provides too little information to account for infiltration excess earlier in a rainfall event before f c is reached but when rainfall intensity exceeds f consequently despite the widespread use of constant intensity rainfall simulation and of the estimation of f c using steady state approaches eq 1 an understanding of the time varying rate of infiltration is required to predict the flux of overland flow generated by intermittent rainfall not least because as reinhart and taylor 1954 showed infiltrability recovers during hiatuses in rainfall such that any infiltration excess is reduced after an hiatus of sufficient length reinhart and taylor 1954 speculated that some of this effect might arise from the re development of interception and depression storage capacity during an hiatus nevertheless even if they are exposed to natural intermittent rainfall it is common for the rainfall input to field areas such as runoff plots or small catchments to be described using one or a few simple measures that neglect intermittency rainfall is commonly divided into events using a nominated minimum inter event rainless time mit or analysed as total hourly or daily rainfall and described by measures including depth mm duration h a measure of peak intensity such as i30 mm h and average rainfall rate mm h joel et al 2002 chamizo et al 2012 though the event profile the temporal sequence of intensities within a rainfall event has been considered as a descriptive tool for some time huff 1967 only in a minority of experimental studies is the event profile considered welderufael et al 2009 while intermittency has hardly been considered at all because natural rainfall almost always exhibits intermittency this is a major gap in our methodology and in our understanding of several key hydrologic processes intermittency is taken here to mean the time variation of rainfall intensity such that there are breaks hiatuses in rainfall or periods of very low intensity that do not exceed the soil infiltrability temporary cessations of rainfall may occupy much of the intra event time during a rainfall event because using the mit criterion to separate events allows hiatuses almost as long as the mit to be included in a single event dunkerley 2008 in many cases therefore as commonly defined the duration of a rainfall event may substantially exceed the actual duration of rainfall at intensities sufficient to produce ponding or overland flow this means that the event mean rainfall rate may be less than the typical intensities when rain is actually falling the conditional rainfall rate and that in the case of intermittent rainfall events most events the mean intensity may not be an appropriate descriptor for use in the prediction of overland flow during an hiatus in rainfall the redistribution of soil moisture and the associated regeneration of near surface soil suction allow ponding to partially or wholly dissipate aryal et al 2007 and the infiltrability to recover from the value that had been reached at the time rainfall ceased smith et al 1993 little seems to be known about levels of intermittency in various rainfall regimes frontal convective orographic stratiform arid wet tropical etc or about the extent to which a consideration of intermittency might help to account for the observed variability in runoff depths runoff ratios and fluxes and possibly delivery of sediments nutrients and agrochemicals that result from intermittency within rainfall events that are otherwise comparable in terms of measures like depth duration i30 or mean intensity the climatology of rainfall intermittency is a subject in need of more study as an example for the present arid location in australia dunkerley 2015 demonstrated that shorter smaller and less intense rainfall events tend to exhibit greater intermittency than do longer larger and more intense events whether this is true in other rainfall climates appears to be unknown though intermittency has been considered in approaches to the temporal downscaling of precipitation data this has generally been done using the statistical manipulation of wet and dry intervals and perhaps intensity using imposed probability distributions callau poduje and haberlandt 2017 for instance lombardo et al 2012 and paschalis et al 2014 employed a multiplicative random cascade approach to predict periods of rain or no rain within an event down to a time scale of minutes these approaches fail to capture the tendency for early or late intensity peaks to occur in particular rainfall climates as reflected in the huff curves huff 1967 nor the metric properties of intermittency documented by dunkerley 2015 to the writer s knowledge such metrics have not been included in any published approach to statistical downscaling though molini et al 2010 explored some aspects of causality of variation in rainfall behaviour across a range of short time scales 1 1 soil physics and surface response approaches to plot hydrology various theoretical approaches to the analysis of infiltration but not directly targeting the prediction of overland flow from multiple successive rainfall events as well as intermittent events have been explored a number are based on the green ampt approach modified variously to allow estimation of the redistribution of water within the soil that occurs during hiatuses in rainfall ogden and saghafian 1997 gowdish and muñoz carpena 2009 other approaches to dealing with infiltration under changing rainfall rates and with hiatuses in rainfall have been reported morel seytoux 1978 smith et al 1993 corradini et al 1994 smith et al 1999 corradini et al 2000 these studies track the subsurface redistribution of moisture during hiatuses using various simplifying assumptions and re compute infiltration rates post hiatus model testing has generally been done by comparison with solutions to the richards equation corradini et al 2000 noted that comparison with experimental data would be valuable but observed that they knew of no suitable data it is not clear how one might use field based rainfall simulation or natural rain runoff data from real landscapes to validate soil physics approaches this is because such approaches do not incorporate any soil surface microtopography the influence of plants and organic litter surface stones biological soil crusts or the effects of drop impact or overland flow on the soil surface they cannot thus incorporate the hydrologic effects of the filling or emptying or surface ponding or the consequent delays in the timing of overland flow recorded at runoff plot outlets likewise they are unable to incorporate the routing of overland flow across the soil surface generally regarded as involving the evolution of a flow cascade in which overland flow spills from one depression to another resulting eventually depending on the rainfall character including intensity and duration in integrated runoff this integration collapses progressively during hiatuses in rainfall possibly in a sequence from earliest cessation upslope to last cessation downslope and this also cannot be captured in infiltration theory that considers only the soil column without regard to key processes such as flow routing across the soil surface an additional challenge to all approaches to understanding infiltration under intermittent rainfall is that in the landscape the soil surface condition may change during the rainfall soil aggregate breakdown formation and erosion of soil surface seals changes in microtopography and flow patterns and changes in the intensity of splash arising from varying ponding depths may all affect surface water partitioning torri et al 1999 changes in drop diameters and drop arrival rates may also be influential foley and silburn 2002 the present study consequently instead adopts a surface response approach to the investigation of overland flow this uses the observed difference between applied rainfall depth and measured runoff depth during short intra event time periods to evaluate infiltration capacity and infiltration rate changes and hence to seek an understanding of overland flow production the advantage of this approach over the soil physics scheme just outlined is that it incorporates all of the processes active at the field site that affect overland flow production including soil surface erosion and deposition crusting air entrapment and flow routing the particular research questions addressed using rainfall simulation in the present study are as follows it is emphasised that the experimental findings relate to crusted dryland soils typical of ecologically important runoff source areas dunkerley and brown 1995 but target mechanisms that are likely to have much wider importance 1 during intermittent rainfall how do the metrics of rainfall intermittency such as the durations of rain and rainless intervals and the relative durations of rain and no rain intervals here termed the rainfall duty cycle affect infiltration and runoff depths 2 how does intermittency affect the time to runoff at plot scale 3 how does intermittency affect runoff ratios and peak runoff rates 4 can the time varying infiltrability f of soils exposed to intermittent rainfall including the recovery of f during hiatuses in rainfall and all soil surface and flow routing effects be estimated from plot scale rainfall and runoff data 2 surface responses to intermittent rainfall brief review of prior studies field studies have shown that there can be complex time varying relationships between key soil properties and the nature of incident rainfall darboux et al 2001 knapen et al 2008 most of these are not yet amenable to theoretical analysis but depend on experimental studies of infiltration and runoff in relation to measured soil properties soils prone to crust development for instance are known to exhibit infiltrability that is a function of the moisture content when rain begins le bissonnais and singer 1991 and hence on the drying time between showers levy et al 1984 soil texture also influences the time varying infiltrability hardy et al 1983 and the nature of seals and their effects on infiltration can vary spatially thus low points inundated by short duration or low intensity rain may exhibit reduced infiltrability owing to the development of depositional seals whilst higher points inundated in long duration or high intensity rain may show larger infiltrability torri et al 1999 this has been proposed as one explanation for the dependency of infiltration rate on rainfall intensity at least in field experiments using constant intensity simulated rain dunne et al 1991 influences such as these related to microtopography and to rainfall intensity are not included in the soil physics approach to understanding infiltration torri et al 1999 stressed that models of slope response to rainfall that do not incorporate time varying changes in the soil surface and near surface may well prove to be unsatisfactory several key findings have emerged from the small number of experimental studies that have explicitly examined the effects of intermittent rainfall overland flow may be generated by rain of relatively low intensity if the soil has been wetted up by prior rainfall and showers that primarily wet up soil after a prolonged dry period may result in no overland flow even if they are more intense than the later showers that do result in runoff yair 1983 lange et al 2003 thus the production of overland flow is dependent on the sequence and properties of antecedent rainfalls and cannot adequately be predicted without taking their effects into account moreover infiltrability is known to recover during rainless periods between showers but to decline more rapidly and to a lower value in subsequent rainfalls that follow sufficiently closely in time this effect has been shown for successive rainfalls separated by periods ranging from a week fohrer et al 1999 to 10 min nicolas et al 2007 a limitation of the works mentioned here including the theoretical approaches mentioned earlier is that with the exception of the work of nicolas et al 2007 they concern the effects of successive rainfalls over several days and with rainfalls 1 7 days apart and provide less guidance on the effects of intermittency at intra event timescales from tens of minutes to one or perhaps a few hours or in multiple rainfalls during a single day this forms the focus of the present study 3 field experimental methods the field experiments were conducted at a dryland site in arid western new south wales australia the climate of the field area is arid with an average annual rainfall of about 220 mm and no marked wet or dry seasons vegetation consists primarily of scattered small shrubs and grasses often organised into spatial mosaics that include substantial areas of bare crusted soils and areas of relatively dense vegetation dunkerley brown 1995 the bare zones intergroves act as runoff sources and overland flow moves downslope where infiltration of runon water takes place in vegetated patches groves that show higher soil infiltrability in many cases the soil surface in the runoff source areas is colonised by cyanobacteria and bryophytes eight bounded runoff plots of 0 5 0 5 m were set up along a single contour in a bare intergrove and within a few metres of each other on a slope of about 0 5 the soils within the plots were visually indistinguishable the soil surfaces were essentially planar but carried scattered loose surface quartz granules and a few small pebbles as well as a cyanobacterial crust and occasional plant debris fig 1 plot walls were 10 cm in height and set carefully into the soil surface the corner joins being sealed with a silicone caulking compound the plot surface was open at the downslope end and drained freely into a steel collecting gutter that was set about 2 mm below the elevation of the plot surface in order to allow unrestricted drainage of overland flow the experimental design included the application of simulated rain either continuously at 10 mm h or intermittently with intervals of rainfall at 10 mm h separated by rainless intervals during which operation of a peristaltic pump feeding the rainfall simulator was halted under the control of a computer program see below the objective was to explore the effects of intermittency with no change in the conditional rainfall rate the intensity when actually raining this design was regarded as the only feasible way to explore the effects of intermittency without the confounding effects of varying intensity a consequence of this design is that the mean intensity during intermittent events was lower than the intensity during experiments run under a constant 10 mm h however the focus of this study is intermittency not the effects of different mean intensities or of intensity variation during an event which were addressed by dunkerley 2012 in experiments at a location close to that used for the present experiments the simulated rainfall was generated by a drop forming system consisting of a hermetically sealed chamber equipped with a grid of drop formers and linked to a peristaltic pump whose flow rate was varied at 1 s intervals under the control of a laptop computer on which were stored various design rainfall events having varying intermittency the drop forming module was suspended 2 m above the plot and the whole apparatus was enclosed by a heavy canvas screen to minimise the effects of wind on drop trajectories and on evaporation from the wet soil surface continuous rather than intermittent rainfall was also applied in one series of experiments in order to differentiate the infiltration and runoff behaviour under constant versus intermittent rain all rainfall both constant and intermittent was delivered at 10 mm h which is a typical intensity for rainfall events in the field area dunkerley 2013 most experiments were of 60 min duration though some were extended to 90 120 min as required for runoff to be initiated full details of the field apparatus are contained in dunkerley 2012 and dunkerley 2017 some experiments used square wave on off intermittent rainfall that is with the rain on time the same as the rain off time with rain applied and halted in alternation every 3 6 or 12 min these are referred to as the square wave experiments some of these experiments took more than 1 h to result in runoff in other experiments all of 60 min duration the rain and intervening hiatuses were of varying durations from 10 min to 25 min volumes of rainfall applied to the plots and runoff collected were recorded by weighing both the 1 5 l water supply container and the 500 ml collecting vessel which caught the runoff arriving at the plot outlet to the nearest 1 g every 2 min subsequently apparent event infiltration rates f mm h through the course of the experiments were calculated from 3 f p r t in which p is the event rainfall depth mm r is the event runoff depth mm and t is the event duration h three groups of experiments were conducted the first group constant intensity experiments used rain at a fixed intensity of 10 mm h multiple separate unused plots were used for these experiments all in a dry antecedent condition following some weeks without rainfall the second group of experiments the square wave experiments used rain on off cycles every 3 6 and 12 min for 1 h a single separate unused dry plot was used once only for each of these three experiments three plots in all in all cases the duration of each rain pulse was exactly equal to the duration of the following rainless period with the pattern simply repeated until an hour had elapsed the third group of experiments employed varying durations for both the rain and rainless periods in the range 10 25 min in four different temporal patterns and with the experiment duration in all cases being 1 h experiments in this third group were again each carried out on a different adjacent plot plots 1 4 and all of the plots were all initially dry following some weeks without rain each experiment was then repeated after 7 h of drying time during hot and sunny weather in each case on the same plot 1 2 3 or 4 as used for the initial dry experiment these replicates were designed to see whether and if so how the effects of intermittency varied under dry and damp soil conditions the same plots were re used in the damp condition so that the only factor that varied between the dry antecedent and the damp antecedent experiments was the moisture content of the soil within the plot each individual plot was presumed to have a slightly different pattern of surface stones or soil cracking or other features that might affect the infiltration behaviour and therefore the repeat experiments were always carried out on the same plot after the drying time already mentioned details of all three groups of experiments are set out in tables 1 3 the observed overland flow hydrographs collected at the plot outlets were interpreted using a series of horton infiltration equations as described by dunkerley 2017 a spreadsheet was used to allow the adjustment of the horton equation parameters in order to achieve the best correspondence of predicted runoff rates and observed runoff rates the key parameter adjusted was the initial infiltrability f 0 which was allowed to recover during hiatuses in rainfall and the exponential decay coefficient kf which as noted above may also change during hiatuses such that more rapid decline in infiltrability is seen in later rainfall pulses however in contrast no adjustment to the final infiltrability f c was required as a result of hiatuses since this is essentially a property of the saturated soil consequently a group of what have been termed affine horton equations dunkerley2017 that share a common value of f c were defined a major advantage of this approach as outlined by dunkerley 2017 is that it allows the rate of recovery of f 0 to be estimated from plot runoff data in turn this allows the production of overland flow in both timing and volume to be better predicted than when the only data available are f c especially since in short or very intermittent events f c may never be expressed by the constantly draining soils moreover the use of a notional single value of the initial infiltrability f 0 fails to account for the fact that in successive bursts of rainfall a different value of f 0 has to be fitted to allow for the subsoil redistribution of moisture during the intervening hiatus 3 1 comparison of simulated rainfall events with natural events in the field area given the focus of the present work it is important to consider the intermittency characteristics of natural rainfall in the field area in relation to the simulated rainfall events the natural rainfall was analysed by dunkerley 2015 using a continuous record of more than 10 years tipping bucket data at 0 5 mm resolution delineating events using the minimum inter event time mit criterion and adopting a rainfall rate of 0 5 mm h to define an hiatus he showed that the proportion of rainfall events that were classified as intermittent that is containing at least one not raining period of at least an hour lay in the range 59 75 depending on the mit value adopted moreover for all values of mit examined an average of at least 60 of the total event duration was classed as not raining i e intensity 0 5 mm h and frequently this was comprised of multiple not raining periods of varying duration event mean rainfall rates including the intra event rainless periods were about 5 mm h this is reproduced in the present rainfall simulation experiments by applying rainfall at 10 mm h in events with typically 50 intermittency dunkerley 2017 presented additional detail of the rainfall regime at the field site 4 results 4 1 constant intensity experiments the replicate experiments using rain of fixed 10 mm h intensity all yielded runoff within the first 30 min the mean time to runoff across 11 replicate runs on initially dry soil was 21 4 min and in 4 cases runoff began within 15 min table 1 once initiated runoff was continuous and tended to approach a stable value in the last 10 15 min of each experiment generally at 2 4 mm h average 3 7 mm h two representative hydrographs are presented in fig 2 the final or steady state infiltrability f c was estimated from the last 10 min of data for each experiment table 2 and averaged 6 3 mm h this agrees with prior estimates for these crusted soils derived from both ponded cylinder infiltrometers and small plot rainfall simulation in the same field area dunkerley 2000 of 5 10 mm h overall event infiltration rates in the 11 replicate experiments f averaged 7 6 mm h 4 2 intermittent rainfall experiments there were two sets of experiments rapid square wave tests of 90 min duration 50 rainfall duty cycle and variable duty cycle experiments of 60 min duration as explained above the former were all conducted on dry soil the latter experiments were carried out first on dry soil and repeated 7 h later on the same set of runoff plots to represent damp antecedent conditions the objective of this was to assess the extent to which antecedent soil wetness affected infiltration behaviour and the timing of any periods of runoff under intermittent rain 4 2 1 the square wave experiments 3 6 and 12 min on off cycles on initially dry soil the rapidly pulsed rainfall 3 6 and 12 min square wave experiments each lasting 90 min all yielded continuous runoff at low rates although the onset of runoff required 50 65 min considerably longer than the time lag seen under continuous rainfall table 2 given that rainfall was applied for 50 of the time and the intensity always exceeded f c there is clearly an effect of intermittency on time to runoff that is additional to the halving of the mean rainfall rate this nonlinear response is evident because time to runoff increased by about 300 whereas mean rainfall intensity only declined by 50 in the intermittent rain because of the slow onset of runoff the experiments were extended from 60 min to 90 min runoff rates which rose steadily following the onset of runoff peaked at or close to the end of the experiments at rates of 1 5 mm h 2 3 mm h and 0 85 mm h for the three experiments these rates are generally lower than those reached after only 60 min of continuous rainfall despite the longer experiment duration the apparent event infiltration rates derived from the plot data on rainfall event input and runoff output are informative during the experiments 80 90 of the applied rainfall infiltrated the apparent event infiltration rates estimated using eq 1 above for the 3 6 and 12 min square wave experiments were 4 2 mm h 4 5 mm h and 4 9 mm h moreover the apparent infiltration rate f increased as a power function of the intermittency cycle time according to 4 f 3 62 λ 0 12 where λ is the rain on or off time min with r2 0 999 fig 3 in a related way the event runoff ratio φ declined with increasing intermittency cycle time according to 5 ϕ 2 91 λ 0 01 where λ is the rain on or off time min with r2 0 999 fig 3 to the writer s knowledge this dependency of f and φ on the timing of intermittency has not been reported previously it is important to recall that these are square wave 50 duty cycle experiments that were not intended to mimic natural rainfall but rather to explore some aspects of soil responses to intermittent rainfall 4 2 2 the 60 min variable duty cycle experiments these experiments used rainfall sequences with varying numbers of hiatuses in rainfall and varying durations of rain and rainless periods variable duty cycle to form four different patterns of intermittency the longest hiatus was 25 min and the shortest was 10 min tables 3 and 4 in two of the experiments on initially dry soil no runoff was generated even after 60 min table 4 these two events both included the largest fraction of rainless time a total of 30 min without rain divided into two hiatuses on the tested soils therefore a rainfall event that includes bursts of 10 20 min duration even at intensities exceeding the steady state infiltrability of the soils may not necessarily yield any runoff this conclusion could also be deduced from the continuous rainfall experiments where the average time required for the onset of runoff was 21 4 min table 1 interestingly the average time to runoff in the 60 min experiments was very similar 21 3 min table 4 but was as long as 34 min in one experiment this is readily accounted for by the fact that every experiment began with a period of rainfall with intermittency only activated after 10 20 min in the other six 1 h experiments runoff was generated including from an event with a 20 min rainfall hiatus peak runoff rate was 6 25 mm h notably higher than the rates seen in the 3 6 and 12 min square wave experiments presented above where the conditional intensity of the rainfall was the same but with marked intermittency in the 60 min variable intermittency experiments infiltration and runoff behaviour were similar to what was observed in the 90 min 3 6 and 12 min square wave experiments table 3 fig 2 runoff rates rose steadily after an initial lag time runoff ratios were only moderate averaging 15 8 table 4 in intermittency pattern 1 for instance the 1 h rainfall event was comprised of two 20 min periods of rain separated by a 20 min rainless period on initially dry soil runoff began after 10 min of rain in the first period and renewed runoff began after 6 min in the second period following the 20 min hiatus fig 4 during the second episode of runoff the runoff rate rose more rapidly than during the first runoff episode and reached a rate of 4 mm h at the end of the experiment analysing the infiltration rates separately for the two periods of rainfall the values are 9 0 mm h and 7 5 mm h however using lumped event rainfall and runoff depths the apparent infiltration rate f for the whole 60 min event is 5 6 mm h this is a little larger than the 5 3 mm h estimated from the 12 min square wave experiments this would be expected because although the longer 20 min periods of rain allow the infiltrability to decline more than is possible in shorter periods of rain in the way described by the horton infiltration equation or other similar approaches the longer period of continuous rainfall offers fewer hiatuses for the partial recovery of infiltrability that were present in the 3 6 and 12 min square wave tests the results presented in table 4 and fig 3 show that intermittency pattern 4 which had the longest rainfall hiatus 25 min yielded the lowest peak runoff rate 3 8 mm h and the lowest runoff ratio 7 9 this intermittency pattern yielded no runoff on initially dry soil in contrast intermittency pattern 2 on damp soil with only 10 min hiatuses yielded the highest peak runoff rate 6 3 mm h and the largest runoff ratio 22 9 clearly therefore the timing and sequence of intermittency affect key hydrologic response parameters the behaviour of infiltration and runoff in the other intermittency patterns is set out in table 4 and fig 4 4 3 estimating infiltrability changes from intermittent rainfall the time varying infiltrability of the plot surfaces was estimated as described by dunkerley 2017 by fitting a series of horton infiltration equations refer to eq 2 above coefficients were adjusted manually in a spreadsheet whilst observing superimposed graphs of observed and predicted runoff the procedure could be automated if need be with fitting tolerance criteria established before the optimisation this procedure involves moderate but understandable errors in runoff timing in which the calculated runoff typically begins about 4 min before the observed runoff this is reasoned to reflect the slowing of runoff release from the plot by surface tension effects at edge of the runoff collecting sill during drainage laterally along the collecting gutter and finally during release from the exit pipe at the latter point especially during the slow onset of runoff water was observed to build up until there was sufficient to break the surface tension and release a pulse of flow from these causes a delay in recording runoff of a few minutes can readily be accounted for likewise the simple horton runoff calculation neglects the steering of runoff by the plot microtopography and the delay involved when ponding has to develop and subsequently overtop a low barrier before downslope flow can occur by deepening the flow being routed along subtle preferred flow pathways the microtopography may be able to result in higher flow speeds and higher runoff peaks during rainfall intensity bursts consequently some error in accounting for peak runoff rates in both timing and magnitude is to be expected flow paths across the plots and the collecting gutter configuration can be seen in fig 1 nevertheless the affine horton equations table 5 predicted runoff volumes across the 6 1 h variable duty cycle experiments where runoff was recorded with an rms error of just 4 4 the largest over estimate of runoff volume was 6 6 and largest under estimate of runoff volume was 4 9 for 3 6 and 12 min square wave rainfall a single fitted horton equation predicted runoff timing and volume satisfactorily however for some of the 60 min experiments where periods of rain and no rain lasted 15 or 20 min multiple affine horton equations resulted in better predictions of the multiple occurrences of overland flow during the event as well as providing reasonable estimates of peak runoff rates and runoff depths table 6 5 discussion the results presented above establish that intra event intermittency of rainfall modifies infiltration and runoff production at plot scales given that intermittency is a common feature of rainfall with its burst like character peters and christensen 2002 it may be that intermittency and its effects warrant increased consideration in research on landsurface hydrology at least at plot to hillslope scales the rapid square wave experiments are discussed first given that in these experiments the rain fell for 50 of the elapsed time and that there was little runoff infiltration rates were close to the mean rainfall rate through the whole 90 min averaging 4 2 4 9 mm h these apparent rates are much lower than the actual steady state infiltration rates reached in shorter periods of continuous rainfall such as the 60 min of continuous rainfall at 10 mm h discussed earlier which averaged 7 6 mm h on the other hand infiltration rates corrected for the 50 of event duration which was rainless that is found by multiplying the apparent rates by 2 0 8 4 mm h 9 0 mm h and 9 8 mm h appear to be too high in comparison with the known steady state values for these soils these results reveal that intermittency affects the apparent infiltration rate f this is further explored shortly results of the 1 h variable intermittency experiments confirm that the observed event infiltration rate is influenced by the timing and sequence of rain and rainless periods the more rapid increase in runoff rate during second or subsequent bursts of rainfall suggest further that runoff generation is affected by the more rapid rate at which infiltrability declines once rainfall resumes on soil already partially wetted up by a prior period of rainfall this in turn presumably depends on the rate of subsoil water redistribution and the amount by which soil suction in near surface soils recovers during any preceding rainfall hiatus these effects have not been explored here and would require experiments to be conducted on a set of soils having contrasting textural properties taken together the present results have important implications they suggest that unanalysed intermittency in rainfall in studies for instance where only hourly or daily totals are recorded will hamper the correct interpretation and prediction of infiltrability and hence of the generation of overland flow the time to runoff of 50 65 min as just noted from the square wave experiments shows that during early bursts of rainfall the infiltration rate was equal to the rainfall intensity of 10 mm h and the infiltrability the potential rate of water uptake may have been considerably higher than this employing apparent infiltration rates would yield significant over prediction of runoff depths if applied to storm event data involving rainfall of lower intermittency the apparent infiltration rates are too low and do not directly reflect the actual infiltrability of the soils because the rainfall was intermittent on the other hand using the corrected infiltration rates would underestimate runoff in prolonged rainfall because these estimates exceed the known steady state infiltrability of these soils analysis of event rainfall and runoff depths without knowledge of the effects of intermittency may thus yield misleading estimates of infiltration rates in light of the square wave experiment results much depends on the length of the rain and intervening no rain periods without a knowledge of which the plot hydrology cannot be correctly interpreted a simple hypothetical example may illustrate this more clearly if during an hour rainfall totalling 10 mm and runoff of 2 mm were recorded from an experimental plot the apparent infiltration rate would be 8 mm h however if it is not detected that the hour of rainfall in fact contained 40 min of rainless time followed by 20 min of rain at 30 mm h required to yield the total of 10 mm for the entire hour it would not be possible to reason that the actual infiltrability expressed during those 20 min of rainfall must in fact have been 28 mm h the kind of error that might be made in data reduction evidently depends on the patterns and magnitudes of the intermittency actually present in the local rainfall regime of a study site the conclusion remains clear that if intermittency is not monitored and allowed for in calculating infiltration rates then erroneous estimates will result the full explanation for the results presented here will require additional experimentation during the early stages of rainfall soil suction forces dominate the entry of water into the soil and high suction gradients exist in the near subsurface philip 1957 1959 as the wetting front moves more deeply into the soil the suction gradient declines reducing the soil infiltrability according to the fitted horton equations in the soils tested the infiltrability of initially dry soils was 90 mm h such that initially no runoff was generated from the applied rainfall at 10 mm h if there was a sufficiently long hiatus in rainfall before the infiltrability had declined to 10 mm h no runoff resulted the fitting of affine horton equations showed that if an hiatus in rainfall was sufficiently long the soil infiltrability recovered during the hiatus so as to alter the soil response to a following period of rain if an hiatus is sufficiently long it increases the time lag before the onset of runoff when rain resumes intermittency on short timescales of less than about 10 15 min resulted in this effect occurring repeatedly through multiple successive cycles of rain and no rain such that time to first runoff lengthened to 1 h in some cases when intermittency was present on longer timescales of 15 25 min runoff was produced in each period of rain and there was little effect on time to first runoff the theoretical soil physics approaches to infiltration redistribution and reinfiltration have shown that this kind of behaviour could be expected during hiatuses in rainfall thus smith et al 1993 showed that following an hiatus infiltration rate was higher than would be estimated had the redistribution during the hiatus been neglected during an hiatus redistribution is reasoned to result in an increased depth of the wetting front and a corresponding decline in soil water content through the zone lying between the soil surface and the wetting front the actual form of the water content profile has been variously approximated as a rectangle a segment of an ellipse etc corradini et al 1997 to the best of the writer s knowledge the present results are the first to explore experimentally the effects of various forms of rainfall intermittency on overland flow that include the potential effects of spatially varying wetting depths and overland flow runoff paths as well as soil surface redistribution by splash and or flow the results confirm by direct observation that both intensity fluctuations and intermittency down to hiatus durations of as little as 15 20 min that is on intra event timescales modify both infiltration and overland flow behaviour among the limitations to the present work are the effects of experiment scale effects at the plot dimensions employed here almost certainly do not scale to hillslope dimensions for instance however the present findings could readily be incorporated into hillslope runoff models including cellular models ma et al 2009 in order to explore how the spatial scaling effects might behave the present results confirm that in addition to simple metrics such as the length of hiatuses the internal timing or sequence of rain and no rain periods within an event is significant for the production of overland flow welderufael et al 2009 employed the morin and cluff 1980 runoff model and found that runoff prediction was most successful for early peak rainfall events in which the intensity significantly exceeded the soil infiltrability the first quartile events of huff 1967 in which most rain accumulates in the first 25 of the storm duration with much less success found for rainfall events in which intensity remained close to the soil infiltrability likewise in the same field area as the present work dunkerley 2015 showed how infiltration and runoff rates varied with the position of intensity bursts in simulated rainfall events having the same depth duration and average intensity but no hiatuses he demonstrated that overland flow behaviour timing peak flow rates etc varied greatly depending on whether rainfall exhibited the highest intensity early or late during a shower it is hypothesised here that results of this kind are not completely explicable in terms of infiltration behaviour but involve also the evolution of drainage across the soil surface thus in events with early intensity peaks overland flow paths may be established early in the rainfall event and preferential soil wetting along these flow paths might facilitate enhanced runoff delivery in later possibly smaller intensity peaks these are aspects of the generation of overland flow that have not been investigated and that warrant further study other mechanisms may also contribute to the observed effects of rainfall intermittency on infiltration and runoff behaviour it is hypothesised that the effects of sorptivity philip 1957 which underlie the early phase of high soil infiltrability seen following the onset of rainfall may provide an explanation during the period when imbibition occurs under high suction gradients infiltrability the diffusive movement of water through the soil pore spaces is high and the water uptake reduces the potential runoff ratio for a rainfall event watanabe et al 2012 showed that antecedent volumetric soil moisture θ causes variations in sorptivity s similarly stewart et al 2013 established the dependence of sorptivity on soil wetness such that as saturation declines as might occur during a rainfall hiatus owing to subsurface redistribution and perhaps some evaporation sorptivity increases these findings suggest that following an hiatus in rainfall infiltration might be partly driven by the regeneration of sorptivity and that the repeated occurrence of such episodes of sorptivity renewal under intermittent rainfall could in part account for the need for a series of affine horton infiltration equations it is reasoned that the rate at which sorptivity is regenerated will be dependent on the particular hydraulic properties of the tested soils as well perhaps as the intensity of the rainfall striking the soil surface prior to and following an hiatus and that varying rates would emerge from tests on different soil materials and rainfall patterns in continuous rainfall as commonly used in rainfall simulation experiments sorptivity is usually only an influence on infiltration in the first few minutes of rainfall smettem and clothier 1989 consequently such experiments shed no light on the behaviour of sorptivity in intermittent rainfall additional experiments on different soil materials and eventually under natural rainfall using suitable measures of intermittency will be needed to explore further the effects of intermittency on infiltration and overland flow behaviour a further benefit may flow from a focus on the role of sorptivity especially during intermittent rain a reliance on f c the final steady state infiltrabilty reached after prolonged rainfall may yield little information on the key role of the near surface soil conditions that alter the value of s in the first minutes of rainfall or the first few minutes of each burst of rainfall as is suggested here consequently f c may prove to be of limited value in exploring the effects of landuse such as trampling in grazing landscapes and of litter and plant cover on infiltration and overland flow gifford and hawkins 1978 where rainfall exhibits significant intermittency 6 conclusions there are very few experimental studies addressing intra event intermittency and its effects on infiltration and runoff and it is hoped that the present results draw attention to some of the phenomena that result for the soils and rainfall intensities used in the experiments reported here the key findings in relation to the four research questions posed earlier are as follows 1 intermittency on short timescales 3 min 12 min does not significantly affect time to first runoff runoff is generated continuously once it is initiated and short hiatuses in rainfall after the start of runoff do not result in breaks of runoff nevertheless using the 3 6 and 12 min square wave rainfall simulation experiments apparent infiltration rate equation 1 rises as a power function of the intermittency period and runoff ratio correspondingly declines with increasing intermittency period apparent event infiltration rates are lower than the known final infiltration rates for these soils under prolonged rainfall it is hypothesised that progressively longer square wave intermittency cycles allow deeper penetration of the wetting front and more redistribution time when rain ceases such that the near surface soils maintain a higher infiltrability than when intermittency is present over shorter periods these processes mean that the apparent infiltration rate cannot simply be corrected for the effects of intermittency by making allowance for the aggregate fraction of event time that is rainless because the effect evidently depends on the duration and sequencing of hiatuses in rainfall 2 intermittency that involves longer hiatuses in rainfall of 10 25 min with a subsequent resumption of rainfall have greater effects on infiltration and overland flow behaviour in particular in the presence of intermittency on these timescales the time to first runoff can increase substantially and the peak runoff rates achieved in later bursts of rainfall are reduced in comparison with rain of the same but fixed intensity or indeed in comparison with the effects of intermittency on shorter timescales hiatuses in rainfall can result in the complete cessation of runoff time to runoff can be much shorter in response to second third or subsequent periods of rainfall than from the first rainfall as with the short time period intermittency apparent infiltration rates are lower than the known final infiltrability of the tested soils and cannot readily be corrected by making a simple numerical allowance for the intermittency 3 under intermittent rainfall apparent infiltration rates are reduced by 30 45 in comparison with those from experiments under constant rainfall intensity 5 27 mm h versus a mean of 7 6 mm h under constant intensity rain and runoff ratios are reduced an average of 9 4 runoff versus a mean of 23 4 under constant intensity rain to obtain reliable estimates of soil infiltrability intermittency has to be recorded and allowance made for its effect on apparent infiltration rates the use of hourly rainfall totals for instance when the rain exhibits intermittency would result in erroneous estimates of infiltrability 4 for intermittency on the longer hiatus timescales explored here 10 25 min the horton infiltration parameters can successfully be estimated by using a series of affine equations allowing for the partial recovery of infiltrability during rainfall hiatuses this indeed allows the successful prediction of the timing and fluxes of overland flow this approach has the major advantage that it incorporates a range of possible effects arising at the soil surface including erosion deposition ponding and flow routing additional experimental work will be needed to further clarify the mechanisms in terms of altered capillary drive or near surface sorptivity that underlie the present findings and to extend similar experiments to other soil types to the kinds of rainfall event profiles exhibited by non dryland rainfall

7546,in this study we propose a soft computing methodology to visibly explore the spatio temporal groundwater variations of the kuoping river basin in southern taiwan the self organizing map som is implemented to investigate the interactive mechanism between surface water and groundwater over the river basin based on large high dimensional data sets coupled with their occurrence times we find that extracting the occurrence time from each 30 day moving average data set in the clustered neurons of the som is a crucial step to learn the spatio temporal interaction between surface water and groundwater we design 2 d topological bubble map to summarize all the groundwater values of four aquifers in a neuron which can visibly explore the major features of the groundwater in the vertical direction the constructed som topological maps nicely display that 1 the groundwater movement in general extends from the eastern area to the western where groundwater in the eastern area can be easily recharged from precipitation in wet seasons and discharged into streams during dry seasons due to the high permeability in this area 2 the water movements in the four aquifers of the study area are quite different and the seasonal variations of groundwater in the second and third aquifers are larger than those of the others and 3 the spatial distribution and seasonal variations of groundwater and surface water are comprehensively linked together over the constructed maps to present groundwater characteristics and the interrelation between groundwater and surface water the proposed modeling methodology not only can classify the large complex high dimensional data sets into visible topological maps to effectively facilitate the quantitative status of regional groundwater resources but can also provide useful elaboration for future groundwater management keywords self organizing map som regional groundwater visually display spatio temporal distribution soft computing

regional groundwater variations with surface water through the state of the art techniques with very uneven rainfall high mountains and steep sloped rives all over the taiwan island constrain the storage and use of water resources consequently groundwater resources become vital especially during long drought periods in response to the industrial development and population aggregation in the last half century groundwater resources have been over drawn which has caused severe subsidence and the depletion of groundwater storage space in many parts of the island chen et al 2007 hung et al 2012 wada et al 2012 effective groundwater resources management is a crucial task the subsidence and large variations of groundwater levels over the decades suggest a precise and detailed study is required for elucidating the behavior of groundwater fluctuations in both spatial and temporal scales the purpose of this study was thus to comprehensively investigate and model regional groundwater variations for sustainable management of groundwater resources the variation of groundwater in the whole basin was analyzed by using a clustering method to identify the spatio temporal characteristics of groundwater levels we proposed a soft computing technique that can visibly describe and foresee the complex dynamic regional groundwater variations at high spatial and temporal resolutions the paper is organized into five sections the first section introduces the general background and ideas used in this study the second section describes the study area and datasets used in modeling processes the third section describes the methodology and focuses on how the ann models can be implemented to model regional groundwater levels the fourth section presents the results of scenario calculations relevant to regional water resources management the final section summarizes the results and gives conclusions regarding the coupled surface water groundwater systems in semiarid regions 2 study area and dataset the kuoping river basin is the largest drainage basin 3257 km2 in taiwan and the river meanders 171 km through a highly rugged terrain in the central mountain range towards the southern part of taiwan strait where the pingtung plain is situated with rich groundwater resources fig 1 the mean annual rainfall of this basin is close to 3000 mm while over 90 of which appears in the wet season during may and october which is influenced by typhoons and monsoons the amount of the wet season flow would increase approximately 10 times than that of the dry season flow the extremely uneven distribution of rainfall and stream flows over seasons has resulted in a severe issue of water resources management the basin is primarily planned for agricultural productions and stock farms while the latest development of fish farms and industrial complexes requires more water due to the tremendous water demands that continue growing inevitably the over exploitation of groundwater by different sectors has caused a severe drop of groundwater levels and subsidence and thus has imposed great pressure on the environment to better learn the status and effectively manage the vital groundwater resources in the study basin we collected the basin wide daily hydrological monitoring data sets during 1999 and 2015 to perform the data mining analysis and model construction 126 time series of groundwater levels and three time series of river flow were obtained from the water resources agency wra taiwan thirteen time series of precipitation were obtained from the central weather bureau taiwan fig 1 shows the locations of the study area and monitoring stations and fig 2 shows the geological characteristics of the basin where four thick aquifers can be found in various areas 3 methodology in this study we explore the spatio temporal dynamics of groundwater systems through the soft computing techniques that can visibly describe and foresee the complex dynamic regional groundwater variations the large high dimensional data sets coupled with their occurrence times are analyzed and the proposed methodology is presented as follows 3 1 data preprocessing in order to eliminate the elevation effects of different observational groundwater wells we adopted the relative groundwater level rgl i e the groundwater water level was subtracted by the minimum value of historical observed groundwater levels as shown in eq 1 in this study 1 wl i relative wl i original wl i min where i represents the ith well wl i relative represents the relative groundwater level wl i original represents the original groundwater level and wl i min represents the minimum value of the original historical groundwater levels the moving average method is commonly used with time series data to smooth out short term fluctuations and highlight longer term trends and or cycles and the produced data sets are logically coherent in the time domain we used 30 day moving average to analyze data points by creating a series ofdata each of which was averaged over a subset 30 daily data of the original rgl data set ranging between 1999 01 01 and 2015 12 2 the 30 day moving average of rgls was calculated where a total of 6180 data sets were obtained and each data set included the rgls of 126 wells table 1 summarizes the groundwater precipitation and flow records in the last sixteen years 1999 2015 used in this study 3 2 som overview the self organizing map som proposed by kohonen 1982 is a powerful method used to explore the interrelationships of high dimensional multivariate systems and it is effective for clustering and forecasting in a wide spread range of disciplines a key benefit of the som is its ability to extract implicit patterns from high dimensional input data sets and classify the obtained patterns into a low dimensional output layer where similar inputs remain close together in the output neurons while preserving data structure the neurons in the output layer are commonly arranged in two dimensional grids so that the constructed topology can be visualized to give an insight into the system under investigation the som has gained increasing interest and been successfully applied to water resources management a number of promising researches related to the modeling of groundwater processes are briefly reviewed as follows for instance hassan et al 2014 modeled the structural and hydrological complexity of hard rock systems affecting the dynamics of surface groundwater interactions krause et al 2007 indicated that the interactions of the investigative system could be characterized by temporal and spatial variability tremblay et al 2011 found drastically different patterns of variability evolution for the records in three canadian regions and jan et al 2007 indicated the effective accumulated rainfall amount highly correlated to the difference between groundwater levels at each moment recently the som has been satisfactorily applied to regionalization studies e g agarwal et al 2016 chang et al 2016 and watershed classification e g ley et al 2011 razavi and coulibaly 2017 3 3 configure the som this study configured an som to cluster a large number of high dimensional regional rgls into a visible 2 dimensional topology of regional rgl maps the map size of the som must be determined at first even though we did have a large number of data sets which however were logically coherent in the time domain due to the 30 day moving average procedure conducted to synthesize the time series data sets consequently we only tried a few map sizes i e 3 3 4 4 and 5 5 the constructed topological maps coupled with related key features averaged rgl and weights of aquifer b were shown in fig 3 the results indicated that 1 the small network i e 3 3 could not fully present the regional rgl classification while there were many similar clusters in the large network 5 5 and 2 the 4 4 network was considered the most suitable for presenting the topology of regional rgl classification the 126 rgls were distributed in four heterogeneous aquifers and the groundwater monitoring wells were discontinuous with respect to vertical aquifers the three dimensional problem could not be well presented in a 2 dimensional som map consequently we made a 2 dimensional som map for each aquifer to better display the variation of rgls in each aquifer the ordinary kriging method was used to connect rgls within an aquifer to form a 2 dimensional som map for presenting the spatial distribution of rgls in the aquifer the kriging is an interpolation method that gives the best unbiased linear estimation of the intermediate values and is widely used in the domain of spatial analysis e g tapoglou et al 2014 parajka et al 2015 piazza et al 2015 we intended to classify and quantify the large complex high dimensional data sets based on soft computing techniques som topological maps and make a comprehensive analysis of groundwater variations in four aquifers to learn and present their spatio temporal features the comprehensive analytical framework is shown in fig 4 which can be divided into four major schemes presented as follows scheme 1 som configuration a 4 4 som network was configured based on large data sets i e 6180 where each data included 126 rgls fig 5 because the wells were distributed in four aquifers the configured som would be thus displayed in four topological maps for the corresponding aquifers respectively scheme 2 seasonal identification as the som was configured we could identify the temporal information of the clustered data sets in each neuron in a seasonal scale for allocating these data into four seasons scheme 3 spatio temporal analysis the rgl topological maps in four aquifers could be obtained the kriging method was applied to drawing the rgl distribution of the neurons thus the rgls of four aquifers could thus be fully visualized to easily tell the differences and interrelation we designed a 2 d topological bubble map to merge all the averaged rgl values of four aquifers in a neuron so that the vertical relations could be quantified into the topological bubble map the whole multi dimensional data sets could then be summarized and therefore we could visibly explore the major features of the rgls in the vertical direction scheme 4 surface water and groundwater relationships to assess the possible relations between surface water and groundwater we computed the average rainfall and flow amounts in a neuron which represented the surface water information in a specific time interval of the corresponding neuron and put all the information surface water and rgls in four aquifers together so that we could easily examine the possible relationship inside the topological features maps 4 results and discussion as mentioned above the 30 day moving average procedure was used to synthesize the analyzed data and a total of 6180 data sets where each data set included 126 rgls were obtained and used for constructing the som to excavate the temporal spatial features inside the som the time and average rgl in each neuron were analyzed we discovered a topological feature shift before after 2005 through the decomposition of the som data structure and the similarities of datasets could be organized by year and by season fig 6 a indicates the occurrence time of the clustered data sets in each neuron years 1999 2015 season coloring spring green summer red fall pink winter blue the darker color meant more data sets were included in a dot and fig 6 b shows the seasonal changes moves between neurons we noticed that the data collected before after 2005 could be easily separated the dotted line in each neuron in fig 6 a the red line in b and such phenomenon might be due to the regulations on groundwater conservation implemented by the government in 2002 and a great number of farm s pumping well were shut down in the following years the seasonality of each neuron could also be easily identified because the occurrence times of the data in each group fell within the same season fig 6 b as we assessed in more details we found that the neurons well presented a seasonal loop i e neurons before 2005 formed another cycle where the seasonal direction of the group again started from summer to fall 1 2 3 then moved to winter 5 6 and finally ended in spring 9 13 neurons after 2005 formed a cycle where the seasonal direction of the group started from summer toward fall 16 12 8 4 then moved to winter 7 11 and eventually returned to summer 15 16 by passing through spring 14 the seasonal cycles in the map indicated the neighborhood features of the topology and provided extra evidence of the sustained persistent phenomenon in groundwater levels we also calculated the average value of the rgls in each neuron of the constructed som for each aquifer and the clustering statistics including the number of data rainfall stream flow and the average rgl in each neuron of the som are summarized in table 2 the regional rgl distribution was drawn by the kriging spatial interpolation method fig 7 displays the horizontal topological classification of the regional rgls in four aquifers a d they could be visualized and explored where the rgl value increased from the lower left corner neuron 13 to the upper right corner neuron 4 in the topological distribution it clearly indicated that the groundwater level gradually decreased from east to west over the entire area which re confirms the permeability of the eastern area is much greater than that of the western area fig 2 it was easy to tell the spatial variation in the neurons where the rgl gradually increased from west to east over the entire area i e light color in the western area and dark color in the eastern area as we integrated fig 6 with fig 7 we could catch the regional groundwater variation maps of all the four aquifers in different periods of time season we designed a 2 d topological bubble map to integrate all the information in the same neuron cluster together to elaborate the link between climate surface waters and groundwater in four aquifers the inter relational features of groundwater variations in four aquifers with rainfall and streamflow could be visibly found from the designed 2 d topological bubble map where the groundwater variations in the four aquifers were presented by 4 circles fig 8 a and the amounts of rainfall and streamflow were presented by one circle fig 8 b and c respectively for each clustered neuron a larger circle means a larger value of the corresponding variable fig 8 a shows the general features and trends of groundwater variations in different seasons as well as in various aquifers vertical analysis the higher the rgl is the bigger the circle bubble is aquifer b has the biggest bubble indicated that aquifer b received more recharge quantity than the other aquifers and tended to be more easily refilled as we investigated the distribution of the temporal topology after 2005 fig 6 a the water level was gradually brimmed to the top from summer to fall neurons 16 12 8 4 when winter came the water level slightly reduced neurons 4 7 11 the minimum water level occurred between winter and spring neurons 11 10 14 a sharp drawdown could be observed from the outer ring to the inner ring in aquifer b the water level in aquifer a dropped to the lowest value the water level gradually increased again until summer returned neurons 14 15 16 wherein the inner ring was displaced by the outer ring in aquifer b the results indicated that rainfall and flow was highly correlated and higher rainfall as well as flow occurred in summer and fall as presented in neurons 4 8 12 and 16 besides rainfall significantly decreased from fall to winter the groundwater levels in all layers only slightly reduced in fall which might be due to the recharge from upstream mountain area groundwater outflow and or river flow for replenishing underground aquifers the groundwater level in winter neurons 7 11 10 still maintained in an average level even though there was no much rainfall in this season we also noticed that river flow still occurred in winter which might mainly come from groundwater outflow even though rainfall would slightly increase as spring arrived the groundwater level fell from winter to the next spring and the water level in spring reached the lowest groundwater level minimum circle in a year based on the pattern analysis on the visualizing som maps the inter relationships of groundwater among various aquifers can be identified and the interactions between groundwater and surface water can also be sketched uncertainty due to obscured spatial characteristics of regional groundwater is a long standing challenge issue for effective groundwater management the som approach presented here utilizes the pattern classification capability of a neural network and its ability to learn from a large number of data sets the constructed feature maps not only can meaningfully present the spatio temporal characteristics of regional groundwater but also display its interaction with surface water this joint approach enables one to visibly quantify their uncertainty inside the som which provide regional features and useful information for sustainable management of groundwater resources there is however a large variability in groundwater residence time including groundwater flow paths that discharge groundwater into surface water consequently it is still difficult to quantify the groundwater recharge amount refilling aquifer storage and the groundwater discharge amount releasing back to surface water and becoming runoff based on the limited clusters ex 16 clusters obtained in this study a more sophisticate modeling technique with long term comprehensive monitoring data sets such as daily even hourly data including regional groundwater and rainfall data and a series of flow data along the river from upstream to downstream and hydrogeological features in the study area might be necessary to precisely identify and or estimate the discharge and recharge amounts of groundwater as mentioned early modeling complex groundwater systems to simulate the dynamics of surface water groundwater interactions and or assess the quantitative status of groundwater resources is still a great challenging task in this study we implemented the data driven techniques for configuring the som feature map through decomposing the large high dimensional 30 day moving average rgl data sets that could help to better understand how the spatio temporal characteristics of 126 groundwater sensors and the multi relations among hydrological variables we designed a number of figures to display and explore the complex dynamic temporal spatial groundwater and surface water characteristics where fig 6 displayed the temporal distribution of each neuron and seasonal changes between neurons fig 7 shown the clustered rgl topological maps of four aquifers in the pingtung plain and fig 8 presented the 2 d bubble topological maps of surface water and rgl in four aquifers which integrated all the information in all the clustered neuron to explore their complex dynamic temporal spatial characteristics and discover the regional groundwater variations in various aquifers 5 conclusions in this study we conducted a study to explore the complex spatial temporal groundwater features and multi relations among hydrological variables in the kuoping river basin based on a systematic combination of large i e 6180 data sets of high dimensional groundwater levels 126 rgls in various aquifers rainfall and stream flow by using the data driven techniques distinct patterns of regional groundwater characteristics and specific dominant hydrological attributes could be identified in the clusters obtained from the nonlinear clustering techniques the som which indicated the obtained clustering results were sound from the hydrological point of view the major findings based on the constructed topological maps of the som in the four aquifers of the study area are summarized as follows 1 extracting the occurrence time of each 30 day moving average data set in the clustered neurons of the som is a crucial step to identify the spatio temporal interaction between surface water and groundwater 2 the constructed topological maps clearly indicate that the fluctuation of groundwater level decreases from east to west in the pingtung plain which re confirms the permeability of the eastern area is much greater than that of the western area 3 the water levels in four aquifers have different growth and decline patterns in various seasons the water level fluctuations in aquifers b and c are more significant than those of the other two layers which indicate those two layers can be more easily replenished or drained out 4 the regional water levels possess a seasonal cycle before and after the 2005 respectively they gradually increase from spring to summer dramatically increase to reach the maximum in fall then gradually decease from fall to the next spring and consequently reached the minimum in spring 5 the designed 2 d topological bubble map which summarizes all the averaged rgl values of four aquifers and surface water in a neuron can visualize the major features of the rgls in the vertical direction so that we could easily examine the inter relationships of groundwater among various aquifers and the interactions between groundwater and surface water in sum we classified the complex high dimensional data sets based on the topological maps to make a comprehensive analysis of groundwater variations in four aquifers and present their spatio temporal features the som results could visibly explore the behavior of regional groundwater variations in various aquifers present the seasonal cycles in a temporal scale and systematically classify the interactions between surface water and groundwater and obtain the spatio temporal interrelation we thus conclude that the constructed feature maps are topologically ordered in the sense that the spatial location of a neuron in the lattice corresponds to the particular features of input patterns and can meaningfully present the spatio temporal characteristics of regional groundwater and its interaction with surface water which provide useful elaboration for future groundwater management plans acknowledgments this study was supported by the water resources agency

7546,in this study we propose a soft computing methodology to visibly explore the spatio temporal groundwater variations of the kuoping river basin in southern taiwan the self organizing map som is implemented to investigate the interactive mechanism between surface water and groundwater over the river basin based on large high dimensional data sets coupled with their occurrence times we find that extracting the occurrence time from each 30 day moving average data set in the clustered neurons of the som is a crucial step to learn the spatio temporal interaction between surface water and groundwater we design 2 d topological bubble map to summarize all the groundwater values of four aquifers in a neuron which can visibly explore the major features of the groundwater in the vertical direction the constructed som topological maps nicely display that 1 the groundwater movement in general extends from the eastern area to the western where groundwater in the eastern area can be easily recharged from precipitation in wet seasons and discharged into streams during dry seasons due to the high permeability in this area 2 the water movements in the four aquifers of the study area are quite different and the seasonal variations of groundwater in the second and third aquifers are larger than those of the others and 3 the spatial distribution and seasonal variations of groundwater and surface water are comprehensively linked together over the constructed maps to present groundwater characteristics and the interrelation between groundwater and surface water the proposed modeling methodology not only can classify the large complex high dimensional data sets into visible topological maps to effectively facilitate the quantitative status of regional groundwater resources but can also provide useful elaboration for future groundwater management keywords self organizing map som regional groundwater visually display spatio temporal distribution soft computing method 1 introduction groundwater is a crucial resource to humans and ecosystems in the context of sustainable water resources management it is important to explore the mechanisms between groundwater and surface water for quantifying the amount of groundwater recharge and extraction modeling complex groundwater systems is one focus of current research in hydrological sciences e g bauer et al 2006 henriksen et al 2003 wada et al 2014 most up to date researches have been directed from the development of numerical models to simulate the dynamics of surface water groundwater interactions and or assess the quantitative status of groundwater resources e g hartmann et al 2015 jan et al 2007 nourani and mano 2007 tremblay et al 2011 despite great efforts put in exploring the complex spatio temporal patterns inside groundwater data the characteristics of aquifers remain largely unknown and modeling the dynamic complex groundwater systems is still a great challenging task with practical limitations such as the high expense needed to overcome data availability e g anderson et al 2015 mohanty et al 2015 in watersheds with limited hydro geophysical information data driven models could be a valuable alternative to extracting valuable relations inside input output patterns and to modeling complex hydrologic systems artificial neural networks anns are such tools for effectively modeling nonlinear systems and capturing spatio temporal characteristics of patterns with less computational requirements e g abrahart et al 2012 floreano et al 2008 shen and chang 2013 over the last decades anns have raised an increasing interest in modelling hydrological processes and therefore has led to a tremendous surge in research activities e g chang et al 2016 isik et al 2013 mekonnen et

rarely to model regional groundwater levels e g mohanty et al 2015 tsai et al 2016 this study intends to explore the spatio temporal dynamics of groundwater systems and assess the interrelation of regional groundwater variations with surface water through the state of the art techniques with very uneven rainfall high mountains and steep sloped rives all over the taiwan island constrain the storage and use of water resources consequently groundwater resources become vital especially during long drought periods in response to the industrial development and population aggregation in the last half century groundwater resources have been over drawn which has caused severe subsidence and the depletion of groundwater storage space in many parts of the island chen et al 2007 hung et al 2012 wada et al 2012 effective groundwater resources management is a crucial task the subsidence and large variations of groundwater levels over the decades suggest a precise and detailed study is required for elucidating the behavior of groundwater fluctuations in both spatial and temporal scales the purpose of this study was thus to comprehensively investigate and model regional groundwater variations for sustainable management of groundwater resources the variation of groundwater in the whole basin was analyzed by using a clustering method to identify the spatio temporal characteristics of groundwater levels we proposed a soft computing technique that can visibly describe and foresee the complex dynamic regional groundwater variations at high spatial and temporal resolutions the paper is organized into five sections the first section introduces the general background and ideas used in this study the second section describes the study area and datasets used in modeling processes the third section describes the methodology and focuses on how the ann models can be implemented to model regional groundwater levels the fourth section presents the results of scenario calculations relevant to regional water resources management the final section summarizes the results and gives conclusions regarding the coupled surface water groundwater systems in semiarid regions 2 study area and dataset the kuoping river basin is the largest drainage basin 3257 km2 in taiwan and the river meanders 171 km through a highly rugged terrain in the central mountain range towards the southern part of taiwan strait where the pingtung plain is situated with rich groundwater resources fig 1 the mean annual rainfall of this basin is close to 3000 mm while over 90 of which appears in the wet season during may and october which is influenced by typhoons and monsoons the amount of the wet season flow would increase approximately 10 times than that of the dry season flow the extremely uneven distribution of rainfall and stream flows over seasons has resulted in a severe issue of water resources management the basin is primarily planned for agricultural productions and stock farms while the latest development of fish farms and industrial complexes requires more water due to the tremendous water demands that continue growing inevitably the over exploitation of groundwater by different sectors has caused a severe drop of groundwater levels and subsidence and thus has imposed great pressure on the environment to better learn the status and effectively manage the vital groundwater resources in the study basin we collected the basin wide daily hydrological monitoring data sets during 1999 and 2015 to perform the data mining analysis and model construction 126 time series of groundwater levels and three time series of river flow were obtained from the water resources agency wra taiwan thirteen time series of precipitation were obtained from the central weather bureau taiwan fig 1 shows the locations of the study area and monitoring stations and fig 2 shows the geological characteristics of the basin where four thick aquifers can be found in various areas 3 methodology in this study we explore the spatio temporal dynamics of groundwater systems through the soft computing techniques that can visibly describe and foresee the complex dynamic regional groundwater variations the large high dimensional data sets coupled with their occurrence times are analyzed and the proposed methodology is presented as follows 3 1 data preprocessing in order to eliminate the elevation effects of different observational groundwater wells we adopted the relative groundwater level rgl i e the groundwater water level was subtracted by the minimum value of historical observed groundwater levels as shown in eq 1 in this study 1 wl i relative wl i original wl i min where i represents the ith well wl i relative represents the relative groundwater level wl i original represents the original groundwater level and wl i min represents the minimum value of the original historical groundwater levels the moving average method is commonly used with time series data to smooth out short term fluctuations and highlight longer term trends and or cycles and the produced data sets are logically coherent in the time domain we used 30 day moving average to analyze data points by creating a series ofdata each of which was averaged over a subset 30 daily data of the original rgl data set ranging between 1999 01 01 and 2015 12 2 the 30 day moving average of rgls was calculated where a total of 6180 data sets were obtained and each data set included the rgls of 126 wells table 1 summarizes the groundwater precipitation and flow records in the last sixteen years 1999 2015 used in this study 3 2 som overview the self organizing map som proposed by kohonen 1982 is a powerful method used to explore the interrelationships of high dimensional multivariate systems and it is effective for clustering and forecasting in a wide spread range of disciplines a key benefit of the som is its ability to extract implicit patterns from high dimensional input data sets and classify the obtained patterns into a low dimensional output layer where similar inputs remain close together in the output neurons while preserving data structure the neurons in the output layer are commonly arranged in two dimensional grids so that the constructed topology can be visualized to give an insight into the system under investigation the som has gained increasing interest and been successfully applied to water resources management a number of promising researches related to the modeling of groundwater processes are briefly reviewed as follows for instance hassan et al 2014 modeled the structural and hydrological complexity of hard rock systems affecting the dynamics of surface groundwater interactions krause et al 2007 indicated that the interactions of the investigative system could be characterized by temporal and spatial variability tremblay et al 2011 found drastically different patterns of variability evolution for the records in three canadian regions and jan et al 2007 indicated the effective accumulated rainfall amount highly correlated to the difference between groundwater levels at each moment recently the som has been satisfactorily applied to regionalization studies e g agarwal et al 2016 chang et al 2016 and watershed classification e g ley et al 2011 razavi and coulibaly 2017 3 3 configure the som this study

7547,streamflow discharge is a fundamental dataset required to effectively manage water and land resources however developing robust stage discharge relationships called rating curves from which streamflow discharge is derived is time consuming and costly particularly in remote areas and especially at high stage levels as a result stage discharge relationships are often heavily extrapolated hydrodynamic hd models are physically based models used to simulate the flow of water along river channels and over adjacent floodplains in this paper we demonstrate a method by which a hd model can be used to generate a synthetic stage discharge relationship at high stages the method uses a both side box cox transformation to calibrate the synthetic rating curve such that the regression residuals are as close to the normal distribution as possible by doing this both side transformation the statistical uncertainty in the synthetically derived stage discharge relationship can be calculated this enables people trying to make decisions to determine whether the uncertainty in the synthetically generated rating curve at high stage levels is acceptable for their decision the proposed method is demonstrated in two streamflow gauging stations in north queensland australia keywords discharge estimation rating curve uncertainty both side box cox transformation hydrodynamic modelling streamflow 1 introduction streamflow discharge is a fundamental dataset required by hydrological ecological agricultural and engineering studies consequently the accuracy of streamflow data profoundly influences the reliability of the results of these studies however continuous discharge measurements rely on costly equipment such as doppler current profilers nihei and kimizu 2008 that can only be used in a limited range of conditions only e g deep river channels and therefore regularly intensive measurements are rare except at some important locations in practice accurate streamflow data relies on having a robust stage discharge relationship which enables continuous measurements of water level height i e stage to be accurately converted to an equivalent discharge value e g see wmo 2008 however developing reliable stage discharge relationships also known as rating curves is especially problematic at high flow events linder and miller 2012 for example when rivers break their banks le coz 2012 also it is particularly the case in remote areas where accessing the streamflow gauging station during flood events can be logistically very challenging and expensive meaning that rating curve must be extrapolated outside of the observed range pappenberger et al 2006 furthermore periodic updating of rating curve is needed hannah et al 2011 adding more cost and labours and intensive measurement this is a reason why there are rating curves corresponding to different periods in historical discharges a consequence of not having measured stage discharge values at high stage levels is that the stage discharge relationship has to be extrapolated beyond the last stage discharge measurement which can introduce large uncertainty and possible systematic bias in the discharge values shao et al 2014 as such streamflow uncertainty is not usually low as assumed and should be considered explicitly lloyd et al 2016 nathan and mcmahon 2017 and has significant impact on hydrological model calibration and evaluation pappenberger and beven 2006 knoche et al 2014 engeland et al 2016 westerberg et al 2011 found that the rating curve uncertainty can be large in nonstationary river system when a constant rating curve is applied domeneghetti et al 2012 analyzed the uncertainty of rating curves and demonstrated the significant effect of extrapolation errors biases on hydrological model calibration the importance of considering data uncertainty in model calibration and prediction has been widely recognized in the statistical community see for example carroll et al 2006 and eventually in applications see for example vrugt et al 2005 kuczera et al 2006 lerat et al 2013 in hydrological applications ocio et al 2017 evaluated the effect of rating curve uncertainty on real time forecasting and concluded that standard flow error treatment represents a reasonable trade off between complexity and realism steinbakk et al 2016 assessed the effect of rating curve uncertainty in design flood estimation particularly when extrapolation is applied as the rating curve is highly skewed it is an urgent task to understand and finally provide the estimation of uncertainty in discharge data as streamflow data are often derived before its uses to hydrological and other modelling practice however this rating curve method does not work well in gauges with no measurement of discharge at high stage because the heavily extrapolated stage discharge relationship could not be justified di baldassarre and montanari 2009 concluded that the uncertainty in discharges derived from rating curve can be up to 25 in extrapolated those extrapolation errors can dominate over all other source of uncertainty in rating curve domeneghetti et al 2012 shao et al 2014 developed a method to estimate the uncertainty and correction for bias in stage discharge relationships but this method also suffers from extrapolation issue this motivates the current work by seeking an alternative way to reconstruct streamflows and associated uncertainty at high stage levels however the discharge is in fact affected by not only stage but also many other factors such as slope of water surface and shape of the channel herschy 1999 the rating curve method by a single curve within each rating period may not work well geomorphically unstable channels when inundation occurs in a floodplain because a step change can be the case heine and pinter 2012 resulting in large uncertainty in the derived discharges beside the traditional stage discharge rating curve other approaches of constructing rating curve have been developed and used in practice for different situations including multi segmented model petersen øverleir and reitan 2005 reitan and petersen øverleir 2009 the development of rating curve at ungauged river by using variable parameter muskingum stage hydrograph perumal et al 2007 machine learning method to model stage discharge relationship by using more river system information ajmera and goyal 2012 kean and smith 2005 derive rating curves using field measurements of channel s physical properties pan et al 2016 used remotely sensed river cross sectional inundation areas and river bathymetry to construct rating curve and tested in two usgs gauging stations along the illinois river unfortunately many historical discharge records were derived from stage discharge rating curve relationship particulary in australia therefore it is always important to understand and quantify the uncertainty associated with the historical discharge data numerical hydrodynamic hd models are physically based models that utilize a detailed representation of channel geometry and floodplain topography and boundary conditions associated with particular flows to simulate the flow of water along river channels and over adjacent floodplains although the collection of data to fully parameterize these models can be expensive and laborious and their calibration is computationally intensive attempts have been made in recent years to utilize one and two dimensional hd models to extend rating curves under high flow conditions darby and thorne 1996 dose et al 2002 wilson et al 2002 simth et al 2005 doherty 2010 linder and miller 2012 brunner 2010 these approaches have facilitated the generation of rating curves with varied success hydraulic model produces reliable simulation at high flow westerberg et al 2017 sörengård and di baldassarre 2017 suggested that a simple rating curve can be reliable for high flow in stable channels however there has been little attempt to analyze the uncertainty associated with rating curves based on hd models and as a result the quantification of the uncertainty in streamflow data has been largely ignored this paper aims to contribute to the understanding and quantification of uncertainty associated with the historical discharge data which were often derived from hydrographer s rating curve without uncertainty measures by using the simulated hd stage discharge data the objectives of this paper are to 1 assess the performance of a hd model at simulating stage height and discharge for high flow events against historical stage and discharge values where the historical discharges were derived from hydrographer s rating curves in the study area and 2 derive new rating curves based on the simulated stage discharge data for high stages flows and adjust the simulated rating curves for its usage in revising historical flow data and 3 develop a method of quantifying the uncertainty in streamflow data generated using a hd model the paper is organized as follows the study area and data are described in the next section the assessment criteria and methods are presented in section 3 which is followed by the results and discussion the conclusions are presented in section 5 2 study areas and reference stations for analysis two gauging stations from two important regions in north queensland australia were used in this study these regions were the tully murray catchment and the flinders catchment these regions are selected because of their differences in flood characteristics allowing to investigate the suitability of the methodology in rivers with varied nature the observations were at daily scale the tully murray catchment is located in the wet tropics region of the north east coast of australia fig 1 and is one of the many catchments which drain into the great barrier reef lagoon it covers an area of 2072 km2 of which 832 km2 is floodplain karim et al 2008 topography varies from steep rainforest covered mountains to the low relief floodplain which is largely developed for agriculture mainly sugarcane grazing and bananas the tully river is one of the main waterways on the floodplain with a length of 130 km and well developed natural levee banks which have been extended artificially in places karim et al 2014 the catchment receives a mean annual rainfall of between 2000 and 4000 mm depending on location most rainfall 60 80 occurs during the wet season between december and april during this period floodplain wetlands are inundated by an average of 3 4 flood pulses per year wallace et al 2009 tully station with id 113006a is also shown in fig 1 hd simulation was conduction from january 2006 to june 2009 the historical rating curves were updated annually but the change of rating points were only at lower stage flow levels to account for changes in channel bedform between and within seasons for station 113006a we only obtained the hydrographer s rating curves but not discharge measurement and believed that the historical discharge observations were derived from the rating tables which were generally extrapolated with validation by high flow values the historical hydrographer s rating curves which correspond to ratings 84 87 are also very similar and in fact are the same for high stage flow levels above stage 5 696 corresponding to discharge 410 822 the next largest observed discharge were between 220 and 232 556 with corresponding stage levels of 3 9 4 025 respectively for different rating curves therefore all the simulated high flow data were pooled together to derive the simulated rating curve this will be discussed in section 4 the flinders river is the longest river in queensland and its catchment has an area of 109 000 km2 fig 1 the agricultural potential of the catchment was recently assessed as part of the flinders and gilbert agricultural resource assessment petheram et al 2013 this river system is complicated with possible inundation in high flows dutta et al 2013 karim et al 2014 karim et al 2015 zhao and shao 2015 zhao et al 2016 using data from this station and other stations within the flinders catchment shao et al 2014 estimated the streamflow uncertainty at selected stations and lerat et al 2013 using an ensemble of 50 river system models estimated the mean annual flow to be 2543 gl with uncertainty bounds ranging from 2415 gl to 2685 gl at a 95 confidence level the stream gauge at walkers bend station id 915003a located approximately 80 km upstream of the mouth of the flinders river is the key surface water monitoring station in the catchment and unlike other coastal gauging stations in northern australia it has a well defined rating curve at high flows due to a favorable topographic constriction at the gauging station the observed streamflow time series at station 915003a was derived using 8 rating curves in this paper we concentrated on the high quality period between 1988 and 2011 which encompassed 4 of the 8 rating curves see table 1 a rating curve is governed by its rating period indicating when it is applicable and rating table consisting of isolated stage streamflow points which collectively form the rating curve station 915003a was deliberately selected to assess if the method proposed in this paper is applicable in complicated river systems where hd model can be challenging there are 114 stage discharge measurements in total unfortunately except rating 15 all the ratings have stage discharge observations at relatively lower stage levels see table 1 the result by using shao et al 2014 indicated that the uncertainty was reasonable see fig 2 however the results cannot be testified for all the rating periods except rating 15 due to available stage discharge measurements motivating us to consider the use of hd model to further understand its discharge uncertainty in different rating periods 3 methods this section describes how the hd model was setup section 3 1 1 and calibrated under high flow overbank conditions section 3 1 2 and the assessment criteria that were used to assess the hd model performance section 3 2 section 3 3 1 describes how a simulated rating curve was generated and section 3 3 2 outlines how the simulated rating curve was adjusted to ensure continuity with the observed rating curve at the threshold height i e the height above which the rating curve based on the hd simulated data was derived section 3 4 describes the method by which the simulated rating curve was perturbed to make estimates of streamflow uncertainty under high flow conditions 3 1 hydrodynamic modelling 3 1 1 model setup the mike11 one dimensional hd model dhi 2009 was used to simulate the water level and streamflow in the

11 modelling can be performed across a floodplain using wide cross sections for preliminary assessment of the floodplain behaviour key model input data includes stream river network cross section geometry riverbed friction initial and boundary conditions manning s roughness coefficient n is the only calibrated term the other terms were parameterized through physical measurements key model output data include water level and velocity at the model cross section locations and discharge at the mid points between the successive cross sections in this study the model was setup for the entire flinders river network fig 1 for tully and murray rivers the river network was derived from the lidar light detection and ranging data which is a very high resolution topography data 1 m spatial resolution with vertical accuracy of 15 cm the resulting stream network model consists of 69 stream links a link is a section of a stream between two junctions 7 inflow sources that carry upper catchment runoff to the floodplain and 2 downstream water height boundaries the catchment was divided into a number of sub catchments based on land topography sub catchment boundaries and stream networks were generated using arc gis hydro tools smith and brough 2006 the nam hydrological model dhi 2008 was used to simulate rainfall generated runoff runoff for individual sub catchments was estimated separately and then propagated through sub catchments further downstream the nam was first calibrated against observed flow at headwater catchments regionalization method vaze et al 2011 was used to transfer the parameters to sub catchments within the study domain to generate runoff using the nam model the hydrographer s extrapolated discharge data were not used in the calibration the main calibration parameter was the surface roughness coefficient manning s n however stream bed elevations at junctions were slightly modified to rectify model warnings due to different bed levels of streams meeting at a junction the value of roughness coefficient was adjusted by trial and error basis until the best match was obtained between simulated and measured data determined when the summation of the root mean square deviations between measured and simulated values was minimum the flinders river catchment is a complicated system and inundation happens during floods the stream network was derived from the projected srtm and cross checked with the watercourses lines in the topographic mapping hydrography feature dataset from australian hydrological geospatial fabric ahgf a specialised geographic information system bom 2012 the srtm derived network agreed with the topographic mapping for the most part but some correction to flow direction was needed in the low lying flat areas where there is a lot of river braiding to ensure the dem derived stream lines for main rivers followed the channel path depicted in the topographic mapping a visual assessment of google earth pro imagery was used to identify the significant drainage lines in the landscape and select a subset of major rivers from the dem derived network to be used in the analysis cross section of each reach of a river network needs to be defined in one dimensional hydrodynamic modelling cross section data are only available at the stream gauges of the main rivers in the flinders and gilbert catchments the cross sections for different sections of the river network were initially derived from the 30 m resolution digital elevation model dem obtained from nasa s shuttle radar topography mission srtm farr and kobrick 2000 however by comparing the generated cross sections from the srtm dem with the measured cross sections at the gauging locations it was found that the cross section derived from the srtm 30 m dem did not represent the shape of the measured cross sections in the mid and lower part of the river networks in the flinders and gilbert catchments a four day field trip to the flinders and gilbert was undertaken by the hydrodynamic modelling team to survey the cross sections of the rivers in the floodplains of the two catchments during this trip the cross sections of different rivers at 56 locations that were accessible by roads were measured dutta et al 2013 for example fig 3 shows the photographs of two sites at the flinders and gilbert rivers respectively where cross section measurements were undertaken the surveyed data were used to update the cross sections derived from srtm dem for different sections of the river networks of the two catchments for one dimensional hydrodynamic modelling the field survey data allowed to well represent the cross section for most of the reaches the data were interpolated between the measured locations to cover the entire river network a schematic of the modelled river network is shown in fig 4 based on the locations of the streamflow gauging stations fig 4 sub catchment boundaries were generated using d8 technique tarboton et al 1991 based on flow direction and accumulation data generated from the dem sacramento rainfall runoff model burnash et al 1973 using daily silo gridded climate data jeffrey et al 2001 was used to simulate runoff in the headwater and ungauged catchments lerat et al 2013 the sacramento rainfall runoff model was calibrated using observed data at the headwater catchments of the basin the simulated runoff at the headwater catchments were used as the inflow boundary to the 1d hd model regionalization method vaze et al 2011 was used to transfer the parameters to sub catchments within the study domain to generate runoff using the sacramento rainfall runoff model routing of runoff water between individual sub catchments to the hydrodynamic model boundary was done using the mike 11 model the mike11 hd model was calibrated for a number of high flow events against the observed water levels recorded at 3 gauging stations for the period between 1980 and 2010 the observed water levels at different gauges at the start of the simulation was interpolated to be used as the initial water levels for different sections of the river network in 1d modelling the model was calibrated for a number of historical flood events by adjusting the manning s roughness coefficients for compound river cross sections in the model setup and simulation all input data for hd model was provided at a daily timestep hd model runs in sub daily timestep at multiple of seconds the input data are descritised by the hd model to sub daily scale to match the sub daily timestep of the model run the sub daily time step is adjusted by the model itself to satisfy the stability criteria the final results are aggregated to daily timestep for the model calibration and validation and to generate stage discharge relationship at daily timestep which is same as the time step of observed stage discharge relationship 3 1 2 model calibration the hd model calibration aimed to match the simulated and observed stage levels as closely as possible the selected rivers have been investigated through the so called flinders and gilbert agricultural resources assessment dutta et al 2013 and the performance of hd model has also been reported in karim et al 2014 and karim et al 2015 the results showed that the hydrodynamic model performed reasonably well in simulating stage height at gauging stations the timing of simulated flood peaks at different locations on the floodplain closely match the observed data details of the calibration and validation of the two river models are presented in karim et al 2015 from which it can be seen both the calibration and validation on water stage are reasonably well under both calibration and validation modes as a demonstration figs 5 and 6 compare the simulated and observed water levels for three different events used for the model calibration at gauging stations tully gauge id 113006a in tully river and walker bend gauge id 915003a at flinders river respectively as can be seen from fig 5 the simulated water level agreed well with the observed data for all three flood events from the start to the end of the flood events similar results were obtained at walker bend in flinders river as well fig 6 in particular the matching between the observed and simulated flood levels was highly satisfactory during the peak floods for different magnitude flood events it is understandable because the hd models were calibrated by observed water levels which are measured over time 3 2 criteria used to assess hd model performance the focus of this study was to use a hd model to simulate the stage discharge relationship at high flow over bank events for this reason a predefined stage height threshold h t was adopted above which the observed rating curve was revised using the hd model although the hd model simulates all the daily stage and flows the assessment of the hd model was only made for simulated water levels above ht to evaluate the performance of the hd model when the observed stage heights are above the predefined threshold h t four statistics were employed in this study these were the correlation coefficient r coefficient of efficiency ens model biases bias and the ratio of simulated and observed standard deviation rs and are defined for stage heights as 3 r 1 i 1 n h o i h o h s i h s i 1 n h o i h o 2 i 1 n h s i h s 2 4 e ns 1 i 1 n h o i h s i 2 i 1 n h o i h o 2 5 bias 1 n i 1 n h s i h o i and 6 rs i 1 n h s i h s 2 i 1 n h o i h o 2 respectively where h o i 1 n h o i n and h s i 1 n h s i n are the average of the observed and simulated stage heights respectively with h o i and h s i i 1 2 n being the observed and simulated stage heights respectively at time step i and n is the number of time steps with the observed stage heights above the predefined stage height threshold h t in statistics r with the range between 0 and 1 represents how well a linear model describes the relationship between two variables ens with the values of less than one reflects how well the hd model simulates observed daily stage heights the model bias quantifies the systematic departure of the simulated stage heights from the observed stage heights and the ratio of standard deviation rs of the modelled and observed daily stage heights provides a measure of the degree of dispersion of variables hundecha and bárdossy 2008 the same criteria were used to assess the performance of the hd model at simulating observed discharges at the time when the corresponding observed stage height are above the predefined threshold h t 3 3 developing a simulated stage discharge relationship under high flow conditions 3 3 1 simulating a rating curve above a stage height threshold the first step was to construct a rating curve based on the simulated stage and flow data using the one dimensional unsteady hd model section 3 1 for a given water stage above the threshold ht the discharge can vary for different stage values with the following power relationship 7 q s g h s θ s a s h s c s b s with θ s a s b s c s being the vector of model parameters for the data simulated using the hd model in the present model setting c s h t is required in the eq 7 to enable the temporal variation of the stage discharge relationship hydrographers often produce a set of rating curves each covering different periods of time see table 1 it is widely noted that the flow residuals in the resulted stage discharge relationship are not well described by a normal distribution petheram et al 2008 making the least squares method in parameter estimation less efficient see for example cox and hinkley 1968 in order to take account of the heterogeneous variation in residuals at different stage levels we used the both side box cox regression as described in eqs 8 10 8 t q s λ t g h s θ s λ s ε to stablise the residual ε so that with a proper choice of parameter λ the resulted residuals are independent and identically distributed as a normal distribution with mean of zero and standard deviation σ rc here 9 t x λ s x λ s 1 λ s λ s 0 log x λ s 0 is the box cox transformation with inverse transformation 10 t 1 x λ s λ s x 1 1 λ s λ 0 exp x λ 0 this method for transforming data to fit a normal distribution was first investigated by wood 1974 and carroll and ruppert 1984 in statistics and was discussed in details in carroll and ruppert 1988 shao et al 2014 successfully applied this transformation in the uncertainty evaluation in streamflow data in the flinders catchment although it is possible to use different transformation on stage and discharge to achieve possibly better fitting in the statistical sense we do not tend to recommend this here because our both side transformation retains the traditionally used stage discharge relationship in 7 when trying to stabilize the residual as close to the normal distribution as possible in fact the original empirical stage discharge relationship in eq 7 has been used widely and approved work well and the both side box cox transformation includes the weighted least squares method as a special case shao et al 2014 therefore it is not our intention to revise such a relationship 3 3 2 adjusting the simulated rating curve to ensure continuity with the observed rating curve at threshold height ht if there are no stage discharge measurements at high stages it is not possible to assess the systematic departure of the simulated rating curve from the observed rating curve under the assumption see the results for its rationality that the systematic departure of the simulated rating curve is similar to the departure of the observed discharge at the threshold stage ht it is possible to correct the departure of the simulated rating curve by adjusting it so that continuity is achieved with the existing rating curve at the threshold stage ht to do this one can either impose a constraint in the calibration of the simulated rating curve or impose a constraint on the discharge post process in practice it was found that the post bias correction approach using eqs 9 and 10 are easy to implement and robust there are two constraints that can be implemented in post process i through a shift vertically so that the bias corrected rating curve is given by 11 q s add a s h t c s b s δ q with 12 δ q q t a s h t c s b s or ii by a proportional adjustment so that the bias corrected rating curve is given by 13 q s mul a s h t c s b s xq with 14 xq q t a s h t c s b s both options will be examined in the case study 3 4 estimating uncertainty under high flow conditions quantifying the uncertainty in the simulated rating curve is complicated by the nonlinearity in the stage discharge relationship caused by the nonlinear rating curve function eq 7 and the two side box cox regression eq 8 because the two side box cox regression model in the rating curve construction tends to generate homogeneous residuals the bootstrap method introduced by efron 1979 was used to assess the model parameter uncertainty due to its simplicity and robustness the bootstrap method is powerful for deriving statistical uncertainty and has been successfully used in hydrological research see for example li et al 2010 selle and hannah 2010 shao et al 2012 2014 the great advantage of bootstrap is its simplicity although the two side box cox aims to achieve normality in residuals the normal residuals cannot be guaranteed and are approximately reached in fact the normality is a very strong assumption and distribution free approaches are always preferred if possible another great advantage of bootstrap is that it is asymptotically more accurate than other approaches using normality assumption diciccio and efron 1996 therefore the bootstrap is adopted here while the empirical distribution based on ε i i 1 2 n is used to quantify the model uncertainty the parameter uncertainty can be assessed as follows let θ s λ s denote the estimate of model parameters θ s λ s 1 randomly resample the model residuals ε i i 1 2 n with replacement to form a new residual series ε i b i 1 2 n here b denotes the b th bootstrap residual sample 2 add ε i b to the fitted value t g h s θ s λ s and transform the total quantity by inversing box cox transformation to form the new observations 15 q s i b t 1 t g h s i θ s λ s ε i b i 1 2 n because the new residual series is generated with replacement any model residual ε i can be sampled more than one time or not sampled at all 3 calibrate the bootstrap sample h s i q s i b i 1 2 n to obtain a bootstrap estimate θ s b λ s b of model parameter θ s λ s as well as the simulated flow q s i b i 1 2 n because of the limited number of parameters involved the calibration can be achieved with a gradient descent method such as the levenberg marquardt algorithm marquardt 1963 the starting point of the search algorithm can be set to the conservative value of θ 0 λ 0 1 1 4 repeat steps 1 to 3 for b times to obtain a set of bootstrap parameter estimates θ s b λ s b b 1 2 b reflecting the uncertainty in the model parameters and simulated flows q s i b i 1 2 n b 1 b reflecting the simulation uncertainty due to parameter uncertainty in this paper the bootstrap resampling was repeated 499 times once the parameter uncertainty and model uncertainty are derived one can generate prediction uncertainty for a given stage above the threshold h t to do this for a given observed stage h o the following steps were undertaken 5 simulate streamflow value q s by applying h o to eq 8 with bootstrapped parameter values derived from steps 1 4 and an empirical residual based on resampling 6 adjust the streamflow value q s either vertically by eq 11 or proportionally by eq 13 it will be seen that the vertical adjustment is appropriate in our case study in the above bootstrap procedure parameter c was treated as fixed because it is a constant which was added only for best rating curve fitting 4 results 4 1 assessing the applicability of hd model fig 7 provides the relationships between the observations and simulations at station 113006a it can be seen that the observed and simulated stages agreed with each other very well fig 7 a with excellent criterion values with the values of r ens and rs closing to one and therefore reported as 1 small bias see table 2 it is possible in simulation because the hd model was calibrated against water stage which all were assumed to be accurate however the simulated discharges did not agree with the observed ones see fig 7 b it can be seen that the simulated discharges were generally larger than the observed ones resulting in the smaller coefficient of efficiency ens 0 85 positive bias bias 18 64 and large value of deviation ratio rs 1 30 while the correlation is high r 0 98 therefore the simulated discharges still need to be corrected fig 7 c and d plot the observed discharge against observed stage in the original and log scales respectively together with all the rating tables used to derive the discharge values it can be seen that the rating tables changed only at the lower stage values around 2 5 m and were identical for the high stage values fig 7 e and f also plot the simulated discharge against simulated stage in the original and log scales respectively together with all the rating tables used to derived the discharge values it can be seen that the simulated discharges were similar to the observed ones but departure from the rating tables at high stage values however it should be noted that there was no observed stage discharges and to verify the simulation for station 915003a table 2 provides the statistics summarizing the performance of the hd simulation during different rating periods and fig 8 provides the plots of the simulated stages and discharges against their corresponding observations it can be seen that the simulated stages have quite high correlation with the observations over 0 92 but relatively low coefficients of efficiency over 0 69 meaning that corrections are needed overall the simulated stages generally overestimate the observations with positive biases however the simulation of discharge is not as good as the simulation of stage with slightly smaller correlation between 0 82 and 0 90 and coefficient of efficiency between 0 64 and 0 78 and larger bias the results are not surprising because the hd model was calibrated against stage values rather than discharge values it can be seen from fig 8 that the stage simulation are not accurate at lower stage levels this is likely to be because in channels with sandy beds the stage discharge relationship at low stage levels can change considerably between seasons and even within seasons variation in such fine scale topographic information is not captured by the hd model and changes in channel bedform do not impact on the stage discharge relationship at mid to high stage levels the discharge simulation at lower stages does not agree with the observations well but is reasonable this was not unexpected either because the hd model was mainly calibrated against the observed water levels covering mid and higher flow ranges by adjusting the roughness coefficient thus the calibrated roughness coefficient was not suitable to simulate low flow before using the hd model to synthetically generate rating curves and assess the uncertainty in the stage discharge relationship it is important to further assess the robustness of the hd model fig 9 presents the plots of the simulated discharges against the simulated stages together with the hydrographer s rating curve for each rating period it can be seen that the simulated stage discharge relationships do not always agree with the corresponding hydrographer s rating curves however it is interesting to see that the simulated stage flow relationships are quite stable with reasonably good agreement at reasonably high stages see the scatter plot of simulated stage against simulated discharges in fig 9 even though the simulation does not agree with observations well see the scatter plot of simulated discharge against observed discharges in fig 8 4 2 simulated rating curve and its uncertainty given that the hd model performs satisfactorily at mid to high stages it is possible to use the simulated stage and discharge values to revise the hydrographer s historical discharges beyond the last stage discharge measurement where extrapolation occurs the threshold ht where construction of the simulated rating curve commenced was visually assigned at a stage height beyond which the simulated stage discharge relationship is considered as stable 4 2 1 station 113006a for station 113006a given that we only obtained the hydrographer s rating curves but not discharge measurement at this station and believed that the historical discharge observations were derived from the rating tables which were generally extrapolated with validation by high flow values we will derive a rating curve based on the simulated data for the stage above 3 9 m which is the third highest rating point beyond which the historical rating tables were identical and all the rating periods were considered together the parameter estimates for the rating curve based on the hd model are given in table 3 the fitted rating curves with and without box cox variance are similar in the data range although the parameter values are different the plots are not provided because it does not provide much useful information the residuals for the rating curve with and without the box cox variance stabilization are given in fig 10 from which it can be seen that heterogeneity appeared in the residuals by nonlinear least squares fig 10a but the use of the box cox variance stabilization was effective at normalizing the variance fig 10b the parameter estimates can be used to generate as many ensembles as needed instead of revealing the individual ensembles we provide the theoretical 95 confidence envelope of the ensembles in fig 11 together with the simulated stage discharge data and hydrographer s rating curves used to generate the historical discharges it can be seen that both the vertical and proportional adjustments perform similarly and have reasonable agreement with the historical data represented by the hydrographer s rating curves in conclusion the rating curve based on simulated stage discharge data provide a way to adjust the historical discharges with uncertainty estimation see table 4 4 2 2 station 915003a given that the hd model can reasonably simulates steady stage discharge relationship for mid and high flows see fig 10 we construct the simulated rating curve above a stage threshold table 1 and fig 9 were used to guide the selection of the threshold ht after carefully examining the relationships shown in figs 8 and 9 we fixed the threshold stage at h t 1 100 see table 1 the parameter estimates for the rating curve based on the hd model are given in table 3 and the fitted curves for individual rating periods are given in fig 12 the residuals for the rating curve with and without the box cox variance stabilization are given in fig 13 although the nonlinear least squares appears to capture the stage flow relationship without the box cox variance stabilization fig 12 the residuals do not fit a normal distribution consequently the use of the box cox variance stabilization is required and can be seen to be effective at normalizing the variance fig 13 furthermore there is a greater variation in parameter values between different rating curves without stabilizing the variance than there is when the variance is stabilized again the parameter estimates can be used to generate as many ensembles as required instead of revealing the individual ensembles we provide the theoretical 95 confidence envelope of the ensembles in fig 14 together with the simulated stage discharge data and hydrographer s rating curves used to generate the historical discharges it can be seen that the vertical adjustment outperformed the proportional adjustment in particular the hydrographer s rating curves were not within the uncertainty envelopes of the simulated rating curves for proportional adjustment in rating 13 and 14 therefore we use the vertical adjustment in this station from now for the vertical adjustment the hydrographer s rating curves were within the uncertainty envelopes of the simulated rating curves for rating periods 13 and 14 the simulated rating curves are similar to the rating curve extrapolated by the hydrographer however the simulated rating curves are slightly below the hydrographer s curve for rating periods 15 and 16 close inspection of the data revealed that the simulated discharge values were usually smaller than the corresponding historical values see the scatter plots in fig 9 note that the flinders catchment is frequently inundated during flood events especially in recent years the hydrographer s rating curve may not work well if only a linear extrapolation was used in fact the bias correction in shao et al 2014 also found that the hydrographer s rating curve frequently suffers from overestimation at large values and the historical discharges should be reduced from the results we can see that the uncertainty based on the simulated rating curve is reasonably small if the simulated stages and discharges can form a stable relationship e g ratings 13 and 14 however the simulated rating curve is subject to a large uncertainty if the hd model does not produce a good representation of discharge i e the simulated discharges vary greatly for a given stage value e g ratings 15 and 16 resulting in a large uncertainty when being applied to the historical discharge series nevertheless the historical discharges tend to fall in the 95 uncertainty envelope derived from the simulated rating curve with vertical adjustment 5 conclusions and a discussion in this paper the performance of a hd model to simulate discharge was re assessed as a precursor to developing a procedure for simulating stage discharge relationships rating curves under high flow conditions and quantifying the associated uncertainty it was found that the simulated stage discharge relationship was usually in good agreement with the hydrographer s rating curve used to derive the historical discharge time series for mid to high flows this was not unexpected and was consistent with many previous studies because the hd model was calibrated against the stage data only during high flows however note that the correlation between the simulated and historical discharge values was weaker than that for simulated and historical stages as the hd model considers more factors such as the previous stage and discharges in the discharge simulation considerable uncertainties can be introduced in converting stage data to discharge when simulated stage discharge data are used to construct the simulated rating curve there is a potential to evaluate the uncertainties in the historical discharge data series provided that one is confident about the accuracy of the hd model in simulating flow values in high flow periods and events in order to quantify the uncertainty in the simulated rating curve the both side box cox transformation was adopted to obtain stable residuals in the model calibration the uncertainty estimation was then constructed by a bootstrapping procedure note that the simulated rating curve was derived from the simulated stage and discharge values for the stages above a pre defined threshold an adjustment was needed to ensure the continuity at the threshold it was found that a vertical adjustment was an appropriate approach the proposed simulated rating curve based on hd model has a good agreement with hydrographer s rating curve in stable river channel station 113006a in tully river of queensland australia however in a complicated river system such as frequent flood inundation the proposed rating curve can produce large uncertainty because hydrographer s rating curve may not work well if only a linear extrapolation was used a comprehensive revision of historical discharge data based on hydrographer s rating curve may be needed by for example identifying new set of rating periods and rating curves from simulated stage discharge relationship furthermore as the simulated stage discharge by hd model only reliable for high stage discharge levels in this paper we only constructed the simulated rating curves for high stage levels above a pre defined threshold which is beyond the discharge measurements and therefore only derived the uncertainties for the corresponding historical discharge at high stage discharge levels however in many gauging stations there usually some actual stage discharge measurements are mostly available at the lower stage levels it should be interesting to combine the measured stage discharge data at low flow and the simulated stage discharge data by hd model for high flow to construct a single rating curve for the entire stage data acknowledgements this research is supported by csiro water for a healthy country and sustainable agriculture flagships the streamflow and rating curve data used in the paper were supplied

7547,streamflow discharge is a fundamental dataset required to effectively manage water and land resources however developing robust stage discharge relationships called rating curves from which streamflow discharge is derived is time consuming and costly particularly in remote areas and especially at high stage levels as a result stage discharge relationships are often heavily extrapolated hydrodynamic hd models are physically based models used to simulate the flow of water along river channels and over adjacent floodplains in this paper we demonstrate a method by which a hd model can be used to generate a synthetic stage discharge relationship at high stages the method uses a both side box cox transformation to calibrate the synthetic rating curve such that the regression residuals are as close to the normal distribution as possible by doing this both side transformation the statistical uncertainty in the synthetically derived stage discharge relationship can be calculated this enables people trying to make decisions to determine whether the uncertainty in the synthetically generated rating curve at high stage levels is acceptable for their decision the proposed method is demonstrated in two streamflow gauging stations in north queensland australia keywords discharge estimation rating curve uncertainty both side box cox transformation hydrodynamic modelling streamflow 1 introduction streamflow discharge is a fundamental dataset required by hydrological ecological agricultural and engineering studies consequently the accuracy of streamflow data profoundly influences the reliability of the results of these studies however continuous discharge measurements rely on costly equipment such as doppler current profilers nihei and kimizu 2008 that can only be used in a limited range of conditions only e g deep river channels and therefore regularly intensive measurements are rare except at some important locations in practice accurate streamflow data relies on having a robust stage discharge relationship which enables continuous measurements of water level height i e stage to be accurately converted to an equivalent discharge value e g see wmo 2008 however developing reliable stage discharge relationships also known as rating curves is especially problematic at high flow events linder and miller 2012 for example when rivers break their banks le coz 2012 also it is particularly the case in remote areas where accessing the streamflow gauging station during flood events can be logistically very challenging and expensive meaning that rating curve must be extrapolated outside of the observed range pappenberger et al 2006 furthermore periodic updating of rating curve is needed hannah et al 2011 adding more cost and labours and intensive measurement this is a reason why there are rating curves corresponding to different periods in historical discharges a consequence of not having measured stage discharge values at high stage levels is that the stage discharge relationship has to be extrapolated beyond the last stage discharge measurement which can introduce large uncertainty and possible systematic bias in the discharge values shao et al 2014 as such streamflow uncertainty is not usually low as assumed and should be considered explicitly lloyd et al 2016 nathan and mcmahon 2017 and has significant impact on hydrological model calibration and evaluation pappenberger and beven 2006 knoche et al 2014 engeland et al 2016 westerberg et al 2011 found that the rating curve uncertainty can be large in nonstationary river system when a constant rating curve is applied domeneghetti et al 2012 analyzed the uncertainty of rating curves and demonstrated the significant effect of extrapolation errors biases on hydrological model calibration the importance of considering data uncertainty in model calibration and prediction has been widely recognized in the statistical community see for example carroll et al 2006 and eventually in applications see for example vrugt et al 2005 kuczera et al 2006 lerat et al 2013 in hydrological applications ocio et al 2017 evaluated the effect of rating curve uncertainty on real time forecasting and concluded that standard flow error treatment represents a reasonable trade off between complexity and realism steinbakk et al 2016 assessed the effect of rating curve uncertainty in design flood estimation particularly when extrapolation is applied as the rating curve is highly skewed it is an urgent task to understand and finally provide the estimation of uncertainty in discharge data as streamflow data are often derived before its uses to hydrological and other modelling practice however this rating curve method does not work well in gauges with no measurement of discharge at high stage because the heavily extrapolated stage discharge relationship could not be justified di baldassarre and montanari 2009 concluded that the uncertainty in discharges derived from rating curve can be up to 25 in extrapolated those extrapolation errors can dominate over all other source of uncertainty in rating curve domeneghetti et al 2012 shao et al 2014 developed a method to estimate the uncertainty and correction for bias in stage discharge relationships but this method also suffers from extrapolation issue this motivates the current work by seeking an alternative way to reconstruct streamflows and associated uncertainty at high stage levels however the discharge is in fact affected by not only stage but also many other factors such as slope of water surface and shape of the channel herschy 1999 the rating curve method by a single curve within each rating period may not work well geomorphically unstable channels when inundation occurs in a floodplain because a step change can be the case heine and pinter 2012 resulting in large uncertainty in the derived discharges beside the traditional stage discharge rating curve other approaches of constructing rating curve have been developed and used in practice for different situations including multi segmented model petersen øverleir and reitan 2005 reitan and petersen øverleir 2009 the development of rating curve at ungauged river by using variable parameter muskingum stage hydrograph perumal et al 2007 machine learning method to model stage discharge relationship by using more river system information ajmera and goyal 2012 kean and smith 2005 derive rating curves using field measurements of channel s physical properties pan et al 2016 used remotely sensed river cross sectional inundation areas and river bathymetry to construct rating curve and tested in two usgs gauging stations along the illinois river unfortunately many historical discharge records were derived from stage discharge rating curve relationship particulary in australia therefore it is always important to understand and quantify the uncertainty associated with the historical discharge data numerical hydrodynamic hd models are physically based models that utilize a detailed representation of channel geometry and floodplain topography and boundary conditions associated with particular flows to simulate the flow of water along river channels and over adjacent floodplains although the collection of data to fully parameterize these models can be expensive and laborious and their calibration is computationally intensive attempts have been made in recent years to utilize one and two dimensional hd models to extend rating curves under high flow conditions darby and thorne 1996 dose et al 2002 wilson et al 2002 simth et al 2005 doherty 2010 linder and miller 2012 brunner 2010 these approaches have facilitated the generation of rating curves with varied success hydraulic model produces reliable simulation at high flow westerberg et al 2017 sörengård and di baldassarre 2017 suggested that a simple rating curve can be reliable for high flow in stable channels however there has been little attempt to analyze the uncertainty associated with rating curves based on hd models and as a result the quantification of the uncertainty in streamflow data has been largely ignored this paper aims to contribute to the understanding and quantification of uncertainty associated with the historical discharge data which were often derived from hydrographer s rating curve without uncertainty measures by using the simulated hd stage discharge data the objectives of this paper are to 1 assess the performance of a hd model at simulating stage height and discharge for high flow events against historical stage and discharge values where the historical discharges were derived from hydrographer s rating curves in the study area and 2 derive new rating curves based on the simulated stage discharge data for high stages flows and adjust the simulated rating curves for its usage in revising historical flow data and 3 develop a method of quantifying the uncertainty in streamflow data generated using a hd model the paper is organized as follows the study area and data are described in the next section the assessment criteria and methods are presented in section 3 which is followed by the results and discussion the conclusions are presented in section 5 2 study areas and reference stations for analysis two gauging stations from two important regions in north queensland australia were used in this study these regions were the tully murray catchment and the flinders catchment these regions are selected because of their differences in flood characteristics allowing to investigate the suitability of the methodology in rivers with varied nature the observations were at daily scale the tully murray catchment is located in the wet tropics region of the north east coast of australia fig 1 and is one of the many catchments which drain into the great barrier reef lagoon it covers an area of 2072 km2 of which 832 km2 is floodplain karim et al 2008 topography varies from steep rainforest covered mountains to the low relief floodplain which is largely developed for agriculture mainly sugarcane grazing and bananas the tully river is one of the main waterways on the floodplain with a length of 130 km and well developed natural levee banks which have been extended artificially in places karim et al 2014 the catchment receives a mean annual rainfall of between 2000 and 4000 mm depending on location most rainfall 60 80 occurs during the wet season between december and april during this period floodplain wetlands are inundated by an average of 3 4 flood pulses per year wallace et al 2009 tully station with id 113006a is also shown in fig 1 hd simulation was conduction from january 2006 to june 2009 the historical rating curves were updated annually but the change of rating points were only at lower stage flow levels to account for changes in channel bedform between and within seasons for station 113006a we only obtained the hydrographer s rating curves but not discharge measurement and believed that the historical discharge observations were derived from the rating tables which were generally extrapolated with validation by high flow values the historical hydrographer s rating curves which correspond to ratings 84 87 are also very similar and in fact are the same for high stage flow levels above stage 5 696 corresponding to discharge 410 822 the next largest observed discharge were between 220 and 232 556 with corresponding stage levels of 3 9 4 025 respectively for different rating curves therefore all the simulated high flow data were pooled together to derive the simulated rating curve this will be discussed in section 4 the flinders river is the longest river in queensland and its catchment has an area of 109 000 km2 fig 1 the agricultural potential of the catchment was recently assessed as part of the flinders and gilbert agricultural resource assessment petheram et al 2013 this river system is complicated with possible inundation in high flows dutta et al 2013 karim et al 2014 karim et al 2015 zhao and shao 2015 zhao et al 2016 using data from this station and other stations within the flinders catchment shao et al 2014 estimated the streamflow uncertainty at selected stations and lerat et al 2013 using an ensemble of 50 river system models estimated the mean annual flow to be 2543 gl with uncertainty bounds ranging from 2415 gl to 2685 gl at a 95 confidence level the stream gauge at walkers bend station id 915003a located approximately 80 km upstream of the mouth of the flinders river is the key surface water monitoring station in the catchment and unlike other coastal gauging stations in northern australia it has a well defined rating curve at high flows due to a favorable topographic constriction at the gauging station the observed streamflow time series at station 915003a was derived using 8 rating curves in this paper we concentrated on the high quality period between 1988 and 2011 which encompassed 4 of the 8 rating curves see table 1 a rating curve is governed by its rating period indicating when it is applicable and rating table consisting of isolated stage streamflow points which collectively form the rating curve station 915003a was deliberately selected to assess if the method proposed in this paper is applicable in complicated river systems where hd model can be challenging there are 114 stage discharge measurements in total unfortunately except rating 15 all the ratings have stage discharge observations at relatively lower stage levels see table 1 the result by using shao et al 2014 indicated that the uncertainty was reasonable see fig 2 however the results cannot be testified for all the rating periods except rating 15 due to available stage discharge measurements motivating us to consider the use of hd model to further understand its discharge uncertainty in different rating periods 3 methods this section describes how the hd model was setup section 3 1 1 and calibrated under high flow overbank conditions section 3 1 2 and the assessment criteria that were used to assess the hd model performance section 3 2 section 3 3 1 describes how a simulated rating curve was generated and section 3 3 2 outlines how the simulated rating curve was adjusted to ensure continuity with the observed rating curve at the threshold height i e the height above which the rating curve based on the hd simulated data was derived section 3 4 describes the method by which the simulated rating curve was perturbed to make estimates of streamflow uncertainty under high flow conditions 3 1 hydrodynamic modelling 3 1 1 model setup the mike11 one dimensional hd model dhi 2009 was used to simulate the water level and streamflow in the

11 modelling can be performed across a floodplain using wide cross sections for preliminary assessment of the floodplain behaviour key model input data includes stream river network cross section geometry riverbed friction initial and boundary conditions manning s roughness coefficient n is the only calibrated term the other terms were parameterized through physical measurements key model output data include water level and velocity at the model cross section locations and discharge at the mid points between the successive cross sections in this study the model was setup for the entire flinders river network fig 1 for tully and murray rivers the river network was derived from the lidar light detection and ranging data which is a very high resolution topography data 1 m spatial resolution with vertical accuracy of 15 cm the resulting stream network model consists of 69 stream links a link is a section of a stream between two junctions 7 inflow sources that carry upper catchment runoff to the floodplain and 2 downstream water height boundaries the catchment was divided into a number of sub catchments based on land topography sub catchment boundaries and stream networks were generated using arc gis hydro tools smith and brough 2006 the nam hydrological model dhi 2008 was used to simulate rainfall generated runoff runoff for individual sub catchments was estimated separately and then propagated through sub catchments further downstream the nam was first calibrated against observed flow at headwater catchments regionalization method vaze et al 2011 was used to transfer the parameters to sub catchments within the study domain to generate runoff using the nam model the hydrographer s extrapolated discharge data were not used in the calibration the main calibration parameter was the surface roughness coefficient manning s n however stream bed elevations at junctions were slightly modified to rectify model warnings due to different bed levels of streams meeting at a junction the value of roughness coefficient was adjusted by trial and error basis until the best match was obtained between simulated and measured data determined when the summation of the root mean square deviations between measured and simulated values was minimum the flinders river catchment is a complicated system and inundation happens during floods the stream network was derived from the projected srtm and cross checked with the watercourses lines in the topographic mapping hydrography feature dataset from australian hydrological geospatial fabric ahgf a specialised geographic information system bom 2012 the srtm derived network agreed with the topographic mapping for the most part but some correction to flow direction was needed in the low lying flat areas where there is a lot of river braiding to ensure the dem derived stream lines for main rivers followed the channel path depicted in the topographic mapping a visual assessment of google earth pro imagery was used to identify the significant drainage lines in the landscape and select a subset of major rivers from the dem derived network to be used in the analysis cross section of each reach of a river network needs to be defined in one dimensional hydrodynamic modelling cross section data are only available at the stream gauges of the main rivers in the flinders and gilbert catchments the cross sections for different sections of the river network were initially derived from the 30 m resolution digital elevation model dem obtained from nasa s shuttle radar topography mission srtm farr and kobrick 2000 however by comparing the generated cross sections from the srtm dem with the measured cross sections at the gauging locations it was found that the cross section derived from the srtm 30 m dem did not represent the shape of the measured cross sections in the mid and lower part of the river networks in the flinders and gilbert catchments a four day field trip to the flinders and gilbert was undertaken by the hydrodynamic modelling team to survey the cross sections of the rivers in the floodplains of the two catchments during this trip the cross sections of different rivers at 56 locations that were accessible by roads were measured dutta et al 2013 for example fig 3 shows the photographs of two sites at the flinders and gilbert rivers respectively where cross section measurements were undertaken the surveyed data were used to update the cross sections derived from srtm dem for different sections of the river networks of the two catchments for one dimensional hydrodynamic modelling the field survey data allowed to well represent the cross section for most of the reaches the data were interpolated between the measured locations to cover the entire river network a schematic of the modelled river network is shown in fig 4 based on the locations of the streamflow gauging stations fig 4 sub catchment boundaries were generated using d8 technique tarboton et al 1991 based on flow direction and accumulation data generated from the dem sacramento rainfall runoff model burnash et al 1973 using daily silo gridded climate data jeffrey et al 2001 was used to simulate runoff in the headwater and ungauged catchments lerat et al 2013 the sacramento rainfall runoff model was calibrated using observed data at the headwater catchments of the basin the simulated runoff at the headwater catchments were used as the inflow boundary to the 1d hd model regionalization method vaze et al 2011 was used to transfer the parameters to sub catchments within the study domain to generate runoff using the sacramento rainfall runoff model routing of runoff water between individual sub catchments to the hydrodynamic model boundary was done using the mike 11 model the mike11 hd model was calibrated for a number of high flow events against the observed water levels recorded at 3 gauging stations for the period between 1980 and 2010 the observed water levels at different gauges at the start of the simulation was interpolated to be used as the initial water levels for different sections of the river network in 1d modelling the model was calibrated for a number of historical flood events by adjusting the manning s roughness coefficients for compound river cross sections in the model setup and simulation all input data for hd model was provided at a daily timestep hd model runs in sub daily timestep at multiple of seconds the input data are descritised by the hd model to sub daily scale to match the sub daily timestep of the model run the sub daily time step is adjusted by the model itself to satisfy the stability criteria the final results are aggregated to daily timestep for the model calibration and validation and to generate stage discharge relationship at daily timestep which is same as the time step of observed stage discharge relationship 3 1 2 model calibration the hd model calibration aimed to match the simulated and observed stage levels as closely as possible the selected rivers have been investigated through the so called flinders and gilbert agricultural resources assessment dutta et al 2013 and the performance of hd model has also been reported in karim et al 2014 and karim et al 2015 the results showed that the hydrodynamic model performed reasonably well in simulating stage height at gauging stations the timing of simulated flood peaks at different locations on the floodplain closely match the observed data details of the calibration and validation of the two river models are presented in karim et al 2015 from which it can be seen both the calibration and validation on water stage are reasonably well under both calibration and validation modes as a demonstration figs 5 and 6 compare the simulated and observed water levels for three different events used for the model calibration at gauging stations tully gauge id 113006a in tully river and walker bend gauge id 915003a at flinders river respectively as can be seen from fig 5 the simulated water level agreed well with the observed data for all three flood events from the start to the end of the flood events similar results were obtained at walker bend in flinders river as well fig 6 in particular the matching between the observed and simulated flood levels was highly satisfactory during the peak floods for different magnitude flood events it is understandable because the hd models were calibrated by observed water levels which are measured over time 3 2 criteria used to assess hd model performance the focus of this study was to use a hd model to simulate the stage discharge relationship at high flow over bank events for this reason a predefined stage height threshold h t was adopted above which the observed rating curve was revised using the hd model although the hd model simulates all the daily stage and flows the assessment of the hd model was only made for simulated water levels above ht to evaluate the performance of the hd model when the observed stage heights are above the predefined threshold h t four statistics were employed in this study these were the correlation coefficient r coefficient of efficiency ens model biases bias and the ratio of simulated and observed standard deviation rs and are defined for stage heights as 3 r 1 i 1 n h o i h o h s i h s i 1 n h o i h o 2 i 1 n h s i h s 2 4 e ns 1 i 1 n h o i h s i 2 i 1 n h o i h o 2 5 bias 1 n i 1 n h s i h o i and 6 rs i 1 n h s i h s 2 i 1 n h o i h o 2 respectively where h o i 1 n h o i n and h s i 1 n h s i n are the average of the observed and simulated stage heights respectively with h o i and h s i i 1 2 n being the observed and simulated stage heights respectively at time step i and n is the number of time steps with the observed stage heights above the predefined stage height threshold h t in statistics r with the range between 0 and 1 represents how well a linear model describes the relationship between two variables ens with the values of less than one reflects how well the hd model simulates observed daily stage heights the model bias quantifies the systematic departure of the simulated stage heights from the observed stage heights and the ratio of standard deviation rs of the modelled and observed daily stage heights provides a measure of the degree of dispersion of variables hundecha and bárdossy 2008 the same criteria were used to assess the performance of the hd model at simulating observed discharges at the time when the corresponding observed stage height are above the predefined threshold h t 3 3 developing a simulated stage discharge relationship under high flow conditions 3 3 1 simulating a rating curve above a stage height threshold the first step was to construct a rating curve based on the simulated stage and flow data using the one dimensional unsteady hd model section 3 1 for a given water stage above the threshold ht the discharge can vary for different stage values with the following power relationship 7 q s g h s θ s a s h s c s b s with θ s a s b s c s being the vector of model parameters for the data simulated using the hd model in the present model setting c s h t is required in the eq 7 to enable the temporal variation of the stage discharge relationship hydrographers often produce a set of rating curves each covering different periods of time see table 1 it is widely noted that the flow residuals in the resulted stage discharge relationship are not well described by a normal distribution petheram et al 2008 making the least squares method in parameter estimation less efficient see for example cox and hinkley 1968 in order to take account of the heterogeneous variation in residuals at different stage levels we used the both side box cox regression as described in eqs 8 10 8 t q s λ t g h s θ s λ s ε to stablise the residual ε so that with a proper choice of parameter λ the resulted residuals are independent and identically distributed as a normal distribution with mean of zero and standard deviation σ rc here 9 t x λ s x λ s 1 λ s λ s 0 log x λ s 0 is the box cox transformation with inverse transformation 10 t 1 x λ s λ s x 1 1 λ s λ 0 exp x λ 0 this method for transforming data to fit a normal distribution was first investigated by wood 1974 and carroll and ruppert 1984 in statistics and was discussed in details in carroll and ruppert 1988 shao et al 2014 successfully applied this transformation in the uncertainty evaluation in streamflow data in the flinders catchment although it is possible to use different transformation on stage and discharge to achieve possibly better fitting in the statistical sense we do not tend to recommend this here because our both side transformation retains the traditionally used stage discharge relationship in 7 when trying to stabilize the residual as close to the normal distribution as possible in fact the original empirical stage discharge relationship in eq 7 has been used widely and approved work well and the both side box cox transformation includes the weighted least squares method as a special case shao et al 2014 therefore it is not our intention to revise such a relationship 3 3 2 adjusting the simulated rating curve to ensure continuity with the observed rating curve at threshold height ht if there are no stage discharge measurements at high stages it is not possible to assess the systematic departure of the simulated rating curve from the observed rating curve under the assumption see the results for its rationality that the systematic departure of the simulated rating curve is similar to the departure of the observed discharge at the threshold stage ht it is possible to correct the departure of the simulated rating curve by adjusting it so that continuity is achieved with the existing rating curve at the threshold stage ht to do this one can either impose a constraint in the calibration of the simulated rating curve or impose a constraint on the discharge post process in practice it was found that the post bias correction approach using eqs 9 and 10 are easy to implement and robust there are two constraints that can be implemented in post process i through a shift vertically so that the bias corrected rating curve is given by 11 q s add a s h t c s b s δ q with 12 δ q q t a s h t c s b s or ii by a proportional adjustment so that the bias corrected rating curve is given by 13 q s mul a s h t c s b s xq with 14 xq q t a s h t c s b s both options will be examined in the case study 3 4 estimating uncertainty under high flow conditions quantifying the uncertainty in the simulated rating curve is complicated by the nonlinearity in the stage discharge relationship caused by the nonlinear rating curve function eq 7 and the two side box cox regression eq 8 because the two side box cox regression model in the rating curve construction tends to generate homogeneous residuals the bootstrap method introduced by efron 1979 was used to assess the model parameter uncertainty due to its simplicity and robustness the bootstrap method is powerful for deriving statistical uncertainty and has been successfully used in hydrological research see for example li et al 2010 selle and hannah 2010 shao et al 2012 2014 the great advantage of bootstrap is its simplicity although the two side box cox aims to achieve normality in residuals the normal residuals cannot be guaranteed and are approximately reached in fact the normality is a very strong assumption and distribution free approaches are always preferred if possible another great advantage of bootstrap is that it is asymptotically more accurate than other approaches using normality assumption diciccio and efron 1996 therefore the bootstrap is adopted here while the empirical distribution based on ε i i 1 2 n is used to quantify the model uncertainty the parameter uncertainty can be assessed as follows let θ s λ s denote the estimate of model parameters θ s λ s 1 randomly resample the model residuals ε i i 1 2 n with replacement to form a new residual series ε i b i 1 2 n here b denotes the b th bootstrap

with bootstrapped parameter values derived from steps 1 4 and an empirical residual based on resampling 6 adjust the streamflow value q s either vertically by eq 11 or proportionally by eq 13 it will be seen that the vertical adjustment is appropriate in our case study in the above bootstrap procedure parameter c was treated as fixed because it is a constant which was added only for best rating curve fitting 4 results 4 1 assessing the applicability of hd model fig 7 provides the relationships between the observations and simulations at station 113006a it can be seen that the observed and simulated stages agreed with each other very well fig 7 a with excellent criterion values with the values of r ens and rs closing to one and therefore reported as 1 small bias see table 2 it is possible in simulation because the hd model was calibrated against water stage which all were assumed to be accurate however the simulated discharges did not agree with the observed ones see fig 7 b it can be seen that the simulated discharges were generally larger than the observed ones resulting in the smaller coefficient of efficiency ens 0 85 positive bias bias 18 64 and large value of deviation ratio rs 1 30 while the correlation is high r 0 98 therefore the simulated discharges still need to be corrected fig 7 c and d plot the observed discharge against observed stage in the original and log scales respectively together with all the rating tables used to derive the discharge values it can be seen that the rating tables changed only at the lower stage values around 2 5 m and were identical for the high stage values fig 7 e and f also plot the simulated discharge against simulated stage in the original and log scales respectively together with all the rating tables used to derived the discharge values it can be seen that the simulated discharges were similar to the observed ones but departure from the rating tables at high stage values however it should be noted that there was no observed stage discharges and to verify the simulation for station 915003a table 2 provides the statistics summarizing the performance of the hd simulation during different rating periods and fig 8 provides the plots of the simulated stages and discharges against their corresponding observations it can be seen that the simulated stages have quite high correlation with the observations over 0 92 but relatively low coefficients of efficiency over 0 69 meaning that corrections are needed overall the simulated stages generally overestimate the observations with positive biases however the simulation of discharge is not as good as the simulation of stage with slightly smaller correlation between 0 82 and 0 90 and coefficient of efficiency between 0 64 and 0 78 and larger bias the results are not surprising because the hd model was calibrated against stage values rather than discharge values it can be seen from fig 8 that the stage simulation are not accurate at lower stage levels this is likely to be because in channels with sandy beds the stage discharge relationship at low stage levels can change considerably between seasons and even within seasons variation in such fine scale topographic information is not captured by the hd model and changes in channel bedform do not impact on the stage discharge relationship at mid to high stage levels the discharge simulation at lower stages does not agree with the observations well but is reasonable this was not unexpected either because the hd model was mainly calibrated against the observed water levels covering mid and higher flow ranges by adjusting the roughness coefficient thus the calibrated roughness coefficient was not suitable to simulate low flow before using the hd model to synthetically generate rating curves and assess the uncertainty in the stage discharge relationship it is important to further assess the robustness of the hd model fig 9 presents the plots of the simulated discharges against the simulated stages together with the hydrographer s rating curve for each rating period it can be seen that the simulated stage discharge relationships do not always agree with the corresponding hydrographer s rating curves however it is interesting to see that the simulated stage flow relationships are quite stable with reasonably good agreement at reasonably high stages see the scatter plot of simulated stage against simulated discharges in fig 9 even though the simulation does not agree with observations well see the scatter plot of simulated discharge against observed discharges in fig 8 4 2 simulated rating curve and its uncertainty given that the hd model performs satisfactorily at mid to high stages it is possible to use the simulated stage and discharge values to revise the hydrographer s historical discharges beyond the last stage discharge measurement where extrapolation occurs the threshold ht where construction of the simulated rating curve commenced was visually assigned at a stage height beyond which the simulated stage discharge relationship is considered as stable 4 2 1 station 113006a for station 113006a given that we only obtained the hydrographer s rating curves but not discharge measurement at this station and believed that the historical discharge observations were derived from the rating tables which were generally extrapolated with validation by high flow values we will derive a rating curve based on the simulated data for the stage above 3 9 m which is the third highest rating point beyond which the historical rating tables were identical and all the rating periods were considered together the parameter estimates for the rating curve based on the hd model are given in table 3 the fitted rating curves with and without box cox variance are similar in the data range although the parameter values are different the plots are not provided because it does not provide much useful information the residuals for the rating curve with and without the box cox variance stabilization are given in fig 10 from which it can be seen that heterogeneity appeared in the residuals by nonlinear least squares fig 10a but the use of the box cox variance stabilization was effective at normalizing the variance fig 10b the parameter estimates can be used to generate as many ensembles as needed instead of revealing the individual ensembles we provide the theoretical 95 confidence envelope of the ensembles in fig 11 together with the simulated stage discharge data and hydrographer s rating curves used to generate the historical discharges it can be seen that both the vertical and proportional adjustments perform similarly and have reasonable agreement with the historical data represented by the hydrographer s rating curves in conclusion the rating curve based on simulated stage discharge data provide a way to adjust the historical discharges with uncertainty estimation see table 4 4 2 2 station 915003a given that the hd model can reasonably simulates steady stage discharge relationship for mid and high flows see fig 10 we construct the simulated rating curve above a stage threshold table 1 and fig 9 were used to guide the selection of the threshold ht after carefully examining the relationships shown in figs 8 and 9 we fixed the threshold stage at h t 1 100 see table 1 the parameter estimates for the rating curve based on the hd model are given in table 3 and the fitted curves for individual rating periods are given in fig 12 the residuals for the rating curve with and without the box cox variance stabilization are given in fig 13 although the nonlinear least squares appears to capture the stage flow relationship without the box cox variance stabilization fig 12 the residuals do not fit a normal distribution consequently the use of the box cox variance stabilization is required and can be seen to be effective at normalizing the variance fig 13 furthermore there is a greater variation in parameter values between different rating curves without stabilizing the variance than there is when the variance is stabilized again the parameter estimates can be used to generate as many ensembles as required instead of revealing the individual ensembles we provide the theoretical 95 confidence envelope of the ensembles in fig 14 together with the simulated stage discharge data and hydrographer s rating curves used to generate the historical discharges it can be seen that the vertical adjustment outperformed the proportional adjustment in particular the hydrographer s rating curves were not within the uncertainty envelopes of the simulated rating curves for proportional adjustment in rating 13 and 14 therefore we use the vertical adjustment in this station from now for the vertical adjustment the hydrographer s rating curves were within the uncertainty envelopes of the simulated rating curves for rating periods 13 and 14 the simulated rating curves are similar to the rating curve extrapolated by the hydrographer however the simulated rating curves are slightly below the hydrographer s curve for rating periods 15 and 16 close inspection of the data revealed that the simulated discharge values were usually smaller than the corresponding historical values see the scatter plots in fig 9 note that the flinders catchment is frequently inundated during flood events especially in recent years the hydrographer s rating curve may not work well if only a linear extrapolation was used in fact the bias correction in shao et al 2014 also found that the hydrographer s rating curve frequently suffers from overestimation at large values and the historical discharges should be reduced from the results we can see that the uncertainty based on the simulated rating curve is reasonably small if the simulated stages and discharges can form a stable relationship e g ratings 13 and 14 however the simulated rating curve is subject to a large uncertainty if the hd model does not produce a good representation of discharge i e the simulated discharges vary greatly for a given stage value e g ratings 15 and 16 resulting in a large uncertainty when being applied to the historical discharge series nevertheless the historical discharges tend to fall in the 95 uncertainty envelope derived from the simulated rating curve with vertical adjustment 5 conclusions and a discussion in this paper the performance of a hd model to simulate discharge was re assessed as a precursor to developing a procedure for simulating stage discharge relationships rating curves under high flow conditions and quantifying the associated uncertainty it was found that the simulated stage discharge relationship was usually in good agreement with the hydrographer s rating curve used to derive the historical discharge time series for mid to high flows this was not unexpected and was consistent with many previous studies because the hd model was calibrated against the stage data only during high flows however note that the correlation between the simulated and historical discharge values was weaker than that for simulated and historical stages as the hd model considers more factors such as the previous stage and discharges in the discharge simulation considerable uncertainties can be introduced in converting stage data to discharge when simulated stage discharge data are used to construct the simulated rating curve there is a potential to evaluate the uncertainties in the historical discharge data series provided that one is confident about the accuracy of the hd model in simulating flow values in high flow periods and events in order to quantify the uncertainty in the simulated rating curve the both side box cox transformation was adopted to obtain stable residuals in the model calibration the uncertainty estimation was then constructed by a bootstrapping procedure note that the simulated rating curve was derived from the simulated stage and discharge values for the stages above a pre defined threshold an adjustment was needed to ensure the continuity at the threshold it was found that a vertical adjustment was an appropriate approach the proposed simulated rating curve based on hd model has a good agreement with hydrographer s rating curve in stable river channel station 113006a in tully river of queensland australia however in a complicated river system such as frequent flood inundation the proposed rating curve can produce large uncertainty because hydrographer s rating curve may not work well if only a linear extrapolation was used a comprehensive revision of historical discharge data based on hydrographer s rating curve may be needed by for example identifying new set of rating periods and rating curves from simulated stage discharge relationship furthermore as the simulated stage discharge by hd model only reliable for high stage discharge levels in this paper we only constructed the simulated rating curves for high stage levels above a pre defined threshold which is beyond the discharge measurements and therefore only derived the uncertainties for the corresponding historical discharge at high stage discharge levels however in many gauging stations there usually some actual stage discharge measurements are mostly available at the lower stage levels it should be interesting to combine the measured stage discharge data at low flow and the simulated stage discharge data by hd model for high flow to construct a single rating curve for the entire

7548,the thermal regime of rivers plays an important role in the overall health and composition of aquatic ecosystems and together with flow is recognised as one of the most influential abiotic drivers of aquatic ecosystem processes affecting species distribution changes in thermal conditions in aquatic systems are driven by on going human induced climate change hydrological regional and structural factors here we quantified the impact of instream impoundments on the natural longitudinal connectivity and estimated thermal vulnerability of catchments based on the functional relationship between changing temperature and the profile gradient of rivers in the eastern portion of south africa we identified catchments that are most vulnerable to thermal stress based on cold water adapted species tolerance to thermal changes more than half of all studied catchments include rivers that are relatively intact longitudinally with notable exceptions being rivers in the central portion of the study area thermal condition of high elevation sites is more heavily impacted by impoundments and consequently thermal vulnerability of these sites are higher blephariceridae and

water temperature changes in the province of kwazulu natal kzn south africa this riverscape was chosen because of its high proportion in levels of water yield aquatic species richness and endemism in south africa rivers moore et al 2007 it therefore provides a useful template to draw inferences on vulnerability and resilience of selected aquatic macroinvertebrate families because of topographically and climatically diverse landscape and well studied longitudinal river disconnectivity rivers moore et al 2007 2016 these assessments will provide a holistic screening process for further refining priority catchments already identified in freshwater conservation plans our aims in this study were to 1 quantify the impact of instream impoundments on natural longitudinal connectivity 2 identify the catchments most vulnerable to water temperature changes and 3 highlight aquatic macroinvertebrate families that are likely to be vulnerable to changes in water temperature

26 50 and 31 10 south of the equator and between 28 50 and 32 50 east of the prime meridian line eeley et al 1999 the rivers of kzn flow through a climatically and topographically diverse landscape

c eeley et al 1999 for this assessment 2nd order streams strahler 1952 were selected as large impoundments are unlikely to occur in first order streams fig 1 2 2 applicable datasets measurements of the connectivity index and vulnerability of rivers to thermal change was based on spatial data layers of instream dams weirs and waterfalls fig 1 to account for mapping inaccuracies between 1 500 000 rivers and impoundments at a 1 50 000 scale a 50 m buffer was defined around each impoundment such that if the buffer intersected a river line then an instream barrier was assigned un impounded free flowing rivers were verified through using google earth we also acknowledge that natural waterfalls have positive impacts on rivers as they can act as barriers to upstream migration of alien species karssing et al 2012 nevertheless waterfalls were considered barriers as they equally impede the mobility of native species quaternary catchments were used for the calculation of connectivity and vulnerability quaternary catchments defines areas with uniform hydrological characteristics and the primary water planning units in south africa driver et al 2011 the spatial scale of rivers used was 1 500 000 and this layer included attributes such as stream order ecoregion type and status geographic zone flow variability and stream length driver et al 2011 dwa 2005 instream dams weirs and waterfalls were used to assess the impact of impoundments on longitudinal connectivity and thermal regimes of a stream caissie 2006 dla cdsm 2005 poff and zimmerman 2010 family level distribution data for aquatic macroinvertebrates were extracted from the river health programme rhp database dallas et al 2007 the rhp dataset for kzn included 23 natural undisturbed sites out of the 1041 monitoring sites across varying substrate components rocks boulders cobbles gravel sand fine sediment and woody debris snags and elevation collected over 10 years 2 3 impact of impoundments on longitudinal connectivity the degree of impact of instream impoundments on flow was quantified using the total cumulative score of these obstacles to a rivers longitudinal connectivity at a quaternary catchment scale rivers moore et al 2016 the impact score rating for instream impoundments are adopted from the australian instream impoundment weight scoring index because of the similarities in flow patterns between australian and south african rivers chiew et al 1995 stein et al 2002 cumulative impact scores for instream impoundments were assigned on a 0 1 scale as 1 0 0 6 0 3 and 0 1 for dams canals weirs and waterfalls respectively the longitudinal connectivity index lci was calculated as a product of the total impact score per quaternary catchment divided by the maximum score of the overall observed impact eq 1 rivers moore et al 2016 the lci uses the highest impact score max score observed for a catchment as a benchmark for a worst case scenario longitudinal disturbance to standardize all other catchment scores to range between 0 and 1 catchments with a score value of 0 are well connected while catchments with a score of 1 were highly disconnected longitudinally results were presented on the basis of natural breakpoints between score classes 1 longitudinal connectivity index lci i 1 n barrier weights max score 2 4 assessing thermal vulnerability of upstream reaches the most pragmatic approach of relating the lci to conservation planning goal is to identify zones that are thermally vulnerable to climate change effects this was done using the rate of thermal change in response to changes in stream gradient we studied downstream to upstream thermal vulnerability by quantifying temperature changes along an elevational gradient in the umzimkhulu river fig 1 mean annual water temperature was measured at three elevations 6 977 and 1430 m a s l respectively approximately 9 109 and 137 km upstream of a river s mouth thermal vulnerability was then used as a base layer in assessing thermal resilience of catchments in 13 streams with varying elevational gradients in kzn rates of elevation change in river profiles were used as a surrogate for vulnerability based on the fact that temperature changes are more rapid with steeper gradients the gradient of a stream was measured as the highest point minus lowest point divided by the longest distance minus the shortest distance of the river streams with an elevation gradient greater than the average elevation gradient for the 13 streams selected were considered to have high vulnerability to thermal change heino et al 2009 sheldon 2012 rieman and isaak 2010 thermal resilience was measured as the product of thermal vulnerability and lci eq 2 such that a well connected river with a low elevation gradient is less thermally vulnerable and would have high thermal resilience we also distinguished between moderate and low thermal resilience streams with low thermal resilience are very disconnected and highly vulnerable thermally while moderate thermal resilient streams could be well connected but with high thermal vulnerability or highly disconnected but less thermally vulnerable fig 2 2 thermal resilience thermal vulnerability lci 2 5 thermal vulnerability of cold adapted families and catchment conservation priorities to estimate the vulnerability or risk where resilience is low of cold water families this study used thermophily degree of preference for high or low temperature for a subset of macroinvertebrates families occurring in kzn rivers the estimate of thermophily of aquatic macroinvertebrate families was undertaken for seven families notonomouridae plecoptera philopotomidae trichoptera paramelitidae amphipoda blephariceridae diptera simuliidae diptera heptageniidae ephemeroptera and gyrinidae coleoptera including six ranked as thermally sensitive thermal sensitivity rank tsr 1 and one as thermally tolerant tsr 3 macroinvertebrate families used include thermophily is a product of the mean instantaneous temperature itmean associated with samples in which that family was detected divided by mean water temperature wtmean of all samples chessman 2012 eq 3 tsr values were derived from experimentally generated critical thermal maxima values dallas and rivers moore 2012 spot water temperature data at sites where these families were present in kzn rivers were extracted from the rhp database dallas et al 2007 the mean water temperature of 17 95 c was generated from all nationwide sites 5302 where aquatic macroinvertebrate samples were collected during the rhp families with lower estimates of thermophily were considered thermophobic while families with greater estimates were thermorphilic dallas et al 2007 thermophily was calculated as the ratio of thermophilic warm adapted to thermophobic cold adapted organisms and this was compared between sites 3 thermophily itmean wtmean catchment conservation priority ccp is the sum of the availability of thermophobic taxa and thermal resilience in catchments eq 4 systems with high ccp indicative of the presence of thermophobic family in catchments with low to moderate thermal resilience are earmarked as hotspots for freshwater conservation planning 4 catchment conservation priority thermophobic taxa thermal resilience 3 results 3 1 impact of impoundments on longitudinal connectivity a total of 275 instream barriers were recorded along 7900 km of rivers of stream order class 2 at a mapping scale of 1 500 000 extending over 214 quaternary catchments our assessments showed that longitudinal connectivity generally decreased with increasing stream order only 27 of total river length with average length of 45 km had undisturbed free flowing conditions with most of them being small tributaries figs 1 and 3 more than half 66 37 of all quaternary catchments contained rivers with low lci well connected impact scores of between 0 00 and 0 05 fig 4 most of the natural catchments were found in the southernmost and central regions of kzn the highest disturbance class contained 2 3 of all catchments and include the lower and middle sections of the umngeni and tugela river the entire length of the umngeni river has a total of four clustered large dams and also other instream impoundment factors weirs and waterfalls contributing to an unstandardized cumulative disconnectivity impact score of 7 5 3 2 resilience of catchments to thermal change the mean profile gradient of the 13 high elevation streams that were used to assess the thermal vulnerability and resilience of streams was 5 29 which represents the thermal vulnerability threshold i e streams with an elevation gradient less than the overall mean elevation gradient were considered less vulnerable to thermal changes six streams that are least vulnerable to increasing temperatures are found in the lowlands of the central and northern parts of kzn table 1 of the 13 streams one had the lowest profile gradient of 2 02 and was therefore the least thermally vulnerable stream seven streams had elevation gradients exceeding the 5 29 mean profile gradient amongst them the mdloti river was the most vulnerable to thermal change in the kzn province with an elevation gradient of 11 05 table 1 all seven of these thermally vulnerable streams are found in the southern parts of kzn which consist mostly of a diverse range of landscapes regarding resilience two streams had the lowest thermal resilience these two streams descend from the drakensberg highland areas and have both recorded a high lci score impounding of these two streams further reduces the downstream upstream routes of organisms and poses a great threat to cold water specialized families more than half of assessed streams 8 of 13 had moderate resilience to thermal change these streams either exhibited high lci scores or a high vulnerability status to thermal change due to a high elevational gradient the remaining three streams are highly resilient with low lci scores and low thermal vulnerability 3 3 vulnerability of cold water adapted families and catchment conservation priorities thermophily of macroinvertebrate families assessed varied between 0 79 and 1 00 table 2 the most thermophobic taxa included blephariceridae and notonemouridae with a mean instantaneous temperature of 14 3 c and 14 8 c and estimate of thermophily of 0 79 and 0 82 respectively gyrinidae simuliidae and heptageniidae were the most thermophilic family with estimate of thermophily at 1 00 0 97 and 0 96 respectively two catchment areas were identified as having high conservation priority viz the headwater reaches of both the mkomazi and umngeni rivers table 1 both these catchments have records for at least one thermophobic family fig 5 4 discussion the existing baseline freshwater conservation plan for the kzn region identifies priority areas based on the irreplaceability of freshwater biodiversity and vulnerability of surface water yield zones to anticipated land use threats within the province rivers moore et al 2011 rivers moore et al 2016 proposed the use of a connectivity index layer to complement these criteria in setting priorities for conservation and rehabilitation of kzn rivers the current study extends the utility value of the lci by including both thermal vulnerability and the proportion of thermophobic taxa to refine selection criteria based on these criteria two rivers umngeni and mkomazi had high conservation priority both had high thermal vulnerabilities and hosted thermophobic taxa the umngeni also falls within the 2 3 of all catchments that recorded the highest disconnectivity score lci disconnected catchments are a great threat to potential compensatory migration of thermal affected taxa to higher elevations or any other refuge chessman 2012 the incorporation of the thermal vulnerability assessment of sensitive taxa to the existing conservation plans is a useful technique to identify priorities at finer scales modern day frameworks for prioritizing conservation hotspots are based on two critical areas of concern viz landscape conservation capacity and vulnerability to climate change khamis et al 2014b with little consideration of dimensions of stream connectivity and taxonomic response extending the current conservation initiatives to include all three criteria disconnectivity thermal vulnerability and thermophoby would allow for priorities to address specific threats wilson et al 2007 also the process of monitoring and maintaining the river s ability to adapt to change using iterative adaptive management principles is an ideal approach for dealing with the uncertainties surrounding future climatic conditions and future climate impacts rivers moore et al 2007 pace et al 2013 here we embed the areas of high conservation priority as indicated by the inclusive assessment of this study to the existing priority areas for freshwater planning which based on their conservation importance for kzn fig 6 as assessed and identified by rivers moore et al 2011 in the most affected river the umngeni of this study in terms of its high thermal vulnerability low thermal resistance and low longitudinal connectivity score falls within the priority planning areas of rivers moore et al 2011 and this shows the extent to which the holistic approach of this study can identify finer scale priority areas we believe that adding the aspects of thermal vulnerability of rivers longitudinal connectivity and sensitive taxa to the existing conservation planning assessments contribute towards an improved management and decision marking tool fig 6 however a major challenge for this technique is an inadequacy of long term data for freshwater invertebrates at finer spatial and taxonomic scales taxonomic data will enable setting quantitative conservation targets which in turn provide a base for an assessment of the conservation value of an area rivers moore et al 2011 it is also worth noting that connectivity of rivers goes beyond just a single longitudinal dimension to cover a range of lateral vertical and temporal dimensions enabling full consideration of ecological processes freeman et al 2007 the approach presented here requires minimal consideration of dispersal abilities life history and habitat requirements of taxa concerned and strengthens conservation planning at the level of decision making by identifying tipping points in the aquatic systems the use of macroinvertebrate families in modeling thermal vulnerability and thermal

drivers of aquatic ecosystem processes affecting species distribution changes in thermal conditions in aquatic systems are driven by on going human induced climate change hydrological regional and structural factors here we quantified the impact of instream impoundments on the natural longitudinal connectivity and estimated thermal vulnerability of catchments based on the functional relationship between changing temperature and the profile gradient of rivers in the eastern portion of south africa we identified catchments that are most vulnerable to thermal stress based on cold water adapted species tolerance to thermal changes more than half of all studied catchments include rivers that are relatively intact longitudinally with notable exceptions being rivers in the central portion of the study area thermal condition of high elevation sites is more heavily impacted by impoundments and consequently thermal vulnerability of these sites are higher blephariceridae and

water temperature changes in the province of kwazulu natal kzn south africa this riverscape was chosen because of its high proportion in levels of water yield aquatic species richness and endemism in south africa rivers moore et al 2007 it therefore provides a useful template to draw inferences on vulnerability and resilience of selected aquatic macroinvertebrate families because of topographically and climatically diverse landscape and well studied longitudinal river disconnectivity rivers moore et al 2007 2016 these assessments will provide a holistic screening process for further refining priority catchments already identified in freshwater conservation plans our aims in this study were to 1 quantify the impact of instream impoundments on natural longitudinal connectivity 2 identify the catchments most vulnerable to water temperature changes and 3 highlight aquatic macroinvertebrate families that are likely to be vulnerable to changes in water temperature 2 material and methods 2 1 study area rivers in the province of kwazulu natal in the eastern portion of south africa were selected for this study the province covers an area of some 92 000 km2 between 26 50 and 31 10 south of the equator and between 28 50 and 32 50 east of the prime meridian line eeley et al 1999 the rivers of kzn flow through a climatically and topographically diverse landscape these rivers provide habitat for many aquatic associated macroinvertebrates amphibians reptiles and fish species including at least 26 endemic species some of which are endangered and critically endangered rivers moore et al 2007 2011 kzn has the second highest number of flagship rivers in south africa prioritised for the retention of their natural and undisturbed status driver et al 2011 mean annual precipitation ranges from around 2000 mm to as low as 550 mm in the drier and lower lying valley regions lynch 2004 while mean air temperature in winter can be as low as 0 4 c in high lying areas it varies considerably towards the in dry lower lying areas of kzn grab and simpson 2000 schulze et al 2005 mean air temperature during the mid summer months for the entire province is 28 c eeley et al 1999 for this assessment 2nd order streams strahler 1952 were selected as large impoundments are unlikely to occur in first order streams fig 1 2 2 applicable datasets measurements of the connectivity index and vulnerability of rivers to thermal change was based on spatial data layers of instream dams weirs and waterfalls fig 1 to account for mapping inaccuracies between 1 500 000 rivers and impoundments at a 1 50 000 scale a 50 m buffer was defined around each impoundment such that if the buffer intersected a river line then an instream barrier was assigned un impounded free flowing rivers were verified through using google earth we also acknowledge that natural waterfalls have positive impacts on rivers as they can act as barriers to upstream migration of alien species karssing et al 2012 nevertheless waterfalls were considered barriers as they equally impede the mobility of native species quaternary catchments were used for the calculation of connectivity and vulnerability quaternary catchments defines areas with uniform hydrological characteristics and the primary water planning units in south africa driver et al 2011 the spatial scale of rivers used was 1 500 000 and this layer included attributes such as stream order ecoregion type and status geographic zone flow variability and stream length driver et al 2011 dwa 2005 instream dams weirs and waterfalls were used to assess the impact of impoundments on longitudinal connectivity and thermal regimes of a stream caissie 2006 dla cdsm 2005 poff and zimmerman 2010 family level distribution data for aquatic macroinvertebrates were extracted from the river health programme rhp database dallas et al 2007 the rhp dataset for kzn included 23 natural undisturbed sites out of the 1041 monitoring sites across varying substrate components rocks boulders cobbles gravel sand fine sediment and woody debris snags and elevation collected over 10 years 2 3 impact of impoundments on longitudinal connectivity the degree of impact of instream impoundments on flow was quantified using the total cumulative score of these obstacles to a rivers longitudinal connectivity at a quaternary catchment scale rivers moore et al 2016 the impact score rating for instream impoundments are adopted from the australian instream impoundment weight scoring index because of the similarities in flow patterns between australian and south african rivers chiew et al 1995 stein et al 2002 cumulative impact scores for instream impoundments were assigned on a 0 1 scale as 1 0 0 6 0 3 and 0 1 for dams canals weirs and waterfalls respectively the longitudinal connectivity index lci was calculated as a product of the total impact score per quaternary catchment divided by the maximum score of the overall observed impact eq 1 rivers moore et al 2016 the lci uses the highest impact score max score observed for a catchment as a benchmark for a worst case scenario longitudinal disturbance to standardize all other catchment scores to range between 0 and 1 catchments with a score value of 0 are well connected while catchments with a score of 1 were highly disconnected longitudinally results were presented on the basis of natural breakpoints between score classes 1 longitudinal connectivity index lci i 1 n barrier weights max score 2 4 assessing thermal vulnerability of upstream reaches the most pragmatic approach of relating the lci to conservation planning goal is to identify zones that are thermally vulnerable to climate change effects this was done using the rate of thermal change in response to changes in stream gradient we studied downstream to upstream thermal vulnerability by quantifying temperature changes along an elevational gradient in the umzimkhulu river fig 1 mean annual water temperature was measured at three elevations 6 977 and 1430 m a s l respectively approximately 9 109 and 137 km upstream of a river s mouth thermal vulnerability was then used as a base layer in assessing thermal resilience of catchments in 13 streams with varying elevational gradients in kzn rates of elevation change in river profiles were used as a surrogate for vulnerability based on the fact that temperature changes are more rapid with steeper gradients the gradient of a stream was measured as the highest point minus lowest point divided by the longest distance minus the shortest distance of the river streams with an elevation gradient greater than the average elevation gradient for the 13 streams selected were considered to have high vulnerability to thermal change heino et al 2009 sheldon 2012 rieman and isaak 2010 thermal resilience was measured as the product of thermal vulnerability and lci eq 2 such that a well connected river with a low elevation gradient is less thermally vulnerable and would have high thermal resilience we also distinguished between moderate and low thermal resilience streams with low thermal resilience are very disconnected and highly vulnerable thermally while moderate thermal resilient streams could be well connected but with high thermal vulnerability or highly disconnected but less thermally vulnerable fig 2 2 thermal resilience thermal vulnerability lci 2 5 thermal vulnerability of cold adapted families and catchment conservation priorities to estimate the vulnerability or risk where resilience is low of cold water families this study used thermophily degree of preference for high or low temperature for a subset of macroinvertebrates families occurring in kzn rivers the estimate of thermophily of aquatic macroinvertebrate families was undertaken for seven families notonomouridae plecoptera philopotomidae trichoptera paramelitidae amphipoda blephariceridae diptera simuliidae diptera heptageniidae ephemeroptera and gyrinidae coleoptera including six ranked as thermally sensitive thermal sensitivity rank tsr 1 and one as thermally tolerant tsr 3 macroinvertebrate families used include thermophily is a product of the mean instantaneous temperature itmean associated with samples in which that family was detected divided by mean water temperature wtmean of all samples chessman 2012 eq 3 tsr values were derived from experimentally generated critical thermal maxima values dallas and rivers moore 2012 spot water temperature data at sites where these families were present in kzn rivers were extracted from the rhp database dallas et al 2007 the mean water temperature of 17 95 c was generated from all nationwide sites 5302 where aquatic macroinvertebrate samples were collected during the rhp families with lower estimates of thermophily were considered thermophobic while families with greater estimates were thermorphilic dallas et al 2007 thermophily was calculated as the ratio of thermophilic warm adapted to thermophobic cold adapted organisms and this was compared between sites 3 thermophily itmean wtmean catchment conservation priority ccp is the sum of the availability of thermophobic taxa and thermal resilience in catchments eq 4 systems with high ccp indicative of the presence of thermophobic family in catchments with low to moderate thermal resilience are earmarked as hotspots for freshwater conservation planning 4 catchment conservation priority thermophobic taxa thermal resilience 3 results 3 1 impact of impoundments on longitudinal connectivity a total of 275 instream barriers were recorded along 7900 km of rivers of stream order class 2 at a mapping scale of 1 500 000 extending over 214 quaternary catchments our assessments showed that longitudinal connectivity generally decreased with increasing stream order only 27 of total river length with average length of 45 km had undisturbed free flowing conditions with most of them being small tributaries figs 1 and 3 more than half 66 37 of all quaternary catchments contained rivers with low lci well connected impact scores of between 0 00 and 0 05 fig 4 most of the natural catchments were found in the southernmost and central regions of kzn the highest disturbance class contained 2 3 of all catchments and include the lower and middle sections of the umngeni and tugela river the entire length of the umngeni river has a total of four clustered large dams and also other instream impoundment factors weirs and waterfalls contributing to an unstandardized cumulative disconnectivity impact score of 7 5 3 2 resilience of catchments to thermal change the mean profile gradient of the 13 high elevation streams that were used to assess the thermal vulnerability and resilience of streams was 5 29 which represents the thermal vulnerability threshold i e streams with an elevation gradient less than the overall mean elevation gradient were considered less vulnerable to thermal changes six streams that are least vulnerable to increasing temperatures are found in the lowlands of the central and northern parts of kzn table 1 of the 13 streams one had the lowest profile gradient of 2 02 and was therefore the least thermally vulnerable stream seven streams had elevation gradients exceeding the 5 29 mean profile gradient amongst them the mdloti river was the most vulnerable to thermal change in the kzn province with an elevation gradient of 11 05 table 1 all seven of these thermally vulnerable streams are found in the southern parts of kzn which consist mostly of a diverse range of landscapes regarding resilience two streams had the lowest thermal resilience these two streams descend from the drakensberg highland areas and have both recorded a high lci score impounding of these two streams further reduces the downstream upstream routes of organisms and poses a great threat to cold water specialized families more than half of assessed streams 8 of 13 had moderate resilience to thermal change these streams either exhibited high lci scores or a high vulnerability status to thermal change due to a high elevational gradient the remaining three streams are highly resilient with low lci scores and low thermal vulnerability 3 3 vulnerability of cold water adapted families and catchment conservation priorities thermophily of macroinvertebrate families assessed varied between 0 79 and 1 00 table 2 the most thermophobic taxa included blephariceridae and notonemouridae with a mean instantaneous temperature of 14 3 c and 14 8 c and estimate of thermophily of 0 79 and 0 82 respectively gyrinidae simuliidae and heptageniidae were the most thermophilic family with estimate of thermophily at 1 00 0 97 and 0 96 respectively two catchment areas were identified as having high conservation priority viz the headwater reaches of both the mkomazi and umngeni rivers table 1 both these catchments have records for at least one thermophobic family fig 5 4 discussion the existing baseline freshwater conservation plan for the kzn region identifies priority areas based on the irreplaceability of freshwater biodiversity and vulnerability of surface water yield zones to anticipated land use threats within the province rivers moore et al 2011 rivers moore et al 2016 proposed the use of a connectivity index layer to complement these criteria in setting priorities for conservation and rehabilitation of kzn rivers the current study extends the utility value of the lci by including both thermal vulnerability and the proportion of thermophobic taxa to refine selection criteria based on these criteria two rivers umngeni and mkomazi had high conservation priority both had high thermal vulnerabilities and hosted thermophobic taxa the umngeni also falls within the 2 3 of all catchments that recorded the highest disconnectivity score lci disconnected catchments are a great threat to potential compensatory migration of thermal affected taxa to higher elevations or any other refuge chessman 2012 the incorporation of the thermal vulnerability assessment of sensitive taxa to the existing conservation plans is a useful technique to identify priorities at finer scales modern day frameworks for prioritizing conservation hotspots are based on two critical areas of concern viz landscape conservation capacity and vulnerability to climate change khamis et al 2014b with little consideration of dimensions of stream connectivity and taxonomic response extending the current conservation initiatives to include all three criteria disconnectivity thermal vulnerability and thermophoby would allow for priorities to address specific threats wilson et al 2007 also the process of monitoring and maintaining the river s ability to adapt to change using iterative adaptive management principles is an ideal approach for dealing with the uncertainties surrounding future climatic conditions and future climate impacts rivers moore et al 2007 pace et al 2013 here we embed the areas of high conservation priority as indicated by the inclusive assessment of this study to the existing priority areas for freshwater planning which based on their conservation importance for kzn fig 6 as assessed and identified by rivers moore et al 2011 in the most affected river the umngeni of this study in terms of its high thermal vulnerability low thermal resistance and low longitudinal connectivity score falls within the priority planning areas of rivers moore et al 2011 and this shows the extent to which the holistic approach of this study can identify finer scale priority areas we believe that adding the aspects of thermal vulnerability of rivers longitudinal connectivity and sensitive taxa to the existing conservation planning assessments contribute towards an improved management and decision marking tool fig 6 however a major challenge for this technique is an inadequacy of long term data for freshwater invertebrates at finer spatial and taxonomic scales taxonomic data will enable setting quantitative conservation targets which in turn provide a base for an assessment of the conservation value of an area rivers moore et al 2011 it is also worth noting that connectivity of rivers goes beyond just a single longitudinal dimension to cover a range of lateral vertical and temporal dimensions enabling full consideration of ecological processes freeman et al 2007 the approach presented here requires minimal consideration of dispersal abilities life history and habitat requirements of taxa concerned and strengthens conservation planning at the level of decision making by identifying tipping points in the aquatic systems the use of macroinvertebrate families in modeling thermal vulnerability and thermal

7549,regionalization methods have long been used to estimate high return levels of river discharges at ungauged locations on a river network in these methods discharge measurements from a homogeneous group of similar gauged stations are used to estimate high quantiles at a target location that has no observations the similarity of this group to the ungauged location is measured in terms of a hydrological distance measuring differences in physical and meteorological catchment attributes we develop a statistical method for estimation of high return levels based on regionalizing the parameters of a generalized extreme value distribution the group of stations is chosen by optimizing over the attribute weights of the hydrological distance ensuring similarity and in group homogeneity our method is applied to discharge data from the rhine basin in switzerland and its performance at ungauged locations is compared to that of other regionalization methods for gauged locations we show how our approach improves the estimation uncertainty for long return periods by combining local measurements with those from the chosen group keywords extreme value distribution rhine basin river discharge statistical regionalization ungauged estimation 1 introduction the accurate quantification of high return levels of peak river flows is crucial for effective flood protection at minimal economic cost and ecological damage statistics of extremes provides reliable tools for model fitting identification and assessment of parameter uncertainty for gauging stations with long and stationary discharge records the two main statistical approaches within this paradigm are the block maximum method which fits a generalized extreme value distribution to the yearly maximum discharges and the peaks over threshold method which models all exceedances over a high threshold by a generalized pareto distribution katz et al 2002 the theory and statistical properties of both are well understood and they are often used to analyze flood risk at gauging stations more precisely if g 0 denotes the cumulative distribution function of annual maximum discharge at the target location t 0 and g 0 1 its pseudo inverse the quantity of interest is the t year return level 1 q 0 t g 0 1 1 1 t corresponding to a flood that occurs on average once every t years typical return periods t required by regulators are 50 100 or 200 years but they may be much higher at critical sites flood estimates are often required at locations where no or only few years of observations are available or the data quality is inadequate for example the uk flood estimation handbook reed and robson 1999 states that many flood estimation problems arise at ungauged locations and gives guidelines for estimation of peak discharges at them in these cases the classical tools for high quantile estimation are inapplicable or subject to large estimation uncertainty a common way of estimating the quantiles 1 is then to identify a homogeneous group of gauging stations hydrologically similar to the target location and to transfer information there from these stations this is called regionalization similarity between locations is measured in geographical distance or based on physical and meteorological catchment attributes whereas the in group homogeneity can be tested statistically see e g hosking and wallis 1993 this group denoted by rhs t 0 forms a region of homogeneous stations similar to the target location t 0 if this region is well chosen and contains relevant information on high return levels at the target location regionalization is known to give good results grehys 1996b the identification of hydrologically similar stations is as crucial to the final estimation quality as it is difficult a wide variety of statistical methods for this have been proposed including cluster analysis principal component analysis canonical correlation analysis grehys 1996a ilorme and griffis 2013 entropy based clustering basu and srinivas 2016 and the region of influence approach burn 1990 instead of regionalization some methods in the literature use the information from all available gauging stations shu and ouarda 2007 2008 wazneh et al 2013 2015 once the region rhs t 0 is identified there are two main approaches for transferring the information from the region to the target location the first relies on a hydrological model e g viviroli et al 2009 whose tunable parameters are calibrated for the gauged catchments and then extrapolated to the possibly ungauged target catchment by means of nearest neighbors kriging or regression given the estimated parameters catchment characteristics and meteorological data observed precipitation temperature etc the hydrological model then produces the discharge time series at the location of interest in a deterministic process oriented way hydrological models are appealing because their output includes the temporal evolution of discharges rather than just their marginal distribution but such models require numerous attributes and parameters moreover for estimation of high return levels a further extreme value analysis of the generated time series is necessary the second approach called statistical regionalization directly models high return levels at the target catchment as a function of quantities at gauged locations in rhs t 0 the commonest methods in this context are the index flood dalrymple 1960 and regression of quantile approaches pandey and nguyen 1999 the latter do not determine the whole distribution function of extremes at the target location and can therefore lead to inconsistencies such as a 100 year return level that is smaller than the corresponding 50 year return level methods recently proposed consider more general relations between quantiles and catchment attributes namely generalized additive models chebana et al 2014 artificial neural networks shu and burn 2004 projection pursuit regression durocher et al 2015 and depth based methods wazneh et al 2013 2015 in this paper we propose a new regionalization approach combining the identification of an optimal homogeneous region similar to the target location with an estimation approach that solves the problem of inconsistency and reduces the subjectivity involved in other approaches it regresses the parameters of the generalized extreme value distributions at the gauged stations in the region of the target location on catchment attributes the fitted model is applied to the target location and provides an estimate of the entire distribution of yearly maximum discharges thus giving consistently ordered return levels the attribute weights in the similarity measure that determine the distance between catchments and therefore the region rhs t 0 are chosen in an optimal way to minimize the estimation error so no expert judgment or heuristics for similarity are required and the number of required attributes is very small and the computational cost compared to hydrological models is considerably reduced as an application we estimate high return levels of river discharges at the gauging stations on the rhine basin in switzerland we first use our regionalization approach to reduce the uncertainty of high quantiles of discharges at gauged target locations by borrowing information from hydrologically similar stations we compare the uncertainties of the estimated high quantiles to those of a local model that fits an extreme value distribution using data from the target station only we then treat each station successively as ungauged and estimate return levels with return periods up to 200 years using the optimal homogeneous region similar to the target location the results are compared to quantiles estimated using competing methods such as the index flood method clustering canonical correlation analysis projection pursuit regression and optimal depth based regional frequency analysis section 2 recalls notions of univariate extreme value theory and the concept of regionalization including common methods for estimation of quantiles of river discharge at ungauged locations section 3 introduces our approach section 4 presents discharge data at 68 gauging stations on the swiss rhine basin section 5 uses our new method to estimate high quantiles of gauging stations and section 6 discusses some advantages and drawbacks of our method 2 extreme values and regionalization in this section we first give some background on generalized extreme value distributions a flexible class of distributions often used to model yearly maximum discharges we then discuss the delineation of homogeneous regions including the notion of hydrological distance which can be used as a similarity measure for catchments these concepts are crucial in statistical regionalization of river discharges and will be used in section 3 in addition we review existing estimation methods in regional frequency analysis we consider a river network with m gauged locations t 1 t m and we denote a generic target location on this network by t 0 this might be either gauged or ungauged the k catchment attributes that are available at all stations are denoted by y j k for j 0 1 m and k 1 k 2 1 generalized extreme value distributions generalized extreme value gev distributions have been applied extensively for modeling rare phenomena such as financial crises heat waves or heavy precipitation indeed the gev distribution is the only possible limit for the linearly normalized maximum of a sequence of independent identically distributed random variables fisher and tippett 1928 this remains true if the daily observations show common forms of temporal dependence as is often the case in meteorological data leadbetter et al 1983 so the gev distribution is the natural choice as a model for yearly maxima of daily river discharges at a gauging station more precisely for a gauging station t j j 1 m on the river network we define the local gev distribution as 2 g j l x exp 1 ξ j x μ j σ j 1 ξ j ξ j 0 exp exp x μ j σ j ξ j 0 where z max z 0 and μ j r σ j 0 and ξ j r are the location scale and shape parameters respectively the case ξ j 0 in 2 is obtained as the limit of the first case when ξ j 0 the three parameters of 2 must be estimated from discharge measurements at location t j for sufficiently long and stationary discharge records it is well understood how to obtain parameter estimates and confidence intervals see katz et al 2002 depending on data availability these methods either use the block maxima of yearly peak discharge values or all daily discharges that exceed a high threshold the so called peaks over threshold method both approaches provide estimates for the parameters μ j σ j and ξ j and thus of the 1 1 t quantile t 1 of the fitted gev distribution by replacing the parameters in 3 q j l t μ j σ j ξ j 1 log 1 1 t ξ j ξ j 0 μ j σ j log log 1 1 t ξ j 0 by estimates q j l t is the return level associated with the return period t years 2 2 delineation of homogeneous region fitting the parameters of the gev distribution in 2 requires a long record of discharge values at the location of interest but ungauged locations on the river network for example at confluence points cities or power plants are also crucial for risk assessment standard extreme value methods no longer apply however because of the lack of data at ungauged sites even at gauged locations the record length is often rather short in comparison to the desired return periods resulting in very high uncertainty regionalization involves the use of discharge information from other gauged locations on the river network that are similar to the target location t 0 finding a region with good properties that is similar to the target location t 0 is an area of research in itself if no discharge measurements are available at t 0 the only information on the corresponding catchment are covariates such as the catchment topology its size mean elevation or slope which can be obtained from digital elevation models meteorological quantities such as mean precipitation may also be available based on these catchment attributes a similarity measure is defined and the region rhs t 0 is taken to be those gauged stations out of t 1 t m that are homogeneous and most similar to t 0 according to this measure the number of stations j n in rhs t 0 is a tuning parameter similarity of the station t 0 and the stations in rhs t 0 is not the only criterion for a useful region in order to fit a statistical model to high return levels of discharges in rhs t 0 it is necessary that the discharge distributions at stations in rhs t 0 are sufficiently homogeneous and many tests for this have been proposed see e g hosking and wallis 1993 there is clearly a trade off between similarity and homogeneity high similarity between the target station and the corresponding region rhs t 0 ensures a strong relation between discharges at the ungauged site and at the gauged locations whereas a homogeneous region is the basis for a sensible statistical model and for information transfer our new regionalization method aims to find an optimal compromise between these two properties in order to identify the gauged catchments that are most similar to the catchment of the target location of interest we need a measure of similarity two types of attributes are typically used those based on physical characteristics such as catchment area mean altitude or mean slope and those based on meteorological inputs such as mean precipitation in addition measured discharge statistics at gauged locations might be considered even if the target station t 0 is gauged and discharge statistics are available castellarin et al 2001 argue that the use of physical and meteorological catchment characteristics is preferable to the use of discharges in order to avoid identifying the region rhs t 0 and testing its homogeneity on the basis of the same information most similarity measures between catchments t i and t j use a weighted euclidean distance burn 1990 merz and bloschl 2005 4 d i j w 0 d euc t i t j 2 k 1 k w k y i k y j k 2 1 2 where d euc t i t j is the euclidean distance between the centroids of the sub catchments of t i and t j and w k 0 is the relative importance of the kth attribute the catchment attributes y k are first normalized to adjust for their different scales see gaál et al 2008 merz and bloschl 2005 classically the euclidean distance was not used in 4 that is w 0 0 but merz and bloschl 2005 showed that adding spatial proximity for the identification of rhs t 0 improves the estimation error of regionalization see also gaál and kyselỳ 2009 there are several classical methods for identifying this region cluster analysis is a classical fixed region approach that partitions the gauging stations into disjoint regions a target station t 0 belongs to exactly one of these regions which then defines rhs t 0 in order to find the fixed clusters the distance matrix d i j i j 1 m between all gauged locations is constructed based on the hydrological distance defined in 4 in applications the weights are usually taken to be equal for all attributes or are determined by the correlation between the quantiles of discharges at the stations with the attributes or by expert knowledge several clustering techniques have been used to construct the regions e g rao and srinivas 2006 chiang et al 2002 the most common technique is the ward method which partitions the entire region into clusters of similar sizes and is considered to be well suited for regionalization hosking and wallis 1997 pp 58 59 the ward method is an agglomerative hierarchical algorithm that starts with m clusters i e each location is a single cluster and then successively merges the two clusters resulting in the smallest increase in total within cluster variance this procedure is continued until the desired number c n of clusters is attained where c is a tuning parameter for an application of this method in regionalization see acreman and sinclair 1986 while cluster analysis partitions the stations into distinct and fixed regions canonical correlation analysis is used to find a tailor made region rhs t 0 for each target location t 0 hardoon et al 2004 the idea is to determine a joint normal model for linear combinations of discharge and catchment characteristics with maximal correlations the assumption of multivariate normality ensures that the distribution of the discharge characteristics conditioned on the catchment characteristics is also normally distributed with by construction diagonal covariance matrix σ given the catchment characteristics at the target location t 0 the distance between the discharge distribution at t 0 and any observed discharge at gauged locations can then be measured by the mahalanobis distance induced by σ all stations within a certain radius r 0 with respect to this distance form rhs t 0 r is a tuning parameter grehys 1996b compared various classical regionalization approaches and concluded that canonical correlation analysis is generally preferable to other approaches see ouarda et al 2001 2008 for applications of this approach 2 3 regional estimation methods the estimation of high quantiles q 0 t in 1 at the target location t 0 is of continued interest to hydrologists here we describe only commonly used methods that will later be compared to our new approach presented in section 3 unlike the local model described in section 2 1 regionalization uses additional information from similar catchments in order to decrease the estimation error of the model consider a region r t 1 t j of gauged locations e g the region rhs t 0 identified with one of the methods in section 2 2 in order to pool the information in r and to use common parameters for high quantiles a joint regional model is required the most popular regional models are the index flood method bocchiola et al 2003 and regression of quantiles benson 1962 the index flood method is based on the assumption that in a hydrologically similar region rhs t 0 the peak flows at different locations are identically distributed up to a multiplicative constant called the index flood for a fixed return period t this implies that the 1 1 t quantile of the discharge distribution at station j in region r equals q j t μ j q r t where μ j is the index flood at station j and q r t is a dimensionless quantile function valid over the whole region the index floods μ j in region r are assumed to follow a log linear model 5 log μ j α 0 k 1 k α k log y j k j j 1 j with covariates given by the catchment attributes y j k and independent normally distributed regression error terms j the coefficients α 0 α k can be estimated by ordinary least squares for a target location t 0 either gauged or ungauged that is similar to the region r the index flood μ 0 is then estimated by μ 0 exp α 0 k 1 k α k log y 0 k where α 0 α k are the fitted model parameters similarly for regression of quantiles a log linear model is fitted directly to the 1 1 t quantiles q j t for each return period t separately another estimation method is the parameter regression technique which regresses the parameters of a distribution class on the catchment attributes recent studies haddad et al 2012 haddad and rahman 2012 use this approach with the log pearson type 3 distribution as model for extreme discharges and regress the first three moments of this distribution on the catchment attributes of stations in r several recent regionalization methods propose using the information from all available gauging stations rather than forming a region rhs t 0 projection pursuit regression for instance characterizes the relation between the quantiles of river discharge at a location j and the catchment attributes see durocher et al 2015 for details another method that uses information at all gauging stations is optimal depth based regional frequency analysis wazneh et al 2013 2015 like 5 this method regresses the quantiles on catchment attributes and estimates the coefficients by weighted least squares the weights being parametric functions of the similarity of each station to the target location measured in terms of the mahalanobis depth function in this paper we only consider the gompertz and logistic functions i e ϕ g x c exp a exp bx and ϕ l x c 1 a exp bx a b c 0 where x r which provide the best fits 3 methodology 3 1 regional gev distribution similar to classical regression of quantiles for a given region r t 1 t j our method uses common parameters to increase the accuracy of rare event estimation but instead of modeling a particular quantile we regionalize the entire distribution function this ensures the correct ordering of estimated quantiles for different return levels and avoids inconsistencies due to regressing quantiles separately we assume a log linear relationship between the location and scale parameters of the gev distributions at different locations in r and their catchment characteristics the shape parameters are taken to be constant over r as is natural if the region is sufficiently homogeneous see cooley et al 2007 and sang and gelfand 2009 for discussions of the difficulty of finding reliable spatial patterns for the shape parameters of gev distributions fitted to environmental data for each station t j j 1 j we define the regionalized gev distribution with location scale and shape parameters respectively as 6 g j r x exp 1 ξ j x μ j σ j 1 ξ j log μ j α 0 k 1 k α k log y j k log σ j β 0 k 1 k β k log y j k ξ j ξ where y j 1 y j k are k covariates at gauging station j and α 0 α k and β 0 β k are the coefficients associated to the covariates this marginal model can be fitted by maximizing an independence likelihood chandler and bate 2007 since there certainly is some spatial dependence between discharges in the region r using an independence likelihood can yield inefficient estimates of the model parameters an alternative that allows for spatial dependence would be to fit a max stable dependence model and optimize the joint likelihood asadi et al 2015 since we are only interested in marginal estimates and we will have to fit a large number of these models the independence likelihood is preferred for its simplicity for a target location t 0 similar to region r with catchment attributes y 0 1 y 0 k the estimated t year return level can then be computed as g 0 r 1 1 1 t obtained from model 6 for the fitted parameters α 0 α k and β 0 β k and ξ 3 2 optimal homogeneous region given a target location t 0 at which flood estimation is desired different methods to determine its region rhs t 0 were presented in section 2 2 as discussed in section 2 2 the stations in rhs t 0 should be both homogeneous and similar to location t 0 to ensure the latter we can use the hydrological distance in 4 with weights w 0 w 1 w k 0 satisfying k 0 k w k 1 for a fixed set of weights and a fixed group size j n a region r w k j can then be defined as the j gauging stations out of all t 1 t m that are closest to t 0 measured in hydrological distance these are the j nearest neighbors once this region is found we can fit the model 6 and obtain estimates of arbitrary quantiles at t 0 such estimates will however strongly depend on the choice of weights and the group size the region r w k j might be similar to the target station with respect to the chosen distance but need not also be homogeneous let us first assume that t 0 is ungauged that is no discharge measurements are available at this location below we describe how to find rhs t 0 by choosing the optimal set of weights and the optimal group size roughly speaking we range over all regions r w k j and minimize the training error that is the estimation error made at stations in r w k j whose discharge characteristics are known from observations the discharge distributions in the optimal region rhs t 0 r w k j are homogeneous in the sense that their high quantiles are explained by the fitted regional model 6 better than for any other region r w k j in order to avoid overfitting and to enforce a minimal contribution to the similarity measure from all attributes we impose lower bounds 0 on the weights and n n on the group size the full procedure for finding the optimal region of t 0 is as follows see also the diagram in fig a3 in the appendix for an illustration for all w 0 w k k 0 k w k 1 and j n find the region r w k j as the j nearest neighbors of t 0 fit the regional model 6 to r w k j and compute the fitted model quantiles q j t q j t w k j for all t j r w k j compute the optimal weights and group size minimizing the training error that is 7 w 0 w k j argmin ω 0 ω k j 1 j 1 j n j j 1 j t 1 n j q j t x t n j t j x t n j t j 2 where n j is the number of yearly maxima available at gauging station t j and x t n j t j is the corresponding tth order statistic the latter can be seen as the empirical 1 1 t quantile the region rhs t 0 r w k j is the optimal homogeneous region similar to location t 0 use the regional model 6 fitted to rhs t 0 to estimate the t year return level q 0 t at target location t 0 like canonical correlation analysis our method defines an individual region for each target location unlike methods such as cluster analysis we optimize over all possible hydrological distances the importance of different catchment attributes is thus chosen automatically which avoids the use of heuristics or expert judgment in our approach homogeneity inside the region rhs t 0 is not defined in terms of distribution functions as is the case for the test of hosking and wallis 1993 instead the optimization 7 chooses the most homogeneous region in the sense that local quantiles can be well estimated by using information in this region therefore homogeneity is tested using gauged discharge characteristics whereas the similarity of this region to the target location is based on physical and meteorological attributes only this agrees with the reasoning of castellarin et al 2001 in many applications there are discharge measurements at the target location t 0 but the number of available years n 0 is small compared to the desired return periods in this situation regionalization can significantly decrease estimation uncertainty instead of fitting a local gev model to discharge data only from t 0 we can use our above to determine the homogeneous region rhs t 0 of hydrologically similar stations to t 0 and fit a regional model to the augmented region t 0 rhs t 0 our method can be directly applied with a slight modification of the error function in the minimization 7 since we have actual at site discharge measurements at the target location t 0 the error function in 7 is replaced by 8 1 j 0 j n j τ t 1 n 0 q 0 t x t n 0 t 0 x t n 0 t 0 2 j 1 j t 1 n j q j t x t n j t j x t n j t j 2 where the parameter τ 1 increases the importance of the error at t 0 compared to those in rhs t 0 a large value of τ results in higher bias and smaller variance and conversely for small τ 4 data we illustrate the new method using annual maximum discharges measured at m 68 gauging stations t 1 t m on 44 rivers in the rhine basin in switzerland fig 1 shows the boundary of the basin with its topography and the 68 gauged stations the data used in this paper are monitored by the swiss federal office of the environment foen at these stations the water level is measured and the discharge value is then computed through a rating curve based on regular discharge measurements in the case of extreme flows the discharge values are manually checked and if required corrected by hydraulic modeling and expert judgment there are no missing values at the selected stations the time series of annual maxima at station t j j 1 m is denoted by x i t j i 1 n j where n j is the number of available years at station t j the lengths of the time series are between 30 and 120 years with an average of 60 years see the top left panel of fig 2 the average discharge of annual maxima at these stations ranges from 18 m 3 s in the alps to 2975 m 3 s at the most downstream station on the rhine the major part of the run off in the basin arises from the alps in river flow data seasonality temporal trend possibly due to climate change and abrupt changes due to man made structures like dams or power plants are the main sources of non stationarity as we use only the annual maxima we can ignore seasonality many studies have focused on detecting abrupt changes or trends in extreme river flows kundzewicz et al 2005 and birsan et al 2005 analyze rivers in central europe but neither finds significant trend in particular the latter investigate 48 gauging stations in switzerland and detect no significant trend in extremes of river flows to confirm their results we introduce a temporal linear trend see e g coles 2001 ch 6 for the location and scale parameters of the gev distribution fitted to the annual maxima of the time series in almost all stations no significant trend is observed so we treat the data as temporally stationary in addition to observed annual maximum discharge time series we use a digital elevation model for our study area 1 downloaded from http gdem ersdac jspacesystems or jp made publicly available by the ministry of economy trade and industry of japan and the united states national aeronautics and space administration see tachikawa et al 2011 1 the software arcgis 2 software for analyzing geographical information and digital elevation models 2 is used to obtain the catchment attributes listed in the first part of table 1 the corine data base 3 downloaded from http www eea europa eu 3 bossard et al 2000 provides the type of land cover of each catchment that is the portion of forest rock and agriculture we also compute spatio temporal averages of daily precipitation and averages of annual maximum daily precipitation over each catchment by using its boundaries and historical precipitation data 4 available on http www euro4m eu datasets html 4 on a 5 km 5 km grid isotta et al 2014 exploratory analysis shows strong correlation between certain attributes and table 1 shows which of them carry relevant information on extreme discharges and will be used as covariates in our model the selected attributes are obtained by exploratory data analysis and by applying log likelihood ratio tests while fitting the regional gev distributions 6 5 results 5 1 regionalization for uncertainty reduction in this section we consider the estimation of high quantiles at a target location t 0 with at site discharge measurements standard methods can be used to fit a local gev distribution to the annual maxima at this station and to extrapolate into high quantile regions see section 2 1 confidence bands for the true values are typically computed by parametric bootstrapping davison and hinkley 1997 the local gev fits for four stations can be found in the upper panels of fig 3 we notice that the local fit accurately reproduces the observations but for higher return periods outside the range of the data the uncertainty becomes huge and might be unrealistic at some stations on a tributary of a main river the return level associated to a very long return period may be bigger than the corresponding return level on the main river our methodology with the modified error function at the end of section 3 2 can be used to determine the homogeneous region rhs t 0 of hydrologically similar stations to t 0 and fit a regional model to the augmented region t 0 rhs t 0 for our data the value τ 2 gives a good bias variance trade off the other tuning parameters described in section 3 2 are set to 0 05 as the minimal weight for an attribute and n 7 as the minimal group size an example of the optimal region rhs t 0 for a gauging station is shown in fig a1 in the appendix we use a nonparametric bootstrap to quantify the uncertainty of estimated quantiles obtained using our method the upper left panel of fig 2 shows the data available for all stations since the lengths of the data series differ we partition the years from 1869 to 2015 into four strata for each stratum we resample with equal probability and replacement from the years in the stratum this ensures that any spatial dependence among the data at different stations is preserved examples of such bootstrapped data sets are shown in the other panels of fig 2 the regional model is then fitted to the resampled data re estimating the optimal group size j and the relative weights and the quantiles of interest are computed we repeat this bootstrapping procedure b times and then compute the limits of the 100 1 α bootstrap percentile confidence interval for a given station as the α 2 and 1 α 2 quantiles of the b bootstrap estimates the number b of bootstrap repetitions should be chosen sufficiently large davison and hinkley 1997 chapter 5 we used b 1000 fig 3 compares results for the local and regional models for four stations in the rhine basin the qq plots for the regional and local models in the right hand panels show quite similar fits in the range of observations although the local fits use only data at single stations whereas the regional fits use data from several stations giving some confidence that using regional information does not greatly distort the fits at individual stations the 95 pointwise confidence bands are produced as described in davison and hinkley 1997 4 2 4 the return level plots for regional and local models in the left hand panels of fig 3 however show that there can be big differences between the extrapolations from the local and regional fits the latter tend to be more stable and the confidence bands are narrower especially for higher return levels for some stations the local model gives unrealistically large 500 year return levels with huge confidence intervals whereas the corresponding results for the regional model seem much more reasonable owing to the reduction of uncertainty fig a2 in the appendix shows the 50 100 and 200 year return levels with their 95 confidence intervals for the local and regional models for all 68 stations in the rhine basin when the return period increases the local model estimates and their confidence intervals increase wildly for some stations while the regional model gives both more stable estimates and narrower confidence intervals mainly due to stabilized estimation of the shape parameter 5 2 ungauged regionalization the main goal of the regional flood frequency analysis is to estimate high quantiles of river discharges at ungauged target locations t 0 to evaluate the performance of our proposed method for statistical regionalization we compare the results with those obtained by several classical and recent methods see sections 2 2 and 2 3 in addition to our new method we implemented clustering and canonical correlation analysis combined with regression of quantiles the index flood method combined with our optimization approach to identify the optimal homogeneous region project pursuit regression and optimal depth based regional flood frequency analysis in order to compute the errors between the estimates and the observed quantiles we apply a leave one out procedure for each gauged location t 1 t 68 from the data set we assume that this location is ungauged and estimate high return levels using the remaining stations by our regional model and the competing methods for our method we choose the minimal attribute weight as 0 05 and the minimal size of the region rhs t 0 as j 8 we run the optimization procedure described in section 3 2 we obtain the optimal group size j for each target location ranging between 8 and 14 with an average of 10 2 and standard deviation 1 3 and a set of optimal weights the interpretation of the optimal weights w k in the hydrological distance 4 is difficult as each target location has its individual set of k 5 optimal weights in order to evaluate the performance of the different models we need a baseline distribution at t j that is assumed to be the truth in this paper we assume that the local gev distribution fitted to the observations at t j is the true distribution since it is asymptotically motivated and provides good fits for our data see section 2 1 there are other possible choices as baseline distribution see e g saf 2009 the estimated quantiles from the regional models are compared to this baseline gev in terms of relative bias and relative root mean squared error for a specific return period of t years they are defined as rel bias 1 m j 1 m q j t q j l t q j l t rel rmse 1 m j 1 m q j t q j l t q j l t 2 1 2 where m 68 is the number of gauged stations q j l t is the quantile obtained by the local gev distribution at station t j and q j t is the estimate from all regional models fig 4 compares the relative bias and relative root mean square error for our model and the competitors the relative bias of our method is comparable with those of the optimal depth based methods and better than all remaining methods in terms of the relative root mean squared error our method is better than the competing methods for return periods larger than 10 years which usually are of main interest the plot also shows that the worst root mean squared error occurs with the clustering approach which is based on fixed regions fig 5 summarizes the relative deviations of 100 year return levels from the baseline for all stations in the rhine basin for the different methods our statistical regionalization has a smaller variance than the competing methods and fewer outliers the way our method defines the region rhs t 0 is flexible enough to give good estimates for all stations fig 6 shows how reliably our method estimates 50 year and 100 year return levels without any discharge data compared to the local gev fitted to actual observations we plot the specific discharges that is the discharge at a location divided by the corresponding catchment size for most stations there is very good agreement between the ungauged estimation and the local model the ten stations with the largest relative estimation errors marked by red circles in fig 6 mostly have very small catchments and no further gauging stations are located either upstream or downstream until the next confluence point so there is a lack of highly relevant information in their similar region viviroli et al 2009 studied the same region in the rhine basin and used data similar to ours they implemented and compared different regionalization methods for hydrological models and estimated high return levels at ungauged locations the estimation errors are not directly comparable with our results since the databases do not coincide but the orders of magnitude seem similar 6 discussion the statistical regionalization approach introduced in this paper allows the estimation of high return levels of river discharges at both gauged and ungauged locations the output of the algorithm is the entire gev distribution of annual maxima at the point of interest this is a major advantage over regression of quantile techniques since the ordering of quantiles with different return periods is always correct the homogeneous region of stations similar to the target location in our method is chosen individually for each station and in an optimal way minimizing the training error this results in better performance than competing methods when estimating return levels at ungauged locations in the swiss rhine basin for gauged locations we show that our method can improve the estimation of extreme river discharges and in particular can decrease the estimation uncertainty for long return periods this is achieved by using observations in the optimal region rhs t 0 of the target site in addition to local measurements and thus increasing the amount of relevant information on extreme discharges the small number of covariates needed in our approach and the low computation time of the algorithm are further advantages over regionalization methods based on hydrological models one reason for the good performance of our method is the fact that the generalized extreme value distribution provides a good approximation to the extremes of river discharges in the rhine basin in switzerland this family of distributions is motivated by asymptotic theory and in our experience is often suitable for other catchments however if another parametric family of distributions is preferred e g the log pearson type 3 haddad et al 2012 our method can be adapted by regressing the corresponding parameters against the catchment attributes and by choosing the optimal homogeneous region in exactly the same way one limitation of our method is that we have to make the simplifying assumption that the shape parameters in our regression model 6 are constant across the chosen region r since otherwise the estimation uncertainty would be too large this might cause problems in certain situations but in our case it seems to be a sensible choice see also cooley et al 2007 and sang and gelfand 2009 acknowledgments we thank the editorial team and two referees for helpful comments financial support by the swiss national science foundation is gratefully acknowledged appendix a 
7549,regionalization methods have long been used to estimate high return levels of river discharges at ungauged locations on a river network in these methods discharge measurements from a homogeneous group of similar gauged stations are used to estimate high quantiles at a target location that has no observations the similarity of this group to the ungauged location is measured in terms of a hydrological distance measuring differences in physical and meteorological catchment attributes we develop a statistical method for estimation of high return levels based on regionalizing the parameters of a generalized extreme value distribution the group of stations is chosen by optimizing over the attribute weights of the hydrological distance ensuring similarity and in group homogeneity our method is applied to discharge data from the rhine basin in switzerland and its performance at ungauged locations is compared to that of other regionalization methods for gauged locations we show how our approach improves the estimation uncertainty for long return periods by combining local measurements with those from the chosen group keywords extreme value distribution rhine basin river discharge statistical regionalization ungauged estimation 1 introduction the accurate quantification of high return levels of peak river flows is crucial for effective flood protection at minimal economic cost and ecological damage statistics of extremes provides reliable tools for model fitting identification and assessment of parameter uncertainty for gauging stations with long and stationary discharge records the two main statistical approaches within this paradigm are the block maximum method which fits a generalized extreme value distribution to the yearly maximum discharges and the peaks over threshold method which models all exceedances over a high threshold by a generalized pareto distribution katz et al 2002 the theory and statistical properties of both are well understood and they are often used to analyze flood risk at gauging stations more precisely if g 0 denotes the cumulative distribution function of annual maximum discharge at the target location t 0 and g 0 1 its pseudo inverse the quantity of interest is the t year return level 1 q 0 t g 0 1 1 1 t corresponding to a flood that occurs on average once every t years typical return periods t required by regulators are 50 100 or 200 years but they may be much higher at critical sites flood estimates are often required at locations where no or only few years of observations are available or the data quality is inadequate for example the uk flood estimation handbook reed and robson 1999 states that many flood estimation problems arise at ungauged locations and gives guidelines for estimation of peak discharges at them in these cases the classical tools for high quantile estimation are inapplicable or subject to large estimation uncertainty a common way of estimating the quantiles 1 is then to identify a homogeneous group of gauging stations hydrologically similar to the target location and to transfer information there from these stations this is called regionalization similarity between locations is measured in geographical distance or based on physical and meteorological catchment attributes whereas the in group homogeneity can be tested statistically see e g hosking and wallis 1993 this group denoted by rhs t 0 forms a region of homogeneous stations similar to the target location t 0 if this region is well chosen and contains relevant information on high return levels at the target location regionalization is known to give good results grehys 1996b the identification of hydrologically similar stations is as crucial to the final estimation quality as it is difficult a wide variety of statistical methods for this have been proposed including cluster analysis principal component analysis canonical correlation analysis grehys 1996a ilorme and griffis 2013 entropy based clustering basu and srinivas 2016 and the region of influence approach burn 1990 instead of regionalization some methods in the literature use the information from all available gauging stations shu and ouarda 2007 2008 wazneh et al 2013 2015 once the region rhs t 0 is identified there are two main approaches for transferring the information from the region to the target location the first relies on a hydrological model e g viviroli et al 2009 whose tunable parameters are calibrated for the gauged catchments and then extrapolated to the possibly ungauged target catchment by means of nearest neighbors kriging or regression given the estimated parameters catchment characteristics and meteorological data observed precipitation temperature etc the hydrological model then produces the discharge time series at the location of interest in a deterministic process oriented way hydrological models are appealing because their output includes the temporal evolution of discharges rather than just their marginal distribution but such models require numerous attributes and parameters moreover for estimation of high return levels a further extreme value analysis of the generated time series is necessary the second approach called statistical regionalization directly models high return levels at the target catchment as a function of quantities at gauged locations in rhs t 0 the commonest methods in this context are the index flood dalrymple 1960 and regression of quantile approaches pandey and nguyen 1999 the latter do not determine the whole distribution function of extremes at the target location and can therefore lead to inconsistencies such as a 100 year return level that is smaller than the corresponding 50 year return level methods recently proposed consider more general relations between quantiles and catchment attributes namely generalized additive models chebana et al 2014 artificial neural networks shu and burn 2004 projection pursuit regression durocher et al 2015 and depth based methods wazneh et al 2013 2015 in this paper we propose a new regionalization approach combining the identification of an optimal homogeneous region similar to the target location with an estimation approach that solves the problem of inconsistency and reduces the subjectivity involved in other approaches it regresses the parameters of the generalized extreme value distributions at the gauged stations in the region of the target location on catchment attributes the fitted model is applied to the target location and provides an estimate of the entire distribution of yearly maximum discharges thus giving consistently ordered return levels the attribute weights in the similarity measure that determine the distance between catchments and therefore the region rhs t 0 are chosen in an optimal way to minimize the estimation error so no expert judgment or heuristics for similarity are required and the number of required attributes is very small and the computational cost compared to hydrological models is considerably reduced as an application we estimate high return levels of river discharges at the gauging stations on the rhine basin in switzerland we first use our regionalization approach to reduce the uncertainty of high quantiles of discharges at gauged target locations by borrowing information from hydrologically similar stations we compare the uncertainties of the estimated high quantiles to those of a local model that fits an extreme value distribution using data from the target station only we then treat each station successively as ungauged and estimate return levels with return periods up to 200 years using the optimal homogeneous region similar to the target location the results are compared to quantiles estimated using competing methods such as the index flood method clustering canonical correlation analysis projection pursuit regression and optimal depth based regional frequency analysis section 2 recalls notions of univariate extreme value theory and the concept of regionalization including common methods for estimation of quantiles of river discharge at ungauged locations section 3 introduces our approach section 4 presents discharge data at 68 gauging stations on the swiss rhine basin section 5 uses our new method to estimate high quantiles of gauging stations and section 6 discusses some advantages and drawbacks of our method 2 extreme values and regionalization in this section we first give some background on generalized extreme value distributions a flexible class of distributions often used to model yearly maximum discharges we then discuss the delineation of homogeneous regions including the notion of hydrological distance which can be used as a similarity measure for catchments these concepts are crucial in statistical regionalization of river discharges and will be used in section 3 in addition we review existing estimation methods in regional frequency analysis we consider a river network with m gauged locations t 1 t m and we denote a generic target location on this network by t 0 this might be either gauged or ungauged the k catchment attributes that are available at all stations are denoted by y j k for j 0 1 m and k 1 k 2 1 generalized extreme value distributions generalized extreme value gev distributions have been applied extensively for modeling rare phenomena such as financial crises heat waves or heavy precipitation indeed the gev distribution is the only possible limit for the linearly normalized maximum of a sequence of independent identically distributed random variables fisher and tippett 1928 this remains true if the daily observations show common forms of temporal dependence as is often the case in meteorological data leadbetter et al 1983 so the gev distribution is the natural choice as a model for yearly maxima of daily river discharges at a gauging station more precisely for a gauging station t j j 1 m on the river network we define the local gev distribution as 2 g j l x exp 1 ξ j x μ j σ j 1 ξ j ξ j 0 exp exp x μ j σ j ξ j 0 where z max z 0 and μ j r σ j 0 and ξ j r are the location scale and shape parameters respectively the case ξ j 0 in 2 is obtained as the limit of the first case when ξ j 0 the three parameters of 2 must be estimated from discharge measurements at location t j for sufficiently long and stationary discharge records it is well understood how to obtain parameter estimates and confidence intervals see katz et al 2002 depending on data availability these methods either use the block maxima of yearly peak discharge values or all daily discharges that exceed a high threshold the so called peaks over threshold method both approaches provide estimates for the parameters μ j σ j and ξ j and thus of the 1 1 t quantile t 1 of the fitted gev distribution by replacing the parameters in 3 q j l t μ j σ j ξ j 1 log 1 1 t ξ j ξ j 0 μ j σ j log log 1 1 t ξ j 0 by estimates q j l t is the return level associated with the return period t years 2 2 delineation of homogeneous region fitting the parameters of the gev distribution in 2 requires a long record of discharge values at the location of interest but ungauged locations on the river network for example at confluence points cities or power plants are also crucial for risk assessment standard extreme value methods no longer apply however because of the lack of data at ungauged sites even at gauged locations the record length is often rather short in comparison to the desired return periods resulting in very high uncertainty regionalization involves the use of discharge information from other gauged locations on the river network that are similar to the target location t 0 finding a region with good properties that is similar to the target location t 0 is an area of research in itself if no discharge measurements are available at t 0 the only information on the corresponding catchment are covariates such as the catchment topology its size mean elevation or slope which can be obtained from digital elevation models meteorological quantities such as mean precipitation may also be available based on these catchment attributes a similarity measure is defined and the region rhs t 0 is taken to be those gauged stations out of t 1 t m that are homogeneous and most similar to t 0 according to this measure the number of stations j n in rhs t 0 is a tuning parameter similarity of the station t 0 and the stations in rhs t 0 is not the only criterion for a useful region in order to fit a statistical model to high return levels of discharges in rhs t 0 it is necessary that the discharge distributions at stations in rhs t 0 are sufficiently homogeneous and many tests for this have been proposed see e g hosking and wallis 1993 there is clearly a trade off between similarity and homogeneity high similarity between the target station and the corresponding region rhs t 0 ensures a strong relation between discharges at the ungauged site and at the gauged locations whereas a homogeneous region is the basis for a sensible statistical model and for information transfer our new regionalization method aims to find an optimal compromise between these two properties in order to identify the gauged catchments that are most similar to the catchment of the target location of interest we need a measure of similarity two types of attributes are typically used those based on physical characteristics such as catchment area mean altitude or mean slope and those based on meteorological inputs such as mean precipitation in addition measured discharge statistics at gauged locations might be considered even if the target station t 0 is gauged and discharge statistics are available castellarin et al 2001 argue that the use of physical and meteorological catchment characteristics is preferable to the use of discharges in order to avoid identifying the region rhs t 0 and testing its homogeneity on the basis of the same information most similarity measures between catchments t i and t j use a weighted euclidean distance burn 1990 merz and bloschl 2005 4 d i j w 0 d euc t i t j 2 k 1 k w k y i k y j k 2 1 2 where d euc t i t j is the euclidean distance between the centroids of the sub catchments of t i and t j and w k 0 is the relative importance of the kth attribute the catchment attributes y k are first normalized to adjust for their different scales see gaál et al 2008 merz and bloschl 2005 classically the euclidean distance was not used in 4 that is w 0 0 but merz and bloschl 2005 showed that adding spatial proximity for the identification of rhs t 0 improves the estimation error of regionalization see also gaál and kyselỳ 2009 there are several classical methods for identifying this region cluster analysis is a classical fixed region approach that partitions the gauging stations into disjoint regions a target station t 0 belongs to exactly one of these regions which then defines rhs t 0 in order to find the fixed clusters the distance matrix d i j i j 1 m between all gauged locations is constructed based on the hydrological distance defined in 4 in applications the weights are usually taken to be equal for all attributes or are determined by the correlation between the quantiles of discharges at the stations with the attributes or by expert knowledge several clustering techniques have been used to construct the regions e g rao and srinivas 2006 chiang et al 2002 the most common technique is the ward method which partitions the entire region into clusters of similar sizes and is considered to be well suited for regionalization hosking and wallis 1997 pp 58 59 the ward method is an agglomerative hierarchical algorithm that starts with m clusters i e each location is a single cluster and then successively merges the two clusters resulting in the smallest increase in total within cluster variance this procedure is continued until the desired number c n of clusters is attained where c is a tuning parameter for an application of this method in regionalization see acreman and sinclair 1986 while cluster analysis partitions the stations into distinct and fixed regions canonical correlation analysis is used to find a tailor made region rhs t 0 for each target location t 0 hardoon et al 2004 the idea is to determine a joint normal model for linear combinations of discharge and catchment characteristics with maximal correlations the assumption of multivariate normality ensures that the distribution of the discharge characteristics conditioned on the catchment characteristics is also normally distributed with by construction diagonal covariance matrix σ given the catchment characteristics at the target location t 0 the distance between the discharge distribution at t 0 and any observed discharge at gauged locations can then be measured by the mahalanobis distance induced by σ all stations within a certain radius r 0 with respect to this distance form rhs t 0 r is a tuning parameter grehys 1996b compared various classical regionalization approaches and concluded that canonical correlation analysis is generally preferable to other approaches see ouarda et al 2001 2008 for applications of this approach 2 3 regional estimation methods the estimation of high quantiles q 0 t in 1 at the target location t 0 is of continued interest to hydrologists here we describe only commonly used methods that will later be compared to our new approach presented in section 3 unlike the local model described in section 2 1 regionalization uses additional information from similar catchments in order to decrease the estimation error of the model consider a region r t 1 t j of gauged locations e g the region rhs t 0 identified with one of the methods in section 2 2 in order to pool the information in r and to use common parameters for high quantiles a joint regional model is required the most popular regional models are the index flood method bocchiola et al 2003 and regression of quantiles benson 1962 the index flood method is based on the assumption that in a hydrologically similar region rhs t 0 the peak flows at different locations are identically distributed up to a multiplicative constant called the index flood for a fixed return period t this implies that the 1 1 t quantile of the discharge distribution at station j in region r equals q j t μ j q r t where μ j is the index flood at station j and q r t is a dimensionless quantile function valid over the whole region the index floods μ j in region r are assumed to follow a log linear model 5 log μ j α 0 k 1 k α k log y j k j j 1 j with covariates given by the catchment attributes y j k and independent normally distributed regression error terms j the coefficients α 0 α k can be estimated by ordinary least squares for a target location t 0 either gauged or ungauged that is similar to the region r the index flood μ 0 is then estimated by μ 0 exp α 0 k 1 k α k log y 0 k where α 0 α k are the fitted model parameters similarly for regression of quantiles a log linear model is fitted directly to the 1 1 t quantiles q j t for each return period t separately another estimation method is the parameter regression technique which regresses the parameters of a distribution class on the catchment attributes recent studies haddad et al 2012 haddad and rahman 2012 use this approach with the log pearson type 3 distribution as model for extreme discharges and regress the first three moments of this distribution on the catchment attributes of stations in r several recent regionalization methods propose using the information from all available gauging stations rather than forming a region rhs t 0 projection pursuit regression for instance characterizes the relation between the quantiles of river discharge at a location j and the catchment attributes see durocher et al 2015 for details another method that uses information at all gauging stations is optimal depth based regional frequency analysis wazneh et al 2013 2015 like 5 this method regresses the quantiles on catchment attributes and estimates the coefficients by weighted least squares the weights being parametric functions of the similarity of each station to the target location measured in terms of the mahalanobis depth function in this paper we only consider the gompertz and logistic functions i e ϕ g x c exp a exp bx and ϕ l x c 1 a exp bx a b c 0 where x r which provide the best fits 3 methodology 3 1 regional gev distribution similar to classical regression of quantiles for a given region r t 1 t j our method uses common parameters to increase the accuracy of rare event estimation but instead of modeling a particular quantile we regionalize the entire distribution function this ensures the correct ordering of estimated quantiles for different return levels and avoids inconsistencies due to regressing quantiles separately we assume a log linear relationship between the location and scale parameters of the gev distributions at different locations in r and their catchment characteristics the shape parameters are taken to be constant over r as is natural if the region is sufficiently homogeneous see cooley et al 2007 and sang and gelfand 2009 for discussions of the difficulty of finding reliable spatial patterns for the shape parameters of gev distributions fitted to environmental data for each station t j j 1 j we define the regionalized gev distribution with location scale and shape parameters respectively as 6 g j r x exp 1 ξ j x μ j σ j 1 ξ j log μ j α 0 k 1 k α k log y j k log σ j β 0 k 1 k β k log y j k ξ j ξ where y j 1 y j k are k covariates at gauging station j and α 0 α k and β 0 β k are the coefficients associated to the covariates this marginal model can be fitted by maximizing an independence likelihood chandler and bate 2007 since there certainly is some spatial dependence between discharges in the region r using an independence likelihood can yield inefficient estimates of the model parameters an alternative that allows for spatial dependence would be to fit a max stable dependence model and optimize the joint likelihood asadi et al 2015 since we are only interested in marginal estimates and we will have to fit a large number of these models the independence likelihood is preferred for its simplicity for a target location t 0 similar to region r with catchment attributes y 0 1 y 0 k the estimated t year return level can then be computed as g 0 r 1 1 1 t obtained from model 6 for the fitted parameters α 0 α k and β 0 β k and ξ 3 2 optimal homogeneous region given a target location t 0 at which flood estimation is desired different methods to determine its region rhs t 0 were presented in section 2 2 as discussed in section 2 2 the stations in rhs t 0 should be both homogeneous and similar to location t 0 to ensure the latter we can use the hydrological distance in 4 with weights w 0 w 1 w k 0 satisfying k 0 k w k 1 for a fixed set of weights and a fixed group size j n a region r w k j can then be defined as the j gauging stations out of all t 1 t m that are closest to t 0 measured in hydrological distance these are the j nearest neighbors once this region is found we can fit the model 6 and obtain estimates of arbitrary quantiles at t 0 such estimates will however strongly depend on the choice of weights and the group size the region r w k j might be similar to the target station with respect to the chosen distance but need not also be homogeneous let us first assume that t 0 is ungauged that is no discharge measurements are available at this location below we describe how to find rhs t 0 by choosing the optimal set of weights and the optimal group size roughly speaking we range over all regions r w k j and minimize the training error that is the estimation error made at stations in r w k j whose discharge characteristics are known from observations the discharge distributions in the optimal region rhs t 0 r w k j are homogeneous in the sense that their high quantiles are explained by the fitted regional model 6 better than for any other region r w k j in order to avoid overfitting and to enforce a minimal contribution to the similarity measure from all attributes we impose lower bounds 0 on the weights and n n on the group size the full procedure for finding the optimal region of t 0 is as follows see also the diagram in fig a3 in the appendix for an illustration for all w 0 w k k 0 k w k 1 and j n find the region r w k j as the j nearest neighbors of t 0 fit the regional model 6 to r w k j and compute the fitted model quantiles q j t q j t w k j for all t j r w k j compute the optimal weights and group size minimizing the training error that is 7 w 0 w k j argmin ω 0 ω k j 1 j 1 j n j j 1 j t 1 n j q j t x t n j t j x t n j t j 2 where n j is the number of yearly maxima available at gauging station t j and x t n j t j is the corresponding tth order statistic the latter can be seen as the empirical 1 1 t quantile the region rhs t 0 r w k j is the optimal homogeneous region similar to location t 0 use the regional model 6 fitted to rhs t 0 to estimate the t year return level q 0 t at target location t 0 like canonical correlation analysis our method defines an individual region for each target location unlike methods such as cluster analysis we optimize over all possible hydrological distances the importance of different catchment attributes is thus chosen automatically which avoids the use of heuristics or expert judgment in our approach homogeneity inside the region rhs t 0 is not defined in terms of distribution functions as is the case for the test of hosking and wallis 1993 instead the optimization 7 chooses the most homogeneous region in the sense that local quantiles can be well estimated by using information in this region therefore homogeneity is tested using gauged discharge characteristics whereas the similarity of this region to the target location is based on physical and meteorological attributes only this agrees with the reasoning of castellarin et al 2001 in many applications there are discharge measurements at the target location t 0 but the number of available years n 0 is small compared to the desired return periods in this situation regionalization can significantly decrease estimation uncertainty instead of fitting a local gev model to discharge data only from t 0 we can use our above to determine the homogeneous region rhs t 0 of hydrologically similar stations to t 0 and fit a regional model to the augmented region t 0 rhs t 0 our method can be directly applied with a slight modification of the error function in the minimization 7 since we have actual at site discharge measurements at the target location t 0 the error function in 7 is replaced by 8 1 j 0 j n j τ t 1 n 0 q 0 t x t n 0 t 0 x t n 0 t 0 2 j 1 j t 1 n j q j t x t n j t j x t n j t j 2 where the parameter τ 1 increases the importance of the error at t 0 compared to those in rhs t 0 a large value of τ results in higher bias and smaller variance and conversely for small τ 4 data we illustrate the new method using annual maximum discharges measured at m 68 gauging stations t 1 t m on 44 rivers in the rhine basin in switzerland fig 1 shows the boundary of the basin with its topography and the 68 gauged stations the data used in this paper are monitored by the swiss federal office of the environment foen at these stations the water level is measured and the discharge value is then computed through a rating curve based on regular discharge measurements in the case of extreme flows the discharge values are manually checked and if required corrected by hydraulic modeling and expert judgment there are no missing values at the selected stations the time series of annual maxima at station t j j 1 m is denoted by x i t j i 1 n j where n j is the number of available years at station t j the lengths of the time series are between 30 and 120 years with an average of 60 years see the top left panel of fig 2 the average discharge of annual maxima at these stations ranges from 18 m 3 s in the alps to 2975 m 3 s at the most downstream station on the rhine the major part of the run off in the basin arises from the alps in river flow data seasonality temporal trend possibly due to climate change and abrupt changes due to man made structures like dams or power plants are the main sources of non stationarity as we use only the annual maxima we can ignore seasonality many studies have focused on detecting abrupt changes or trends in extreme river flows kundzewicz et al 2005 and birsan et al 2005 analyze rivers in central europe but neither finds significant trend in particular the latter investigate 48 gauging stations in switzerland and detect no significant trend in extremes of river flows to confirm their results we introduce a temporal linear trend see e g coles 2001 ch 6 for the location and scale parameters of the gev distribution fitted to the annual maxima of the time series in almost all stations no significant trend is observed so we treat the data as temporally stationary in addition to observed annual maximum discharge time series we use a digital elevation model for our study area 1 downloaded from http gdem ersdac jspacesystems or jp made publicly available by the ministry of economy trade and industry of japan and the united states national aeronautics and space administration see tachikawa et al 2011 1 the software arcgis 2 software for analyzing geographical information and digital elevation models 2 is used to obtain the catchment attributes listed in the first part of table 1 the corine data base 3 downloaded from http www eea europa eu 3 bossard et al 2000 provides the type of land cover of each catchment that is the portion of forest rock and agriculture we also compute spatio temporal averages of daily precipitation and averages of annual maximum daily precipitation over each catchment by using its boundaries and historical precipitation data 4 available on http www euro4m eu datasets html 4 on a 5 km 5 km grid isotta et al 2014 exploratory analysis shows strong correlation between certain attributes and table 1 shows which of them carry relevant information on extreme discharges and will be used as covariates in our model the selected attributes are obtained by exploratory data analysis and by applying log likelihood ratio tests while fitting the regional gev distributions 6 5 results 5 1 regionalization for uncertainty reduction in this section we consider the estimation of high quantiles at a target location t 0 with at site discharge measurements standard methods can be used to fit a local gev distribution to the annual maxima at this station and to extrapolate into high quantile regions see section 2 1 confidence bands for the true values are typically computed by parametric bootstrapping davison and hinkley 1997 the local gev fits for four stations can be found in the upper panels of fig 3 we notice that the local fit accurately reproduces the observations but for higher return periods outside the range of the data the uncertainty becomes huge and might be unrealistic at some stations on a tributary of a main river the return level associated to a very long return period may be bigger than the corresponding return level on the main river our methodology with the modified error function at the end of section 3 2 can be used to determine the homogeneous region rhs t 0 of hydrologically similar stations to t 0 and fit a regional model to the augmented region t 0 rhs t 0 for our data the value τ 2 gives a good bias variance trade off the other tuning parameters described in section 3 2 are set to 0 05 as the minimal weight for an attribute and n 7 as the minimal group size an example of the optimal region rhs t 0 for a gauging station is shown in fig a1 in the appendix we use a nonparametric bootstrap to quantify the uncertainty of estimated quantiles obtained using our method the upper left panel of fig 2 shows the data available for all stations since the lengths of the data series differ we partition the years from 1869 to 2015 into four strata for each stratum we resample with equal probability and replacement from the years in the stratum this ensures that any spatial dependence among the data at different stations is preserved examples of such bootstrapped data sets are shown in the other panels of fig 2 the regional model is then fitted to the resampled data re estimating the optimal group size j and the relative weights and the quantiles of interest are computed we repeat this bootstrapping procedure b times and then compute the limits of the 100 1 α bootstrap percentile confidence interval for a given station as the α 2 and 1 α 2 quantiles of the b bootstrap estimates the number b of bootstrap repetitions should be chosen sufficiently large davison and hinkley 1997 chapter 5 we used b 1000 fig 3 compares results for the local and regional models for four stations in the rhine basin the qq plots for the regional and local models in the right hand panels show quite similar fits in the range of observations although the local fits use only data at single stations whereas the regional fits use data from several stations giving some confidence that using regional information does not greatly distort the fits at individual stations the 95 pointwise confidence bands are produced as described in davison and hinkley 1997 4 2 4 the return level plots for regional and local models in the left hand panels of fig 3 however show that there can be big differences between the extrapolations from the local and regional fits the latter tend to be more stable and the confidence bands are narrower especially for higher return levels for some stations the local model gives unrealistically large 500 year return levels with huge confidence intervals whereas the corresponding results for the regional model seem much more reasonable owing to the reduction of uncertainty fig a2 in the appendix shows the 50 100 and 200 year return levels with their 95 confidence intervals for the local and regional models for all 68 stations in the rhine basin when the return period increases the local model estimates and their confidence intervals increase wildly for some stations while the regional model gives both more stable estimates and narrower confidence intervals mainly due to stabilized estimation of the shape parameter 5 2 ungauged regionalization the main goal of the regional flood frequency analysis is to estimate high quantiles of river discharges at ungauged target locations t 0 to evaluate the performance of our proposed method for statistical regionalization we compare the results with those obtained by several classical and recent methods see sections 2 2 and 2 3 in addition to our new method we implemented clustering and canonical correlation analysis combined with regression of quantiles the index flood method combined with our optimization approach to identify the optimal homogeneous region project pursuit regression and optimal depth based regional flood frequency analysis in order to compute the errors between the estimates and the observed quantiles we apply a leave one out procedure for each gauged location t 1 t 68 from the data set we assume that this location is ungauged and estimate high return levels using the remaining stations by our regional model and the competing methods for our method we choose the minimal attribute weight as 0 05 and the minimal size of the region rhs t 0 as j 8 we run the optimization procedure described in section 3 2 we obtain the optimal group size j for each target location ranging between 8 and 14 with an average of 10 2 and standard deviation 1 3 and a set of optimal weights the interpretation of the optimal weights w k in the hydrological distance 4 is difficult as each target location has its individual set of k 5 optimal weights in order to evaluate the performance of the different models we need a baseline distribution at t j that is assumed to be the truth in this paper we assume that the local gev distribution fitted to the observations at t j is the true distribution since it is asymptotically motivated and provides good fits for our data see section 2 1 there are other possible choices as baseline distribution see e g saf 2009 the estimated quantiles from the regional models are compared to this baseline gev in terms of relative bias and relative root mean squared error for a specific return period of t years they are defined as rel bias 1 m j 1 m q j t q j l t q j l t rel rmse 1 m j 1 m q j t q j l t q j l t 2 1 2 where m 68 is the number of gauged stations q j l t is the quantile obtained by the local gev distribution at station t j and q j t is the estimate from all regional models fig 4 compares the relative bias and relative root mean square error for our model and the competitors the relative bias of our method is comparable with those of the optimal depth based methods and better than all remaining methods in terms of the relative root mean squared error our method is better than the competing methods for return periods larger than 10 years which usually are of main interest the plot also shows that the worst root mean squared error occurs with the clustering approach which is based on fixed regions fig 5 summarizes the relative deviations of 100 year return levels from the baseline for all stations in the rhine basin for the different methods our statistical regionalization has a smaller variance than the competing methods and fewer outliers the way our method defines the region rhs t 0 is flexible enough to give good estimates for all stations fig 6 shows how reliably our method estimates 50 year and 100 year return levels without any discharge data compared to the local gev fitted to actual observations we plot the specific discharges that is the discharge at a location divided by the corresponding catchment size for most stations there is very good agreement between the ungauged estimation and the local model the ten stations with the largest relative estimation errors marked by red circles in fig 6 mostly have very small catchments and no further gauging stations are located either upstream or downstream until the next confluence point so there is a lack of highly relevant information in their similar region viviroli et al 2009 studied the same region in the rhine basin and used data similar to ours they implemented and compared different regionalization methods for hydrological models and estimated high return levels at ungauged locations the estimation errors are not directly comparable with our results since the databases do not coincide but the orders of magnitude seem similar 6 discussion the statistical regionalization approach introduced in this paper allows the estimation of high return levels of river discharges at both gauged and ungauged locations the output of the algorithm is the entire gev distribution of annual maxima at the point of interest this is a major advantage over regression of quantile techniques since the ordering of quantiles with different return periods is always correct the homogeneous region of stations similar to the target location in our method is chosen individually for each station and in an optimal way minimizing the training error this results in better performance than competing methods when estimating return levels at ungauged locations in the swiss rhine basin for gauged locations we show that our method can improve the estimation of extreme river discharges and in particular can decrease the estimation uncertainty for long return periods this is achieved by using observations in the optimal region rhs t 0 of the target site in addition to local measurements and thus increasing the amount of relevant information on extreme discharges the small number of covariates needed in our approach and the low computation time of the algorithm are further advantages over regionalization methods based on hydrological models one reason for the good performance of our method is the fact that the generalized extreme value distribution provides a good approximation to the extremes of river discharges in the rhine basin in switzerland this family of distributions is motivated by asymptotic theory and in our experience is often suitable for other catchments however if another parametric family of distributions is preferred e g the log pearson type 3 haddad et al 2012 our method can be adapted by regressing the corresponding parameters against the catchment attributes and by choosing the optimal homogeneous region in exactly the same way one limitation of our method is that we have to make the simplifying assumption that the shape parameters in our regression model 6 are constant across the chosen region r since otherwise the estimation uncertainty would be too large this might cause problems in certain situations but in our case it seems to be a sensible choice see also cooley et al 2007 and sang and
