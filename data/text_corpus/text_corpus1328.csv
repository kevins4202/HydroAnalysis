of the hydrological cycle and one of the main components of the hydrological balance in the soil pereira et al 2015 being considered the greatest source of water loss from hydrological systems therefore its estimation is important for the sustainable management of hydrological resources with important applications in hydrological agricultural and environmental studies djaman et al 2017 however direct determination of et is difficult and expensive requiring specialized equipment and personnel therefore indirect estimates of et are fundamental to better plan the use of water resources there is a diverse range of models to calculate reference evapotranspiration et0 the penman monteith pm method parameterized by the food and agriculture organization fao has been used as a standard diverse agricultural and hydrological functions require daily evapotranspiration data martí et al 2015 however the majority of brazilian locations as well as in numerous other countries do not have meteorological data available to estimate evapotranspiration using the pm method in this case the temperature based methods like hargreaves and samani equation 1985 hs represent an alternative to estimate reference evapotranspiration with a limitation on meteorological data allen et al 1998 jensen et al 1997 sentelhas et al 2010 the hs equation is a simple empirical method that only requires the measurement of maximum and minimum air temperature data although there are recommendations that the hs method only be used for periods equal to or greater than five days hargreaves and allen 2003 there are studies that also indicate its efficiency for daily periods aguilar and polo 2011 conceição 2013 fernandes et al 2012 being considered a method of sufficient precision to apply in hydrological studies aguilar and polo 2011 sperna weiland et al 2012 given that the hs equation was developed for semi arid climate conditions in california usa it tends to overestimate et0 in humid regions and underestimate it in drier regions bezerra et al 2014 carvalho et al 2015 fanaya júnior et al 2012 kisi 2014 tagliaferre et al 2010 trajkovic 2007 therefore the hs equation needs to be calibrated for each location to improve et0 estimates according to different climatic conditions alencar et al 2015 allen et al 1998 fernandes et al 2012 jabloun and sahli 2008 martínez cob and tejero juste 2004 shiri et al 2015 xu and singh 2002 especially in regions with a rainy tropical climate where the efficiency of the temperature based models tends to be lower almorox et al 2015 diverse studies have proposed to calibrate the hs equation taking as a reference the standard pm methods for determination of local et0 berti et al 2014 gavilán et al 2006 maestre valero et al 2013 mendicino and senatore 2013 ravazzani et al 2012 shahidian et al 2013 vanderlinden et al 2004 in addition to local calibration numerous authors have proposed the regional calibration of the hs method in diverse ways seeking to improve et0 estimates and allowing the use of calibration in locations different to those where the method was adjusted berti et al 2014 droogers and allen 2002 lee 2010 maestre valero

et al 2012 thepadia and martinez 2012 vanderlinden et al 2004 water existing in the environment acts as an air temperature moderator in drier environments there is a tendency toward greater daily thermal amplitudes higher maximum temperatures and lower minimum temperatures as normally occurs in semiarid climates while in more humid environments the opposite tends to occur therefore based on knowledge of thermal air amplitude on a given day we can approximately describe its conditions of insolation and relative air humidity it is thought that this is the main factor for the efficiency of the hs equation given that according to priestley and taylor 1972 and samani 2000 solar radiation and temperature explain at least 80 of evapotranspiration variability therefore understanding that the hs equation presents better results in drier environments its results tend to be better on days with higher thermal amplitude this knowledge is used as a basis for a new method proposed for the calibration of the hs equation the use of daily thermal amplitude the objective of the present study was to propose a new form of calibration for the hs equation based on the use of the daily thermal amplitude as well as evaluating it comparing its performance with that of the other calibration methods under different meteorological conditions for tropical climate and with limited meteorological data 2 material and methods 2 1 area and data used in the study the present study was conducted for the state of espírito santo fig 1 with a total area of 46 184 1 km2 geographically situated between the meridians 39 38 and 41 50 longitude west and between the parallels 17 52 and 21 19 latitude south daily meteorological data provided by xavier et al 2015 was used from the period between 2009 and 2013 with maximum and minimum air temperature solar radiation maximum and minimum relative air humidity and wind speed information a quality control check for the raw data was performed previously by xavier et al 2015 meteorological data from nine automatic weather stations located in the state of espírito santo were used eight neighboring weather stations located outside the state were also included with a total of 17 weather stations used the description of the weather stations with the köppen climate classification alvares et al 2013 is presented in table 1 in most of the state the total mean annual rainfall ranges from 1000 to 1600 mm and the annual mean air temperature ranges from 18 to 24 c varying according to the climate of each region alvares et al 2013 in this study all days containing at least one variable with a failure in the data from the historical series were excluded given that the afonso cláudio weather station es did not present sufficient data to adjust the models 2012 and 2013 it was only used to test the adjustments performed 2 2 penman monteith fao 56 method pm the standard penman monteith fao 56 equation was applied to estimate evapotranspiration et0 pm with the values being used as a reference to adjust those estimated by the hs equation and to realize comparative tests the et0 pm was calculated according to allen et al 1998 the g value was considered equal to 0 and the albedo of the reference culture grass was equal to 0 23 2 3 penman monteith method with limitation of meteorological data pml for comparison the penman monteith method was also tested using only the air temperature data measured to determine et0 allen et al 1998 in the bulletin no 56 of the fao present the methodology that should be used in the absence of wind speed relative air humidity and solar radiation data wind speed estimates depend on local climate and the season of the year when wind speed data is not available the value 2 m s 1 can be used as an approximate estimate this value is an average of more than 2000 weather stations studied around the world allen et al 1998 in the absence of relative air humidity data or when it is of doubtful quality actual vapour pressure ea can be estimated by assuming that the dew point temperature tpo is close to minimum temperature tmin this implicitly supposes that at dawn when this temperature is close to tmin the air is practically saturated allen et al 1998 therefore ea was estimated using tmin to represent tpo in tetens equation for the calculation of the solar radiation rs mj m 2 d 1 eq 1 was used proposed by hargreaves and samani 1985 as a function of the minimum and maximum daily air temperatures tmax and tmin 1 r s k r s r a t max t min where ra is the extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2 d 1 and krs is the adjustment coefficient c 0 5 the krs value varied from 0 16 to 0 19 with 0 16 used for interior regions farther than 20 km from the ocean and 0 19 for coastal regions up to 20 km distant from the ocean hargreaves and samani 1985 the ra values were also calculated according to allen et al 1998 2 4 hargreaves and samani method 1985 hs the method proposed by hargreaves and samani 1985 was also used to estimate et0 which only required the measurements of the maximum and minimum air temperature data substituting the eq 1 in eq 2 the original hs equation used in this study was obtained eq 3 2 et 0 0 0135 r s λ t mean 17 8 3 et 0 hs 0 0023 r a λ t max t min t m e a n 17 8 where λ is the latent heat of water vaporization 2 45 mj kg 1 2 5 adjustment of evapotranspiration of the hargreaves and samani equation 1985 using simple linear regression allen et al 1998 in the bulletin fao no 56 recommend that where necessary the et0 adjustment obtained using the hs equation be realized with a simple linear regression equation in this case the pm method was adopted as an independent variable to perform the et0 adjustment of hs on a daily timeframe eq 4 4 et 0 a b et 0 hs four different types of adjustment by linear regression were realized 1 general adjustment using the data from all stations simultaneously 2 adjustment by climate type 3 adjustment by thermal amplitude class and 4 adjustment by thermal amplitude class for each climate type and 5 adjustment for season of the year dry and rainy these adjustments are described in the following items 2 6 general adjustment of evapotranspiration the et0 obtained by the hs equation was adjusted using simple linear regression and the data from all the weather stations presented in table 1 except for the afonso cláudio weather station in this manner the parameters for eq 4 were adjusted which were subsequently used to estimate reference evapotranspiration 2 7 adjustment of evapotranspiration for each climate type the state of espírito santo is made up of different climate types as determined by alvares et al 2013 table 1 in this study the et0 of the hs equation for each climatically homogenous region was adjusted six climate types aw am cfa cfb cwa and cwb that correspond to regions where weather stations used in this study are found were selected the weather stations with the matching climate type were selected with the values of the parameters of the linear regression in each climate being obtained following this the evapotranspiration of the adjustment by climate was estimated also using eq 4 2 8 adjustment of evapotranspiration by daily thermal amplitude class fig 2 presents the daily thermal amplitude data associated with the respective solar radiation fig 2a and relative humidity fig 2b values for all the weather stations in the present study linear relationships between thermal amplitude and solar radiation r 0 627 and between the thermal amplitude and relative air humidity r 0 628 both significant using the t test p 0 01 were observed therefore there is a tendency toward wider thermal amplitude on days with greater solar irradiation as well a tendency toward lower relative humidity measured on days with greater thermal amplitude therefore understanding that the hs equation presents better results in drier environments its results tend to be better on days with greater thermal amplitude with this knowledge being used as the basis for a new calibration method for the hs equation based on this premise 4 thermal amplitude classes were adopted in this study for the adjustment of et0 obtained using the original hs equation with two classes being above and two below the average 10 c fig 3 in this manner the parameters for the analysis of the linear regression were calculated for each thermal amplitude class and the evapotranspiration was estimated based on these adjustments using eq 4 2 9 adjustment of evapotranspiration by climate and daily thermal amplitude class the et0 obtained by the hs equation was also adjusted considering the climate types and the thermal amplitude classes the weather stations with the same climate type were selected and the data was divided into 4 thermal amplitude classes in this way the values of the parameters for the linear regression equation in each climate with their respective classes were obtained and the evapotranspiration was also estimated using eq 4 2 10 adjustment of evapotranspiration according to dry and rainy seasons given that the hs equation was originally developed in semiarid climatic conditions in california usa this method is more recommended for application in this type of context in southeastern brazil there are well defined dry and rainy seasons in the state of espírito santo the drier semester corresponds to april to september a period during which only around 25 of total annual precipitation occurs the rainiest season corresponds to the months from october to march with around 75 of the precipitation lima et al 2016 in this manner the adjustment of et0 using the hs equation was performed considering the dry and rainy seasons throughout the year in espírito santo firstly the months corresponding to each period were evaluated for all the weather stations used subsequently the parameters values for the linear regression of each period were obtained and the evapotranspiration of the adjustment by period was estimated once again using eq 4 2 11 evaluation of the performance of models to evaluate the results five statistical indices were used mean absolute error mae mean error mbe the root mean squared error rmse willmott 1982 relative rmse rrmse martí et al 2015 and the coefficient of determination of linear regression between the observed and estimated et0 r2 5 mae i 1 n y i y i n 6 mbe i 1 n y i y i n 7 rmse i 1 n y i y i 2 n 0 5 8 rrmse 1 y i 1 n y i y i 2 n 0 5 where y is the et0 estimated by the diverse methods evaluated y is the et0 obtained by pm reference and n is the number of data the evaluation of the performance of the models was realized individually by each one of the 16 weather stations used in the study in the performance evaluation for the models adjusted by linear regression the leave one out cross validation was used for each station evaluated the models were adjusted using the data from the other 15 stations that is the models were evaluated with data not used for their adjustment seeking to obtain a non tendentious evaluation given that the climates aw cfb and cwb only have one representative weather station in vitória es santa teresa es and caparaó mg respectively it was not possible to evaluate the performance of the adjustment by climate in these stations by cross validation the data for the afonso cláudio weather station was only used to test the models which were adjusted using all 16 weather stations 3 results and discussion table 2 presents the adjusted parameters for all the linear regression equations for adjustment of et0 estimated using the hs method with all being significant according to the f test p 0 01 in the cfb climate there is no complete data with thermal amplitude data above 15 c class 4 with the calibration proposed in this class therefore not being performed it can be seen that the adjustments were better for the larger thermal amplitude classes indicating a better correlation between the et0 estimated by the hs and pm methods under these meteorological conditions both in the general adjustment and in the adjustment by climate table 3 presents the statistical indicators for adjustment of the et0 estimated using the hs equation with and without calibration concerning the pm method separated into thermal amplitude classes it can be observed that the coefficient values for determination r2 increased with the increase in daily thermal amplitude both for calibrated et0 and for et0 without calibration this improvement was due to the homogeneity of the meteorological conditions of the days contained in the higher amplitude classes with such conditions being closer to the mediterranean climate in california usa characterized as drier where the hs equation was originally developed the adjustment of the hs equation using linear regression corrects the et0 without altering the r2 values as shown in fig 4 for thermal amplitude greater than 15 c class 4 this adjustment changes the inclination and the vertical position of the line of tendency without altering the data dispersion around it resulting in null mbe values this detail only can be seen putting et0 hs on the x axis analyzing the other statistical indicators we can perceive an improvement in the adjustment between the observed pm and estimated data by as much as 60 therefore the adjustment by daily thermal amplitude class provides estimation improvements of the et0 especially on days with greater evaporative demand on the air greater evapotranspiration according to table 4 with this being the condition which requires estimation improvements for evapotranspiration in general studies related to hydrological resource management fig 5 presents the dispersion graphs showing the quality of the adjustments of the methods evaluated in this study in comparison with the pm method applied simultaneously for all the weather stations the general performance of the models evaluated in this study from the statistical indices are found in table 5 generally in espírito santo the hs method overestimated the et0 by 0 47 mm day 1 mbe similar results were encountered by reis et al 2007 and carvalho et al 2015 in this same study though this value seems to be low it is a daily mean error that is if a daily sequential hydrological balance was realized there would be a cumulative error in the et0 of 172 mm per year which equals approximately 14 of the mean precipitation in the state lima et al 2016 the pml methods presented the worst performance of the methods differing on average by 1 46 mm day 1 from the pm method martinez and thepadia 2010 using 72 weather stations in florida obtained similar performance for the pml and hs methods in which the hs method provided better estimates for et0 than the pml method generally adjustments by linear regression obtained a performance 30 better than the original hs method additionally it should be highlighted that independent stations were used in this study using cross validation to test the performance of the adjustments by linear regression using the statistical indicators it was found that the adjustment by climate and class of thermal amplitude presented the best performance of the methods evaluated the adjustments by thermal amplitude class by climate and by season presented similar performance the general adjustment also presented satisfactory performance showing little difference in relation to the other methods adjusted by linear regression these same behaviors are corroborated by the performance of the adjustments in afonso cláudio es table 6 in which data was used exclusively for the test tables 7 and 8 present the performance of the adjustments in the locations where their best and worst results were observed as expected the hargreaves and samani method 1985 presented the best et0 estimates in locations with a drier climate such as linhares es aw climate and worse estimates in locations with a humid climate such as caparaó mg cwb climate table 1 this shows the need for the local calibration of the hs equation to improve the et0 estimates depending on different climatic conditions alencar et al 2015 allen et al 1998 fernandes et al 2012 shiri et al 2015 the rmse values for the pml method in espírito santo varied between 1 07 and 2 08 mm per day these values were higher than those found for the daily estimates in bulgaria tunisia and in the mediterranean by popova et al 2006 0 52 0 58 mm day 1 jabloun and sahli 2008 0 41 0 80 mm day 1 and todorovic et al 2013 0 60 0 65 mm day 1 respectively in southeastern brazil carvalho et al 2015 observed values between 0 05 and 0 85 mm day 1 this may have occurred due to these authors using a shorter meteorological data series different to the one used in this study 2008 2011 the adjustment methods by linear regression presented the best performance in serra dos aimorés mg and the worst performance in presidente kennedy es in the location presenting the worst performance the adjustment methods by regression underestimated the et0 presenting an mae of around 0 78 mm day 1 in diverse regions of the planet where there are well defined dry and rainy seasons it is common for dry spells to occur during rainy seasons and vice versa which is a limitation for adjustment by rainy and dry season additionally in regions where there are no well defined rainy or dry seasons such as in southern brazil this type of adjustment is unviable therefore the adjustment by thermal amplitude class using simple linear regression represents a promising alternative for the calibration of et0 calculated by the hs equation this is because it is an easily applied method that allows the correction of the et0 according to the meteorological condition for each day individually using the data necessary to estimate the et0 with the hs equation therefore it does not require additional meteorological data as long as one has available thermal amplitude data this method can also be used to calibrate all the methods to estimate et0 based on air temperature even using a 5 year meteorological data series the adjustments by linear regression provide satisfactory estimates for the et0 however new studies to calibrate the hargreaves and samani equation 1985 by linear regression should be performed in other regions of brazil with a more extensive meteorological data series seeking to provide better et0 estimates 4 conclusions based on the et0 obtained by the original hargreaves and samani equation the adjustment by climate and by thermal amplitude class provided smaller errors in the et0 estimates in the state of espírito santo the method for general adjustment was considered the most recommendable of the methods tested due to its simple application and for not presenting a significant difference in relation to the better methods tested with limited meteorological data presenting only available air temperature data the use of the pml method is not recommended to estimate daily evapotranspiration in increasing order of efficiency the methods to estimate evapotranspiration with limited meteorological data are pml original hs equation general adjustment of et0 estimated with the hs equation adjustment by thermal amplitude class adjustment by climate type adjustment by season dry or rainy and adjustment by climate and class conflict of interest the authors declared that there is no conflict of interest acknowledgements the authors wish to

was obtained eq 3 2 et 0 0 0135 r s λ t mean 17 8 3 et 0 hs 0 0023 r a λ t max t min t m e a n 17 8 where λ is the latent heat of water vaporization 2 45 mj kg 1 2 5 adjustment of evapotranspiration of the hargreaves and samani equation 1985 using simple linear regression allen et al 1998 in the bulletin fao no 56 recommend that where necessary the et0 adjustment obtained using the hs equation be realized with a simple linear regression equation in this case the pm method was adopted as an independent variable to perform the et0 adjustment of hs on a daily timeframe eq 4 4 et 0 a b et 0 hs four different types of adjustment by linear regression were realized 1 general adjustment using the data from all stations simultaneously 2 adjustment by climate type 3 adjustment by thermal amplitude class and 4 adjustment by thermal amplitude class for each climate type and 5 adjustment for season of the year dry and rainy these adjustments are described in the following items 2 6 general adjustment of evapotranspiration the et0 obtained by the hs equation was adjusted using simple linear regression and the data from all the weather stations presented in table 1 except for the afonso cláudio weather station in this manner the parameters for eq 4 were adjusted which were subsequently used to estimate reference evapotranspiration 2 7 adjustment of evapotranspiration for each climate type the state of espírito santo is made up of different climate types as determined by alvares et al 2013 table 1 in this study the et0 of the hs equation for each climatically homogenous region was adjusted six climate types aw am cfa cfb cwa and cwb that correspond to regions where weather stations used in this study are found were selected the weather stations with the matching climate type were selected with the values of the parameters of the linear regression in each climate being obtained following this the evapotranspiration of the adjustment by climate was estimated also using eq 4 2 8 adjustment of evapotranspiration by daily thermal amplitude class fig 2 presents the daily thermal amplitude data associated with the respective solar radiation fig 2a and relative humidity fig 2b values for all the weather stations in the present study linear relationships between thermal amplitude and solar radiation r 0 627 and between the thermal amplitude and relative air humidity r 0 628 both significant using the t test p 0 01 were observed therefore there is a tendency toward wider thermal amplitude on days with greater solar irradiation as well a tendency toward lower relative humidity measured on days with greater thermal amplitude therefore understanding that the hs equation presents better results in drier environments its results tend to be better on days with greater thermal amplitude with this knowledge being used as the basis for a new calibration method for the hs equation based on this premise 4 thermal amplitude classes were adopted in this study for the adjustment of et0 obtained using the original hs equation with two classes being above and two below the average 10 c fig 3 in this manner the parameters for the analysis of the linear regression were calculated for each thermal amplitude class and the evapotranspiration was estimated based on these adjustments using eq 4 2 9 adjustment of evapotranspiration by climate and daily thermal amplitude class the et0 obtained by the hs equation was also adjusted considering the climate types and the thermal amplitude classes the weather stations with the same climate type were selected and the data was divided into 4 thermal amplitude classes in this way the values of the parameters for the linear regression equation in each climate with their respective classes were obtained and the evapotranspiration was also estimated using eq 4 2 10 adjustment of evapotranspiration according to dry and rainy seasons given that the hs equation was originally developed in semiarid climatic conditions in california usa this method is more recommended for application in this type of context in southeastern brazil there are well defined dry and rainy seasons in the state of espírito santo the drier semester corresponds to april to september a period during which only around 25 of total annual precipitation occurs the rainiest season corresponds to the months from october to march with around 75 of the precipitation lima et al 2016 in this manner the adjustment of et0 using the hs equation was performed considering the dry and rainy seasons throughout the year in espírito santo firstly the months corresponding to each period were evaluated for all the weather stations used subsequently the parameters values for the linear regression of each period were obtained and the evapotranspiration of the adjustment by period was estimated once again using eq 4 2 11 evaluation of the performance of models to evaluate the results five statistical indices were used mean absolute error mae mean error mbe the root mean squared error rmse willmott 1982 relative rmse rrmse martí et al 2015 and the coefficient of determination of linear regression between the observed and estimated et0 r2 5 mae i 1 n y i y i n 6 mbe i 1 n y i y i n 7 rmse i 1 n y i y i 2 n 0 5 8 rrmse 1 y i 1 n y i y i 2 n 0 5 where y is the et0 estimated by the diverse methods evaluated y is the et0 obtained by pm reference and n is the number of data the evaluation of the performance of the models was realized individually by each one of the 16 weather stations used in the study in the performance evaluation for the models adjusted by linear regression the leave one out cross validation was used for each station evaluated the models were adjusted using the data from the other 15 stations that is the models were evaluated with data not used for their adjustment seeking to obtain a non tendentious evaluation given that the climates aw cfb and cwb only have one representative weather station in vitória es santa teresa es and caparaó mg respectively it was not possible to evaluate the performance of the adjustment by climate in these stations by cross validation the data for the afonso cláudio weather station was only used to test the models which were adjusted using all 16 weather stations 3 results and discussion table 2 presents the adjusted parameters for all the linear regression equations for adjustment of et0 estimated using the hs method with all being significant according to the f test p 0 01 in the cfb climate there is no complete data with thermal amplitude data above 15 c class 4 with the calibration proposed in this class therefore not being performed it can be seen that the adjustments were better for the larger thermal amplitude classes indicating a better correlation between the et0 estimated by the hs and pm methods under these meteorological conditions both in the general adjustment and in the adjustment by climate table 3 presents the statistical indicators for adjustment of the et0 estimated using the hs equation with and without calibration concerning the pm method separated into thermal amplitude classes it can be observed that the coefficient values for determination r2 increased with the increase in daily thermal amplitude both for calibrated et0 and for et0 without calibration this improvement was due to the homogeneity of the meteorological conditions of the days contained in the higher amplitude classes with such conditions being closer to the mediterranean climate in california usa characterized as drier where the hs equation was originally developed the adjustment of the hs equation using linear regression corrects the et0 without altering the r2 values as shown in fig 4 for thermal amplitude greater than 15 c class 4 this adjustment changes the inclination and the vertical position of the line of tendency without altering the data dispersion around it resulting in null mbe values this detail only can be seen putting et0 hs on the x axis analyzing the other statistical indicators we can perceive an improvement in the adjustment between the observed pm and estimated data by as much as 60 therefore the adjustment by daily thermal amplitude class provides estimation improvements of the et0 especially on days with greater evaporative demand on the air greater evapotranspiration according to table 4 with this being the condition which requires estimation improvements for evapotranspiration in general studies related to hydrological resource management fig 5 presents the dispersion graphs showing the quality of the adjustments of the methods evaluated in this study in comparison with the pm method applied simultaneously for all the weather stations the general performance of the models evaluated in this study from the statistical indices are found in table 5 generally in espírito santo the hs method overestimated the et0 by 0 47 mm day 1 mbe similar results were encountered by reis et al 2007 and carvalho et al 2015 in this same study though this value seems to be low it is a daily mean error that is if a daily sequential hydrological balance was realized there would be a cumulative error in the et0 of 172 mm per year which equals approximately 14 of the mean precipitation in the state lima et al 2016 the pml methods presented the worst performance of the methods differing on average by 1 46 mm day 1 from the pm method martinez and thepadia 2010 using 72 weather stations in florida obtained similar performance for the pml and hs methods in which the hs method provided better estimates for et0 than the pml method generally adjustments by linear regression obtained a performance 30 better than the original hs method additionally it should be highlighted that independent stations were used in this study using cross validation to test the performance of the adjustments by linear regression using the statistical indicators it was found that the adjustment by climate and class of thermal amplitude presented the best performance of the methods evaluated the adjustments by thermal amplitude class by climate and by season presented similar performance the general adjustment also presented satisfactory performance showing little difference in relation to the other methods adjusted by linear regression these same behaviors are corroborated by the performance of the adjustments in afonso cláudio es table 6 in which data was used exclusively for the test tables 7 and 8 present the performance of the adjustments in the locations where their best and worst results were observed as expected the hargreaves and samani method 1985 presented the best et0 estimates in locations with a drier climate such as linhares es aw climate and worse estimates in locations with a humid climate such as caparaó mg cwb climate table 1 this shows the need for the local calibration of the hs equation to improve the et0 estimates depending on different climatic conditions alencar et al 2015 allen et al 1998 fernandes et al 2012 shiri et al 2015 the rmse values for the pml method in espírito santo varied between 1 07 and 2 08 mm per day these values were higher than those found for the daily estimates in bulgaria tunisia and in the mediterranean by popova et al 2006 0 52 0 58 mm day 1 jabloun and sahli 2008 0 41 0 80 mm day 1 and todorovic et al 2013 0 60 0 65 mm day 1 respectively in southeastern brazil carvalho et al 2015 observed values between 0 05 and 0 85 mm day 1 this may have occurred due to these authors using a shorter meteorological data series different to the one used in this study 2008 2011 the adjustment methods by linear regression presented the best performance in serra dos aimorés mg and the worst performance in presidente kennedy es in the location presenting the worst performance the adjustment methods by regression underestimated the et0 presenting an mae of around 0 78 mm day 1 in diverse regions of the planet where there are well defined dry and rainy seasons it is common for dry spells to occur during rainy seasons and vice versa which is a limitation for adjustment by rainy and dry season additionally in regions where there are no well defined rainy or dry seasons such as in southern brazil this type of adjustment is unviable therefore the adjustment by thermal amplitude class using simple linear regression represents a promising alternative for the calibration of et0 calculated by the hs equation this is because it is an easily applied method that allows the correction of the et0 according to the meteorological condition for each day individually using the data necessary to estimate the et0 with the hs equation therefore it does not require additional meteorological data as long as one has available thermal amplitude data this method can also be used to calibrate all the methods to estimate et0 based on air temperature even using a 5 year meteorological data series the adjustments by linear regression provide satisfactory estimates for the et0 however new studies to calibrate the hargreaves and samani equation 1985 by linear regression should be performed in other regions of brazil with a more extensive meteorological data series seeking to provide better et0 estimates 4 conclusions based on the et0 obtained by the original hargreaves and samani equation the adjustment by climate and by thermal amplitude class provided smaller errors in the et0 estimates in the state of espírito santo the method for general adjustment was considered the most recommendable of the methods tested due to its simple application and for not presenting a significant difference in relation to the better methods tested with limited meteorological data presenting only available air temperature data the use of the pml method is not recommended to estimate daily evapotranspiration in increasing order of efficiency the methods to estimate evapotranspiration with limited meteorological data are pml original hs equation general adjustment of et0 estimated with the hs equation adjustment by thermal amplitude class adjustment by climate type adjustment by season dry or rainy and adjustment by climate and class conflict of interest the authors declared that there is no conflict of interest acknowledgements the authors wish to

6641,this paper investigates the residual nutrient load from a combined sewer system along the shore of a deep italian lake to provide data that can help explaining the contribution of combined sewers to lakes eutrophication to this purpose a stochastic methodology is applied to the analysis of the combined sewer overflows and pollutants that provides reliable estimates with related uncertainties of the storage capacity to be supplied in order to mitigate the impact on the quality of receiving waters the sewer is modeled by swmm and two terminal combined sewer weirs are modeled in detail and instrumented for calibration purposes a year long campaign was accomplished allowing to study the occurrence and relevance of the first flush the calibrated model of the sewer network was used to extrapolate the results to a 10 years period thus providing a statistically reliable estimate of the residual load delivered from this watershed to the lake a conservative evaluation shows that up to 22 of phosphorus and up to 41 of nitrogen delivered to the sewer are still discharged into the environment however the results also show that in this case a relatively small capture volume would obtain a target pollution reduction thus providing insights on the feasibility of this structural practice in similar watersheds along the shore of endangered lakes keywords water quality monitoring combined sewer modelling lakes eutrophication 1 introduction eutrophication is a major threat to lake waters quality worldwide mostly due to phosphorus p and nitrogen n delivery from diffuse and point sources in anthropized watersheds e g schindler et al 2008 the diversion of sewage through the development of combined urban drainage systems is a common practice in endangered lake areas but water quality improvements have often been less effective than expected combined sewer systems are the prevalent sewage collection system in urban areas which evolved from the sprawl of old settlements in these systems under dry conditions sanitary waters supply the sewage discharge while under wet weather conditions stormwaters are collected and conveyed through the same conduits mixing with sanitary waters during heavy precipitations sewage exceeding the conveyance capacity of the sewer network or the treatment plant processing capacity is discharged into surface waters as combined sewer overflows csos the actual amount of nutrients flushed by csos depends on the local climate on the imperviousness of the drained catchment on the introduction of so called best practices to deal with stormwater and on the operational management of the sewer in dry weather periods in general the rationale supporting the technical acceptance of csos is that 1 a combined sewer cannot be sized to efficiently deal with both ordinary sewage flow and peak stormwater discharges 2 the renewal time of the cso receiving body is short and 3 the sewage pollutant concentration during wet weather periods decreases due to dilution owing to violation of these assumptions in the past the environmental impact of csos has often been underestimated in fact during wet weather periods csos may deliver substantial amounts of contaminants such as nutrients heavy metals sediments wastewater micropollutants and microorganisms bryan ellis and yu 1995 chebbo et al 2001 whose impact on the quality of receiving water bodies cannot be overlooked sartor and boyd 1972 epa 1993 2009 tibbetts 2005 moreover in strongly urbanized areas stormwaters are themselves contaminated by diffuse sources novotny 2002 so that during wet weather periods mixing often does not yield the assumed dilution hence this issue has been studied from various perspectives assessing the occurrence of the first flush phenomenon i e of the concentration of most pollutant mass during the first part of the overflow event saget et al 1996 bertrand krajewski et al 1998 deletic 1998 sansalone and cristina 2004 bach et al 2010 evaluating the efficiency of stormwater storage tanks balistrocchi et al 2009 wang and guo 2018 reducing the impact on receiving water bodies freni et al 2010 todeschini et al 2011 improving sampling techniques for quality monitoring mccarthy et al 2018 and analysing the interaction with climate change salerno et al 2018 owing to their long renewal time pilotti et al 2014 deep lakes are particularly sensitive to the pollution effects of csos whose contribution has been identified as a constraint to water quality improvement in several large lakes in the world e g sekaluvu et al 2018 a technical solutions was found in extended storage capacities such as the construction of deep tunnels and reservoirs for temporary csos storage e g lyandres and welch 2012 however to our knowledge very few studies have so far quantified the contribution of the csos to nutrients load in deep european lakes and none in the italian area in italy all the great prealpine lakes lake maggiore lugano como iseo and garda with maximum depths between 256 and 410 m fig 1 a are surrounded by important urban settlements where combined sewers predominate and are under scrutiny for the increase in nutrient concentrations and the decrease in hypolimnetic oxygen content the case of lake iseo is particularly relevant this lake 50 years ago used to be fully oxygenated as far as its maximum depth at 256 m while is now anoxic under 100 m salmaso and mosello 2010 lake iseo drains a large watershed valle camonica about 1450 km2 whose strong economic development led in the past to an uncontrolled pollution of oglio river its main tributary in addition the lake drains many small watersheds whose combined sewers drain to a centralised wastewater treatment plant about 20 years ago a combined sewer pipe was completed along the eastern lake shore to improve its water quality solid black line in fig 1b which collects and delivers the sewage from 9 municipal sewer systems to the waste water treatment plant located at the lake outlet since the capacity of the combined sewer was limited to low return period rainfall events combined sewer weirs csws were located at the connection with the municipal sewers on the assumption that the pollutant concentrations from the csos during wet weather periods were low in fact it was empirically reckoned that the overall contribution of csos to the p load could range between 0 and 3 of the overall yearly load to the sewer garibaldi et al 1998 however although no data has been measured or any modelling effort undertaken to actually quantify this process in lake iseo to the date of this research these assumptions are presumably wrong without quantitative data in the italian prealpine area as in many other lakes elsewhere it is difficult to step over a legislation that is based on the maximum effluent concentrations in favour of an approach based on the nutrient cumulative effects that are particularly relevant for lakes therefore we believe that every effort to increase the body of knowledge on this contribution is justified bearing in mind the long renewal times of deep lakes a long term assessment of nutrient residual loads associated with csos is a crucial piece of information that must be known before any restoration strategy is undertaken unfortunately pollutant transport dynamic in combined sewer systems is affected by a number of physical chemical climatic hydraulic and hydrologic factors so that it configures as a very site specific phenomenon this requires complex and computationally intensive numerical simulations conducted for long time periods further simulation outcomes must be statistically characterised in this paper an alternative stochastic approach based on monte carlo simulations is suggested to this purpose 1 we modeled in detail the hydraulic hydrologic behaviour of two municipal sewer systems located along the shore of lake iseo obtaining a calibrated modeling framework for the occurrence of csos 2 we instrumented a representative csw where we monitored eighteen cso events measuring total nitrogen tn and phosphorus tp chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solids tss and biological oxygen demand bod then 3 the data measured during the experimental campaign were extrapolated to a longer period by using the calibrated model with a 10 year long rainfall record a probabilistic estimation of the sewage volumes disposed into lake by the sewer csws and of the corresponding tp and tn loads was accomplished finally 4 the obtained results were used to estimate by a monte carlo approach the capture volume that would be needed in a detention tank to obtain a target reduction of the disposed pollution load overall we believe that this paper also provides important insights regarding other watersheds located in areas with similar climatic features and anthropic pressure so contributing to a better understanding of the relevance of lakes eutrophication problem 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area we considered two relatively small urban rural catchments provaglio d iseo and corte franca with similar municipal sewer systems located along the eastern coastal area of lake iseo the sub alpine lake iseo area of 61 km2 maximum depth of 256 m is the fifth largest italian lake in terms of volume it is located in the region of lombardy see fig 1a in an area characterised by the presence of several other deep and large lakes during the second half of the 20th century it underwent a transition from oligotrophy to eutrophy and the oxygen content of the bottom waters decreased from 9 mg l in 1967 to zero from mid 1995 s till the mid 2000 s pilotti et al 2014 undoubtedly the human pressure in the lake s watershed can be blamed for the gradual increase of the trophic level coupled with the accumulation of nutrients deriving from the limited exchange of deep waters from this viewpoint the situation is further hindered by current climatic trends that might completely prevent the regular overturn of deep waters valerio et al 2015 having in mind the quantification of the residual load from the entire main sewer draining the eastern shore of the lake we started from the contribution of the municipal sewers whose hydrology is very similar we focused our attention on the csw located at the junction of the corte franca cf in the following municipal sewer with the main pipe red dot in fig 1b this csw is one of the most important for the discharged volumes and its proximity to the lake in a protected natural wetland between two important touristic settlements accordingly the contribution of this csw in an area characterized by strong submerged macrophytes growth during summer could be relevant both for lake eutrophication and for potential bacterial pollution to this end we monitored the csw sampling csos and implemented a model using epa s swmm storm water management model software to better understand the hydraulics of the sewer 2 2 the hydraulic hydrological model of corte franca watershed the corte franca cf combined sewer system fig 1c is composed of the main network and of two minor subnetworks nigoline and borgonato which are connected to the main one by two pumping stations due to lack of geometric data the hydraulics of these two subnetworks were not modeled and their contributions transferred directly from the pumping stations to the municipal network the diameter of the conduits of the combined sewer system varies from 125 mm to 800 mm and they are made in concrete and pvc for an overall length of 19 km along the sewer system there are 20 small csws the total area drained by the sewer provided by the public body in charge of the urban water cycle management ato ambito territoriale ottimale is 2 9 km2 considering that 45 of the area is served by separated sewer the area that generates runoff during wet weather is 1 6 km2 to obtain a careful quantification of the impervious surfaces a land use classification was carried out through a colour band analysis of the recent satellite sentinel 2 images with a 10 m spatial resolution the resulting land use map is shown in fig 2 where the urbanized areas drained by the sewer system is evidenced this area totally amounts to 0 6 km2 and approximately 40 can be regarded as totally impervious to compute the dry weather loads the total area was divided in 191 sub catchments one for each sewer junction by assuming that the population density is uniformly distributed in the basin the dry weather loads were calculated by multiplying the measured per capita water supply equal to 300 l p e d by the number of equivalent inhabitants of the area of interest the per capita water supply values were obtained by the analysis of the daily volume delivered by the drinking water plants of the municipalities in addition to normal dry weather flow condition the touristic seasonal loads were calculated by using data provided by the national institute of statistics istat so that the dry weather flow presents a monthly pattern the actual geometrical characteristics of each conduit and manhole of the sewer were implemented in the model the pumping stations functioning was described in detail by inserting the storage unit s dimensions the pump characteristic curves the geometrical data of delivery conduits and the startup and shutoff depths of pumps the csws have a fundamental role and were included in swmm by describing the characteristics of the weirs and the possible presence of sluice gates as infiltration model we used a constant infiltration capacity f p mm h since during intense events that may cause a cso the reduction of infiltration capacity in urban areas is negligible the value of f p was obtained by calibration we evaluated that 40 of the urban area is totally impervious characterised by f p 0 m m h whereas in the remaining area f p 3 m m h three davis rainfall gauges with resolution of 0 2 mm and sensor type tipping bucket with magnetic reed switch were placed within the cf watershed fig 1c for more than a year measuring cumulative rainfall every minute the discharge delivered to the municipal sewer outlet where the monitored csw is located was measured during the same period another raingauge station managed by the regional agency for environmental protection arpa lombardia is located in sarnico about 4 km north west of cf see fig 1 panel b and provided a continuous series from 2007 recorded at 10 time step the monitoring of the terminal csw at cf allowed us to firstly set up a hydraulic model of this device and to calibrate the rainfall runoff model of the sewer network despite the considerable level of complexity of the csw a 1 dimensional model was found to provide a satisfactory representation of the overflow process see details in supplementary material smi 2 3 the hydraulic hydrological model of provaglio watershed the provaglio d iseo pv sewer system is characterised by the presence of a single csw located immediately upstream of the junction of the municipal sewer with the main sewer pipe thus the measured inflow upstream of the csw is the total flow entering the main sewer this csw discharges during wet weather in the wetland area called torbiere d iseo which is in close communication with lake iseo since the geometrical information of the municipal sewer systems under study was not available a complete survey of sewer systems was carried out the industrial part of the basin is drained by a separated sewer system and its dry weather flow enters the municipal sewer downstream of the csw the remaining drained pv area equal to 1 1 km2 was classified using the sentinel 2 satellite images as previously explained obtaining an urbanized drained area of 0 45 km2 the combined pv sewer is mainly made of concrete pipes the diameters range from 160 mm to 1600 mm for an overall length of 13 km at each network junction the value of drained area was assessed by visual inspection of the drained subcatchments the dry period input discharges to the sewer were distributed along the network considering the local population density rainfall was measured at a rain gauge located inside the watershed fig 1b the csw of provaglio consists in an oblique weir whose efficiency is increased by the backwater produced by a gate by using monitoring data a suitable 1 dimensional hydraulic model was set up and calibrated for this device as well see details in supplementary material smii 2 4 model calibration and validation due to the complexity of the cf sewer system which has inter alia 20 csws distributed in the watershed and 6 pumping stations we used for the cf watershed the parameters obtained by the calibration of the watershed and municipal sewer of pv that has similar characteristics but only a single csw located at the outlet of the network to this purpose rainfall in the pv watershed and discharge at the csw were measured for a period of 7 months the hydrologic parameters of the pv model were calibrated by working on single rainfall runoff events comparing the measured discharge hydrograph at the csw with the modelled one for the period 10 03 2018 13 03 2018 fig 3 a the model was then validated for the period 01 03 2018 05 04 2018 an example of model validation is shown in fig 3b fig 3c and 3d show the comparison between the measured discharge hydrograph approaching the final csw of corte franca in blue and the modelled discharge hydrograph in red for two rainfall events of 01 05 2017 03 05 2017 and 05 11 2017 06 11 2017 when the same set of optimized hydrologic parameters were applied to the cf model as one can observe the match is very satisfactory with a maximum error on the hydrograph volume of 4 in the event of panel d the coefficients of linear correlation between measured and modelled data are 0 882 panel a 0 844 panel b 0 919 panel c and 0 944 panel d 2 5 nutrients dynamic assessment in november 2017 we installed an automatic sampler isco 3700 at the csw of corte franca see green dot in fig smi 1 to collect cso samples equipped with 24 ½ liter bottles the sampling was carried out by aspiration using a peristaltic pump the sampling interval was set equal to 10 min and the sampler was set up to collect two samples of 250 ml in each bottle in this way it was possible to characterize the overflowing sewage during an 8 hour long event after collection the samples were transported through a portable refrigerator to the laboratory to quantify tp and tn concentrations since the sampler is not refrigerated we took care to collect the samples as soon as possible after the end of the events overall a total of 18 cso events and 242 samples were analysed unfiltered water samples were analysed for tp and tn concentrations with standard spectrophotometric perkin elmer lambda 35 methods as soluble reactive phosphorus and nitrate after alkaline peroxydisulfate oxidation valderrama 1981 when operative conditions made it possible the laboratory carried out also analysis of cod 7 events apha 2012 bod5 2 events uni en 1899 1 2001 and total suspended solids tss 4 events apat cnr irsa 2090 b man 2003 to identify possible correlations between the pollutants the dates of cso events when the stormwater runoff samples were collected are summarized in table 1 along with the parameters measured in laboratory and the numbers of samples for each event during all these events the discharge hydrograph of the incoming flow and of the cso was either measured or computed using the estimated stage discharge relationship in order to study the phenomenon of first flush the dimensionless diagrams of pollutant loads and discharge volumes firstly proposed by bertrand krajewski et al 1998 and herein called dimensionless cumulative load curves dcl curves see fig 4 were used in these diagrams the ratio υ between cumulative and total runoff volume is reported on x axis and the ratio λ between cumulative pollution load and total pollution load is reported on y axis the empirical dcl curves can be fitted by the power function in eq 1 ma et al 2011 where the greater the first flush the smaller the value of the exponent b is when the first flush is absent b 1 1 λ υ b this approach was preferred to other solutions despite the deficiencies regarding its arbitrary definition of first flush which can be overcome by using non parametric statistical analyses bach et al 2010 actually eq 1 makes it possible to implement monte carlo simulation procedures to size the capture volume needed to mitigate the impact of the csos with reference to a performance target the first flush analysis focused on total phosphorus and total nitrogen that are widely recognised as responsible for the eutrophication process in lakes 2 6 estimation of nutrients residual load to the lake the calibrated hydrodynamic model of cf s sewer network was used to perform a 10 year long from 2007 to 2016 continuous simulation to assess the wet and the dry weather sewage produced in the long term period to this purpose we used the rainfall data of the sarnico rain gauge recorded with a 10 min time step in this way a continuous time series of csos directly discharged into lake iseo through the monitored csw was computed in the absence of a calibrated quality model monte carlo simulation techniques kottegoda and rosso 2008 offered an effective alternative to predict the nutrients residual load associated with these overflow discharges indeed samples of overflow events along with their qualitative and quantitative characteristics can be generated by assuming that the parameters describing the pollutant dynamics are random variables their variability was expressed by suitable probability distributions fitted with respect to a sample of independent events derived from the simulated series to this purpose the continuous series of overflow discharges was discretized into individual independent overflow events through a peak over threshold criterion corrected with a minimum inter event period lang et al 1999 bacchi et al 2008 implemented into two phases 1 individual overflows were sampled from the continuous series as the part of the overflow hydrograph exceeding a discharge threshold used to eliminate from the sample minor overflow events that convey negligible volumes 2 two subsequent individual overflows were assumed to be independent when separated by an inter event period longer than the minimum one otherwise they were joined in a single event in the following a threshold discharge of 10 0 l s and a minimum inter event period of 3 0 h were adopted when relevant detention capacities are not present in the watershed two subsequent csos can be considered independent if they are separated by a period almost equal to the time of concentration in this watershed such a time is far shorter than the minimum interevent period suggested for urban application which is set at 3 0 h adams and papa 2000 the threshold flow discharge was selected in order to have a csos minimum volume slightly greater than 1 0 m3 but also considering that the choice of a greater threshold would have yielded a significant underestimation of the total annual overflow volume accordingly the average annual number ω of individual independent events was computed along with the volume v of total overflow discharge occurring during the event that is including the flow discharge below the threshold typical tp and tn concentrations were already known by the analysis of measured overflow events in order to run monte carlo simulations a sample of ω overflow events was generated for each simulation year each event was featured by the overflow volume v the event mean concentration emc and the exponent b of the dcl curve randomly varying according to their univariate probability distributions as customary in monte carlo simulation procedures this assumption is justified if the different variables are mutually independent as supported in this case by the empirical evidence presented in the following in this way if a sufficiently long time series is used annual balances of nutrient loads and overflow volumes can be computed with reliable estimates of their expected value and uncertainty herein quantified in terms of standard deviation 3 results and discussion 3 1 nutrients dynamic assessment the main characteristics of the monitored cso events are reported in table 1 where the rainfall events are delineated in terms of depth duration maximum intensity and antecedent dry weather period while the pollutant dynamic is summarized by the observed emc of tn and tp and the exponent b of the power functions 1 fitted to the empirical dcl curves fig 4 statistics of these quality parameters are reported as well the measured samples reflect a wide range of rainfall events and initial conditions in the network and the analysed nutrients show very similar pollutant dynamics apart from the order of magnitude emcs aleatory variability are comparable since the variation coefficient estimates show analogous dispersions around the mean and statistics of exponent b have almost identical values tp and tn concentrations are within the upper range of concentrations measured in other csos gervin and brix 2001 barco et al 2008 brombach et al 2005 salerno et al 2018 and were from 30 to 7 times higher compared to those previously measured in the lake s tributaries garibaldi et al 1999 in general the pattern of both dcl curves shown in fig 4 ranges from the proportional transport when b is equal to 1 00 to a moderate strong first flush b equal to 0 39 according to the first flush definition proposed by bertrand krajewski et al 1998 no dcl curve shows a strong first flush as 80 of the pollutant load is always transported by a percentage of the overflow volume greater than 30 on average a moderate weak first flush featured by an exponent b value of 0 70 is experienced for both nutrients a correlation analysis was carried out to identify significant statistical relationships between the quality parameters and the rainfall characteristics to this end the kendall rank correlation coefficient and the pearson linear correlation were used since the kendall coefficient is independent of the marginal distributions it can effectively measure the association degree of not necessarily elliptic dependence structures the estimated coefficients are listed in table 2 where values significantly different from zero are underlined and boldface this condition is satisfied if the p value of the independence test is less than 5 a general mutual independence of the analysed variables is evidenced by low coefficient values which cannot be considered significantly different from zero the only exception is given by the couples of the antecedent dry weather period a and the exponent b of both nutrients these correlations indicate quite strong and significant discordant associations thus the greater the antecedent dry weather period the strongest the nutrients first flush is the results obtained when the tp emc is coupled with the antecedent dry weather period a the wet weather duration d and the rainfall depth h nevertheless deserve a brief discussion in the first two cases the pearson coefficient is significantly different from zero while the kendall coefficient the most reliable one is not in addition the kendall coefficient value is low therefore this appears to be a spurious linear correlation related to the very small variability of the tp emcs with respect to that of the antecedent dry weather period in the third case the contrary occurs yet the discordance strength detected through the kendall coefficients is quite low and its significance slightly less than 5 could be due to the small sample size which yields high estimation variance it is worth highlighting that in this climate the antecedent dry weather period is independent of the other variables of the rainfall process balistrocchi and bacchi 2011 on the one hand a simple stochastic modelling relying on independent univariate distributions is therefore suitable to represent the nutrient transport dynamic on the other hand independence is basically an expression of a strong natural variability so that mean annual values could not be representative of trend values and a suitable estimate of the uncertainty is mandatory to achieve meaningful assessments in consideration of the gentle slopes and the low degree of impermeable covers featuring the catchment surfaces the most compelling cause for the significant discordant association relating to the antecedent dry weather period and the dcl parameters is the accumulation of organic sediments in the sewer pipes in dry periods actually simulations reveal a generalized problem of low sewage flow velocities in most of the network more precisely in dry periods flow velocities are averagely equal to 0 55 m s but in many pipes almost 30 of the total network length located primarily in the upstream portions of the network and next to its outlet velocities less than 0 30 m s are computed when the critical shear stress is exceeded due to the storm water wash off see for instance ahyerre et al 2000 and references therein it is reasonable to suppose that the sudden resuspension of settled particulate matter and nutrients is the leading cause of the first flush occurrence on the other hand the poor correlation of the first flush occurrence with respect to maximum rainfall intensity can be explained considering that the conveyance capacity of the sewer in wet periods is insufficient so that the shear stress limit is exceeded even by low return period storms less than 5 years finally plots in fig 5 show correlations between measured pollutant concentrations during csos events a significant linear correlation between tp and tn concentrations is observed with a tn tp ratio of about 5 which is consistent with the expected range for civil sewage this strong correlation further confirms the previously discussed similarities between the tn and the tp transport dynamics moreover in passing by and marginally with respect to the main objective of the paper we observe that good correlations are obtained also for the other three couples see fig 5b d these regressions that are only indicative of a potential trend affected by a certain degree of uncertainty related to sampling procedure and in the case of bod the limited sample size must be investigated in more detail but could indicate that also the transport dynamics of the organic matter and of the total suspended solids are basically analogous to those of nutrients 3 2 nutrients residual load estimate the 10 years long modeling of the rainfall runoff transformation along the cf network showed that on average the csw at the outlet of the watershed delivers about 62 000 m3 year to the lake the overall volume discharged by all the csws of corte franca sewer system i e including the unmonitored ones within the watershed is on average about 365 000 m3 year so that the terminal csw discharges 17 of the total cso volume 83 of the cso volume is delivered at locations that do not directly drain into the lake but that eventually contribute to the overall load coming to the lake the volumetric efficiency of the sewer i e the percentage of volume that reaches the main collector and presumably the terminal wastewater treatment plant with respect to the total volume entering the combined sewer system is 66 a more detailed statistical description of the 10 year long simulated overflow discharge series was accomplished using the events sampling and analysis procedure detailed in the methods section the sample probability density of the overflow event volumes is shown as a bar diagram in panel a of fig 6 the sampled csos are characterized by an average volume of about 640 m3 a standard deviation of 960 m3 and a variation coefficient of 1 50 moreover the estimated average annual number of overflows above the introduced threshold ω is 95 3 and the average annual overflow volume amounts to about 61 000 m3 i e 2300 m3 haimp with respect to the impermeable catchment area as evident from the variation coefficient and the significant upper tail the variability is large and the distribution is satisfactorily fitted by a generalized pareto gp distribution function kottegoda and rosso 2008 in fig 6a the theoretical density function fitted by means of the maximum likelihood criterion shape parameter 0 33 scale parameter 440 5 m3 lower limit 0 0 m3 is overlapped to the sample one in the same figure the cumulative distribution function is shown the goodness of fit of the gp distribution to data is shown in fig 6b where confidence boundaries for 10 significance are drawn since all sample occurrences are included in the boundary region the null hypothesis cannot be rejected these results delineate a systematic insufficiency of the conveyance capacity of the municipal sewer network featured by high number of overflows mainly related to small volumes indeed the non exceedance probability of an overflow volume of 100 m3 is 22 5 that is almost one fourth of total annual events this probability rises to 37 5 if an overflow volume of 200 m3 is considered to estimate the average annual nutrients load discharged through the monitored csw suitable distribution functions must be chosen for the emc of tn and tp however the sample size does not allow to carry out an inference analysis as detailed as the overflow volume one and a lognormal distribution was selected whose parameters were estimated by the maximum likelihood criterion mean 2 75 mg l and standard deviation 0 37 mg l for tn mean 0 90 mg l and standard deviation 0 42 mg l for tp hence for every i th simulation year an overflow event sample having size ω is generated each j th event is defined in terms of overflow volume v and emcs for tn and tp the annual load li discharged by the csw is therefore given by equation 2 an accurate estimate of li variability has been achieved by using 100 000 simulation years yielding the sample density functions illustrated in fig 7 a b for tn and tp respectively 2 l i j 1 ω em c ij v ij the annual loads probability distributions are less skewed and more concentrated around the mean than the cso ones as expected when random variables are derived by integration with respect to long time periods the variation coefficients are estimated at 0 24 while the expected annual loads of nutrients disposed into lake iseo and their uncertainties amount to 1050 250 kg of tn 170 40 kg of tp in absence of more accurate results from a direct monitoring at the other csws and of a quality model of the cf network considering that the investigated csw provides approximately 1 6 of the overall volume delivered to the environment each year a back of the envelope evaluation on the actual amount of phosphorous released to the environment by the cf sewer is about 1 tonne each year the calculation of the overall percentage of nutrients loads delivered to the main sewer with respect to the total nutrients entering the network requires knowledge of the concentration of dry weather sewage to this purpose a set of measurements over a dry weather day provided average concentrations of 3 01 mg l for tp and 30 37 mg l for tn that could be affected by sedimentation in the conduits by assuming typical literature concentration values for dry weather sewage that varies in the range 6 10 mg l for tp and 20 40 mg l for tn the 7000 equivalent inhabitants for cf and the per capita water supply of 300 l p e d the percentage of loads discharged to lake with respect to loads produced is equal to 13 3 22 2 for tp and to 20 5 41 1 for tn these values are much larger than the ones reckoned during the initial design of the main sewer around the lake based on recent measurements along the two main lake s tributaries we estimate an overall contribution of 84 7 tonnes of p in a year from the whole valle camonica watershed the measurements also show that about 50 of this load is delivered to the lake during rain events when the csos in valle camonica are overflowing in the tributaries according to this evaluation the csos by corte franca increases by about 1 the whole phosphorous mass delivered to lake iseo although negligible in itself one must consider that other 16 municipalities with similar local network are located around the lake moreover the relevance of the corte franca csos is amplified by their location within an environmentally protected area and the proximity to important touristic areas 3 3 sizing of a detention storage the cf watershed lies inside the moraine arch produced by the ancient glacier of the valle camonica so that the soils include large amounts of clay and fine grains several ponds located inside the watershed and the proximity of lake iseo and sebino natural wetlands indicate the presence of a shallow water table with abundance of peat as a consequence infiltration capacities are generally low suggesting the choice of storage structures for urbanization mitigation practices rather than source or end of pipe infiltration practices consequently to mitigate the impact of the cf csos on the lake an off line overflow detention storage downstream of the monitored csw could be designed to intercept the first part of the cso after the storage capacity is filled the further overflow discharge would be completely delivered to the receiving water body during the dry weather periods the stored volume would be pumped back into the sewer network to be delivered to the wastewater treatment plant storage capacity the intensity and recurrence of the first flush phenomenon and the average detention time balistrocchi et al 2009 are crucial parameters for a capture tank performance according to the italian law the emptying process must begin after a dry weather period longer than 48 96 h in order to avoid intercepting overflow events conveying small pollutant loads due to the short antecedent dry weather period and overcharging a network where the falling limb of a flood might still be flowing on the other hand the longer the detention time is the greater the probability that the storage capacity is filled during a following cso this implies that the capture tank performance decreases with a growing average detention time the storage capacity of the capture tank can be defined in terms of water quality volume wef asce 1998 stochastically defined as the average cso volume that must be stored and treated to achieve a target abatement of the pollutant load monte carlo simulation techniques can be utilized to estimate this volume as well however to sample from the continuous overflow discharge series cso events that are independent it is now necessary to select a minimum inter event period that is set according to the storage detention time so that the storage is empty when the subsequent overflow occurs consequently in the following minimum inter event periods of 48 h and 96 h were selected in addition the occurrence and the intensity of the first flush is modelled by assuming the exponent b of the power function approximating the dcl curves as a random variable whose variability is described by a normal distribution fitted to the tp power function exponent reported in table 1 phosphorous is chosen because in lake iseo it likely controls trophic conditions garibaldi et al 1999 salmaso and mosello 2010 the ratio between the storage capacity w and the overflow event volume v generated by the gp distribution provides a dimensionless event volume that can be transformed through the dcl curve into a ratio between the captured load and the overall overflow one that is an event capture efficiency by multiplying this event efficiency for the cso event load the actual event load captured by tank is estimated finally if for each i th simulation year several events are generated in accordance with the average annual number of overflows ω the total annual loads discharged and captured are computed the ratio between these loads supplies the annual capture efficiency of the tank ηi as indicated in equation 3 3 η i w j 1 ω em c ij v ij w v ij b ij j 1 ω em c ij v ij finally the expected value and variability can be assessed through a sufficiently large number of simulation years the results of 100 000 simulations are illustrated in fig 8 where the expected values of the annual capture efficiency are reported along with confidence boundaries centred on the mean and equal to the double of the standard deviation the efficiency curves in fig 8 are referred to the specific storage capacity a customary concept for sizing the water quality volume that is the ratio between the tank capacity w and the product of the total urban catchment area a and the catchment impermeability i the conventional storage capacity of a capture tank in lombardy is 50 m3 haimp relatively small storage capacities ranging between 1000 m3 and 2000 m3 about 40 80 m3 haimp with respect to the impermeable catchment area are associated with quite large capture efficiencies 58 74 for the 48 h detention time 51 68 for the 96 h detention time with reference to the rules established by local regulations storage capacity 50 m3 haimp and detention time 96 h the expected efficiency is equal to 60 with an uncertainty of 10 the small volumes featuring most of overflow events can explain such large efficiencies the detention time exerts a moderate influence on the expected efficiency when it varies in this usual range uncertainties are however significant since they are estimated at about 10 between 1000 m3 and 2000 m3 for both average detention times in addition expected volumetric capture efficiencies are reported in fig 8 to evidence the efficiency gain determined by the first flush with respect to a hypothetical pollutant dynamic characterized by a proportional transport owing to the moderate first flush detected for this urban catchment such an efficiency gain is quite small its values decrease with the storage capacity w from 10 down to 7 and are slightly greater when a 96 h detention time is adopted so that for the conventional storage capacities of 50 m3 haimp the volumetric efficiency curve is included in the uncertainty region of the load efficiency curve 4 conclusions in this paper the residual nutrient load discharged into lake iseo through a csw located at the outlet of a small rural urban watershed has been assessed by coupling a year long monitoring campaign with long term simulation techniques and a monte carlo approach the results have been extended to the whole sewer network where several csws are present this allowed the determination of statistically reliable estimates of the overall average annual overflow volumes and of the corresponding nutrient loadings along with their uncertainties in this regard a general independence of the residual nutrient loads with respect to the rainfall variables was evidenced except for the concordant correlation of the first flush strength and the antecedent dry weather period this behaviour can however be explained by considering the peculiar combination of the sewer network hydraulics the pollutant parameters the catchment hydrology and the climate characteristics and it confirms once more the site specific nature of the pollutant transport dynamics despite alternative approaches were recently advanced to detect and quantify the first flush phenomenon the cumulative dimensionless load curves still maintain a general validity for practical application purposes indeed the difficulty of relating the single curve to the overflow volume can be easily overcome when such curves are implemented inside monte carlo simulations conversely more sophisticated approaches namely non parametric statistical analyses can provide deep insights of observed pollutographs but they are hardly implementable in verification and design procedures and are computationally intensive with regard to the case study this analysis suggests that despite the construction of a combined sewer pipe along the eastern lake shore which collects and conveys the sewage outside the lake watershed significant amounts of tn and tp are still delivered to the lake during most rainfall events due to the occurrence of csos along the municipal sewers a conservative evaluation of the percentage of nutrients loads delivered from the corte franca sewer that are still discharged to the lake ranges between 13 3 and 22 2 for tp and to 20 5 41 1 for tn these values are much larger than the ones reckoned during the initial design of the main sewer around the lake and the results provide for the first time in this environmentally fragile area of italy a sound basis to propose and design valuable mitigation measures on average the measured first flush phenomenon showed to be moderate weak though its strength is significantly correlated with the duration of the antecedent dry weather period this statistical relationship can be justified by the very low sanitary sewage flow rates during dry weather conditions leading to the accumulation of significant deposits of organic matter in various parts of the sewer network however despite the large annual overflow volume and the absence of a systematically strong first flush a small water quality volume must be provided downstream of the monitored csw for a capture storage tank to be effective this outcome is mainly due to the high number of overflow events which convey modest discharge volumes less than 200 m3 a tank sized according to the standards enforced by regional regulations that is a capacity of 50 m3 haimp 1300 m3 and an average detention time of 96 h could be able to achieve a mean capture efficiency equal to 60 a storage capacity of 75 m3 haimp 2000 m3 managed by using a more reasonable detention time of 48 h would increase the efficiency to 75 accordingly also considering the generally low permeability of this moraine watershed which hinders the general adoption of alternative urbanization mitigation practices an end of pipe storage structure emerges as a technically sound solution to mitigate the impact of csos on the lake declaration of

6641,this paper investigates the residual nutrient load from a combined sewer system along the shore of a deep italian lake to provide data that can help explaining the contribution of combined sewers to lakes eutrophication to this purpose a stochastic methodology is applied to the analysis of the combined sewer overflows and pollutants that provides reliable estimates with related uncertainties of the storage capacity to be supplied in order to mitigate the impact on the quality of receiving waters the sewer is modeled by swmm and two terminal combined sewer weirs are modeled in detail and instrumented for calibration purposes a year long campaign was accomplished allowing to study the occurrence and relevance of the first flush the calibrated model of the sewer network was used to extrapolate the results to a 10 years period thus providing a statistically reliable estimate of the residual load delivered from this watershed to the lake a conservative evaluation shows that up to 22 of phosphorus and up to 41 of nitrogen delivered to the sewer are still discharged into the environment however the results also show that in this case a relatively small capture volume would obtain a target pollution reduction thus providing insights on the feasibility of this structural practice in similar watersheds along the shore of endangered lakes keywords water quality monitoring combined sewer modelling lakes eutrophication 1 introduction eutrophication is a major threat to lake waters quality worldwide mostly due to phosphorus p and nitrogen n delivery from diffuse and point sources in anthropized watersheds e g schindler et al 2008 the diversion of sewage through the development of combined urban drainage systems is a common practice in endangered lake areas but water quality improvements have often been less effective than expected combined sewer systems are the prevalent sewage collection system in urban areas which evolved from the sprawl of old settlements in these systems under dry conditions sanitary waters supply the sewage discharge while under wet weather conditions stormwaters are collected and conveyed through the same conduits mixing with sanitary waters during heavy precipitations sewage exceeding the conveyance capacity of the sewer network or the treatment plant processing capacity is discharged into surface waters as combined sewer overflows csos the actual amount of nutrients flushed by csos depends on the local climate on the imperviousness of the drained catchment on the introduction of so called best practices to deal with stormwater and on the operational management of the sewer in dry weather periods in general the rationale supporting the technical acceptance of csos is that 1 a combined sewer cannot be sized to efficiently deal with both ordinary sewage flow and peak stormwater discharges 2 the renewal time of the cso receiving body is short and 3 the sewage pollutant concentration during wet weather periods decreases due to dilution owing to violation of these assumptions in the past the environmental impact of csos has often been underestimated in fact during wet weather periods csos may deliver substantial amounts of contaminants such as nutrients heavy metals sediments wastewater micropollutants and microorganisms bryan ellis and yu 1995 chebbo et al 2001 whose impact on the quality of receiving water bodies cannot be overlooked sartor and boyd 1972 epa 1993 2009 tibbetts 2005 moreover in strongly urbanized areas stormwaters are themselves contaminated by diffuse sources novotny 2002 so that during wet weather periods mixing often does not yield the assumed dilution hence this issue has been studied from various perspectives assessing the occurrence of the first flush phenomenon i e of the concentration of most pollutant mass during the first part of the overflow event saget et al 1996 bertrand krajewski et al 1998 deletic 1998 sansalone and cristina 2004 bach et

sampling techniques for quality monitoring mccarthy et al 2018 and analysing the interaction with climate change salerno et al 2018 owing to their long renewal time pilotti et al 2014 deep lakes are particularly sensitive to the pollution effects of csos whose contribution has been identified as a constraint to water quality improvement in several large lakes in the world e g sekaluvu et al 2018 a technical solutions was found in extended storage capacities such as the construction of deep tunnels and reservoirs for temporary csos storage e g lyandres and welch 2012 however to our knowledge very few studies have so far quantified the contribution of the csos to nutrients load in deep european lakes and none in the italian area in italy all the great prealpine lakes lake maggiore lugano como iseo and garda with maximum depths between 256 and 410 m fig 1 a are surrounded by important urban settlements where combined sewers predominate and are under scrutiny for the increase in nutrient concentrations and the decrease in hypolimnetic oxygen content the case of lake iseo is particularly relevant this lake 50 years ago used to be fully oxygenated as far as its maximum depth at 256 m while is now anoxic under 100 m salmaso and mosello 2010 lake iseo drains a large watershed valle camonica about 1450 km2 whose strong economic development led in the past to an uncontrolled pollution of oglio river its main tributary in addition the lake drains many small watersheds whose combined sewers drain to a centralised wastewater treatment plant about 20 years ago a combined sewer pipe was completed along the eastern lake shore to improve its water quality solid black line in fig 1b which collects and delivers the sewage from 9 municipal sewer systems to the waste water treatment plant located at the lake outlet since the capacity of the combined sewer was limited to low return period rainfall events combined sewer weirs csws were located at the connection with the municipal sewers on the assumption that the pollutant concentrations from the csos during wet weather periods were low in fact it was empirically reckoned that the overall contribution of csos to the p load could range between 0 and 3 of the overall yearly load to the sewer garibaldi et al 1998 however although no data has been measured or any modelling effort undertaken to actually quantify this process in lake iseo to the date of this research these assumptions are presumably wrong without quantitative data in the italian prealpine area as in many other lakes elsewhere it is difficult to step over a legislation that is based on the maximum effluent concentrations in favour of an approach based on the nutrient cumulative effects that are particularly relevant for lakes therefore we believe that every effort to increase the body of knowledge on this contribution is justified bearing in mind the long renewal times of deep lakes a long term assessment of nutrient residual loads associated with csos is a crucial piece of information that must be known before any restoration strategy is undertaken unfortunately pollutant transport dynamic in combined sewer systems is affected by a number of physical chemical climatic hydraulic and hydrologic factors so that it configures as a very site specific phenomenon this requires complex and computationally intensive numerical simulations conducted for long time periods further simulation outcomes must be statistically characterised in this paper an alternative stochastic approach based on monte carlo simulations is suggested to this purpose 1 we modeled in detail the hydraulic hydrologic behaviour of two municipal sewer systems located along the shore of lake iseo obtaining a calibrated modeling framework for the occurrence of csos 2 we instrumented a representative csw where we monitored eighteen cso events measuring total nitrogen tn and phosphorus tp chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solids tss and biological oxygen demand bod then 3 the data measured during the experimental campaign were extrapolated to a longer period by using the calibrated model with a 10 year long rainfall record a probabilistic estimation of the sewage volumes disposed into lake by the sewer csws and of the corresponding tp and tn loads was accomplished finally 4 the obtained results were used to estimate by a monte carlo approach the capture volume that would be needed in a detention tank to obtain a target reduction of the disposed pollution load overall we believe that this paper also provides important insights regarding other watersheds located in areas with similar climatic features and anthropic pressure so contributing to a better understanding of the relevance of lakes eutrophication problem 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area we considered two relatively small urban rural catchments provaglio d iseo and corte franca with similar municipal sewer systems located along the eastern coastal area of lake iseo the sub alpine lake iseo area of 61 km2 maximum depth of 256 m is the fifth largest italian lake in terms of volume it is located in the region of lombardy see fig 1a in an area characterised by the presence of several other deep and large lakes during the second half of the 20th century it underwent a transition from oligotrophy to eutrophy and the oxygen content of the bottom waters decreased from 9 mg l in 1967 to zero from mid 1995 s till the mid 2000 s pilotti et al 2014 undoubtedly the human pressure in the lake s watershed can be blamed for the gradual increase of the trophic level coupled with the accumulation of nutrients deriving from the limited exchange of deep waters from this viewpoint the situation is further hindered by current climatic trends that might completely prevent the regular overturn of deep waters valerio et al 2015 having in mind the quantification of the residual load from the entire main sewer draining the eastern shore of the lake we started from the contribution of the municipal sewers whose hydrology is very similar we focused our attention on the csw located at the junction of the corte franca cf in the following municipal sewer with the main pipe red dot in fig 1b this csw is one of the most important for the discharged volumes and its proximity to the lake in a protected natural wetland between two important touristic settlements accordingly the contribution of this csw in an area characterized by strong submerged macrophytes growth during summer could be relevant both for lake eutrophication and for potential bacterial pollution to this end we monitored the csw sampling csos and implemented a model using epa s swmm storm water management model software to better understand the hydraulics of the sewer 2 2 the hydraulic hydrological model of corte franca watershed the corte franca cf combined sewer system fig 1c is composed of the main network and of two minor subnetworks nigoline and borgonato which are connected to the main one by two pumping stations due to lack of geometric data the hydraulics of these two subnetworks were not modeled and their contributions transferred directly from the pumping stations to the municipal network the diameter of the conduits of the combined sewer system varies from 125 mm to 800 mm and they are made in concrete and pvc for an overall length of 19 km along the sewer system there are 20 small csws the total area drained by the sewer provided by the public body in charge of the urban water cycle management ato ambito territoriale ottimale is 2 9 km2 considering that 45 of the area is served by separated sewer the area that generates runoff during wet weather is 1 6 km2 to obtain a careful quantification of the impervious surfaces a land use classification was carried out through a colour band analysis of the recent satellite sentinel 2 images with a 10 m spatial resolution the resulting land use map is shown in fig 2 where the urbanized areas drained by the sewer system is evidenced this area totally amounts to 0 6 km2 and approximately 40 can be regarded as totally impervious to compute the dry weather loads the total area was divided in 191 sub catchments one for each sewer junction by assuming that the population density is uniformly distributed in the basin the dry weather loads were calculated by multiplying the measured per capita water supply equal to 300 l p e d by the number of equivalent inhabitants of the area of interest the per capita water supply values were obtained by the analysis of the daily volume delivered by the drinking water plants of the municipalities in addition to normal dry weather flow condition the touristic seasonal loads were calculated by using data provided by the national institute of statistics istat so that the dry weather flow presents a monthly pattern the actual geometrical characteristics of each conduit and manhole of the sewer were implemented in the model the pumping stations functioning was described in detail by inserting the storage unit s dimensions the pump characteristic curves the geometrical data of delivery conduits and the startup and shutoff depths of pumps the csws have a fundamental role and were included in swmm by describing the characteristics of the weirs and the possible presence of sluice gates as infiltration model we used a constant infiltration capacity f p mm h since during intense events that may cause a cso the reduction of infiltration capacity in urban areas is negligible the value of f p was obtained by calibration we evaluated that 40 of the urban area is totally impervious characterised by f p 0 m m h whereas in the remaining area f p 3 m m h three davis rainfall gauges with resolution of 0 2 mm and sensor type tipping bucket with magnetic reed switch were placed within the cf watershed fig 1c for more than a year measuring cumulative rainfall every minute the discharge delivered to the municipal sewer outlet where the monitored csw is located was measured during the same period another raingauge station managed by the regional agency for environmental protection arpa lombardia is located in sarnico about 4 km north west of cf see fig 1 panel b and provided a continuous series from 2007 recorded at 10 time step the monitoring of the terminal csw at cf allowed us to firstly set up a hydraulic model of this device and to calibrate the rainfall runoff model of the sewer network despite the considerable level of complexity of the csw a 1 dimensional model was found to provide a satisfactory representation of the overflow process see details in supplementary material smi 2 3 the hydraulic hydrological model of provaglio watershed the provaglio d iseo pv sewer system is characterised by the presence of a single csw located immediately upstream of the junction of the municipal sewer with the main sewer pipe thus the measured inflow upstream of the csw is the total flow entering the main sewer this csw discharges during wet weather in the wetland area called torbiere d iseo which is in close communication with lake iseo since the geometrical information of the municipal sewer systems under study was not available a complete survey of sewer systems was carried out the industrial part of the basin is drained by a separated sewer system and its dry weather flow enters the municipal sewer downstream of the csw the remaining drained pv area equal to 1 1 km2 was classified using the sentinel 2 satellite images as previously explained obtaining an urbanized drained area of 0 45 km2 the combined pv sewer is mainly made of concrete pipes the diameters range from 160 mm to 1600 mm for an overall length of 13 km at each network junction the value of drained area was assessed by visual inspection of the drained subcatchments the dry period input discharges to the sewer were distributed along the network considering the local population density rainfall was measured at a rain gauge located inside the watershed fig 1b the csw of provaglio consists in an oblique weir whose efficiency is increased by the backwater produced by a gate by using monitoring data a suitable 1 dimensional hydraulic model was set up and calibrated for this device as well see details in supplementary material smii 2 4 model calibration and validation due to the complexity of the cf sewer system which has inter alia 20 csws distributed in the watershed and 6 pumping stations we used for the cf watershed the parameters obtained by the calibration of the watershed and municipal sewer of pv that has similar characteristics but only a single csw located at the outlet of the network to this purpose rainfall in the pv watershed and discharge at the csw were measured for a period of 7 months the hydrologic parameters of the pv model were calibrated by working on single rainfall runoff events comparing the measured discharge hydrograph at the csw with the modelled one for the period 10 03 2018 13 03 2018 fig 3 a the model was then validated for the period 01 03 2018 05 04 2018 an example of model validation is shown in

panel d 2 5 nutrients dynamic assessment in november 2017 we installed an automatic sampler isco 3700 at the csw of corte franca see green dot in fig smi 1 to collect cso samples equipped with 24 ½ liter bottles the sampling was carried out by aspiration using a peristaltic pump the sampling interval was set equal to 10 min and the sampler was set up to collect two samples of 250 ml in each bottle in this way it was possible to characterize the overflowing sewage during an 8 hour long event after collection the samples were transported through a portable refrigerator to the laboratory to quantify tp and tn concentrations since the sampler is not refrigerated we took care to collect the samples as soon as possible after the end of the events overall a total of 18 cso events and 242 samples were analysed unfiltered water samples were analysed for tp and tn concentrations with standard spectrophotometric perkin elmer lambda 35 methods as soluble reactive phosphorus and nitrate after alkaline peroxydisulfate oxidation valderrama 1981 when operative conditions made it possible the laboratory carried out also analysis of cod 7 events apha 2012 bod5 2 events uni en 1899 1 2001 and total suspended solids tss 4 events apat cnr irsa 2090 b man 2003 to identify possible correlations between the pollutants the dates of cso events when the stormwater runoff samples were collected are summarized in table 1 along with the parameters measured in laboratory and the numbers of samples for each event during all these events the discharge hydrograph of the incoming flow and of the cso was either measured or computed using the estimated stage discharge relationship in order to study the phenomenon of first flush the dimensionless diagrams of pollutant loads and discharge volumes firstly proposed by bertrand krajewski et al 1998 and herein called dimensionless cumulative load curves dcl curves see fig 4 were used in these diagrams the ratio υ between cumulative and total runoff volume is reported on x axis and the ratio λ between cumulative pollution load and total pollution load is reported on y axis the empirical dcl curves can be fitted by the power function in eq 1 ma et al 2011 where the greater the first flush the smaller the value of the exponent b is when the first flush is absent b 1 1 λ υ b this approach was preferred to other solutions despite the deficiencies regarding its arbitrary definition of first flush which can be overcome by using non parametric statistical analyses bach et al 2010 actually eq 1 makes it possible to implement monte carlo simulation procedures to size the capture volume needed to mitigate the impact of the csos with reference to a performance target the first flush analysis focused on total phosphorus and total nitrogen that are widely recognised as responsible for the eutrophication process in lakes 2 6 estimation of nutrients residual load to the lake the calibrated hydrodynamic model of cf s sewer network was used to perform a 10 year long from 2007 to 2016 continuous simulation to assess the wet and the dry weather sewage produced in the long term period to this purpose we used the rainfall data of the sarnico rain gauge recorded with a 10 min time step in this way a continuous time series of csos directly discharged into lake iseo through the monitored csw was computed in the absence of a calibrated quality model monte carlo simulation techniques kottegoda and rosso 2008 offered an effective alternative to predict the nutrients residual load associated with these overflow discharges indeed samples of overflow events along with their qualitative and quantitative characteristics can be generated by assuming that the parameters describing the pollutant dynamics are random variables their variability was expressed by suitable probability distributions fitted with respect to a sample of independent events derived from the simulated series to this purpose the continuous series of overflow discharges was discretized into individual independent overflow events through a peak over threshold criterion corrected with a minimum inter event period lang et al 1999 bacchi et al 2008 implemented into two phases 1 individual overflows were sampled from the continuous series as the part of the overflow hydrograph exceeding a discharge threshold used to eliminate from the sample minor overflow events that convey negligible volumes 2 two subsequent individual overflows were assumed to be independent when separated by an inter event period longer than the minimum one otherwise they were joined in a single event in the following a threshold discharge of 10 0 l s and a minimum inter event period of 3 0 h were adopted when relevant detention capacities are not present in the watershed two subsequent csos can be considered independent if they are separated by a period almost equal to the time of concentration in this watershed such a time is far shorter than the minimum interevent period suggested for urban application which is set at 3 0 h adams and papa 2000 the threshold flow discharge was selected in order to have a csos minimum volume slightly greater than 1 0 m3 but also considering that the choice of a greater threshold would have yielded a significant underestimation of the total annual overflow volume accordingly the average annual number ω of individual independent events was computed along with the volume v of total overflow discharge occurring during the event that is including the flow discharge below the threshold typical tp and tn concentrations were already known by the analysis of measured overflow events in order to run monte carlo simulations a sample of ω overflow events was generated for each simulation year each event was featured by the overflow volume v the event mean concentration emc and the exponent b of the dcl curve randomly varying according to their univariate probability distributions as customary in monte carlo simulation procedures this assumption is justified if the different variables are mutually independent as supported in this case by the empirical evidence presented in the following in this way if a sufficiently long time series is used annual balances of nutrient loads and overflow volumes can be computed with reliable estimates of their expected value and uncertainty herein quantified in terms of standard deviation 3 results and discussion 3 1 nutrients dynamic assessment the main characteristics of the monitored cso events are reported in table 1 where the rainfall events are delineated in terms of depth duration maximum intensity and antecedent dry weather period while the pollutant dynamic is summarized by the observed emc of tn and tp and the exponent b of the power functions 1 fitted to the empirical dcl curves fig 4 statistics of these quality parameters are reported as well the measured samples reflect a wide range of rainfall events and initial conditions in the network and the analysed nutrients show very similar pollutant dynamics apart from the order of magnitude emcs aleatory variability are comparable since the variation coefficient estimates show analogous dispersions around the mean and statistics of exponent b have almost identical values tp and tn concentrations are within the upper range of concentrations measured in other csos gervin and brix 2001 barco et al 2008 brombach et al 2005 salerno et al 2018 and were from 30 to 7 times higher compared to those previously measured in the lake s tributaries garibaldi et al 1999 in general the pattern of both dcl curves shown in fig 4 ranges from the proportional transport when b is equal to 1 00 to a moderate strong first flush b equal to 0 39 according to the first flush definition proposed by bertrand krajewski et al 1998 no dcl curve shows a strong first flush as 80 of the pollutant load is always transported by a percentage of the overflow volume greater than 30 on average a moderate weak first flush featured by an exponent b value of 0 70 is experienced for both nutrients a correlation analysis was carried out to identify significant statistical relationships between the quality parameters and the rainfall characteristics to this end the kendall rank correlation coefficient and the pearson linear correlation were used since the kendall coefficient is independent of the marginal distributions it can effectively measure the association degree of not necessarily elliptic dependence structures the estimated coefficients are listed in table 2 where values significantly different from zero are underlined and boldface this condition is satisfied if the p value of the independence test is less than 5 a general mutual independence of the analysed variables is evidenced by low coefficient values which cannot be considered significantly different from zero the only exception is given by the couples of the antecedent dry weather period a and the exponent b of both nutrients these correlations indicate quite strong and significant discordant associations thus the greater the antecedent dry weather period the strongest the nutrients first flush is the results obtained when the tp emc is coupled with the antecedent dry weather period a the wet weather duration d and the rainfall depth h nevertheless deserve a brief discussion in the first two cases the pearson coefficient is significantly different from zero while the kendall coefficient the most reliable one is not in addition the kendall coefficient value is low therefore this appears to be a spurious linear correlation related to the very small variability of the tp emcs with respect to that of the antecedent dry weather period in the third case the contrary occurs yet the discordance strength detected through the kendall coefficients is quite low and its significance slightly less than 5 could be due to the small sample size which yields high estimation variance it is worth highlighting that in this climate the antecedent dry weather period is independent of the other variables of the rainfall process balistrocchi and bacchi 2011 on the one hand a simple stochastic modelling relying on independent univariate distributions is therefore suitable to represent the nutrient transport dynamic on the other hand independence is basically an expression of a strong natural variability so that mean annual values could not be representative of trend values and a suitable estimate of the uncertainty is mandatory to achieve meaningful assessments in consideration of the gentle slopes and the low degree of impermeable covers featuring the catchment surfaces the most compelling cause for the significant discordant association relating to the antecedent dry weather period and the dcl parameters is the accumulation of organic sediments in the sewer pipes in dry periods actually simulations reveal a generalized problem of low sewage flow velocities in most of the network more precisely in dry periods flow velocities are averagely equal to 0 55 m s but in many pipes almost 30 of the total network length located primarily in the upstream portions of the network and next to its outlet velocities less than 0 30 m s are computed when the critical shear stress is exceeded due to the storm water wash off see for instance ahyerre et al 2000 and references therein it is reasonable to suppose that the sudden resuspension of settled particulate matter and nutrients is the leading cause of the first flush occurrence on the other hand the poor correlation of the first flush occurrence with respect to maximum rainfall intensity can be explained considering that the conveyance capacity of the sewer in wet periods is insufficient so that the shear stress limit is exceeded even by low return period storms less than 5 years finally plots in fig 5 show correlations between measured pollutant concentrations during csos events a significant linear correlation between tp and tn concentrations is observed with a tn tp ratio of about 5 which is consistent with the expected range for civil sewage this strong correlation further confirms the previously discussed similarities between the tn and the tp transport dynamics moreover in passing by and marginally with respect to the main objective of the paper we observe that good correlations are obtained also for the other three couples see fig 5b d these regressions that are only indicative of a potential trend affected by a certain degree of uncertainty related to sampling procedure and in the case of bod the limited sample size must be investigated in more detail but could indicate that also the transport dynamics of the organic matter and of the total suspended solids are basically analogous to those of nutrients 3 2 nutrients residual load estimate the 10 years long modeling of the rainfall runoff transformation along the cf network showed that on average the csw at the outlet of the watershed delivers about 62 000 m3 year to the lake the overall volume discharged by all the csws of corte franca sewer system i e including the unmonitored ones within the watershed is on average about 365 000 m3 year so that the terminal csw discharges 17 of the total cso volume 83 of the cso volume is delivered at locations that do not directly drain into the lake but that eventually contribute to the overall load coming to the lake the volumetric efficiency of the sewer i e the percentage of volume that reaches the main collector and presumably the terminal wastewater treatment plant with respect to the total volume entering the combined sewer system is 66 a more detailed statistical description of the 10 year long simulated overflow discharge series was accomplished using the events sampling and analysis procedure detailed in the methods section the sample probability density of the overflow event volumes is shown as a bar diagram in panel a of fig 6 the sampled csos are characterized by an average volume of about 640 m3 a standard deviation of 960 m3 and a variation coefficient of 1 50 moreover the estimated average annual number of overflows above the introduced threshold ω is 95 3 and the average annual overflow volume amounts to about 61 000 m3 i e 2300 m3 haimp with respect to the impermeable catchment area as evident from the variation coefficient and the significant upper tail the variability is large and the distribution is satisfactorily fitted by a generalized pareto gp distribution function kottegoda and rosso 2008 in fig 6a the theoretical density function fitted by means of the maximum likelihood criterion shape parameter 0 33 scale parameter 440 5 m3 lower limit 0 0 m3 is overlapped to the sample one in the same figure the cumulative distribution function is shown the goodness of fit of the gp distribution to data is shown in fig 6b where confidence boundaries for 10 significance are drawn since all sample occurrences are included in the boundary region the null hypothesis cannot be rejected these results delineate a systematic insufficiency of the conveyance capacity of the municipal sewer network featured by high number of overflows mainly related to small volumes indeed the non exceedance probability of an overflow volume of 100 m3 is 22 5 that is almost one fourth of total annual events this probability rises to 37 5 if an overflow volume of 200 m3 is considered to estimate the average annual nutrients load discharged through the monitored csw suitable distribution functions must be chosen for the emc of tn and tp however the sample size does not allow to carry out an inference analysis as detailed as the overflow volume one and a lognormal distribution was selected whose parameters were estimated by the maximum likelihood criterion mean 2 75 mg l and standard deviation 0 37 mg l for tn mean 0 90 mg l and standard deviation 0 42 mg l for tp hence for every i th simulation year an overflow event sample having size ω is generated each j th event is defined in terms of overflow volume v and emcs for tn and tp the annual load li discharged by the csw is therefore given by equation 2 an accurate estimate of li variability has been achieved by using 100 000 simulation years yielding the sample density functions illustrated in fig 7 a b for tn and tp respectively 2 l i j 1 ω em c ij v ij the annual loads probability distributions are less skewed and more concentrated around the mean than the cso ones as expected when random variables are derived by integration with respect to long time periods the variation coefficients are estimated at 0 24 while the expected annual loads of nutrients disposed into lake iseo and their uncertainties amount to 1050 250 kg of tn 170 40 kg of tp in absence of more accurate results from a direct monitoring at the other csws and of a quality model of the cf network considering that the investigated csw provides approximately 1 6 of the overall volume delivered to the environment each year a back of the envelope evaluation on the actual amount of phosphorous released to the environment by the cf sewer is about 1 tonne each year the calculation of the overall percentage of nutrients loads delivered to the main sewer with respect to the total nutrients entering the network requires knowledge of the concentration of dry weather sewage to this purpose a set of measurements over a dry weather day provided average concentrations of 3 01 mg l for tp and 30 37 mg l for tn that could be affected by sedimentation in the conduits by assuming typical literature concentration values for dry weather sewage that varies in the range 6 10 mg l for tp and 20 40 mg l for tn the 7000 equivalent inhabitants for cf and the per capita water supply of 300 l p e d the percentage of loads discharged to lake with respect to loads produced is equal to 13 3 22 2 for tp and to 20 5 41 1 for tn these values are much larger than the ones reckoned during the initial design of the main sewer around the lake based on recent measurements along the two main lake s tributaries we estimate an overall contribution of 84 7 tonnes of p in a year from the whole valle camonica watershed the measurements also show that about 50 of this load is delivered to the lake during rain events when the csos in valle camonica are overflowing in the tributaries according to this evaluation the csos by corte franca increases by about 1 the whole phosphorous mass delivered to lake iseo although negligible in itself one must consider that other 16 municipalities with similar local network are located around the lake moreover the relevance of the corte franca csos is amplified by their location within an environmentally protected area and the proximity to important touristic areas 3 3 sizing of a detention storage the cf watershed lies inside the moraine arch produced by the ancient glacier of the valle camonica so that the soils include large amounts of clay and fine grains several ponds located inside the watershed and the proximity of lake iseo and sebino natural wetlands indicate the presence of a shallow water table with abundance of peat as a consequence infiltration capacities are generally low suggesting the choice of storage structures for urbanization mitigation practices rather than source or end of pipe infiltration practices consequently to mitigate the impact of the cf csos on the lake an off line overflow detention storage downstream of the monitored csw could be designed to intercept the first part of the cso after the storage capacity is filled the further overflow discharge would be completely delivered to the receiving water body during the dry weather periods the stored volume would be pumped back into the sewer network to be delivered to the wastewater treatment plant storage capacity the intensity and recurrence of the first flush phenomenon and the average detention time balistrocchi et al 2009 are crucial parameters for a capture tank performance according to the italian law the emptying process must begin after a dry weather period longer than 48 96 h in order to avoid intercepting overflow events conveying small pollutant loads due to the short antecedent dry weather period and overcharging a network where the falling limb of a flood might still be flowing on the other hand the longer the detention time is the greater the probability that the storage capacity is filled during a following cso this implies that the capture tank performance decreases with a growing average detention time the storage capacity of the capture tank can be defined in terms of water quality volume wef asce 1998 stochastically defined as the average cso volume that must be stored and treated to achieve a target abatement of the pollutant load monte carlo simulation techniques can be utilized to estimate this volume as well however to sample from the continuous overflow discharge series cso events that are independent it is now necessary to select a minimum inter event period that is set according to the storage detention time so that the storage is empty when the subsequent overflow occurs consequently in the following minimum inter event periods of 48 h and 96 h were selected in addition the occurrence and the intensity of the first flush is modelled by assuming the exponent b of the power function approximating the dcl curves as a random variable whose variability is described by a normal distribution fitted to the tp power function exponent reported in table 1 phosphorous is chosen because in lake iseo it likely controls trophic conditions garibaldi et al 1999 salmaso and mosello 2010 the ratio between the storage capacity w and the overflow event volume v generated by the gp distribution provides a dimensionless event volume that can be transformed through the dcl curve into a ratio between the captured load and the overall overflow one that is an event capture efficiency by multiplying this event efficiency for the cso event load the actual event load captured by tank is estimated finally if for each i th simulation year several events are generated in accordance with the average annual number of overflows ω the total annual loads discharged and captured are computed the ratio between these loads supplies the annual capture efficiency of the tank ηi as indicated in equation 3 3 η i w j 1 ω em c ij v ij w v ij b ij j 1 ω em c ij v ij finally the expected value and variability can be assessed through a sufficiently large number of simulation years the results of 100 000 simulations are illustrated in fig 8 where the expected values of the annual capture efficiency are reported along with confidence boundaries centred on the mean and equal to the double of the standard deviation the efficiency curves in fig 8 are referred to the specific storage capacity a customary concept for sizing the water quality volume that is the ratio between the tank capacity w and the product of the total urban catchment area a and the catchment impermeability i the conventional storage capacity of a capture tank in lombardy is 50 m3 haimp relatively small storage capacities ranging between 1000 m3 and 2000 m3 about 40 80 m3 haimp with respect to the impermeable catchment area are associated with quite large capture efficiencies 58 74 for the 48 h detention time 51 68 for the 96 h detention time with reference to the rules established by local regulations storage capacity 50 m3 haimp and detention time 96 h the expected efficiency is equal to 60 with an uncertainty of 10 the small volumes featuring most of overflow events can explain such large efficiencies the detention time exerts a moderate influence on the expected efficiency when it varies in this usual range uncertainties are however significant since they are estimated at about 10 between 1000 m3 and 2000 m3 for both average detention times in addition expected volumetric capture efficiencies are reported in fig 8 to evidence the efficiency gain determined by the first flush with respect to a hypothetical pollutant dynamic characterized by a proportional transport owing to the moderate first flush detected for this urban catchment such an efficiency gain is quite small its values decrease with the storage capacity w from 10 down to 7 and are slightly greater when a 96 h detention time is adopted so that for the conventional storage capacities of 50 m3 haimp the volumetric efficiency curve is included in the uncertainty region of the load efficiency curve 4 conclusions in this paper the residual nutrient load discharged into lake iseo through a csw located at the outlet of a small rural urban watershed has been assessed by coupling a year long monitoring campaign with long term simulation techniques and a monte carlo approach the results have been extended to the whole sewer network where several csws are present this allowed the determination of statistically reliable estimates of the overall average annual overflow volumes and of the corresponding nutrient loadings along with their uncertainties in this regard a general independence of the residual nutrient loads with respect to the rainfall variables was evidenced except for the concordant correlation of the first flush strength and the antecedent dry weather period this behaviour can however be explained by considering the peculiar combination of the sewer network hydraulics the pollutant parameters the catchment hydrology and the climate characteristics and it confirms once more the site specific nature of the pollutant transport dynamics despite alternative approaches were recently advanced to detect and quantify the first flush phenomenon the cumulative dimensionless load curves still maintain a general validity for practical application purposes indeed the difficulty of relating the single curve to the overflow volume can be easily overcome when such curves are implemented inside monte carlo simulations conversely more sophisticated approaches namely non parametric statistical analyses can provide deep insights of observed pollutographs but they are hardly implementable in verification and design procedures and are computationally intensive with regard to the case study this analysis suggests that despite the construction of a combined sewer pipe along the eastern lake shore which collects and conveys the sewage outside the lake watershed significant amounts of tn and tp are still delivered to the lake during most rainfall events due to the occurrence of csos along the municipal sewers a conservative evaluation of the percentage of nutrients loads delivered from the corte franca sewer that are still discharged to the lake ranges between 13 3 and 22 2 for tp and to 20 5 41 1 for tn these values are much larger than the ones reckoned during the initial design of the main sewer around the lake and the results provide for the first time in this environmentally fragile area of italy a sound basis to propose and design valuable mitigation measures on average the measured first flush phenomenon showed to be moderate weak though its strength is significantly correlated with the duration of the antecedent dry weather period this statistical relationship can be justified by the very low sanitary sewage flow rates during dry weather conditions leading to the accumulation of significant deposits of organic matter in various parts of the sewer network however despite the large annual overflow volume and the absence of a systematically strong first flush a small water quality volume must be provided downstream of the monitored csw for a capture storage tank to be effective this outcome is mainly due to the high number of overflow events which convey modest discharge volumes less than 200 m3 a tank sized according to the standards enforced by regional regulations that is a capacity of 50 m3 haimp 1300 m3 and an average detention time of 96 h could be able to achieve a mean capture efficiency equal to 60 a storage capacity of 75 m3 haimp 2000 m3 managed by using a more reasonable detention time of 48 h would increase the efficiency to 75 accordingly also considering the generally low permeability of this moraine watershed which hinders the general adoption of alternative urbanization mitigation practices an end of pipe storage structure emerges as a technically sound solution to mitigate the impact of csos on the lake declaration of

ant colony optimization for the continuous domain genetic algorithm particle swarm optimization differential evolution 1 introduction human life is under constant influence from the changing weather patterns the effects may be observed in agriculture industry communication tourism etc haltiner and williams 1980 weather forecast has gained an important role in water resource planning and management the issue is even more critical in arid and semi arid climates it is noteworthy that many hydrologic processes are mostly non linear and dependent on stochastic events tokar and johnson 1999 the influencing factors which bring about weather changes may be divided into two groups of climate and geographical factors the former group includes humidity barometer reading temperature cloudiness wind speed seasonal changes and cyclical changes e g el niño and la niña the latter group includes the distance to the sources of climate changes such as oceans and the height from the sea level govindaraju 2000 the intelligent models such as artificial neural networks ann and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis are some of the best methods for modeling the mentioned hydrological phenomena chang et al 2014 chang and tsai 2016 tayyab et al 2017 hedir and haddad 2017 1 1 the application of classical artificial intelligence methods to model the hydrological phenomena during last decade different investigations were carried out in order to examine the capability of the classic artificial intelligence methods in hydrological phenomena modeling nayak et al 2004 explored the application of ann and anfis to model river flow the results indicated that while both methods benefited from suitable ability to estimate the river flow the anfis had better performance chang and chang 2006 reported anfis as a reliable model to predict water level fluctuations in reservoir dastorani et al 2010 used ann and anfis models to forecast rainfall in the dry climate of yazd iran their input data included maximum and average temperatures maximum and average wind speeds wind directions humidity and evaporation rates they reported that anfis was suitable models for prediction of rainfall in dry climates such as in yazd el shafie et al 2011 compared the performance of ann and anfis in the prediction of rainfall for klang river in malaysia their findings indicated that anfis was more accurate with less error rate akrami et al 2013 used four models namely ann anfis fis and multi output anfis manfis for prediction of rainfall for klang river their results showed that manfis was more accurate when compared to the other models seo et al 2015 investigated the ability of two hybrid models wavelet based ann and wavelet based anfis models to forecast daily water level in reservoir the results showed that wavelet decomposition is able to enhance the performance of the models mekanik et al 2016 used anfis for predicting seasonal rainfall in australia based on climate signals they reported that anfis model was capable of predicting seasonal rainfall in the australian areas choubin et al 2016 explored that multi layer perceptron mlp and anfis are two appropriate models to predict precipitation when large scale climatic signals are used as inputs in another study shafaei et al 2016 combined wavelet method artificial neural network and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average sarima for prediction of daily rainfall in nahavand iran they reported that their wavelet sarima ann model performed well for the rainfall forecasting of the study choubin et al 2018 compared capability of anfis autoregressive integrated moving average arima and classification and regression trees cart models to forecast rainfall values they considered large scale climate signals as inputs the resulted agreed that the cart and anfis had promising performances 1 2 the application of modified artificial intelligence methods to model the hydrological phenomena while classic artificial intelligence methods are used for modeling various phenomena they usually suffer from some disadvantages as trapping in local optima using local search method over fitting high computing etc peyghami and khanduzi 2013 kisi et al 2018 ann and anfis are known as two methods used to stimulate various hydrological phenomena they often have acceptable performance in modeling the above mentioned events but sometimes they have somewhat troubles with estimating precipitation it might be due to the high turbulence nature of precipitation which makes its modeling hard therefore it seems it is a good idea to improve the quality of the modeling by fading the problems of classic models although ann and anfis have many similarities in their modeling steps the reports suggest that anfis has usually better performance compared to ann el shafie et al 2011 akrami et al 2013 thus it seems to be a logical idea to focus on anfis in a neuro fuzzy system determining a suitable structure and its parameters is very important task also the success of the system is dependent on accuracy and efficiency of its training algorithm classic anfis uses algorithms based on gradient descent and least squares which are useful and powerful training methods however in some complex problems its performance may be significantly decreased algorithms based on gradient use local searching techniques so they are subjected to trap in local optimum points peyghami and khanduzi 2013 also a single algorithm as back propagation needs lot of burdens to train the anfis if the network structure and parameters become large in such a case the classic algorithm might fails to train the system perfectly especially if input data set is large and as a result the modeling cannot be satisfying it is noteworthy that dealing with this input data set is a usual matter in precipitation modeling therefore methods are needed to be prevented from the problems of gradient based algorithms a suitable suggestion to solve these problems is to use evolutionary algorithms ea in the training phase by using eas which do not suffer the mentioned troubles system can be trained in a better situation and achieve to a stable and suitable convergence however different eas have variant characteristics for example some have high speed to reach to converge some provide grantee to meet convergence etc jalalkamali 2015 reported that ga and pso had proper ability in optimizing the anfis performance to predict the water quality parameters in another study tabari 2016 combined fuzzy inference system fis and direct search optimization algorithm dsoa to predict river runoff in taleghan river the results showed that dsoa had ability for improving the anfis performance to model the rainfall runoff kisi et al 2017a b reported that eas improved the artificial intelligent models for predicting the hydrological phenomena yaseen et al 2017 suggested a novel combination of anfis and firefly algorithm anfis ffa to predict stream flow according to their results proposed hybrid model had better performance compared to some classic methods a recurrent adaptive network based fuzzy inference system r anfis embedded with genetic algorithm and least square estimator r anfis gl model was applied and showed satisfactory results to make multi step ahead forecasts and reservoir inflow during flood seasons zhou et al 2019 azad et al 2018a reported that differential evolution algorithm de had better performance than pso and ga for improving the anfis ability to estimate the water quality parameters salimi et al 2018 reported that anfis optimized by particle swarm optimization pso had appropriate performance to predict the water hammer phenomenon in water supply system in another study azad et al 2018b suggested pso as an appropriate alternative for optimizing the anfis performance to predict the river flow according to their report pso was able to enhance the ability of the anfis to predict river flow in acceptable condition from 1 day to 5 day ahead the literature review showed that because of trapping into local optima high calculations volume and over fitting event classical anfis had weaker performance in estimation and prediction of precipitation than other phenomena but this performance could be improved using robust eas based training algorithms in this this study three eas ant colony optimization for the continuous domain acor genetic algorithm ga differential evolution de and particle swarm optimization pso were suggested as alternative of anfis optimization algorithms to recover the mentioned problems of classical training algorithm for modeling the rainfall the results of all four suggested methods were compared 2 material and

iran metrological organization provided the statistical rainfall data of isfahan province for a period of 21 years from 1994 to 2014 monthly rainfall records collected from 10 weather stations during a period of 21 years 1994 2014 were used to evaluate the proposed methodologies total 252 patterns among the collected weather stations the isfahan was chosen as purpose due to its high quality long term and having no missing data table 1 presents the general characteristics of the studied stations and rainfall data 2 2 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system is a feed forward multi layer neural network this system uses neural network training algorithms and also fuzzy logic for expected operations in fact anfis uses training algorithm of the neural network and fuzzy logic in order to provide a nonlinear depiction of the input output relationship anfis was first proposed in 1993 as an attempt to combine the capabilities of a fuzzy system and the numerical capabilities of a neural network to provide a framework for powerful modeling jang 1993 to describe structure of the anfis the system comprising two inputs x1 and x2 two sugeno s type and fuzzy takagi if then rules and one output y is commonly considered as follows 1 rule 1 if x 1 is a 1 and x 2 is b 1 then f 1 p 1 x 1 q 1 x 2 r 1 2 rule 2 if x 1 is a 2 and x 2 is b 2 then f 2 p 2 x 1 q 2 x 2 r 2 where b and a are respectively the fuzzy sets q and p and r are the model consequent parameters which are evaluated in the training stage the anfis structure includes of 5 layers layer 1 includes input variables of fuzzy sets in this layer all nodes will adapt to a function parameter the gaussian function is usually used as the appropriate function in layer 2 two memberships which gotten by the fuzzy will be multiplied therefore the fuzzy rules will be represented by output in layer 3 every node is fixed or non adaptive in layer 4 every node is an adaptive node to an output in layer 5 layer just has single node that is a non adaptive or fixed node this node as the summation of all incoming signals from the previous node computes the overall output jang 1993 here 70 of total data were used for training the models randomly and the remaining 30 were used for testing purpose also the number of epochs in simple anfis and the number of replication in presented algorithms were adjusted on 500 the optimum number of replication for all models was 500 and increasing the number of replications beyond this threshold did not show considerable effect on the models performance accuracy also the optimum values of initial step size step size decrease and initial increase were selected as 0 01 0 9 and 1 15 respectively further three anfis methods namely grid partition gp subtractive clustering sc and fuzzy c means clustering fcm were used for generating the basic fis table 4 the results showed that fcm had slightly better performance than sc so the results of this method were reported as classical anfis performance in this study these facts are similar to the previous studies mirrashid 2014 abdulshahed et al 2015 rajabi et al 2017 2 3 application of particle swarm optimization algorithm for training anfis pso kennedy 1995 is one of the most applicable eas for solving non linear problems pso is a trustworthy method for training intelligent models as it has low computing volume low probability of trapping in local optima high convergence speed and easy implementation in the last years pso was used for training the intelligent models in various studies hasanipanah et al 2016 kisi et al 2017b salimi et al 2018 however this algorithm has less ability in solving the problems including high complexity while the probability of being trapped in local optima is increased pso method is based on searching in solution domain to select some particles which have better condition so while the location of particles is changing continuously they try to locate in the best place based on their experience in fact each particle is aware of its and other particles locations for example particle i has a position in the d dimensional space of the problem this can be solved by eq 3 in this equation t means the particle iteration the mentioned particle has also a velocity which leads this particle to the next position its tth iteration is indicated as v eq 4 each particle also benefits from a memory to remember its and other particles locations which is evaluated by eq 5 3 x i t x i 1 t x i 2 t x id t 4 v i t v i 1 t v i 2 t v id t 5 p i t p i 1 t p i 2 t p id t after each iteration particles update and get new locations using two parameters named the best solution pbest and the best position achieved within the population gbest after determining these two factors velocity of each particle is estimated using eqs 6 and 7 6 v i t 1 w v i t c 1 r 1 i t p i t x i t c 2 r 2 i t p g t x i t 7 x i t 1 x i t v i t 1 where t is the iteration number and c 1 and c 2 are the learning parameters after each iteration the displacement of a particle is controlled by these two parameters usually c 1 c 2 2 the two random numbers r 1 and r 2 have a range 0 1 inertia weight shown by w gets an initial value ranging within 0 1 pso works out in the event of convergence by recording personal best fitness of all particles finding global best particle updating velocity and position of each particle otherwise the problem cycle continues so that the answers converge or the number of repetitions will be reached to the end generally for optimizing and training the system algorithms including classical and suggested try to find the closest values for average and standard deviation sd of output data using the inputs and how much the values suggested by optimization algorithm be more accurate the system trained better and can model or predict the phenomena in better form in some complex issues like rainfall back propagation cannot find these values accurately owing to some problems like trapping in local optima and over fitting shihabudheen and pillai 2018a in other word training algorithms try to propose x in eq 8 so that the difference between two sides of eq 1 is minimized 8 i 1 n p i 1 n x p at last the error between two sides of the eq 8 is evaluated by eq 9 if the result meets the requirements optimization is over but if don t training should be done again 9 i 1 n e i 1 n v target v model where vtarget is the observed values vmodel shows the suggested values by the model and e indicates the difference between the observed and suggested values after the optimization suggested hybrid model acts like the classic anfis the number of replications used for this algorithm was 1000 and with increasing over there no improvement was observed in the results also upper and lower bounds of velocity was selected from 2 to 2 the initial population was selected from 20 to 200 inertia weight was selected from 0 5 to 1 5 and personal and global best learning coefficient was selected from 1 to 5 finally the best combination that produced the most accurate results was presented and discussed steps of anfis pso model have been illustrated in fig 2 2 4 application of genetic algorithm for training anfis genetic algorithm ga is an optimization method based on how the creatures evolve this algorithm was first introduced by holland 1975 ga is one of the most popular optimization methods that has been used in solving various problems one of the advantages of this algorithm is very good global search to be independent of problem situations appropriate performance in complex problems and with voluminous computations and lack of trapping in local optima shihabudheen and pillai 2018b these make this algorithm known as an appropriate option for training the simulation systems such as anfis and ann it noteworthy that classic training algorithms can t train the mentioned models appropriately for solving problems with some specific complexities due to some problems such as trapping in local optima or high volume computing in the present study the ability of ga for training anfis for estimating monthly rainfall was assessed in the present research the algorithm produces the initial population after specifying the initial information then using its method ga tries to find the best fitting x for modeling the rainfall values by suggesting the best amounts of average and sd at first a collection of chromosomes are randomly generated the initial population chromosomes that had the most appropriate performance for solving the problem here monthly rainfall are selected at this stage if the performance of selected chromosomes was acceptable the optimization is over otherwise a new generation is generated and the previous steps are repeated ga generates new chromosomes this cycle continues until the number of requested repetitions is completed after the completion of the algorithm s work other modeling steps are performed similar to the classic anfis the number of replications of the algorithm was considered as 450 and with a greater repetition any remarkable effect on the modeling quality was not observed the initial population was selected from 35 to 150 the algorithm had the most suitable performance with initial number of 75 also the best values of percent of crossover and mutation were 0 9 and 0 1 respectively schematic representation of anfis ga modeling has been shown in fig 2 2 5 application of ant colony optimization for continuous domains acor for training anfis ant colony optimization aco for continuous domains was proposed by socha and dorigo 2008 the idea is based on ants behavior that they randomly explore around their nest at the beginning of their food search once an ant finds a food source it evaluates it and carries some food to the nest a substance referred to as pheromone trail is deposited on the ground during the return trip of the ant the amount of pheromone deposited depends on the quantity and quality of the food which guides other ants to the food source acor uses the ant colony framework to perform local searches whereas global search is handled by an aco algorithm ants perform a simple evaluation of some regions defined in the search space in order to update the regions fitness the creation of new regions is handled by a process very similar to a genetic algorithm using common operators that assimilate real ant colonies behavior like a random walk this algorithm is a good alternative for training anfis because of two reasons 1 it benefits from appropriate ability to solve complex problems in fact if the network structures and parameters become large or algorithm tries to optimize a complex problem optimization algorithm requires a lot of burdens to train the system and as a result risk of fail can be increased shihabudheen and pillai 2018a kisi et al 2018 2 this algorithm never traps in the local optima generally this algorithm tries to optimize e in eq 9 after the completion of the algorithm s work other modeling steps are performed similar to the simple anfis in this algorithm for distributing ants into the solution domain instead of a discrete function a continuous one gaussian is used eq 10 10 g x i l 1 n w l g l i x l 1 n w 1 1 σ l i 2 π e x μ l i 2 2 σ l i 2 where w σ i μ i n are weigh of the gaussian function standard deviation vector mean vector and the effective parameter respectively solutions are stored in an archive at first this archive is weighed using n random solutions and these solutions s1 s2 s3 sn and their objective function values f s are stored and staged with respect to their quality eq 11 11 f s 1 f s 2 f sn then that weigh lth of solution st is estimated using eq 12 12 w l 1 q n 2 π e l 1 2 2 q 2 n 2 where qn and q are variance vector and algorithm parameter respectively according to eq 12 value of the gaussian function is 1 in the following using μ i variables ith should be selected for each g x i these values are selected with help of the archive 13 μ i μ l i μ l i s l i s l i the next step is estimating variance vector qn σ l i in order to determine this parameter it is supposed that an ant selects one of the available solutions in the archive based on a probability process like roulette wheel so if a solution benefits from being in a better position it has more chance to be selected by the ant to estimate σ l i average distance between selected solution s1 and other ones is multiplied by a parameter ξ which is more than 1 and has a similar effect on rate of pheromone evaporation in aco method eq 14 14 σ l i e 1 n s e i s l i n 1 in this study the number of replication of the algorithm was 300 and with a greater repetition no significant effect on the modeling quality was observed also the initial population was selected from 20 to 150 whereas 50 was obtained as the optimal number for the initial population anfis with acor flowchart is shown in fig 3 2 6 application of differential evolution de for training anfis differential evolution de is a recent heuristic evolutionary global optimization method derived from ga but intrinsically capable of solving multidimensional optimization problems involving continuous variables storn 1995 the basic scheme of a common de shows that it has different steps including initialization mutation crossover selection and convergence it requires to set only three user defined control parameters such as number of population weighting factor and crossover probability and it has two stages of initialization and evolution that include several vector transforms i e operations d ambrosio et al 2017 de is appropriate tool for training anfis because it is fast reliable easy to use and implement and needs few tuning parameters these abilities are opposite of characteristics of anfis algorithms such as back propagation and levenberg marquardt anfis trained by de flowchart is shown in fig 3 it is noteworthy that the de and acor are such as ga and pso and they attempt to optimize e via eq 9 2 7 performance evaluation three statistical indices including the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square error rmse and the scatter index si were used for the performance analysis of the novels models in this study as 15 r 2 i 1 n x 1 x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 2 16 rmse 1 n i 1 n x i y i 2 17 si rmse x in the above equations xi and x represent the observed values and their mean yi and y represent the predicted values and their corresponded average magnitudes respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 the correlation coefficient the correlation coefficients between the monthly rainfall in the studied stations and the isfahan station as the benchmark station during the study period have been listed in table 2 three groups tagged i 1 i 2 and i 3 were selected as input data to feed into the applied models these groups included three four and five stations respectively had the highest correlation coefficient with the monthly rainfall time series of isfahan the results of the correlation coefficient analysis showed that the rainfall data from kabutar abad had the highest effect r 0 94 in predicting the monthly rainfall for isfahan shahreza was ranked as second r 0 87 and golpayegan was ranked as third r 0 75 station in this regard khur biyabanak r 0 66 daran r 0 66 and natanz r 0 62 provided the weakest correlation values that can be due to the slight impact of the rainfall values of these stations on the target benchmark station 3 2 non linear sensitivity analysis non linear sensitivity analysis was performed in order to gain assurance from the accuracy of the selected input data selection and verification of linear sensitivity analysis the nonlinear sensitivity of rainfall in the studied stations for obtaining the monthly rainfall in isfahan benchmark station was evaluated separately using anfis model in each evaluation the isfahan rainfall data with one year delay was entered into the model as the constant input while the rainfall data from one of the candidate stations has been used as the variable input then the prediction process was carried out for modelling monthly rainfall in the target station table 3 shows the results of non linear sensitivity analysis the results obtained from the non linear sensitivity analysis confirmed that most of the statements drawn from the correlation coefficient were valid the analysis showed that kabutar abad r2 0 84 rmse 3 76 mm and si 0 36 and in the following shahreza r2 0 75 rmse 5 11 mm and si 0 33 could provide the best input data for simulating the rainfall values for the target station in contrast ardestan r2 0 43 rmse 7 84 mm and si 0 77 kashan r2 0 42 rmse 8 35 and si 0 64 and khur biyabanak r2 0 37 rmse 9 84 mm and si 1 23 introduced as the weakest locations for providing the necessary inputs of rainfall modeling in target station 3 3 prediction groups the identification of different groups was carried out by selecting the most correlated stations with the target site isfahan for this 3 groups were determined i1 i2 and i3 the groups were arranged according to the results of correlation coefficient it means that group i1 was included rainfall data of three stations with highest correlation coefficient kabutar abad shahreza and golpayegan the correlation of rainfall data between three mentioned stations and isfahan were 0 94 0 87 and 0 75 respectively table 2 for arranging group i2 the fourth priority naien with correlation about 0 73 was added to i1 at last i3 the fifth priority daran was added into the i2 3 3 1 group i 1 group i 1 included the monthly rainfall data of kabutar abad shahreza and golpayegan surveys showed that anfis acor could be introduced as the most accurate model results indicated that training system using acor improved the anfis performance by 0 40 3 14 mm and 0 38 in r2 rmse and si respectively table 5 becasuse the data divided into test and training phase randomely this can be lead to the over fitting problem totally classic trainer algorithms are too depondent to the training data and cannot reveal an acceptable performance in test phase fig 4 unlike classic anfis hybrid ones showed relaible performance in training and test phase so that in the best hybrid model anfis acor values of r2 rmse and si in training and test phases were respectively 0 91 2 72 0 19 and 0 86 3 67 and 0 23 the obtained results showed that acor prevented the system from trapping in local optima and over fitting issues kisi et al 2018 this performance of acor method can be due to the ability of this algorithm for the modeling of complex phenomena like rainfall after the acor the ga and de ranked in the second and third stages the weak performance of pso for optimizing the anfis can be due to the weakness of this algorithm in solving hard problems compared to acor and ga in fact because of simple structure pso couldn t optimize the rainfall values properly table 5 the results obtained in this study are in close agreement with other reports hassanvand et al 2018 argued that classic ann and anfis were not able to predict river flood routing in satisfying form just the bat algorithm and imperialist competitive algorithm ica as trainer schemes the performance of the classic models was enhanced it is notable that results obtained by anfis fcm were reported in this study because it led to the best performance for the classical anfis compared to the other algorithms the results of sc and gp algorithms of anfis are shown in table 4 3 3 2 group i 2 group i 2 included the monthly rainfall data for group i 1 plus data of naien station the results of using this data group as input showed that anfis acor and anfis de with little difference were ranked as the first and second most accurate models trained models using ga and pso placed in the third and fourth ranks finally sole anfis introduced as the weakest model with r2 rmse and si respectively equal to 0 33 9 98 mm and 0 90 table 6 in this section some interesting resulted are noticed group i2 significantly improved the performance of hybrid models while decreased the performance of classic anfis table 6 and fig 5 these results can be laid on a point that the classic anfis which uses gradient based learning techniques such as back propagation needs lots of burden to be optimized and trained when inputs are growing shihabudheen and pillai 2018b on the other hand hybrid models had a suitable capability in modeling minimum and maximum points it is noteworthy that the suddenly changes in hyetograph points can generate floods so the models ability for predicting these point can be very important per hydrological studies the acceptable performance of ea in modeling extreme points is also reported by other studies kisi et al 2017a b yaseen et al 2017 hassanvand et al 2018 3 3 3 group i 3 group i 3 included the historical monthly rainfall data of group i 2 plus data from daran station table 7 in the test stage anfis acor r2 0 92 rmse 2 95 mm si 0 22 and anfis de r2 0 91 rmse 2 96 mm si 0 26 ranked closely as the first and second most accurate models the next two models respectively were anfis ga and anfis pso in this division simple anfis presented the weakest results with the coefficient of determination lower than 0 20 and rmse values more than 15 also over fitting values and failing in correct routeing increased fig 6 obviously which can prove the accuracy of discussed reasons mentioned in the previous part on the other hand the performance of hybrid models was unchanged while one of the input variables with a low coefficient of determination was added fig 6 moreover the obtained results indicated that proposed hybrid models when confronted with irrelevant variables had higher certainty rather than simple anfis the results obtained by this study are compatible with other investigations done on the training of artificial intelligence models with different algorithms 4 conclusion the spatial correlation coefficient and non linear sensitivity analysis used in this study showed high overlapping the spatial correlation coefficient showed that rainfall data from kabutar abad station with the coefficient of determination equal to 0 94 was the best input for the models non linear analysis confirmed the results obtained by the spatial correlation coefficient r2 0 84 rmse 3 76 mm si 0 36 group i 2 which included historical rainfall data from kabutar abad shahreza golpayegan and naien stations were introduced as the most effective group in the prediction of rainfall in isfahan station based on statistical indices anfis acor with most suitable statistical indices was the best hybrid model for all three input groups simple anfis was judged to be incapable of accurately predicting monthly rainfall for study area by the available data unlike other models in this study anfis performance dropped as the data volume increased the examination of the evidence indicates that an accurate sensitivity analysis and availability of optimum input make a significant improvement in the results provided by the models furthermore hybrid intelligent algorithms made improvements in anfis models used for rainfall forecast for the study area overall it can be concluded that presented algorithms had the suitable capability in training and improving the performance of anfis conflict of interest the authors declared that there is no conflict

6642,existent algorithms to train adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis such as gradient descent and least square methods are useful but they have problems such as trapping in local optimum as

evolution de for improving the performance of anfis models in simulating monthly rainfall magnitudes monthly rainfall records of nine foothills to arid weather stations of isfahan province central iran were used for evaluating the proposed methodology the correlation coefficient and non linear sensitivity analysis were performed on the available rainfall records monthly rainfall modelling was carried out based on three input groups and used separately in five applied models e g anfis anfis pso anfis acor anfis de and anfis ga the obtained results showed that proposed hybrid models had better accuracy than the simple anfis model in escaping local optima the best model was anfis acor with r2 0 92 rmse 2 73 mm and si 0 26 while sole anfis model with r2 0 33 rmse 9 98 mm and si 0 90 presented the worst output moreover the obtained results showed that 1 coupling the optimization algorithms with anfis can improve its performance in modeling the monthly rainfall time series 2 the correlation coefficient and sensitivity analysis of input data provided a valid input selection that could improve the model accuracy with neglecting the redundant input parameters keywords rainfall ant colony optimization for the continuous domain genetic algorithm particle swarm optimization differential evolution 1 introduction human life is under constant influence from the changing weather patterns the effects may be observed in agriculture industry communication tourism etc haltiner and williams 1980 weather forecast has gained an important role in water resource planning and management the issue is even more critical in arid and semi arid climates it is noteworthy that many hydrologic processes are mostly non linear and dependent on stochastic events tokar and johnson 1999 the influencing factors which bring about weather changes may be divided into two groups of climate and geographical factors the former group includes humidity barometer reading temperature cloudiness wind speed seasonal changes and cyclical changes e g el niño and la niña the latter group includes the distance to the sources of climate changes such as oceans and the height from the sea level govindaraju 2000 the intelligent models such as artificial neural networks ann and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis are some of the best methods for modeling the mentioned hydrological phenomena chang et al 2014 chang and tsai 2016 tayyab et al 2017 hedir and haddad 2017 1 1 the application of classical artificial intelligence methods to model the hydrological phenomena during last decade different investigations were carried out in order to examine the capability of the classic artificial intelligence methods in hydrological phenomena modeling nayak et al 2004 explored the application of ann and anfis to model river flow the results indicated that while both methods benefited from suitable ability to estimate the river flow the anfis had better performance chang and chang 2006 reported anfis as a reliable model to predict water level fluctuations in reservoir dastorani et al 2010 used ann and anfis models to forecast rainfall in the dry climate of yazd iran their input data included maximum and average temperatures maximum and average wind speeds wind directions humidity and evaporation rates they reported that anfis was suitable models for prediction of rainfall in dry climates such as in yazd el shafie et al 2011 compared the performance of ann and anfis in the prediction of rainfall for klang river in malaysia their findings indicated that anfis was more accurate with less error rate akrami et al 2013 used four models namely ann anfis fis and multi output anfis manfis for prediction of rainfall for klang river their results showed that manfis was more accurate when compared to the other models seo et al 2015 investigated the ability of two hybrid models wavelet based ann and wavelet based anfis models to forecast daily water level in reservoir the results showed that wavelet decomposition is able to enhance the performance of the models mekanik et al 2016 used anfis for predicting seasonal rainfall in australia based on climate signals they reported that anfis model was capable of predicting seasonal rainfall in the australian areas choubin et al 2016 explored that multi layer perceptron mlp and anfis are two appropriate models to predict precipitation when large scale climatic signals are used as inputs in another study shafaei et al 2016 combined wavelet method artificial neural network and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average sarima for prediction of daily rainfall in nahavand iran they reported that their wavelet sarima ann model performed well for the rainfall forecasting of the study choubin et al 2018 compared capability of anfis autoregressive integrated moving average arima and classification and regression trees cart models to forecast rainfall values they considered large scale climate signals as inputs the resulted agreed that the cart and anfis had promising performances 1 2 the application of modified artificial intelligence methods to model the hydrological phenomena while classic artificial intelligence methods are used for modeling various phenomena they usually suffer from some disadvantages as trapping in local optima using local search method over fitting high computing etc peyghami and khanduzi 2013 kisi et al 2018 ann and anfis are known as two methods used to stimulate various hydrological phenomena they often have acceptable performance in modeling the above mentioned events but sometimes they have somewhat troubles with estimating precipitation it might be due to the high turbulence nature of precipitation which makes its modeling hard therefore it seems it is a good idea to improve the quality of the modeling by fading the problems of classic models although ann and anfis have many similarities in their modeling steps the reports suggest that anfis has usually better performance compared to ann el shafie et al 2011 akrami et al 2013 thus it seems to be a logical idea to focus on anfis in a neuro fuzzy system determining a suitable structure and its parameters is very important task also the success of the system is dependent on accuracy and efficiency of its training algorithm classic anfis uses algorithms based on gradient descent and least squares which are useful and powerful training methods however in some complex problems its performance may be significantly decreased algorithms based on gradient use local searching techniques so they are subjected to trap in local optimum points peyghami and khanduzi 2013 also a single algorithm as back propagation needs lot of burdens to train the anfis if the network structure and parameters become large in such a case the classic algorithm might fails to train the system perfectly especially if input data set is large and as a result the modeling cannot be satisfying it is noteworthy that dealing with this input data set is a usual matter in precipitation modeling therefore methods are needed to be prevented from the problems of gradient based algorithms a suitable suggestion to solve these problems is to use evolutionary algorithms ea in the training phase by using eas which do not suffer the mentioned troubles system can be trained in a better situation and achieve to a stable and suitable convergence however different eas have variant characteristics for example some have high speed to reach to converge some provide grantee to meet convergence etc jalalkamali 2015 reported that ga and pso had proper ability in optimizing the anfis performance to predict the water quality parameters in another study tabari 2016 combined fuzzy inference system fis and direct search optimization algorithm dsoa to predict river runoff in taleghan river the results showed that dsoa had ability for improving the anfis performance to model the rainfall runoff kisi et al 2017a b reported that eas improved the artificial intelligent models for predicting the hydrological phenomena yaseen et al 2017 suggested a novel combination of anfis and firefly algorithm anfis ffa to predict stream flow according to their results proposed hybrid model had better performance compared to some classic methods a recurrent adaptive network based fuzzy inference system r anfis embedded with genetic algorithm and least square estimator r anfis gl model was applied and showed satisfactory results to make multi step ahead forecasts and reservoir inflow during flood seasons zhou et al 2019 azad et al 2018a reported that differential evolution algorithm de had better performance than pso and ga for improving the anfis ability to estimate the water quality parameters salimi et al 2018 reported that anfis optimized by particle swarm optimization pso had appropriate performance to predict the water hammer phenomenon in water supply system in another study azad et al 2018b suggested pso as an appropriate alternative for optimizing the anfis performance to predict the river flow according to their report pso was able to enhance the ability of the anfis to predict river flow in acceptable condition from 1 day to 5 day ahead the literature review showed that because of trapping into local optima high calculations volume and over fitting event classical anfis had weaker performance in estimation and prediction of precipitation than other phenomena but this performance could be improved using robust eas based training algorithms in this this study three eas ant colony optimization for the continuous domain acor genetic algorithm ga differential evolution de and particle swarm optimization pso were suggested as alternative of anfis optimization algorithms to recover the mentioned problems of classical training algorithm for modeling the rainfall the results of all four suggested methods were compared 2 material and

province is located at the centre of iran from 49 40 to 55 30 e longitude and 30 42 to 34 30 n latitude isfahan province is located in a rather mountainous region in the centre of the iranian plateau spanning from the snow capped zagross mountains in the west to the central desert in east and north the region has arid climate with the average air temperature of 16 59 c fig 1 shows the studied area iran metrological organization provided the statistical rainfall data of isfahan province for a period of 21 years from 1994 to 2014 monthly rainfall records collected from 10 weather stations during a period of 21 years 1994 2014 were used to evaluate the proposed methodologies total 252 patterns among the collected weather stations the isfahan was chosen as purpose due to its high quality long term and having no missing data table 1 presents the general characteristics of the studied stations and rainfall data 2 2 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system is a feed forward multi layer neural network this system uses neural network training algorithms and also fuzzy logic for expected operations in fact anfis uses training algorithm of the neural network and fuzzy logic in order to provide a nonlinear depiction of the input output relationship anfis was first proposed in 1993 as an attempt to combine the capabilities of a fuzzy system and the numerical capabilities of a neural network to provide a framework for powerful modeling jang 1993 to describe structure of the anfis the system comprising two inputs x1 and x2 two sugeno s type and fuzzy takagi if then rules and one output y is commonly considered as follows 1 rule 1 if x 1 is a 1 and x 2 is b 1 then f 1 p 1 x 1 q 1 x 2 r 1 2 rule 2 if x 1 is a 2 and x 2 is b 2 then f 2 p 2 x 1 q 2 x 2 r 2 where b and a are respectively the fuzzy sets q and p and r are the model consequent parameters which are evaluated in the training stage the anfis structure includes of 5 layers layer 1 includes input variables of fuzzy sets in this layer all nodes will adapt to a function parameter the gaussian function is usually used as the appropriate function in layer 2 two memberships which gotten by the fuzzy will be multiplied therefore the fuzzy rules will be represented by output in layer 3 every node is fixed or non adaptive in layer 4 every node is an adaptive node to an output in layer 5 layer just has single node that is a non adaptive or fixed node this node as the summation of all incoming signals from the previous node computes the overall output jang 1993 here 70 of total data were used for training the models randomly and the remaining 30 were used for testing purpose also the number of epochs in simple anfis and the number of replication in presented algorithms were adjusted on 500 the optimum number of replication for all models was 500 and increasing the number of replications beyond this threshold did not show considerable effect on the models performance accuracy also the optimum values of initial step size step size decrease and initial increase were selected as 0 01 0 9 and 1 15 respectively further three anfis methods namely grid partition gp subtractive clustering sc and fuzzy c means clustering fcm were used for generating the basic fis table 4 the results showed that fcm had slightly better performance than sc so the results of this method were reported as classical anfis performance in this study these facts are similar to the previous studies mirrashid 2014 abdulshahed et al 2015 rajabi et al 2017 2 3 application of particle swarm optimization algorithm for training anfis pso kennedy 1995 is one of the most applicable eas for solving non linear problems pso is a trustworthy method for training intelligent models as it has low computing volume low probability of trapping in local optima high convergence speed and easy implementation in the last years pso was used for training the intelligent models in various studies hasanipanah et al 2016 kisi et al 2017b salimi et al 2018 however this algorithm has less ability in solving the problems including high complexity while the probability of being trapped in local optima is increased pso method is based on searching in solution domain to select some particles which have better condition so while the location of particles is changing continuously they try to locate in the best place based on their experience in fact each particle is aware of its and other particles locations for example particle i has a position in the d dimensional space of the problem this can be solved by eq 3 in this equation t means the particle iteration the mentioned particle has also a velocity which leads this particle to the next position its tth iteration is indicated as v eq 4 each particle also benefits from a memory to remember its and other particles locations which is evaluated by eq 5 3 x i t x i 1 t x i 2 t x id t 4 v i t v i 1 t v i 2 t v id t 5 p i t p i 1 t p i 2 t p id t after each iteration particles update and get new locations using two parameters named the best solution pbest and the best position achieved within the population gbest after determining these two factors velocity of each particle is estimated using eqs 6 and 7 6 v i t 1 w v i t c 1 r 1 i t p i t x i t c 2 r 2 i t p g t x i t 7 x i t 1 x i t v i t 1 where t is the iteration number and c 1 and c 2 are the learning parameters after each iteration the displacement of a particle is controlled by these two parameters usually c 1 c 2 2 the two random numbers r 1 and r 2 have a range 0 1 inertia weight shown by w gets an initial value ranging within 0 1 pso works out in the event of convergence by recording personal best fitness of all particles finding global best particle updating velocity and position of each particle otherwise the problem cycle continues so that the answers converge or the number of repetitions will be reached to the end generally for optimizing and training the system algorithms including classical and suggested try to find the closest values for average and standard deviation sd of output data using the inputs and how much the values suggested by optimization algorithm be more accurate the system trained better and can model or predict the phenomena in better form in some complex issues like rainfall back propagation cannot find these values accurately owing to some problems like trapping in local optima and over fitting shihabudheen and pillai 2018a in other word training algorithms try to propose x in eq 8 so that the difference between two sides of eq 1 is minimized 8 i 1 n p i 1 n x p at last the error between two sides of the eq 8 is evaluated by eq 9 if the result meets the requirements optimization is over but if don t training should be done again 9 i 1 n e i 1 n v target v model where vtarget is the observed values vmodel shows the suggested values by the model and e indicates the difference between the observed and suggested values after the optimization suggested hybrid model acts like the classic anfis the number of replications used for this algorithm was 1000 and with increasing over there no improvement was observed in the results also upper and lower bounds of velocity was selected from 2 to 2 the initial population was selected from 20 to 200 inertia weight was selected from 0 5 to 1 5 and personal and global best learning coefficient was selected from 1 to 5 finally the best combination that produced the most accurate results was presented and discussed steps of anfis pso model have been illustrated in fig 2 2 4 application of genetic algorithm for training anfis genetic algorithm ga is an optimization method based on how the creatures evolve this algorithm was first introduced by holland 1975 ga is one of the most popular optimization methods that has been used in solving various problems one of the advantages of this algorithm is very good global search to be independent of problem situations appropriate performance in complex problems and with voluminous computations and lack of trapping in local optima shihabudheen and pillai 2018b these make this algorithm known as an appropriate option for training the simulation systems such as anfis and ann it noteworthy that classic training algorithms can t train the mentioned models appropriately for solving problems with some specific complexities due to some problems such as trapping in local optima or high volume computing in the present study the ability of ga for training anfis for estimating monthly rainfall was assessed in the present research the algorithm produces the initial population after specifying the initial information then using its method ga tries to find the best fitting x for modeling the rainfall values by suggesting the best amounts of average and sd at first a collection of chromosomes are randomly generated the initial population chromosomes that had the most appropriate performance for solving the problem here monthly rainfall are selected at this stage if the performance of selected chromosomes was acceptable the optimization is over otherwise a new generation is generated and the previous steps are repeated ga generates new chromosomes this cycle continues until the number of requested repetitions is completed after the completion of the algorithm s work other modeling steps are performed similar to the classic anfis the number of replications of the algorithm was considered as 450 and with a greater repetition any remarkable effect on the modeling quality was not observed the initial population was selected from 35 to 150 the algorithm had the most suitable performance with initial number of 75 also the best values of percent of crossover and mutation were 0 9 and 0 1 respectively schematic representation of anfis ga modeling has been shown in fig 2 2 5 application of ant colony optimization for continuous domains acor for training anfis ant colony optimization aco for continuous domains was proposed by socha and dorigo 2008 the idea is based on ants behavior that they randomly explore around their nest at the beginning of their food search once an ant finds a food source it evaluates it and carries some food to the nest a substance referred to as pheromone trail is deposited on the ground during the return trip of the ant the amount of pheromone deposited depends on the quantity and quality of the food which guides other ants to the food source acor uses the ant colony framework to perform local searches whereas global search is handled by an aco algorithm ants perform a simple evaluation of some regions defined in the search space in order to update the regions fitness the creation of new regions is handled by a process very similar to a genetic algorithm using common operators that assimilate real ant colonies behavior like a random walk this algorithm is a good alternative for training anfis because of two reasons 1 it benefits from appropriate ability to solve complex problems in fact if the network structures and parameters become large or algorithm tries to optimize a complex problem optimization algorithm requires a lot of burdens to train the system and as a result risk of fail can be increased shihabudheen and pillai 2018a kisi et al 2018 2 this algorithm never traps in the local optima generally this algorithm tries to optimize e in eq 9 after the completion of the algorithm s work other modeling steps are performed similar to the simple anfis in this algorithm for distributing ants into the solution domain instead of a discrete function a continuous one gaussian is used eq 10 10 g x i l 1 n w l g l i x l 1 n w 1 1 σ l i 2 π e x μ l i 2 2 σ l i 2 where w σ i μ i n are weigh of the gaussian function standard deviation vector mean vector and the effective parameter respectively solutions are stored in an archive at first this archive is weighed using n random solutions and these solutions s1 s2 s3 sn and their objective function values f s are stored and staged with respect to their quality eq 11 11 f s 1 f s 2 f sn then that weigh lth of solution st is estimated using eq 12 12 w l 1 q n 2 π e l 1 2 2 q 2 n 2 where qn and q are variance vector and algorithm parameter respectively according to eq 12 value of the gaussian function is 1 in the following using μ i variables ith should be selected for each g x i these values are selected with help of the archive 13 μ i μ l i μ l i s l i s l i the next step is estimating variance vector qn σ l i in order to determine this parameter it is supposed that an ant selects one of the available solutions in the archive based on a probability process like roulette wheel so if a solution benefits from being in a better position it has more chance to be selected by the ant to estimate σ l i average distance between selected solution s1 and other ones is multiplied by a parameter ξ which is more than 1 and has a similar effect on rate of pheromone evaporation in aco method eq 14 14 σ l i e 1 n s e i s l i n 1 in this study the number of replication of the algorithm was 300 and with a greater repetition no significant effect on the modeling quality was observed also the initial population was selected from 20 to 150 whereas 50 was obtained as the optimal number for the initial population anfis with acor flowchart is shown in fig 3 2 6 application of differential evolution de for training anfis differential evolution de is a recent heuristic evolutionary global optimization method derived from ga but intrinsically capable of solving multidimensional optimization problems involving continuous variables storn 1995 the basic scheme of a common de shows that it has different steps including initialization mutation crossover selection and convergence it requires to set only three user defined control parameters such as number of population weighting factor and crossover probability and it has two stages of initialization and evolution that include several vector transforms i e operations d ambrosio et al 2017 de is appropriate tool for training anfis because it is fast reliable easy to use and implement and needs few tuning parameters these abilities are opposite of characteristics of anfis algorithms such as back propagation and levenberg marquardt anfis trained by de flowchart is shown in fig 3 it is noteworthy that the de and acor are such as ga and pso and they attempt to optimize e via eq 9 2 7 performance evaluation three statistical indices including the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square error rmse and the scatter index si were used for the performance analysis of the novels models in this study as 15 r 2 i 1 n x 1 x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 2 16 rmse 1 n i 1 n x i y i 2 17 si rmse x in the above equations xi and x represent the observed values and their mean yi and y represent the predicted values and their corresponded average magnitudes respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 the correlation coefficient the correlation coefficients between the monthly rainfall in the studied stations and the isfahan station as the benchmark station during the study period have been listed in table 2 three groups tagged i 1 i 2 and i 3 were selected as input data to feed into the applied models these groups included three four and five stations respectively had the highest correlation coefficient with the monthly rainfall time series of isfahan the results of the correlation coefficient analysis showed that the rainfall data from kabutar abad had the highest effect r 0 94 in predicting the monthly rainfall for isfahan shahreza was ranked as second r 0 87 and golpayegan was ranked as third r 0 75 station in this regard khur biyabanak r 0 66 daran r 0 66 and natanz r 0 62 provided the weakest correlation values that can be due to the slight impact of the rainfall values of these stations on the target benchmark station 3 2 non linear sensitivity analysis non linear sensitivity analysis was performed in order to gain assurance from the accuracy of the selected input data selection and verification of linear sensitivity analysis the nonlinear sensitivity of rainfall in the studied stations for obtaining the monthly rainfall in isfahan benchmark station was evaluated separately using anfis model in each evaluation the isfahan rainfall data with one year delay was entered into the model as the constant input while the rainfall data from one of the candidate stations has been used as the variable input then the prediction process was carried out for modelling monthly rainfall in the target station table 3 shows the results of non linear sensitivity analysis the results obtained from the non linear sensitivity analysis confirmed that most of the statements drawn from the correlation coefficient were valid the analysis showed that kabutar abad r2 0 84 rmse 3 76 mm and si 0 36 and in the following shahreza r2 0 75 rmse 5 11 mm and si 0 33 could provide the best input data for simulating the rainfall values for the target station in contrast ardestan r2 0 43 rmse 7 84 mm and si 0 77 kashan r2 0 42 rmse 8 35 and si 0 64 and khur biyabanak r2 0 37 rmse 9 84 mm and si 1 23 introduced as the weakest locations for providing the necessary inputs of rainfall modeling in target station 3 3 prediction groups the identification of different groups was carried out by selecting the most correlated stations with the target site isfahan for this 3 groups were determined i1 i2 and i3 the groups were arranged according to the results of correlation coefficient it means that group i1 was included rainfall data of three stations with highest correlation coefficient kabutar abad shahreza and golpayegan the correlation of rainfall data between three mentioned stations and isfahan were 0 94 0 87 and 0 75 respectively table 2 for arranging group i2 the fourth priority naien with correlation about 0 73 was added to i1 at last i3 the fifth priority daran was added into the i2 3 3 1 group i 1 group i 1 included the monthly rainfall data of kabutar abad shahreza and golpayegan surveys showed that anfis acor could be introduced as the most accurate model results indicated that training system using acor improved the anfis performance by 0 40 3 14 mm and 0 38 in r2 rmse and si respectively table 5 becasuse the data divided into test and training phase randomely this can be lead to the over fitting problem totally classic trainer algorithms are too depondent to the training data and cannot reveal an acceptable performance in test phase fig 4 unlike classic anfis hybrid ones showed relaible performance in training and test phase so that in the best hybrid model anfis acor values of r2 rmse and si in training and test phases were respectively 0 91 2 72 0 19 and 0 86 3 67 and 0 23 the obtained results showed that acor prevented the system from trapping in local optima and over fitting issues kisi et al 2018 this performance of acor method can be due to the ability of this algorithm for the modeling of complex phenomena like rainfall after the acor the ga and de ranked in the second and third stages the weak performance of pso for optimizing the anfis can be due to the weakness of this algorithm in solving hard problems compared to acor and ga in fact because of simple structure pso couldn t optimize the rainfall values properly table 5 the results obtained in this study are in close agreement with other reports hassanvand et al 2018 argued that classic ann and anfis were not able to predict river flood routing in satisfying form just the bat algorithm and imperialist competitive algorithm ica as trainer schemes the performance of the classic models was enhanced it is notable that results obtained by anfis fcm were reported in this study because it led to the best performance for the classical anfis compared to the other algorithms the results of sc and gp algorithms of anfis are shown in table 4 3 3 2 group i 2 group i 2 included the monthly rainfall data for group i 1 plus data of naien station the results of using this data group as input showed that anfis acor and anfis de with little difference were ranked as the first and second most accurate models trained models using ga and pso placed in the third and fourth ranks finally sole anfis introduced as the weakest model with r2 rmse and si respectively equal to 0 33 9 98 mm and 0 90 table 6 in this section some interesting resulted are noticed group i2 significantly improved the performance of hybrid models while decreased the performance of classic anfis table 6 and fig 5 these results can be laid on a point that the classic anfis which uses gradient based learning techniques such as back propagation needs lots of burden to be optimized and trained when inputs are growing shihabudheen and pillai 2018b on the other hand hybrid models had a suitable capability in modeling minimum and maximum points it is noteworthy that the suddenly changes in hyetograph points can generate floods so the models ability for predicting these point can be very important per hydrological studies the acceptable performance of ea in modeling extreme points is also reported by other studies kisi et al 2017a b yaseen et al 2017 hassanvand et al 2018 3 3 3 group i 3 group i 3 included the historical monthly rainfall data of group i 2 plus data from daran station table 7 in the test stage anfis acor r2 0 92 rmse 2 95 mm si 0 22 and anfis de r2 0 91 rmse 2 96 mm si 0 26 ranked closely as the first and second most accurate models the next two models respectively were anfis ga and anfis pso in this division simple anfis presented the weakest results with the coefficient of determination lower than 0 20 and rmse values more than 15 also over fitting values and failing in correct routeing increased fig 6 obviously which can prove the accuracy of discussed reasons mentioned in the previous part on the other hand the performance of hybrid models was unchanged while one of the input variables with a low coefficient of determination was added fig 6 moreover the obtained results indicated that proposed hybrid models when confronted with irrelevant variables had higher certainty rather than simple anfis the results obtained by this study are compatible with other investigations done on the training of artificial intelligence models with different algorithms 4 conclusion the spatial correlation coefficient and non linear sensitivity analysis used in this study showed high overlapping the spatial correlation coefficient showed that rainfall data from kabutar abad station with the coefficient of determination equal to 0 94 was the best input for the models non linear analysis confirmed the results obtained by the spatial correlation coefficient r2 0 84 rmse 3 76 mm si 0 36 group i 2 which included historical rainfall data from kabutar abad shahreza golpayegan and naien stations were introduced as the most effective group in the prediction of rainfall in isfahan station based on statistical indices anfis acor with most suitable statistical indices was the best hybrid model for all three input groups simple anfis was judged to be incapable of accurately predicting monthly rainfall for study area by the available data unlike other models in this study anfis performance dropped as the data volume increased the examination of the evidence indicates that an accurate sensitivity analysis and availability of optimum input make a significant improvement in the results provided by the models furthermore hybrid intelligent algorithms made improvements in anfis models used for rainfall forecast for the study area overall it can be concluded that presented algorithms had the suitable capability in training and improving the performance of anfis conflict of interest the authors declared that there is no conflict

6643,knowledge of the spatial distribution of water isotopes in the large river system is useful to comprehend the hydrological processes within the basin spatially limited water isotope data in the ganga river basin grb one of the largest river basins in the world hinders the understanding of hydrological processes at the basin scale therefore to understand the hydrological processes river water and ground water were collected from the source gangotri glacier to sink bay of bengal of the river ganga the δ18o values of river water vary from 14 9 to 6 3 with a general enrichment in 18o from source to sink the δ18o values of ground water are similar to river water only in the middle stretch of the river indicating higher mixing of these two water sources in the middle stretch comparison of the monthly averaged three years δ18o values of river water and rain water suggests that temporal variability in the isotopic composition of river water is higher in the middle stretch of the river compared to lower stretch due to lower discharge in the middle stretch to understand the spatial variability of δ18o values in the grb δ18o values of river water were modeled using latitude and elevation as primary predictors the residuals of the model suggest that in the upper stretch snow glacier melt control the δ18o values in the lower stretch himalayan tributaries control the isotopic composition of the river water and in the middle stretch evaporation dominates which is also supported by δ18o δd plots of the different water inventories keywords ganga ground water rain water river basin river water stable isotopes 1 introduction the δ18o and δd values of river water have been frequently used to understand hydrological processes in the river catchment kendall and coplen 2001 halder et al 2015 sources of water in the main channel sklash et al 1976 sklash 1990 lambs 2000 karim and veizer 2002 gibson et al 2005 ala aho et al 2018 and the role of natural variables on river discharge ogrinc et al 2008 koeniger et al 2009 to monitor the spatio temporal variation in δ18o and δd values of river water international atomic energy agency iaea has established the global network for isotopes in river gnir bowen and wilkinson 2002 terzer et al 2013 evaristo 2015 birkel et al 2018 in comparison to relatively dense monitoring stations in north america or europe isotopic records of δ18o values of river water in the indian subcontinent are extremely scarce bhattacharya et al 1985 krishnamurthy and bhattacharya 1991 navada and rao 1991 ramesh and sarin 1992 rai et al 2009 achyuthan et al 2010 maurya et al 2011 resmi et al 2016 khan et al 2017 the existing studies have either focused on estimating glacier melt contributions in upper stretches of the river or impact of climate in part of a catchment however the hydrology of large river systems cannot be understood by the fragmental dataset rivers spanning hundreds of kilometer may have a distinct isotopic composition in upstream compared to downstream as they integrate water and hydrological processes from the sub catchments simpson and herczeg 1991 ferguson et al 2007 halder et al 2015 therefore to comprehend the hydrological processes in a large river basin and to understand the interplay between water inventories it is important to monitor the spatio temporal isotopic variability of water sources in the river basin the river ganga 2500 km the largest river of the indian subcontinent originates from the gangotri glacier 30 55 593 n 79 4 826 e and drains into the bay of bengal the river flows through indo gangetic plains bordered by the himalaya in the north and vindhya satpura ranges in the south the river ganga along with its tributaries covers a drainage area of 1 08 106 km2 known as ganga river basin grb the headwater of tributaries originating from the himalayan cryosphere is dominated by snow and glacier melt ramesh and sarin 1992 maurya et al 2011 khan et al 2017 the mean annual rainfall of the grb ranges from 350 mm in the west to 2500 mm in the east fig 1 with most of the rain occurring during summer monsoon june september such variations in the rainfall are expected to impact the river discharge in different stretches of the river ganga however the relation between rain amount and river discharge in different climate zones of the grb remains unexplored previous studies have examined δ18o and δd values of river water rai et al 2009 maurya et al 2011 rai et al 2014 rain water kumar et al 2010 rai et al 2014 and ground water bhattacharya et al 1985 from the grb either to delineate the water source or to understand the processes of evaporation evapotranspiration and moisture recycling in the water inventories most of the studies have focused on the upper stretches of the river and have tried to estimate the glacier melt contribution however such estimates show significant discrepancies from the same catchment mainly due to differences in end member isotopic composition or assumption associated with the method of budget estimation moreover none of the existing studies dealt with isotopic composition of the ganga river water and its tributaries from the middle and lower stretch of the river gajurel et al 2006 in attempt to unfold the relationship between the isotopic compositions of modern mollusc shell and fresh water have presented few river water isotopic data from middle and lower stretch of the river ganga but the study did not focus on the hydrological processes the middle and lower stretch of the river ganga plays a significant role in the river discharge as most of the major tributaries of ganga join in this region these tributaries are fed by snow and glaciers melt water from the southern front of the east west trending himalayan belt also these tributaries pass through the areas characterized by high rainfall therefore it is important to understand the impact of major tributaries in river ganga and contribution of rain water and ground water into the main river channel to address these issues systematic sampling of river water and ground water from the source gomukh to sink bay of bengal has been carried out along the river ganga major tributaries of river ganga were sampled to understand their influence on the main channel of river ganga to comprehend the effect of seasonality in different climatic zone of the grb the isotopic composition of river water and rain water were monitored for three years from two climatically contrast regions to integrate the spatial variability in the isotopic composition of river water across the grb isotope data of river water n 540 were compiled a model has been developed using δ18o value latitude and elevation to simulate the spatial isotopic variability of river water in the grb kendall and coplen 2001 dutton et al 2005 the residuals from the derived model have been used to explain the hydrological processes operating in different stretches of the river ganga 2 methodology 2 1 sampling technique the water samples were collected in 60 ml polypropylene pp airtight bottles samples of river water n 47 were generally taken from mid of the channel and a sampling depth of 0 4 m was maintained for locations where the flow velocity of the river was high samples were collected from the bank of the river monthly river water samples n 67 from two locations in the ganga river were collected in the year 2007 2008 2009 from kanpur and in 2011 2012 2013 from kolkata rain water samples n 262 were also collected from the same locations for the above mentioned period using manual rain gauges the rain water samples were collected in the morning 09 00 ist of the rainy days late summer monsoon samples sept 2014 of river water and ground water were collected along the river ganga ground water samples n 162 were collected from tube wells in close vicinity of the river spanning a distance of 3 to 45 km prior to collecting water the tube wells were purged for first 5 7 min to make sure that the pre existing water in the pipeline was drained the glacier sample n 1 was collected from the snout of gangotri glacier gomukh the glacier sample was broken into small chunks and was put into airtight pp bottles for melting in a closed environment stream st samples n 8 were collected between gomukh and gangotri table 1 for simplicity of discussion the river ganga is divided into 3 segments depending on the prevailing climatic condition in the region fig 1 the upper stretch of the river covers gomukh to fatehgarh with mean annual precipitation map ranging between 1350 mm and 800 mm the region from jarauli to rudrapur defines the middle stretch with map ranging from 1000 to 800 mm and the lower stretch covers doriganj to diamond harbor with map ranging from 1800 to 1000 mm fig 1 2 2 stable isotopic analysis the water samples were brought to stable isotope laboratory of the indian institute of science education and research kolkata iiser k and were stored at 4 c 500 μl of each water sample was analyzed via a gas bench ii coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer mat 253 for the measurement of δ18o and δd values water samples were equilibrated with co2 and h2 for the measurement of δ18o and δd values respectively the isotope value of the samples were calibrated using three international standards vsmow2 δ18o 0 σ 0 02 δ d 0 σ 0 3 slap2 δ18o 55 50

vsmow 2 3 satellite data rainfall harris and jones 2017 and elevation data mitchell 2014 along with ground based isotope measurements have been used to create isotopic maps for the grb the cru time series ts version 4 01 has been used to archive a high resolution gridded climate data rainfall over the period of jan 1901 dec 2016 on a grid of 0 5 0 5 the data have been processed using climate data operators cdo command in ubuntu version 16 04 4 and the maps were generated using ferret version 7 4 2 4 model derivation a two step regression technique has been used to simulate the δ18o values of river water across the grb dutton et al 2005 the δ18o values of river water n 540 used in the study were compiled from published literatures bhattacharya et al 1985 navada and rao 1991 garzione et al 2000 pande et al 2000 gajurel et al 2006 hren et al 2009 rai et al 2009 maurya et al 2011 turchyn et al 2013 racoviteanu et al 2013 majumder et al 2013 hoffmann et al 2016 varay et al 2017 khan et al 2017 in addition to the results obtained from the present study table s1 in the model latitudinal lat and elevation elev dependence of δ18o values river water has been represented using second order polynomial equations fig 2 a and b the relationship between latitude elev 200 m and δ18o value of river water is described as 1 δ 18 o river water 0 046 lat 2 1 9277 lat 27 045 with r2 0 52 fig 2a the δ18o values from sampling locations with elev 200 m n 107 were selected to minimize the effect of topography in δ18o values of river water the relation between δ18o values of river water and elevation is derived from the cross plot of residual from eq 1 and elevation this allowed to estimate the latitude independent effect of elevation on δ18o values of the river water the equation is described as 2 residual 2 10 7 elev 2 0 0008 elev 0 6351 with r2 0 69 fig 2b eqs 1 and 2 were combined to obtain the final equation describing the δ18o values of river water as a function of latitude

diagram of map in the grb along with the δ18o values of river ganga and its tributaries are shown in fig 1 the δ18o values of river water vary by 8 6 and δd values vary by 60 along the full stretch of the river ganga table 1 the tributaries joining from the northern side are gomti ghaghara gandak and kosi with δ18o values of 7 7 8 8 9 8 9 1 and δd values of 55 55 65 62 respectively fig 1 the tributaries joining from the southern side are yamuna and sone with δ18o values of 6 1 6 6 and δd values of 48 62 respectively fig 1 at snout of the gomukh glacier the δ18o value of river water is 14 9 and glacier ice is 15 6 the maximum variation in the δ18o values 14 9 to 8 8 of river water is observed in the upper stretch of river ganga the δ18o values of the stream samples in the upper stretch of the river range from 15 0 to 9 8 table 1 at devprayag river alkananda with δ18o value of 11 3 joins river ganga and changes the isotope composition from 11 9 to 11 7 fig 1 in the middle stretch tributaries ramganga yamuna and gomti meet the river ganga the river yamuna joins the main channel of ganga at allahabad and changes the δ18o value of the river ganga from 7 1 to 6 8 fig 1 in the lower stretch river ghaghara sone gandak and kosi join the main channel of river ganga the river ghaghara joins ganga at rudrapur and changes the δ18o value of the main channel of river ganga from 6 3 to 8 5 fig 1 river sone and gandak join the main channel of ganga at doriganj and patna respectively these tributaries together change the δ18o value of river ganga from 8 5 to 7 5 fig 1 further downstream river kosi joins the ganga river at kursela and changes the δ18o value of the river ganga from 7 9 to 8 1 fig 1 the isotopic composition of ground water shows a gentle enrichment trend from source to sink of the river with a variation of 4 2 in δ18o and 34 in δd values table 1 the monthly averaged 3 years δ18o values of river water vary from 6 7 to 3 8 at kanpur and 8 1 to 6 2 at kolkata table s2 three years monthly weighted average δ18o values of rain water vary from 8 2 to 1 4 at kanpur and 8 9 to 0 7 at kolkata table s2 the cross plots of δ18o and δd values of river water rain water and ground water were used to draw river water line rwl local meteoric water line lmwl and ground water line gwl for the upper middle and lower stretch of river ganga table s3 3 2 model derived observations the cross plot of δ18o and δd values of river water from the grb provided the rwl as δd 8 1 δ18o 12 8 with r2 of 0 98 fig 3 the strong correlation suggests that both oxygen and hydrogen isotopes responded in similar way to hydrological processes and for simplicity all the discussion in this paper is done using δ18o values the isoscape for δ18o values of river water across the grb is presented in fig 4 the relation between newly measured and modeled δ18o values of river water is δ18omeasured 1 006 δ18omodeled with r2 0 75 fig 2c the difference between measured and modeled δ18o values of river water herein termed as residual range from 7 1 to 4 5 μ 0 08 σ 1 93 fig 2d the residuals have been used to explain the hydrological processes in different stretches of the river ganga the upper and lower stretch of the river ganga show negative residuals and middle stretch shows positive residuals fig 5 4 discussions the strong correlation between modeled and the measured δ18o values in the ganga river fig 2c suggests that the model captures 75 of the isotopic variability of river water the gaussian distribution of the residuals with a peak around zero suggests that the model accurately captures the broad range of the measured values fig 2d the residual values reflect the importance of other factors on the isotopic composition of river water in addition to the predictors used in the model the negative residuals imply that the δ18o value of river water is lower than the modeled value and vice versa in case of positive residuals the negative residual is the result of contribution of 18o depleted water into river whereas the positive residual suggests evaporation of river water or mixing of 18o enriched water with the river water interestingly the relationship between δ18o and δd values of river water across the grb is similar to the gmwl of rozanski et al 1993 δd 8 2 δ18o 11 3 which suggests that the primary source of water over the grb is rain water and the river water has integrated the isotopic signature of different water inventories from the drainage basin in this study most of the water samples from the upper stretch of ganga show negative residuals indicating the influence of the catchment the catchment effect here is defined as contribution of water from higher elevation watershed the observed negative residuals for most of the sample from the upper stretch suggest the influence of snow and glacier melt water from higher elevation the δ18o values of stream water from the upper stretch of the river show a general enrichment trend with decreasing elevation table 1 variation of 5 in δ18o values of streams within a small stretch of 17 km is the result of change in the mean elevation and area of the watershed fig 6 however the δ18o values in stream 5 and 6 are higher compared to the general trend due to lower mean elevation and smaller areas of the watershed fig 6 with a 100 m increase in elevation 0 3 decrease in δ18o value is observed in the streams water fig 6 the main channel of river ganga shows 0 1 decrease in δ18o value with a 100 m increase in elevation the altitude effect observed in the present study is similar to the value obtained by khan et al 2017 0 1 100 m however the present data differ from the altitude effect shown by ramesh and sarin 1992 0 2 100 m to comprehend the temporal variability of glacier melt contribution in the river ganga isotopic records since the year 1982 of river water at devprayag and rishikesh have been compiled table s1 the low variability in δ18o values of river water at devprayag suggest that the glacier melt contribution did not change significantly over the time ramesh and sarin 1992 maurya et al 2011 khan et al 2017 any change in the glacier melt contribution would have been reflected in the isotopic composition of river water monitoring of areal extent of glaciers also showed that though the glaciers have retreated over time the rate of retreat of glaciers from the central himalaya has remained almost constant since 1980 bolch et al 2012 the confluence of the tributaries also significantly changes the δ18o value of main channel of the river ganga the change in δ18o value depends on the difference between δ18o value of water in the main channel and the tributary and fraction of water contributed by the tributary at devprayag the contribution of water from river alkananda enriches the isotopic composition of river ganga by 0 2 a mass balance calculation using the δ18o value of river water suggests addition of 33 water from the alkananda river into river ganga regional climate also plays important role in shaping the isotopic composition of water sources the rwl lmwl and gwl have been used to understand the environmental processes in different stretches of the ganga river fig 7 the slope 7 3 and intercept 8 9 of rwl fig 7a in the upper stretch of the river suggest minimal evaporation in the river water the high flow deep valley and low temperature in the upper stretch restrict evaporation of river water the slope 7 8 and intercept 9 2 of lmwl fig 7b is comparable to the gmwl which suggests the effect of evaporation was insignificant in rain water in the upper stretch however the slope 4 4 and intercept 17 2 of gwl fig 7c suggest high evaporative enrichment of ground water in the upper stretch as the source of shallow ground water is rain water enriched isotopic composition implies evaporation of rain water in soil horizons en route to the aquifer the slope and intercept of rwl are distinctly different from gwl which suggests that ground water contribution in the main river channel is not significant in the upper stretch of the river the positive residuals in the middle stretch suggest enrichment of 18o in river water fig 5 such enrichment can result from the evaporation of river water or significant contribution from 18o enriched sources in the middle stretch river yamuna joins the main channel of river ganga and changes the δ18o value from 7 1 to 6 8 fig 1 indicating addition of 30 water from the river yamuna the rwl from the middle stretch fig 7d suggests a significant effect of evaporation in the river water the lmwl from the middle stretch of the river also suggests evaporation effect slope 7 3 intercept 2 2 fig 7e a similar slope and intercept were also observed from other places in and around the middle stretch of river ganga datta et al 1991 mukherjee and chandrashekharan 1993 kumar et al 2010 the low slope and intercept of lmwl have been attributed to evaporation during rainout due to dry climate in the region the slope 5 7 and intercept 11 6 of gwl in the middle stretch also suggest significant evaporative enrichment fig 7f the difference between the δ18o values of river water and ground water decreases from the upper stretch to middle stretch of the river the comparison of δ18o values of river water and ground water in the middle stretch suggests mixing between these two water sources the δ18o values of river water diluting towards the ground water in and around middle stretch suggests contribution of ground water into river water fig 8 the gwl obtained from the present study fig 7f shows significant deviation from the gwl reported by bhattacharya et al 1985 δd 6 8 δ18o 2 2 and krishnamurthy and bhattacharya 1991 δd 6 4 δ18o 1 the deviation is possibly result of difference in sampling traverse in the present study isotopic compositions of ground water from the middle stretch of the river have been used whereas the aforementioned literatures considered diverse regions in the middle stretch although the authors considered the isotopic compositions of ground water as a proxy for rain water the present study shows a major difference between the gwl and lmwl in the middle stretch which suggests evaporation is significantly affecting the isotopic composition of ground water three years isotopic compositions of river water and rain water from kanpur middle stretch and kolkata lower stretch have been used to comprehend the influence of seasonality in the isotopic composition of river water a strong seasonal control is observed in the isotopic composition of rain water with lower δ18o values for summer monsoon and higher δ18o values during winter fig 9 lower isotopic variability is observed in river water δ δ18o 2 9 compared to that of rain water δ δ18o 9 6 which suggests that the river shows the average isotopic composition of ground water and rain water over the catchment area the synchronous decrease in the δ18o values of river and rain water with the onset summer monsoon characterized by high rainfall suggests major contributions of rain water into the river during monsoonal months fig 9 the lower stretch of river ganga shows negative residuals fig 5 this might be the effect of the contribution of tributaries originating from the himalaya these tributaries draining the himalayan cryosphere bring water which is depleted in 18o fig 1 the influence of river ghaghara results in a lowering of δ18o values by 2 2 in the main channel of river ganga fig 1 the mass balance calculation using δ18o suggests addition of 88 water from the ghaghara river into the river ganga which differs with the discharge record 37 rao 1975 the discrepancy observed may be related to the morphological setting of sampling location the satellite images show that the main channel of river ganga bifurcates before the confluence of river ghaghara and joins 3 km before the sampled location such small distance probably did not allow the mixing of water further downstream river gandak and sone together enrich the δ18o value of river ganga from 8 5 to 7 5 fig 1 discharge data rao 1975 show that river gandak at the confluence contributes 15 and river sone contributes 11 water into the river ganga river kosi lowers the δ18o value of river ganga by 0 2 fig 1 suggesting a contribution of 17 water into the river ganga the discharge data from rao 1975 also showed an addition of 15 water by river kosi the results from the isotope mixing calculation and ganga river discharge data rao 1975 suggest that a large fraction of water is added by the tributaries in the lower stretch of the river ganga which significantly controls the isotopic composition of river water the low slope 6 7 and intercept 0 8 of rwl fig 7g in the lower stretch of river suggest the presence of evaporatively enriched water the lmwl from the lower stretch suggests that the evaporative effect is insignificant in rain water fig 7h the slope 8 3 in the lmwl probably suggests addition of water from local moisture sources in contrast the gwl with slope of 6 2 and intercept of 4 2 suggest evaporation effect in ground water the values observed in ground water in this study are quite similar to the values obtained by krishnamurthy and bhattacharya 1991 the evaporation of river water should have resulted in positive residuals compared to the modeled values however high contributions 47 of isotopically depleted water from the himalayan tributaries rao 1975 masked the evaporative effect the long term isotopic records of rain water from the lower stretch kolkata show strong seasonal control with lower δ18o values during summer monsoon and higher δ18o values during winter fig 9 the variability in river water δ δ18oriver 1 9 is smaller compared to rain water δ δ18orain 9 6 which suggests that the river water shows average isotopic composition of different water sources from the catchments the lowering in the δ18o values of river water occurs only during peak monsoon period fig 9 which suggests influence of rain water on the isotopic composition of river water the river water shows higher annual variability at kanpur δ δ18oriver 2 9 compared to kolkata δ δ18oriver 1 9 fig 9 such difference is the effect of variation in a discharge and b rainfall distribution at the two locations the river discharge at kanpur is 1 10th of that at farraka a place near to kolkata which makes the river water at kanpur more prone to isotopic change compared to kolkata it is also observed that 90 of the rain in kanpur occurs during the summer monsoon period whereas in kolkata summer monsoon contributes 70 of total rain these two factors together imparted the higher variability in δ δ18oriver at kanpur compared to kolkata 5 conclusions isotopic compositions of river water ground water and rain water have been used to understand the hydrological processes in the grb the upper stretch of the river ganga shows catchment effect with a significant contribution of snow and glacier melt from the higher elevation the middle and lower stretch of the river has major contribution of water from rain and ground water the lower stretch of the river ganga also receives a significant contribution of water from the tributaries draining the himalayas the effect of evaporation is higher in the middle stretch as the region falls in the dry climatic zone mixing between the river water and ground water is higher in the middle stretch compared to the upper and lower stretch of the river the δ18o values of river water and its relation with latitude and elevation provided a river water isoscape over the grb though the isoscape of river water has been used as a proxy for the isotopic composition of rain water in different parts of the world caution should be taken for regions where seasonality plays important role in the river discharge a significant difference can exist between isotopic compositions of rain water and river water if a region is characterized by seasonal rainfall as the indian climate is seasonal in nature the isoscape model for different seasons would glean out more insight into the hydrological processes additionally comparison of the river water isoscape with the rain water and ground water isoscape over the grb would provide a better insight into the interplay among these three water inventories despite the limitation the isoscape of river water can be used for palaeoelevation and palaeoclimate reconstruction in the region with no isotopic records

6643,knowledge of the spatial distribution of water isotopes in the large river system is useful to comprehend the hydrological processes within the basin spatially limited water isotope data in the ganga river basin grb one of the largest river basins in the world hinders the understanding of hydrological processes at the basin scale therefore to understand the hydrological processes river water and ground water were collected from the source gangotri glacier to sink bay of bengal of the river ganga the δ18o values of river water vary from 14 9 to 6 3 with a general enrichment in 18o from source to sink the δ18o values of ground water are similar to river water only in the middle stretch of the river indicating higher mixing of these two water sources in the middle stretch comparison of the monthly averaged three years δ18o values of river water and rain water suggests that temporal variability in the isotopic composition of river water is higher in the middle stretch of the river compared to lower stretch due to lower discharge in the middle stretch to understand the spatial variability of δ18o values in the grb δ18o values of river water were modeled using latitude and elevation as primary predictors the residuals of the model suggest that in the upper stretch snow glacier melt control the δ18o values in the lower stretch himalayan tributaries control the isotopic composition of the river water and in the middle stretch evaporation dominates which is also supported by δ18o δd plots of the different water inventories keywords ganga ground water rain water river basin river water stable isotopes 1 introduction the δ18o and δd values of river water have been frequently used to understand hydrological processes in the river catchment kendall and coplen 2001 halder et al 2015 sources of water in the main channel sklash et al 1976 sklash 1990 lambs 2000 karim and veizer 2002 gibson et al 2005 ala aho et al 2018 and the role of natural variables on river discharge ogrinc et al 2008 koeniger et al 2009 to monitor the spatio temporal variation in δ18o and δd values of river water international atomic energy agency iaea has established the global network for isotopes in river gnir bowen and wilkinson 2002 terzer et al 2013 evaristo 2015 birkel et al 2018 in comparison to relatively dense monitoring stations in north america or europe isotopic records of δ18o values of river water in the indian subcontinent are extremely scarce bhattacharya et al 1985 krishnamurthy and bhattacharya 1991 navada and rao 1991 ramesh and sarin 1992 rai et al 2009 achyuthan et al 2010 maurya et al 2011 resmi et al 2016 khan et al 2017 the existing studies have either focused on estimating glacier melt contributions in upper stretches of the river or impact of climate in part of a catchment however the hydrology of large river systems cannot be understood by the fragmental dataset rivers spanning hundreds of kilometer may have a distinct isotopic composition in upstream compared to downstream as they integrate water and hydrological processes from the sub catchments simpson and herczeg 1991 ferguson et al 2007 halder et al 2015 therefore to comprehend the hydrological processes in a large river basin and to understand the interplay between water inventories it is important to monitor the spatio temporal isotopic variability of water sources in the river basin the river ganga 2500 km the largest river of the indian subcontinent originates from the gangotri glacier 30 55 593 n 79 4 826 e and drains into the bay of bengal the river flows through indo gangetic plains bordered by the himalaya in the north and vindhya satpura ranges in the south the river ganga along with its tributaries covers a drainage area of 1 08 106 km2 known as ganga river basin grb the headwater of tributaries originating from the himalayan cryosphere is dominated by snow and glacier melt ramesh and sarin 1992 maurya et al 2011 khan et al 2017 the mean annual rainfall of the grb ranges from 350 mm in the west to 2500 mm in the east fig 1 with most of the rain occurring during summer monsoon june september such variations in the rainfall are expected to impact the river discharge in different stretches of the river ganga however the relation between rain amount and river discharge in different climate zones of the grb remains unexplored previous studies have examined δ18o and δd values of river water rai et al 2009 maurya et al 2011 rai et al 2014 rain water kumar et al 2010 rai et al 2014 and ground water bhattacharya et al 1985 from the grb either to delineate the water source or to understand the processes of evaporation evapotranspiration and moisture recycling in the water inventories most of the studies have focused on the upper stretches of the river and have tried to estimate the glacier melt contribution however such estimates show significant discrepancies from the same catchment mainly due to differences in end member isotopic composition or assumption associated with the method of budget estimation moreover none of the existing studies dealt with isotopic composition of the ganga river water and its tributaries from the middle and lower stretch of the river gajurel et al 2006 in attempt to unfold the relationship between the isotopic compositions of modern mollusc shell and fresh water have presented few river water isotopic data from middle and lower stretch of the river ganga but the study did not focus on the hydrological processes the middle and lower stretch of the river ganga plays a significant role in the river discharge as most of the major tributaries of ganga join in this region these tributaries are fed by snow and glaciers melt water from the southern front of the east west trending himalayan belt also these tributaries pass through the areas characterized by high rainfall therefore it is important to understand the impact of major tributaries in river ganga and contribution of rain water and ground water into the main river channel to address these issues systematic sampling of river water and ground water from the source gomukh to sink bay of bengal has been carried out along the river ganga major tributaries of river ganga were sampled to understand their influence on the main channel of river ganga to comprehend the effect of seasonality in different climatic zone of the grb the isotopic composition of river water and rain water were monitored for three years from two climatically contrast regions to integrate the spatial variability in the isotopic composition of river water across the grb isotope data of river water n 540 were compiled a model has been developed using δ18o value latitude and elevation to simulate the spatial isotopic variability of river water in the grb kendall and coplen 2001 dutton et al 2005 the residuals from the derived model have been used to explain the hydrological processes operating in different stretches of the river ganga 2 methodology 2 1 sampling technique the water samples were collected in 60 ml polypropylene pp airtight bottles samples of river water n 47 were generally taken from mid of the channel and a sampling depth of 0 4 m was maintained for locations where the flow velocity of the river was high samples were collected from the bank of the river monthly river water samples n 67 from two locations in the ganga river were collected in the year 2007 2008 2009 from kanpur and in 2011 2012 2013 from kolkata rain water samples n 262 were also collected from the same locations for the above mentioned period using manual rain gauges the rain water samples were collected in the morning 09 00 ist of the rainy days late summer monsoon samples sept 2014 of river water and ground water were collected along the river ganga ground water samples n 162 were collected from tube wells in close vicinity of the river spanning a distance of 3 to 45 km prior to collecting water the tube wells were purged for first 5 7 min to make sure that the pre existing water in the pipeline was drained the glacier sample n 1 was collected from the snout of gangotri glacier gomukh the glacier sample was broken into small chunks and was put into airtight pp bottles for melting in a closed environment stream st samples n 8 were collected between gomukh and gangotri table 1 for simplicity of discussion the river ganga is divided into 3 segments depending on the prevailing climatic condition in the region fig 1 the upper stretch of the river covers gomukh to fatehgarh with mean annual precipitation map ranging between 1350 mm and 800 mm the region from jarauli to rudrapur defines the middle stretch with map ranging from 1000 to 800 mm and the lower stretch covers doriganj to diamond harbor with map ranging from 1800 to 1000 mm fig 1 2 2 stable isotopic analysis the water samples were brought to stable isotope laboratory of the indian institute of science education and research kolkata iiser k and were stored at 4 c 500 μl of each water sample was analyzed via a gas bench ii coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer mat 253 for the measurement of δ18o and δd values water samples were equilibrated with

data operators cdo command in ubuntu version 16 04 4 and the maps were generated using ferret version 7 4 2 4 model derivation a two step regression technique has been used to simulate the δ18o values of river water across the grb dutton et al 2005 the δ18o values of river water n 540 used in the study were compiled from published literatures bhattacharya et al 1985 navada and rao 1991 garzione et

al 2017 in addition to the results obtained from the present study table s1 in the model latitudinal lat and elevation elev dependence of δ18o values river water has been represented using second order polynomial equations fig 2 a and b the relationship between latitude elev 200 m and δ18o value of river water is described as 1 δ 18 o river water 0 046 lat 2 1 9277 lat 27 045 with r2 0 52 fig 2a the δ18o values from sampling locations with elev 200 m n 107 were selected to minimize the effect of topography in δ18o values of river water the relation between δ18o values of river water and elevation is derived from the cross plot of residual from eq 1 and elevation this allowed to estimate the latitude independent effect of elevation on δ18o values of the river water the equation is described as 2 residual 2 10 7 elev 2 0 0008 elev 0 6351 with r2 0 69 fig 2b eqs 1 and 2 were combined to obtain the final equation describing the δ18o values of river water as a function of latitude

diagram of map in the grb along with the δ18o values of river ganga and its tributaries are shown in fig 1 the δ18o values of river water vary by 8 6 and δd values vary by 60 along the full stretch of the river ganga table 1 the tributaries joining from the northern side are gomti ghaghara gandak and kosi with δ18o values of 7 7 8 8 9 8 9 1 and δd values of 55 55 65 62 respectively fig 1 the tributaries joining from the southern side are yamuna and sone with δ18o values of 6 1 6 6 and δd values of 48 62 respectively fig 1 at snout of the gomukh glacier the δ18o value of river water is 14 9 and glacier ice is 15 6 the maximum variation in the δ18o values 14 9 to 8 8 of river water is observed in the upper stretch of river ganga the δ18o values of the stream samples in the upper stretch of the river range from 15 0 to 9 8 table 1 at devprayag river alkananda with δ18o value of 11 3 joins river ganga and changes the isotope composition from 11 9 to 11 7 fig 1 in the middle stretch tributaries ramganga yamuna and gomti meet the river ganga the river yamuna joins the main channel of ganga at allahabad and changes the δ18o value of the river ganga from 7 1 to 6 8 fig 1 in the lower stretch river ghaghara sone gandak and kosi join the main channel of river ganga the river ghaghara joins ganga at rudrapur and changes the δ18o value of the main channel of river ganga from 6 3 to 8 5 fig 1 river sone and gandak join the main channel of ganga at doriganj and patna respectively these tributaries together change the δ18o value of river ganga from 8 5 to 7 5 fig 1 further downstream river kosi joins the ganga river at kursela and changes the δ18o value of the river ganga from 7 9 to 8 1 fig 1 the isotopic composition of ground water shows a gentle enrichment trend from source to sink of the river with a variation of 4 2 in δ18o and 34 in δd values table 1 the monthly averaged 3 years δ18o values of river water vary from 6 7 to 3 8 at kanpur and 8 1 to 6 2 at kolkata table s2 three years monthly weighted average δ18o values of rain water vary from 8 2 to 1 4 at kanpur and 8 9 to 0 7 at kolkata table s2 the cross plots of δ18o and δd values of river water rain water and ground water were used to draw river water line rwl local meteoric water line lmwl and ground water line gwl for the upper middle and lower stretch of river ganga table s3 3 2 model derived observations the cross plot of δ18o and δd values of river water from the grb provided the rwl as δd 8 1 δ18o 12 8 with r2 of 0 98 fig 3 the strong correlation suggests that both oxygen and hydrogen isotopes responded in similar way to hydrological processes and for simplicity all the discussion in this paper is done using δ18o values the isoscape for δ18o values of river water across the grb is presented in fig 4 the relation between newly measured and modeled δ18o values of river water is δ18omeasured 1 006 δ18omodeled with r2 0 75 fig 2c the difference between measured and modeled δ18o values of river water herein termed as residual range from 7 1 to 4 5 μ 0 08 σ 1 93 fig 2d the residuals have been used to explain the hydrological processes in different stretches of the river ganga the upper and lower stretch of the river ganga show negative residuals and middle stretch shows positive residuals fig 5 4 discussions the strong correlation between modeled and the measured δ18o values in the ganga river fig 2c suggests that the model captures 75 of the isotopic variability of river water the gaussian distribution of the residuals with a peak around zero suggests that the model accurately captures the broad range of the measured values fig 2d the residual values reflect the importance of other factors on the isotopic composition of river water in addition to the predictors used in the model the negative residuals imply that the δ18o value of river water is lower than the modeled value and vice versa in case of positive residuals the negative residual is the result of contribution of 18o depleted water into river whereas the positive residual suggests evaporation of river water or mixing of 18o enriched water with the river water interestingly the relationship between δ18o and δd values of river water across the grb is similar to the gmwl of rozanski et al 1993 δd 8 2 δ18o 11 3 which suggests that the primary source of water over the grb is rain water and the river water has integrated the isotopic signature of different water inventories from the drainage basin in this study most of the water samples from the upper stretch of ganga show negative residuals indicating the influence of the catchment the catchment effect here is defined as contribution of water from higher elevation watershed the observed negative residuals for most of the sample from the upper stretch suggest the influence of snow and glacier melt water from higher elevation the δ18o values of stream water from the upper stretch of the river show a general enrichment trend with decreasing elevation table 1 variation of 5 in δ18o values of streams within a small stretch of 17 km is the result of change in the mean elevation and area of the watershed fig 6 however the δ18o values in stream 5 and 6 are higher compared to the general trend due to lower mean elevation and smaller areas of the watershed fig 6 with a 100 m increase in elevation 0 3 decrease in δ18o value is observed in the streams water fig 6 the main channel of river ganga shows 0 1 decrease in δ18o value with a 100 m increase in elevation the altitude effect observed in the present study is similar to the value obtained by khan et al 2017 0 1 100 m however the present data differ from the altitude effect shown by ramesh and sarin 1992 0 2 100 m to comprehend the temporal variability of glacier melt contribution in the river ganga isotopic records since the year 1982 of river water at devprayag and rishikesh have been compiled table s1 the low variability in δ18o values of river water at devprayag suggest that the glacier melt contribution did not change significantly over the time ramesh and sarin 1992 maurya et al 2011 khan et al 2017 any change in the glacier melt contribution would have been reflected in the isotopic composition of river water monitoring of areal extent of glaciers also showed that though the glaciers have retreated over time the rate of retreat of glaciers from the central himalaya has remained almost constant since 1980 bolch et al 2012 the confluence of the tributaries also significantly changes the δ18o value of main channel of the river ganga the change in δ18o value depends on the difference between δ18o value of water in the main channel and the tributary and fraction of water contributed by the tributary at devprayag the contribution of water from river alkananda enriches the isotopic composition of river ganga by 0 2 a mass balance calculation using the δ18o value of river water suggests addition of 33 water from the alkananda river into river ganga regional climate also plays important role in shaping the isotopic composition of water sources the rwl lmwl and gwl have been used to understand the environmental processes in different stretches of the ganga river fig 7 the slope 7 3 and intercept 8 9 of rwl fig 7a in the upper stretch of the river suggest minimal evaporation in the river water the high flow deep valley and low temperature in the upper stretch restrict evaporation of river water the slope 7 8 and intercept 9 2 of lmwl fig 7b is comparable to the gmwl which suggests the effect of evaporation was insignificant in rain water in the upper stretch however the slope 4 4 and intercept 17 2 of gwl fig 7c suggest high evaporative enrichment of ground water in the upper stretch as the source of shallow ground water is rain water enriched isotopic composition implies evaporation of rain water in soil horizons en route to the aquifer the slope and intercept of rwl are distinctly different from gwl which suggests that ground water contribution in the main river channel is not significant in the upper stretch of the river the positive residuals in the middle stretch suggest enrichment of 18o in river water fig 5 such enrichment can result from the evaporation of river water or significant contribution from 18o enriched sources in the middle stretch river yamuna joins the main channel of river ganga and changes the δ18o value from 7 1 to 6 8 fig 1 indicating addition of 30 water from the river yamuna the rwl from the middle stretch fig 7d suggests a significant effect of evaporation in the river water the lmwl from the middle stretch of the river also suggests evaporation effect slope 7 3 intercept 2 2 fig 7e a similar slope and intercept were also observed from other places in and around the middle stretch of river ganga datta et al 1991 mukherjee and chandrashekharan 1993 kumar et al 2010 the low slope and intercept of lmwl have been attributed to evaporation during rainout due to dry climate in the region the slope 5 7 and intercept 11 6 of gwl in the middle stretch also suggest significant evaporative enrichment fig 7f the difference between the δ18o values of river water and ground water decreases from the upper stretch to middle stretch of the river the comparison of δ18o values of river water and ground water in the middle stretch suggests mixing between these two water sources the δ18o values of river water diluting towards the ground water in and around middle stretch suggests contribution of ground water into river water fig 8 the gwl obtained from the present study fig 7f shows significant deviation from the gwl reported by bhattacharya et al 1985 δd 6 8 δ18o 2 2 and krishnamurthy and bhattacharya 1991 δd 6 4 δ18o 1 the deviation is possibly result of difference in sampling traverse in the present study isotopic compositions of ground water from the middle stretch of the river have been used whereas the aforementioned literatures considered diverse regions in the middle stretch although the authors considered the isotopic compositions of ground water as a proxy for rain water the present study shows a major difference between the gwl and lmwl in the middle stretch which suggests evaporation is significantly affecting the isotopic composition of ground water three years isotopic compositions of river water and rain water from kanpur middle stretch and kolkata lower stretch have been used to comprehend the influence of seasonality in the isotopic composition of river water a strong seasonal control is observed in the isotopic composition of rain water with lower δ18o values for summer monsoon and higher δ18o values during winter fig 9 lower isotopic variability is observed in river water δ δ18o 2 9 compared to that of rain water δ δ18o 9 6 which suggests that the river shows the average isotopic composition of ground water and rain water over the catchment area the synchronous decrease in the δ18o values of river and rain water with the onset summer monsoon characterized by high rainfall suggests major contributions of rain water into the river during monsoonal months fig 9 the lower stretch of river ganga shows negative residuals fig 5 this might be the effect of the contribution of tributaries originating from the himalaya these tributaries draining the himalayan cryosphere bring water which is depleted in 18o fig 1 the influence of river ghaghara results in a lowering of δ18o values by 2 2 in the main channel of river ganga fig 1 the mass balance calculation using δ18o suggests addition of 88 water from the ghaghara river into the river ganga which differs with the discharge record 37 rao 1975 the discrepancy observed may be related to the morphological setting of sampling location the satellite images show that the main channel of river ganga bifurcates before the confluence of river ghaghara and joins 3 km before the sampled location such small distance probably did not allow the mixing of water further downstream river gandak and sone together enrich the δ18o value of river ganga from 8 5 to 7 5 fig 1 discharge data rao 1975 show that river gandak at the confluence contributes 15 and river sone contributes 11 water into the river ganga river kosi lowers the δ18o value of river ganga by 0 2 fig 1 suggesting a contribution of 17 water into the river ganga the discharge data from rao 1975 also showed an addition of 15 water by river kosi the results from the isotope mixing calculation and ganga river discharge data rao 1975 suggest that a large fraction of water is added by the tributaries in the lower stretch of the river ganga which significantly controls the isotopic composition of river water the low slope 6 7 and intercept 0 8 of rwl fig 7g in the lower stretch of river suggest the presence of evaporatively enriched water the lmwl from the lower stretch suggests that the evaporative effect is insignificant in rain water fig 7h the slope 8 3 in the lmwl probably suggests addition of water from local moisture sources in contrast the gwl with slope of 6 2 and intercept of 4 2 suggest evaporation effect in ground water the values observed in ground water in this study are quite similar to the values obtained by krishnamurthy and bhattacharya 1991 the evaporation of river water should have resulted in positive residuals compared to the modeled values however high contributions 47 of isotopically depleted water from the himalayan tributaries rao 1975 masked the evaporative effect the long term isotopic records of rain water from the lower stretch kolkata show strong seasonal control with lower δ18o values during summer monsoon and higher δ18o values during winter fig 9 the variability in river water δ δ18oriver 1 9 is smaller compared to rain water δ δ18orain 9 6 which suggests that the river water shows average isotopic composition of different water sources from the catchments the lowering in the δ18o values of river water occurs only during peak monsoon period fig 9 which suggests influence of rain water on the isotopic composition of river water the river water shows higher annual variability at kanpur δ δ18oriver 2 9 compared to kolkata δ δ18oriver 1 9 fig 9 such difference is the effect of variation in a discharge and b rainfall distribution at the two locations the river discharge at kanpur is 1 10th of that at farraka a place near to kolkata which makes the river water at kanpur more prone to isotopic change compared to kolkata it is also observed that 90 of the rain in kanpur occurs during the summer monsoon period whereas in kolkata summer monsoon contributes 70 of total rain these two factors together imparted the higher variability in δ δ18oriver at kanpur compared to kolkata 5 conclusions isotopic compositions of river water ground water and rain water have been used to understand the hydrological processes in the grb the upper stretch of the river ganga shows catchment effect with a significant contribution of snow and glacier melt from the higher elevation the middle and lower stretch of the river has major contribution of water from rain and ground water the lower stretch of the river ganga also receives a significant contribution of water from the tributaries draining the himalayas the effect of evaporation is higher in the middle stretch as the region falls in the dry climatic zone mixing between the river water and ground water is higher in the middle stretch compared to the upper and lower stretch of the river the δ18o values of river water and its relation with latitude and elevation provided a river water isoscape over the grb though the isoscape of river water has been used as a proxy for the isotopic composition of rain water in different parts of the world caution should be taken for regions where seasonality plays important role in the river discharge a significant difference can exist between isotopic compositions of rain water and river water if a region is characterized by seasonal rainfall as the indian climate is seasonal in nature the isoscape model for different seasons would glean out more insight into the hydrological processes additionally comparison of the river water isoscape with the rain water and ground water isoscape over the grb would provide a better insight into the interplay among these three water inventories despite the limitation the isoscape of river water can be used for palaeoelevation and palaeoclimate reconstruction in the region with no isotopic records

sciences department of aquatic sciences and assessment uppsala sweden corresponding author hydrologists and hydrogeologists both study the flux and storage of water with the numerous interactions and feedback mechanisms of surface water and groundwater traditionally however focus models and scales of the studies differ in this commentary situations are illustrated where boundary conditions that each discipline assumes preserves and actively uses can and have to be overcome these situations occur when the domain of one discipline cannot be separated from the other one because of existing interaction and feedback mechanisms at the boundaries highlighted are especially these boundary conditions where closer collaboration between catchment hydrologists and hydrogeologists would be most useful often such collaborations would be relatively straight forward and rather requiring an increased awareness than novel methods 1 introduction while hydrologists and hydrogeologists both study the flux and storage of water including the numerous interactions and feedback mechanisms between surface water and groundwater they do this traditionally with a different focus and different models and often at different scales hydrology was originally more an engineering discipline and its initial focus was to estimate design values for floods or droughts or to assess water balances for catchments later hydrology developed also into a scientific discipline with strong links to geoscience ecology and environmental science hydrogeology was developed as a sub discipline of geology and many hydrogeologists have a background in geology rather than engineering traditionally hydrogeology focuses on questions related to the quantities of water stored in the subsurface and the abstraction of groundwater for water supply as well as groundwater flow more recently the fate of contaminants and strategies for groundwater remediation have become an important topic in hydrogeology miller and gray 2008 stephens 2008 the separate development of the two disciplines comes along with confusion and misunderstandings regarding the terminology with different emphasis in field campaigns different educational approaches and different conceptual models several of these aspects have been recently discussed by barthel 2014 simplified assumptions about surface and subsurface fluxes at the boundary of the modelled domain so called boundary conditions are an important part of the different model concepts in the two disciplines often the boundary conditions of the system which is investigated or simulated are in the focus of the respective other discipline this implies that the two disciplines can provide each other with boundary conditions such as recharge or groundwater heads in the usgs publication surface water and groundwater one resource winter et al 1998 discuss the numerous interactions and feedback mechanisms between surface and groundwater across different spatial and temporal scales different landscapes and the hydrologic cycle in general despite this compilation of themes and problems to be treated jointly by hydrogeologists and hydrologists only marginal progress has been made in tackling these problems in a joint effort in the last two decades we wrote this paper as a joint effort between catchment hydrologists and hydrogeologists to show the large potential of collaboration that comes with more detailed information about a boundary condition from the other discipline the term boundary is used as the physical boundary of the system and boundary conditions refer to the fluxes or pressure states that are assumed to occur at the boundary of the simulated system and are used in any hydrological or hydrogeological model an example for a boundary condition in classical hydrogeological models is the recharge flux surface and lateral important boundary conditions for hydrological models are the meteorological conditions above the vegetation and the zero flux at the bottom of the system assuming negligible deep drainage this paper also aims at identifying the requirements to make such a collaboration happen complementary to barthel 2014 who puts emphasis on the differences between the two disciplines on a regional scale and discusses the possibility of using interdisciplinary strategies to work together we highlight specific fields where and conditions under which collaboration is inevitable for studying water resources at the catchment scale and we suggest when approaches from the two disciplines can be integrated in the first part of this paper section 2 we briefly describe some differences between the two disciplines including differences in education data collection and usage as well as common modelling approaches in the second part section 3 we focus on discipline specific assumptions on boundary conditions by hydrologists and hydrogeologist respectively by presenting discipline specific assumptions in different research contexts we want to show that hydrologists and hydrogeologists have to take a step toward an integrated view to benefit from each other instead of conceptualizing an important part of the hydrological cycle by a simple boundary condition in this way both disciplines together could make process on important current challenges for society 2 boundaries between hydrologists and hydrogeologists 2 1 object of interest and terminology catchment hydrologists and hydrogeologists have in common that they are interested in hydrological processes and often adopt a system perspective however the object of investigation and the perspective of the disciplines are often different accordingly also the concept and level of detail with which various parts of the water cycle are studied are different this is reflected in textbooks and terminology there is no textbook available that covers both hydrology and hydrogeology in a balanced way barthel 2014 during lectures and in textbooks some processes are only mentioned some introduced and some are explained in detail and the weight that is given to the explanation of a process originates from the classical problems of the respective discipline the boundaries of aquifers which are the focus of hydrogeologists align to varying degree with catchment boundaries in the case of alluvial aquifers systems there is usually a direct relationship between the aquifer geometry and the current catchment organization geological and hydrological processes that have led to the formation of the aquifers might still be active in such cases it is relatively easy to find common ground among hydrologists and hydrogeologists because their objects of interest are similar and aligned deeper aquifers have often formed under geological and hydrological conditions that were distinctly different from today and the pattern of groundwater flow can defy current catchment logics groundwater might flow across catchment boundaries or in opposite direction of flow paths at the surface aquifers might stretch across numerous catchments e g large aquifer systems such as guarani aquifer in south america great artesian basin in australia or milk river aquifer in north america and rivers that are at the core of a catchment can be the boundary of a groundwater flow system e g the geneovese aquifer that stretches between the arve and rhône river geneva switzerland this misalignment of catchment boundaries that are only defined by surface topography and aquifers is one of the reasons for discrepancies in the concepts and terminology among the two fields fig 2c furthermore there are tendencies to resolve processes in different parts of the hydrological cycle in more detail meaning both disciplines focus on different processes it is instructive to analyze the conceptualization and terminology of processes that transfer water between the domains of main interest of catchment hydrologists and hydrogeologists i e water leaving the surficial zone which is usually treated in greater detail in catchment hydrology to become groundwater and water leaving the subsurface to become streamflow for water leaving the surficial zone researchers from both disciplines use the term groundwater recharge but the conceptualization and considered boundary differ catchment hydrologists put a stronger emphasis on surface processes that influence streamflow while groundwater recharge to deeper zones in many hydrological models receives little attention and groundwater processes are lumped into one or a few simple reservoirs fig 1 the boundary across which recharge occurs tends to correspond to the depth at which water only percolates downward starting somewhere below the root zone and recharge rates are often quantified with soil water balance approaches in contrast hydrogeologists consider the water from any direction that enters the saturated zone with the consequence that the unsaturated zone i e depending on the thickness of this zone the top 1 100 m is often not explicitly considered groundwater recharge includes for hydrogeologists also delayed lateral inflow such as mountain block recharge ajami et al 2011 gilbert and maxwell 2017 wilson and guan 2004 which is often not considered by hydrologists but can be hydrologically relevant welch et al 2012 processes upstream of the boundary across which recharge occurs receive little attention between recharge boundaries in catchment hydrology and hydrogeology often lies the vadose zone as a no man s land that is treated in neither domain with much detail most studies focus on the upper part of the vadose zone typically close to the topsoil regarding field studies there are rather few that investigate more extensive vadose zones e g larger than 5 m between top soil and water table dahan et al 2009 rimon et al 2007 turkeltaub et al 2015 the flow dynamics and transport reactive processes in more extensive vadose zones are not well understood yet a major reason is that this zone is very difficult to instrument for water leaving the subsurface catchment hydrologist and hydrogeologists also use the same term baseflow but mean different things what matters most for catchment hydrologists is the effect on streamflow i e baseflow is the contribution from delayed sources to streamflow baseflow is characterized operationally as the slow flow component irrespectively of its origin hall 1968 in contrast for hydrogeologists baseflow corresponds to streamflow component that originates from aquifers only since a substantial proportion of the rapid flow component can originate from aquifers the quantity of water considered as baseflow can vary considerably for the two disciplines barthel 2014 2 2 data collection and usage which observations are made and how they are used differs strongly between hydrology and hydrogeology in hydrogeology the studied systems are storage dominated i e storages are large compared to fluxes there are relatively long residence times which sometimes are decoupled from seasonal variations compared to this hydrologists focus generally more on surface water and storage at or close to the surface with relatively short residence times therefore in hydrological studies it can often be assumed that it is possible to close the water balance within a year and fluxes e g annual precipitation or annual discharge are larger than the dynamic storage barthel 2014 staudinger et al 2017 it should be mentioned however that recent studies have started exploring the influence of deep groundwater storages on flow dynamics and residence times next to storage close to and at the surface e g benettin et al 2015 danesh yazdi et al 2018 while streamflow can be relatively easily and accurately measured the direct measurement of groundwater fluxes is only possible in exceptional situations e g spring discharge in hydrology the main type of observations are streamflow time series derived from stream gauges point measurements of precipitation and soil moisture but also more detailed surface mappings including remote sensing data hydrologists frequently measure also groundwater levels although the focus is rather on shallow groundwater at the hillslope groundwater heads measured in piezometers are the main type of observation in hydrogeological applications the interpretation of these observations can be challenging especially in areas with large subsurface heterogeneities in most cases it must be inferred indirectly using darcy s law whose key parameter the hydraulic conductivity can vary over orders magnitude geophysical data kirsch 2009 is used to get an idea about subsurface heterogeneities groundwater dating methods for instance from stable isotopes and noble gases can provide an indirect means to constrain groundwater flux simulations 2 3 modelling approaches the emphasis on different parts of the hydrological cycle in the two disciplines led to contrasting modelling approaches while neither discipline can ignore the continuity of the hydrological cycle often complementary parts are simulated in detail versus being treated in a lumped manner fig 1 especially earlier on when computational resources were more limited and data scarcer the spatial scale of the studies object and the temporal dynamics of considered processes influenced the model structure as well finally the objective of models play an important role i e whether the model is used in a scientific context to improve process understanding or in an operational mode for water resources management or prediction in hydrogeology flow processes were simulated already in early studies in a physically based and spatially resolved way this was aided by the simplicity of the underlying flow equation which is a simple linear equation and the often low temporal dynamics allowing for a coarse time stepping however the influx across the boundaries that drives groundwater flow systems is often represented in a simplistic and coarse way and processes are lumped together into simple boundary conditions despite many other methods to estimate recharge using tracers moeck et al 2017 isotopes or water joshi et al 2018 table fluctuation fan et al 2014 traditionally groundwater recharge is derived by some simple equation based on precipitation input without considering how detailed surface properties or vegetation influence the recharge component in the model building process of hydrogeological models surface properties like topography and vegetation as well as snow dynamics and rainfall dynamics are typically not included as a lot of effort has been devoted to the improvement of the representation of subsurface heterogeneity in many cases these complex surface properties are lumped into one boundary condition e g recharge or hydraulic head in the river or lake and rainfall dynamics the temporal resolution of hydrogeological models is often also relatively coarse for short and intense precipitation events this is not always adequate especially for models where surface runoff and infiltration processes are simulated explicitly for example a given amount of precipitation will in many cases result in more or less groundwater recharge if it distributed over a day as compared to the same amount of precipitation distributed over shorter periods where overland flow process will become more important streams are often conceptualized using fixed head boundary condition first type dirichlet or using a fixed head and a flux third type cauchy although a spatially resolved simulation of groundwater flow is in principle straightforward also in hydrogeology lumped parameter models are sometimes employed because subsurface data to parameterize and to calibrate models are rather scarce such lumped parameter models in hydrogeology are generally based on analytical solutions for highly simplified aquifer geometries and are most commonly used for the interpretation of environmental tracer data here the choice of the model is often justified based on the aquifer type e g an exponential model represents the travel time distribution in an unconfined aquifer exponent depends on recharge rate versus aquifer thickness a piston model corresponds to a confined aquifer etc complex fully distributed catchment models such as the she model simulate groundwater flow in a detailed way however simpler bucket type hydrological runoff models conceptualize groundwater flow by using linear reservoirs in different arrangements despite such simplistic approaches for the subsurface processes streamflow dynamics can often be simulated acceptably well a crucial issue in hydrological catchment modelling is the appropriate representation of the functioning of the soil storage as a control of the distinction between water becoming groundwater recharge and eventually streamflow interflow that is reaching the stream and the evaporative fluxes given the lumped nature of many hydrological models it is hardly possible to include detailed information on subsurface geology the hydrological model building process does often not include geological information on the catchments boundaries sivakumar et al 2015 frisbee et al 2011 found a scaling mismatch between hydrological catchment boundaries and larger scale aquifer flow systems which are not represented by the gauging station käser and hunkeler 2016 while hydrologists are fully aware that subsurface geological structures might influence the real catchment boundaries they usually ignore this possibility or are constrained by the limited representation of geological settings in their models thus often only surface topography is used to obtain catchment boundaries the main variable s and the associated calibration parameters lead to different calibration strategies for hydrogeological models versus hydrological models hydrologists typically calibrate their models based on simulations of streamflow data at the catchment outlet this ignores that also calibration as well as validation with baseflow e g hailegeorgis and alfredsen 2015 or water solutes as well as many other variables might be possible this is partly owing to the challenge that most times the use of additional variables used for testing implies the need for additional model parameters seibert et al 2019 the main variables in hydrogeological modelling include typically hydraulic heads at various locations and sometimes groundwater fluxes and streamflow however most models are calibrated using hydraulic heads only simmons et al 2012 if the purpose of the model is to predict heads this type of observation data can be sufficient however large uncertainties are expected for the simulated fluxes resulting from a model that was only calibrated using hydraulic heads regardless of the type of model there is the risk that a model provides good fits in terms of process variable it was calibrated to e g streamflow in hydrology but does so with a poor representation of internal processes kirchner 2006 klemeš 1986 3 overcoming boundaries between catchment hydrologists and hydrogeologists the separate development of the two disciplines the different modelling approaches and the different types of field data limit a holistic understanding of the hydrological cycle and water resources in general a classic example is the interactions between surface water and groundwater where many authors have pointed out that only a joint consideration of surface water and groundwater will allow advancing our understanding of fluvial systems alley et al 2002 fleckenstein et al 2010 sophocleous 2002 winter et al 1998 groundwater surface water interactions are especially important during low flows however on a conceptual basis recent advances in modelling approaches from both the hydrological and hydrogeological community have taken the initiative to overcome the previous limitations numerical models based on the original blueprint for a physically based model freeze and harlan 1969 e g mikeshe hydrogeosphere or parflow clm are conceptually capable of jointly simulating surface and subsurface processes and thus could constitute a useful tool for a more integrative and holistic consideration of surface water groundwater interactions fig 1 such models can conceptually integrate the observations and expert knowledge from both hydrologists and hydrogeologists in fact there are many other examples where a closer collaboration between hydrologists and hydrogeologists and the application of such integrative models is required to go beyond the marginal advances of recent years barthel 2014 barthel and banzhaf 2016 for some classical problems the fastest most pragmatic modelling approach is to conceptualize either the surface or the subsurface as a simple boundary condition however for all situations where feedback mechanisms between the two domains surface and subsurface exist the implementation of a simple boundary condition can cause problems a collaboration between the disciplines can then help avoid these problems below we provide a brief and not comprehensive overview of situations where neither the subsurface nor the surface should be simplified too much and the integration of data covering both surface and subsurface is highly recommended 3 1 fluxes between surface waterbodies and groundwater surface water groundwater interactions involve both surface water flow processes as well as groundwater flow processes this has been recognized and widely discussed in the current literature e g boano et al 2014 partington et al 2017 winter et al 1998 interactions between surface flow and subsurface flow occur at a wide range of different temporal and spatial scales and affect ecological woessner 2017 and sedimentological processes partington et al 2017 temperature water quality as well as the exchange fluxes these processes largely occur in the hyporheic zone modelling approaches of the hyporheic zone require the consideration of flow processes in the river as well as flow processes in the streambed these processes themselves are governed by larger scale boundary conditions in the aquifer and the stream and lead to complex feedback mechanisms between the surface and the subsurface trauth et al 2014 streambeds constitute an interface between surface water and groundwater erosion and sedimentary processes in the streambed are continuously shaping the streambed topography as well as the streambed sedimentary composition boano et al 2014 velocities of surface water flow are crucial for erosion and deposition processes more recently the importance of upwelling groundwater and hyporheic exchange fluxes on the deposition and erosion processes has been observed in both field and laboratory settings partington et al 2017 the hydraulic properties of the streambed as well as its topography control the exchange fluxes between surface water and groundwater recent studies e g gianni et al 2016 have shown that the hydraulic conductivity of the streambed can change by several orders of magnitude after flood events therefore undermining the commonly made modelling assumption in both the hydrological and hydrogeological modelling community of constant hydraulic properties of the streambed this leads to a bias in predictions of groundwater surface water exchange fluxes for essentially all the processes mentioned above it is important to consider the feedback mechanisms between the surface and the subsurface the conceptualization of one compartment through a simple boundary condition prevents a coupled and thus holistic understanding of these processes 3 2 soil hydrology and runoff generation processes the interface between soil and bedrock or soil and unconsolidated material like moraines is an important boundary between hydrology and hydrogeology for soil hydrology the soil vegetation atmosphere boundary is the key location for partitioning precipitation into runoff evapotranspiration and recharge since soil and vegetation properties are highly heterogeneous in space this boundary strongly determines how much water leaves the soil and hence how much water enters the groundwater from above fig 2 a during more intense or longer rainfall events or during snowmelt conditions the infiltrating water is not only increasing the soil moisture storage but runoff generation can trigger overland flow and subsurface stormflow or interflow resulting in lateral redistribution of water and solutes on the surface and within the soil bachmair and weiler 2011 weiler et al 2005 in particular subsurface stormflow is a key element for soil development within a hillslope for slope stability processes due to high pore water pressure at the soil bedrock interface and for delivering substantial runoff amounts via subsurface flow to the streamflow bachmair and weiler 2011 for rainfall events these processes and flow pathways are highly dynamic and the water commonly follows shallow lateral flow pathways within the upper meter s of the soil where the event water may also mobilize old water which then is frequently seen in the streamflow response bachmair and weiler 2014 the slower but more continuous snowmelt events can trigger subsurface runoff even in hillslopes without a distinct soil bedrock boundary but also in slopes with continuously decreasing hydraulic conductivity resulting in subsurface stormflow and in percolation excess subsurface flow smith et al 2014 runoff generation processes typically happen at a time scale of minutes and hours and surface and subsurface runoff is a loss term for groundwater recharge as well as for soil water storage in the areas of runoff production the lateral redistribution of water can however also produce more infiltration percolation and recharge in areas where water from upslope enters the soil and increases both soil moisture storage and recharge this effect can be quite extreme in urban areas especially with low impact storm water management structures in a case study in freiburg germany groundwater recharge was simulated in such an urban area and resulted in recharge of over 38 000 mm in two 500 m long swales steinbrich et al 2018 leistert et al 2018 also in natural catchments where subsurface or surface runoff are important runoff generation mechanisms recharge can increase by several factors to even orders of magnitude when laterally redistributed water enters permeable areas in hollows sinks dolines or the interface between hillslope and flat valley bottoms fig 2a despite the temporal scale of runoff processes most groundwater recharge models run on daily or longer time scales hence infiltration and percolation excess are rarely simulated since daily average rainfall intensities of sub daily rainfall events are too small to generate overland or sub surface flow in addition recharge models are typically one dimensional models that do not allow for lateral redistribution of water which results in significant over or underestimation of recharge in both time and space instead most groundwater recharge models use correction terms armbruster 2002 armbruster and leibundgut 2001 to account for the loss of recharge by surface and subsurface flow information on runoff generation processes from hydrologists could help increase the realism of spatial and temporal recharge patterns in hydrogeological models this effect may also be very relevant under climate change as runoff generation processes are highly non linear or even threshold like processes meerveld and weiler 2008 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 for instance if recharge is generated mainly during snowmelt conditions under current climate conditions a shift to more mid winter snowmelt events or to rainfall events could dramatically change the runoff generation resulting in disproportionally more or less recharge 3 3 water quality aspects water quality is another important field where collaboration between hydrologists and hydrogeologists is indispensable and should be intensified numerous catchments scale water quality studies have been published wellen et al 2015 although many studies use the broad term water quality in their title most of them deal with diffuse contaminant sources mostly from agriculture which will also be the focus of this discussion the objective of water quality models is to predict solute concentration trends at a given location in the stream and sometimes in groundwater for robust predictions such models need to take the temporal and spatial pattern of the solute input into account e g schuetz et al 2016 transport dynamics along multiple pathways cause a time lag between input and output there are sorption and reactive processes along these pathways and mixing of waters of different origin and with different chemistries in the stream among these models we focus here on the most commonly used ones as identified in wellen et al 2015 namely swat inca agnps annagnps hspf and hbv with the term hydrogeological model we refer to the classical groundwater models such as feflow or modflow with related transport codes these two model types differ in their spatial resolution with hydrological models usually discretizing catchments into sub catchments while hydrogeological models describe flow and transport in a spatially distributed manner hydrological models generally emphasize the effect of surface features e g topography soil properties on the partitioning of water among slow and rapid flow paths and on the solute fate biogeochemical processes that govern the solute input from the soil zone fig 2b are explicitly simulated in contrast in hydrogeological models only the fraction of water that infiltrates is considered further while excess water is not considered in the model solute input from soils is usually not simulated but specified as a boundary condition approaches of varying complexities are used from tabulated solute loads as a function of land use irrespectively of site specific conditions to the simulation of the solute input dynamics with a separate model for transport through the shallow and deep subsurface the situation is reversed hydrological models strongly simplify subsurface processes by representing aquifers as single reservoirs while for hydrogeological models water moving along rapid flow paths is not considered in some hydrological model water reaching a deep groundwater reservoir is no longer considered for streamflow a simplified representation of groundwater can be adequate whereas for water quality a more detailed representation of flow pathways and transit times becomes necessary some of the hydrological models e g inca represent the delay between solute input and its appearance in the stream by defining a fixed time constant for the groundwater reservoir however solute breakthrough in streams or wells is usually governed by a broad transit time distribution due to variations in flow path lengths and velocities among them fig 2b furthermore solute breakthrough patterns also depend on where solutes enter the subsurface relative to the receptor which is disregarded in the case of single groundwater reservoirs in hydrogeological models subsurface flow paths are resolved spatially hence reproducing both the effect of spatial variations of solute sources and differences in solute flow paths due to their higher data requirement and calculation times they are usually only implemented for subsections of catchments often focusing on productive aquifers used for water supply furthermore especially in the context of applied modelling for water resources management also in hydrogeology simplified lumped approaches are used that resemble those in hydrology often solute transport is approximated with a transfer function approach whereby the transit time distribution is characterized by a simple lumped parameter analytical model such an approach can reproduce water quality trends in groundwater with sufficient precision especially if constrained with environmental tracer methods refined versions have also been proposed that take the spatial variability of solute input into account many models include separate soil and groundwater zones but usually simplistic formulations are used to describe how the two domains are connected often the output of the soil zone directly enters groundwater however a large mass of solutes is often stored in the vadose zone in case of nitrogen sometimes referred to as the nitrate time bomb in some hydrological models e g swat the vadose zone reservoir is coarsely represented by a fixed time delay between water leaving the soil and entering the aquifer common hydrogeological models can simulate flow and transport under variably saturated conditions and thus vadose zone processes can be included in a physically based way however as the governing equation for flow is strongly nonlinear and vadose zone processes are more dynamic than processes in groundwater calculation times strongly increase making it challenging to couple vadose zone and groundwater processes for large catchments barthel 2006 solute breakthrough in a stream or well is often strongly influenced by sorption and reactive processes fig 2b hydrological models tend to assume that solutes remain stable once they have reached the groundwater box e g inca or given that only discrete reservoirs are considered a spatially homogenous reaction rate is specified e g swat however reactive processes often vary spatially with hot spots of enhanced reactivity for example reactivity often shows a depth dependence due to more strongly reducing conditions at depth or enhanced reactivity occurs in riparian zones modifying the groundwater composition shortly before it exfiltrates the effects of such zones crucially depend on how much flow occurs through such zones i e the turnover is transport controlled and thus an explicit simulation of subsurface flow paths is required finally another difference among hydrological and hydrogeological models are the receptors that are considered while hydrological models provide groundwater concentrations they cannot directly be associated with concentrations measured at a specific location such as a pumping well in reverse classical hydrogeological models can provide solute fluxes to streams which act as boundary conditions but cannot predict stream water concentrations in summary hydrologist and hydrogeologists simplify the complex problem of water quality modelling in different and complementary ways building on concepts and tools that have evolved within their respective discipline this also leads to inconsistency in terminology interestingly in the hydrological literature models like swat or inca are often judged as process orientated bouraoui and grizzetti 2014 although these models represent groundwater in a very simplistic way how a water quality problem is simplified should be driven by the nature of the problem e g the type of solute considered and not by traditions within a discipline for example for strongly sorbing contaminants it can be sufficient to grossly simplify subsurface processes as transport mainly occurs along surficial flow paths while for well soluble compounds such as nitrate long term concentrations trends will not be captured if deeper groundwater reservoirs are ignored or merely act as a sink or for a problem where a biogeochemical time lag dominates over the hydrological time lag it is particularly important to explicitly simulate biogeochemical processes in some cases researchers already leverage on the complementary of the approaches by using one type of model to simulate one part of the system for instance soil and specifying the model output as boundary conditions for the second however there is much scope for collaboration towards a joint framework on how to best conceptualize and model solutes with different properties at the catchment scale the effect of the different flow pathways and transit times relates mainly to water quality aspects from the hydrological quantitative perspective the focus is often on faster flow pathways while deeper and longer flow pathways are ignored the hydrogeological perspective has the opposite bias short surface flow pathways might be ignored although they can be highly important for streamflow water quality one way to overcome the difference here could be to include tritium based transit times stewart and morgenstern 2016 that could bridge the perspectives of hydrologists and hydrogeologists i e hydrological models could be structured with the help of tritium and stable isotopes derived transit times 3 4 low flow periods special situations in which groundwater surface water interaction gains importance are low flow periods smakhtin 2001 that occur after prolonged dry weather or when water is stored in the snowpack during low flow only contributions from delayed sources sustain streamflow hall 1968 one of the major delayed contributions to streamflow is groundwater discharge from aquifers which are often assumed to dominate catchment storage even though there are other delayed sources such as snow or glacier melt when these delayed sources contribute to the stream low flow variability is driven by climate variability and geological catchment properties which shape storage functioning in catchments van lanen et al 2013 schneider 1957 stoelzle et al 2014 catchment storage properties staudinger et al 2017 at the surface snow vegetation soils have an effect on recharge to aquifers and storage properties in the subsurface have an effect on discharge from aquifers and hence ultimately on the streamflow during low flow periods garner et al 2015 kirchner 2009 lauber et al 2014 this is why catchment storage properties are important when studying low flows there are many hydrogeological studies that focus on the low flows of springs for instance large karst springs e g fiorillo 2009 kovács et al 2005 but few studies explicitly relate the dynamics of aquifers to streamflow under low flow conditions at the catchment scale e g käser and hunkeler 2016 while there are many hydrological studies that focus on low streamflow the attribution of the governing mechanisms climate variability and geological catchment properties is still not fully understood to better understand these mechanisms we must think about our simplified boundary conditions that separate hydrology from hydrogeology again catchment hydrologists analyze low flows often from a water balance perspective e g garner et al 2015 i e streamflow during low flow periods in the absence of precipitation is seen as a function of catchment storage kirchner 2009 low flows are quantifiable the water stored in the catchment is not groundwater contribution and its characterization are based on two assumptions 1 streamflow integrates all water releasing processes in the catchment e g snowmelt increases the flux evapotranspiration decreases the flux and more importantly 2 streamflow represents the depletion of catchment storage during prolonged dry weather under these assumptions streamflow is a function of storage and metrics like streamflow recession coefficients or baseflow indices can be used to characterize or even to estimate catchment storage from streamflow variability in hydrological practice the groundwater contribution to streamflow is often estimated with recession analysis methods which recently have been improved roques et al 2017 stewart 2015 stoelzle et al 2013 thomas et al 2015 nevertheless recession segments are only representations of a part of the storage depletion process and often superimposed by streamflow contributions of other delayed sources next to groundwater such as snowmelt in alpine catchments it would be beneficial for instance for low flow regionalization to distinguish between groundwater storage estimate and other delayed sources it is still an open question on which geological information that should be based on but such a storage characterization is crucial for more comprehensive low flow studies and regionalization approaches bloomfield et al 2015 stoelzle et al 2015 in traditional hydrogeology aquifer characterization often prioritizes high permeability zones suitable for groundwater extraction which often have a limited spatial extent relative to the size of catchments for low flow bedrock aquifers can become more important as they can release water over an extended period but much less is known about their characteristics development of new geophysical methods to gain better information on the geometry and properties of these bedrock aquifers might help receive important information for storage characterization since storage is important to understand low flow variability satellite based approaches to estimate terrestrial water storage on large spatial scales e g grace have been recently linked to periods with less water availability houborg et al 2012 small scale gravimeters can help estimate total storage in catchments creutzfeldt et al 2012 2014 hasan et al 2008 however a reliable estimation of catchment storage for mesoscale catchments remains challenging creutzfeldt et al 2014 van loon et al 2017 especially in mountainous regions due to the uncertainty of remote sensing data and a lack of groundwater level information in those regions cosmic ray soil moisture devices e g heidbüchel et al 2016 can continuously measure soil water storage over larger areas and depths which is a promising approach for an improved understanding of catchment storage and to identify the relative importance of soil water storage different types of catchment storages e g dynamic total immobile storage have been discussed in the hydrological community staudinger et al 2017 highlighting that different methods assess different types of storage there are two reasons for additional data in the context of low flow that could lead to more integrated approaches first data is needed to better understand how much water leaves catchments during low flow periods by including subsurface outflow this can be achieved by paired groundwater surface water gauging stations many gauging stations do not measure all water flowing out of the catchment but there is often a substantial flow below the gauge this subsurface outflow might contribute a significant part of the total outflow from the basin particularly during low flow periods käser and hunkeler 2016 showed that groundwater discharge below the gauging station can be substantial and is not negligible second additional data is needed to better understand and estimate groundwater storage and release and its effect during low flow in different aquifer units within a catchment which is more challenging for low flow dynamics water storage in the bedrock can play a critical role but often in these formations there are no observation wells a starting point to better understand the groundwater storage changes is thus to gain more data for bedrock aquifers the issue of missing data is also present at the surface missing measurements and measurement quality of streamflow data are an issue in low flow studies when streamflow measurements are often not precise enough during periods of zero flow there can be still groundwater flow out of the catchment below the streamflow gauging station indicating a lost connection between surface water and groundwater käser and hunkeler 2016 and a fully depleted dynamic catchment storage i e the storage that controls streamflow staudinger et al 2017 as further downstream by passed groundwater can be discharged to the river again hydrological models should consider subsurface flow as a part of total streamflow this becomes especially important during prolonged low flow periods when modelling these low flow periods it is hence important to include subsurface flow as part of total streamflow if subsurface flow is not considered in the water balance calculation simulated evapotranspiration might be erroneously increased to compensate this although a model that is calibrated with parameters that overestimate evapotranspiration may provide good results in term of performance criteria i e differences between simulated and observed streamflow internal model variables might be wrong and may induce biases in low flow processes which should be avoided when the model purpose are predictions hydrological models that use a bucket type representation of the dynamic storage have to be applied carefully for low flow simulations and can benefit from hydrogeological information payn et al 2012 found that topographic controls decreased with progressing streamflow recession while the influence of multiple aspects of the subsurface structure of the catchment increased with longer recessions staudinger et al 2011 found poor low flow performances of bucket type models related to the model structures representing the subsurface these findings suggest that in hydrological models a bucket type representation of the dynamic storage might be only adequate as long as a uniquely defined streamflow aquifer system controls regional low flows hence we have to analyze when and where the assumption of a uniquely defined streamflow aquifer system holds and find better ways to represent aquifer depletion e g le moine et al 2007 as well surface water groundwater exchange fig 2c in bucket type hydrological models staudinger et al in preparation stoelzle et al 2015 suggest that relatively simple changes of groundwater storages boxes in hydrological models can improve baseflow simulation for different geological settings this indicates that information on hydrogeology can directly improve low flow modelling in hydrology many hydrogeological models are calibrated with heads only but are used to predict e g fluxes or residence times it is challenging to calibrate a hydrogeological model based on heads only as follows directly from darcy s law the same head configuration can result in many different fluxes depending on the hydraulic conductivity thus it is important to constrain a model with some measured fluxes particularly under low flow conditions when most water in the river should originate from groundwater incorporating stream flow provides such an opportunity to consider fluxes in hydrogeological modelling as is possible in coupled furman 2008 or integrated models barthel and banzhaf 2016 4 concluding remarks this paper was written jointly by catchment hydrologists and hydrogeologists to discuss the large potential of collaboration for utilizing more detailed information about a boundary condition from the respectively other discipline we discussed general differences between the two disciplines hydrogeology and hydrology how these disciplines evolved separately and which consequences this implies for study foci data collection modelling approaches and education one important issue is that the two disciplines despite all differences often use a similar terminology however sometimes terms have different meanings and we must be careful when communicating and working together to avoid serious misunderstandings we further discussed the respective boundary conditions i e assumptions at the boundaries of the investigated system when we apply hydrological and hydrogeological models such as recharge rate hydrogeology or zero flux at the bottom of the system hydrology we described situations where the work of hydrologists and hydrogeologists should be brought together and where groundwater surface water interactions urge for a more integrated and joint approach often in these situations the boundary conditions that each discipline defines can be refined with information from the other discipline that studies these boundary conditions as being the focus of their investigations fig 2 the discussion included direct groundwater surface water interactions soil hydrology runoff generation water quality aspects and low flow periods within these issues we highlighted especially boundary conditions where closer collaboration between catchment hydrologists and hydrogeologists would be most useful often such collaborations would be relatively straight forward and require an increased awareness rather than fancy methods for instance simply accounting for ungauged subsurface flow out of a catchment can greatly increase the reliability of predictions as the water balance becomes more realistic and model calibration does not artificially increase evaporation to compensate for the subsurface outflow we hope that this

feedback mechanisms of surface water and groundwater traditionally however focus models and scales of the studies differ in this commentary situations are illustrated where boundary conditions that each discipline assumes preserves and actively uses can and have to be overcome these situations occur when the domain of one discipline cannot be separated from the other one because of existing interaction and feedback mechanisms at the boundaries highlighted are especially these boundary conditions where closer collaboration between catchment hydrologists and hydrogeologists would be most useful often such collaborations would be relatively straight forward and rather requiring an increased awareness than novel methods 1 introduction while hydrologists and hydrogeologists both study the flux and storage of water including the numerous interactions and feedback mechanisms between surface water and groundwater they do this traditionally with a different focus and different models and often at different scales hydrology was originally more an engineering discipline and its initial focus was to estimate design values for floods or droughts or to assess water balances for catchments later hydrology developed also into a scientific discipline with strong links to geoscience ecology and environmental science hydrogeology was developed as a sub discipline of geology and many hydrogeologists have a background in geology rather than engineering traditionally hydrogeology focuses on questions related to the quantities of water stored in the subsurface and the abstraction of groundwater for water supply as well as groundwater flow more recently the fate of contaminants and strategies for groundwater remediation have become an important topic in hydrogeology miller and gray 2008 stephens 2008 the separate development of the two disciplines comes along with confusion and misunderstandings regarding the terminology with different emphasis in field campaigns different educational approaches and different conceptual models several of these aspects have been recently discussed by barthel 2014 simplified assumptions about surface and subsurface fluxes at the boundary of the modelled domain so called boundary conditions are an important part of the different model concepts in the two disciplines often the boundary conditions of the system which is investigated or simulated are in the focus of the respective other discipline this implies that the two disciplines can provide each other with boundary conditions such as recharge or groundwater heads in the usgs publication surface water and groundwater one resource winter et al 1998 discuss the numerous interactions and feedback mechanisms between surface and groundwater across different spatial and temporal scales different landscapes and the hydrologic cycle in general despite this compilation of themes and problems to be treated jointly by hydrogeologists and hydrologists only marginal progress has been made in tackling these problems in a joint effort in the last two decades we wrote this paper as a joint effort between catchment hydrologists and hydrogeologists to show the large potential of collaboration that comes with more detailed information about a boundary condition from the other discipline the term boundary is used as the physical boundary of the system and boundary conditions refer to the fluxes or pressure states that are assumed to occur at the boundary of the simulated system and are used in any hydrological or hydrogeological model an example for a boundary condition in classical hydrogeological models is the recharge flux surface and lateral important boundary conditions for hydrological models are the meteorological conditions above the vegetation and the zero flux at the bottom of the system assuming negligible deep drainage this paper also aims at identifying the requirements to make such a collaboration happen complementary to barthel 2014 who puts emphasis on the differences between the two disciplines on a regional scale and discusses the possibility of using interdisciplinary strategies to work together we highlight specific fields where and conditions under which collaboration is inevitable for studying water resources at the catchment scale and we suggest when approaches from the two disciplines can be integrated in the first part of this paper section 2 we briefly describe some differences between the two disciplines including differences in education data collection and usage as well as common modelling approaches in the second part section 3 we focus on discipline specific assumptions on boundary conditions by hydrologists and hydrogeologist respectively by presenting discipline specific assumptions in different research contexts we want to show that hydrologists and hydrogeologists have to take a step toward an integrated view to benefit from each other instead of conceptualizing an important part of the hydrological cycle by a simple boundary condition in this way both disciplines together could make process on important current challenges for society 2 boundaries between hydrologists and hydrogeologists 2 1 object of interest and terminology catchment hydrologists and hydrogeologists have in common that they are interested in hydrological processes and often adopt a system perspective however the object of investigation and the perspective of the disciplines are often different accordingly also the concept and level of detail with which various parts of the water cycle are studied are different this is reflected in textbooks and terminology there is no textbook available that covers both hydrology and hydrogeology in a balanced way barthel 2014 during lectures and in textbooks some processes are only mentioned some introduced and some are explained in detail and the weight that is given to the explanation of a process originates from the classical problems of the respective discipline the boundaries of aquifers which are the focus of hydrogeologists align to varying degree with catchment boundaries in the case of alluvial aquifers systems there is usually a direct relationship between the aquifer geometry and the current catchment organization geological and hydrological processes that have led to the formation of the aquifers might still be active in such cases it is relatively easy to find common ground among hydrologists and hydrogeologists because their objects of interest are similar and aligned deeper aquifers have often formed under geological and hydrological conditions that were distinctly different from today and the pattern of groundwater flow can defy current catchment logics groundwater might flow across catchment boundaries or in opposite direction of flow paths at the surface aquifers might stretch across numerous catchments e g large aquifer systems such as guarani aquifer in south america great artesian basin in australia or milk river aquifer in north america and rivers that are at the core of a catchment can be the boundary of a groundwater flow system e g the geneovese aquifer that stretches between the arve and rhône river geneva switzerland this misalignment of catchment boundaries that are only defined by surface topography and aquifers is one of the reasons for discrepancies in the concepts and terminology among the two fields fig 2c furthermore there are tendencies to resolve processes in different parts of the hydrological cycle in more detail meaning both disciplines focus on different processes it is instructive to analyze the conceptualization and terminology of processes that transfer water between the domains of main interest of catchment hydrologists and hydrogeologists i e water leaving the surficial zone which is usually treated in greater detail in catchment hydrology to become groundwater and water leaving the subsurface to become streamflow for water leaving the surficial zone researchers from both disciplines use the term groundwater recharge but the conceptualization and considered boundary differ catchment hydrologists put a stronger emphasis on surface processes that influence streamflow while groundwater recharge to deeper zones in many hydrological models receives little attention and groundwater processes are lumped into one or a few simple reservoirs fig 1 the boundary across which recharge occurs tends to correspond to the depth at which water only percolates downward starting somewhere below the root zone and recharge rates are often quantified with soil water balance approaches in contrast hydrogeologists consider the water from any direction that enters the saturated zone with the consequence that the unsaturated zone i e depending on the thickness of this zone the top 1 100 m is often not explicitly considered groundwater recharge includes for hydrogeologists also delayed lateral inflow such as mountain block recharge ajami et al 2011 gilbert and maxwell 2017 wilson and guan 2004 which is often not considered by hydrologists but can be hydrologically relevant welch et al 2012 processes upstream of the boundary across which recharge occurs receive little attention between recharge boundaries in catchment hydrology and hydrogeology often lies the vadose zone as a no man s land that is treated in neither domain with much detail most studies focus on the upper part of the vadose zone typically close to the topsoil regarding field studies there are rather few that investigate more extensive vadose zones e g larger than 5 m between top soil and water table dahan et al 2009 rimon et al 2007 turkeltaub et al 2015 the flow dynamics and transport reactive processes in more extensive vadose zones are not well understood yet a major reason is that this zone is very difficult to instrument for water leaving the subsurface catchment hydrologist and hydrogeologists also use the same term baseflow but mean different things what matters most for catchment hydrologists is the effect on streamflow i e baseflow is the contribution from delayed sources to streamflow baseflow is characterized operationally as the slow flow component irrespectively of its origin hall 1968 in contrast for hydrogeologists baseflow corresponds to streamflow component that originates from aquifers only since a substantial proportion of the rapid flow component can originate from aquifers the quantity of water considered as baseflow can vary considerably for the two disciplines barthel 2014 2 2 data collection and usage which observations are made and how they are used differs strongly between hydrology and hydrogeology in hydrogeology the studied systems are storage dominated i e storages are large compared to fluxes there are relatively long residence times which sometimes are decoupled from seasonal variations compared to this hydrologists focus generally more on surface water and storage at or close to the surface with relatively short residence times therefore in hydrological studies it can often be assumed that it is possible to close the water balance within a year and fluxes e g annual precipitation or annual discharge are larger than the dynamic storage barthel 2014 staudinger et al 2017 it should be mentioned however that recent studies have started exploring the influence of deep groundwater storages on flow dynamics and residence times next to storage close to and at the surface e g benettin et al 2015 danesh yazdi et al 2018 while streamflow can be relatively easily and accurately measured the direct measurement of groundwater fluxes is only possible in exceptional situations e g spring discharge in hydrology the main type of observations are streamflow time series derived from stream gauges point measurements of precipitation and soil moisture but also more detailed surface mappings including remote sensing data hydrologists frequently measure also groundwater levels although the focus is rather on shallow groundwater at the hillslope groundwater heads measured in piezometers are the main type of observation in hydrogeological applications the interpretation of these observations can be challenging especially in areas with large subsurface heterogeneities in most cases it must be inferred indirectly using darcy s law whose key parameter the hydraulic conductivity can vary over orders magnitude geophysical data kirsch 2009 is used to get an idea about subsurface heterogeneities groundwater dating methods for instance from stable isotopes and noble gases can provide an indirect means to constrain groundwater flux simulations 2 3 modelling approaches the emphasis on different parts of the hydrological cycle in the two disciplines led to contrasting modelling approaches while neither discipline can ignore the continuity of the hydrological cycle often complementary parts are simulated in detail versus being treated in a lumped manner fig 1 especially earlier on when computational resources were more limited and data scarcer the spatial scale of the studies object and the temporal dynamics of considered processes influenced the model structure as well finally the objective of models play an important role i e whether the model is used in a scientific context to improve process understanding or in an operational mode for water resources management or prediction in hydrogeology flow processes were simulated already in early studies in a physically based and spatially resolved way this was aided by the simplicity of the underlying flow equation which is a simple linear equation and the often low temporal dynamics allowing for a coarse time stepping however the influx across the boundaries that drives groundwater flow systems is often represented in a simplistic and coarse way and processes are lumped together into simple boundary conditions despite many other methods to estimate recharge using tracers moeck et al 2017 isotopes or water joshi et al 2018 table fluctuation fan et al 2014 traditionally groundwater recharge is derived by some simple equation based on precipitation input without considering how detailed surface properties or vegetation influence the recharge component in the model building process of hydrogeological models surface properties like topography and vegetation as well as snow dynamics and rainfall dynamics are typically not included as a lot of effort has been devoted to the improvement of the representation of subsurface heterogeneity in many cases these complex surface properties are lumped into one boundary condition e g recharge or hydraulic head in the river or lake and rainfall dynamics the temporal resolution of hydrogeological models is often also relatively coarse for short and intense precipitation events this is not always adequate especially for models where surface runoff and infiltration processes are simulated explicitly for example a given amount of precipitation will in many cases result in more or less groundwater recharge if it distributed over a day as compared to the same amount of precipitation distributed over shorter periods where overland flow process will become more important streams are often conceptualized using fixed head boundary condition first type dirichlet or using a fixed head and a flux third type cauchy although a spatially resolved simulation of groundwater flow is in principle straightforward also in hydrogeology lumped parameter models are sometimes employed because subsurface data to parameterize and to calibrate models are rather scarce such lumped parameter models in hydrogeology are generally based on analytical solutions for highly simplified aquifer geometries and are most commonly used for the interpretation of environmental tracer data here the choice of the model is often justified based on the aquifer type e g an exponential model represents the travel time distribution in an unconfined aquifer exponent depends on recharge rate versus aquifer thickness a piston model corresponds to a confined aquifer etc complex fully distributed catchment models such as the she model simulate groundwater flow in a detailed way however simpler bucket type hydrological runoff models conceptualize groundwater flow by using linear reservoirs in different arrangements despite such simplistic approaches for the subsurface processes streamflow dynamics can often be simulated acceptably well a crucial issue in hydrological catchment modelling is the appropriate representation of the functioning of the soil storage as a control of the distinction between water becoming groundwater recharge and eventually streamflow interflow that is reaching the stream and the evaporative fluxes given the lumped nature of many hydrological models it is hardly possible to include detailed information on subsurface geology the hydrological model building process does often not include geological information on the catchments boundaries sivakumar et al 2015 frisbee et al 2011 found a scaling mismatch between hydrological catchment boundaries and larger scale aquifer flow systems which are not represented by the gauging station käser and hunkeler 2016 while hydrologists are fully aware that subsurface geological structures might influence the real catchment boundaries they usually ignore this possibility or are constrained by the limited representation of geological settings in their models thus often only surface topography is used to obtain catchment boundaries the main variable s and the associated calibration parameters lead to different calibration strategies for hydrogeological models versus hydrological models hydrologists typically calibrate their models based on simulations of streamflow data at the catchment outlet this ignores that also calibration as well as validation with baseflow e g hailegeorgis and alfredsen 2015 or water solutes as well as many other variables might be possible this is partly owing to the challenge that most times the use of additional variables used for testing implies the need for additional model parameters seibert et al 2019 the main variables in hydrogeological modelling include typically hydraulic heads at various locations and sometimes groundwater fluxes and streamflow however most models are calibrated using hydraulic heads only simmons et al 2012 if the purpose of the model is to predict heads this type of observation data can be sufficient however large uncertainties are expected for the simulated fluxes resulting from a model that was only calibrated using hydraulic heads regardless of the type of model there is the risk that a model provides good fits in terms of process variable it was calibrated to e g streamflow in hydrology but does so with a poor representation of internal processes kirchner 2006 klemeš 1986 3 overcoming boundaries between catchment hydrologists and hydrogeologists the separate development of the two disciplines the different modelling approaches and the different types of field data limit a holistic understanding of the hydrological cycle and water resources in general a classic example is the interactions between surface water and groundwater where many authors have pointed out that only a joint consideration of surface water and groundwater will allow advancing our understanding of fluvial systems alley et al 2002 fleckenstein et al 2010 sophocleous 2002 winter et al 1998 groundwater surface water interactions are especially important during low flows however on a conceptual basis recent advances in modelling approaches from both the hydrological and hydrogeological community have taken the initiative to overcome the previous limitations numerical models based on the original blueprint for a physically based model freeze and harlan 1969 e g mikeshe hydrogeosphere or parflow clm are conceptually capable of jointly simulating surface and subsurface processes and thus could constitute a useful tool for a more integrative and holistic consideration of surface water groundwater interactions fig 1 such models can conceptually integrate the observations and expert knowledge from both hydrologists and hydrogeologists in fact there are many other examples where a closer collaboration between hydrologists and hydrogeologists and the application of such integrative models is required to go beyond the marginal advances of recent years barthel 2014 barthel and banzhaf 2016 for some classical problems the fastest most pragmatic modelling approach is to conceptualize either the surface or the subsurface as a simple boundary condition however for all situations where feedback mechanisms between the two domains surface and subsurface exist the implementation of a simple boundary condition can cause problems a collaboration between the disciplines can then help avoid these problems below we provide a brief and not comprehensive overview of situations where neither the subsurface nor the surface should be simplified too much and the integration of data covering both surface and subsurface is highly recommended 3 1 fluxes between surface waterbodies and groundwater surface water groundwater interactions involve both surface water flow processes as well as groundwater flow processes this has been recognized and widely discussed in the current literature e g boano et al 2014 partington et al 2017 winter et al 1998 interactions between surface flow and subsurface flow occur at a wide range of different temporal and spatial scales and affect ecological woessner 2017 and sedimentological processes partington et al 2017 temperature water quality as well as the exchange fluxes these processes largely occur in the hyporheic zone modelling approaches of the hyporheic zone require the consideration of flow processes in the river as well as flow processes in the streambed these processes themselves are governed by larger scale boundary conditions in the aquifer and the stream and lead to complex feedback mechanisms between the surface and the subsurface trauth et al 2014 streambeds constitute an interface between surface water and groundwater erosion and sedimentary processes in the streambed are continuously shaping the streambed topography as well as the streambed sedimentary composition boano et al 2014 velocities of surface water flow are crucial for erosion and deposition processes more recently the importance of upwelling groundwater and hyporheic exchange fluxes on the deposition and erosion processes has been observed in both field and laboratory settings partington et al 2017 the hydraulic properties of the streambed as well as its topography control the exchange fluxes between surface water and groundwater recent studies e g gianni et al 2016 have shown that the hydraulic conductivity of the streambed can change by several orders of magnitude after flood events therefore undermining the commonly made modelling assumption in both the hydrological and hydrogeological modelling community of constant hydraulic properties of the streambed this leads to a bias in predictions of groundwater surface water exchange fluxes for essentially all the processes mentioned above it is important to consider the feedback mechanisms between the surface and the subsurface the conceptualization of one compartment through a simple boundary condition prevents a coupled and thus holistic understanding of these processes 3 2 soil hydrology and runoff generation processes the interface between soil and bedrock or soil and unconsolidated material like moraines is an important boundary between hydrology and hydrogeology for soil hydrology the soil vegetation atmosphere boundary is the key location for partitioning precipitation into runoff evapotranspiration and recharge since soil and vegetation properties are highly heterogeneous in space this boundary strongly determines how much water leaves the soil and hence how much water enters the groundwater from above fig 2 a during more intense or longer rainfall events or during snowmelt conditions the infiltrating water is not only increasing the soil moisture storage but runoff generation can trigger overland flow and subsurface stormflow or interflow resulting in lateral redistribution of water and solutes on the surface and within the soil bachmair and weiler 2011 weiler et al 2005 in particular subsurface stormflow is a key element for soil development within a hillslope for slope stability processes due to high pore water pressure at the soil bedrock interface and for delivering substantial runoff amounts via subsurface flow to the streamflow bachmair and weiler 2011 for rainfall events these processes and flow pathways are highly dynamic and the water commonly follows shallow lateral flow pathways within the upper meter s of the soil where the event water may also mobilize old water which then is frequently seen in the streamflow response bachmair and weiler 2014 the slower but more continuous snowmelt events can trigger subsurface runoff even in hillslopes without a distinct soil bedrock boundary but also in slopes with continuously decreasing hydraulic conductivity resulting in subsurface stormflow and in percolation excess subsurface flow smith et al 2014 runoff generation processes typically happen at a time scale of minutes and hours and surface and subsurface runoff is a loss term for groundwater recharge as well as for soil water storage in the areas of runoff production the lateral redistribution of water can however also produce more infiltration percolation and recharge in areas where water from upslope enters the soil and increases both soil moisture storage and recharge this effect can be quite extreme in urban areas especially with low impact storm water management structures in a case study in freiburg germany groundwater recharge was simulated in such an urban area and resulted in recharge of over 38 000 mm in two 500 m long swales steinbrich et al 2018 leistert et al 2018 also in natural catchments where subsurface or surface runoff are important runoff generation mechanisms recharge can increase by several factors to even orders of magnitude when laterally redistributed water enters permeable areas in hollows sinks dolines or the interface between hillslope and flat valley bottoms fig 2a despite the temporal scale of runoff processes most groundwater recharge models run on daily or longer time scales hence infiltration and percolation excess are rarely simulated since daily average rainfall intensities of sub daily rainfall events are too small to generate overland or sub surface flow in addition recharge models are typically one dimensional models that do not allow for lateral redistribution of water which results in significant over or underestimation of recharge in both time and space instead most groundwater recharge models use correction terms armbruster 2002 armbruster and leibundgut 2001 to account for the loss of recharge by surface and subsurface flow information on runoff generation processes from hydrologists could help increase the realism of spatial and temporal recharge patterns in hydrogeological models this effect may also be very relevant under climate change as runoff generation processes are highly non linear or even threshold like processes meerveld and weiler 2008 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 for instance if recharge is generated mainly during snowmelt conditions under current climate conditions a shift to more mid winter snowmelt events or to rainfall events could dramatically change the runoff generation resulting in disproportionally more or less recharge 3 3 water quality aspects water quality is another important field where collaboration between hydrologists and hydrogeologists is indispensable and should be intensified numerous catchments scale water quality studies have been published wellen et al 2015 although many studies use the broad term water quality in their title most of them deal with diffuse contaminant sources mostly from agriculture which will also be the focus of this discussion the objective of water quality models is to predict solute concentration trends at a given location in the stream and sometimes in groundwater for robust predictions such models need to take the temporal and spatial pattern of the solute input into account e g schuetz et al 2016 transport dynamics along multiple pathways cause a time lag between input and output there are sorption and reactive processes along these pathways and mixing of waters of different origin and with different chemistries in the stream among these models we focus here on the most commonly used ones as identified in wellen et al 2015 namely swat inca agnps annagnps hspf and hbv with the term hydrogeological model we refer to the classical groundwater models such as feflow or modflow with related transport codes these two model types differ in their spatial resolution with hydrological models usually discretizing catchments into sub catchments while hydrogeological models describe flow and transport in a spatially distributed manner hydrological models generally emphasize the effect of surface features e g topography soil properties on the partitioning of water among slow and rapid flow paths and on the solute fate biogeochemical processes that govern the solute input from the soil zone fig 2b are explicitly simulated in contrast in hydrogeological models only the fraction of water that infiltrates is considered further while excess water is not considered in the model solute input from soils is usually not simulated but specified as a boundary condition approaches of varying complexities are used from tabulated solute loads as a function of land use irrespectively of site specific conditions to the simulation of the solute input dynamics with a separate model for transport through the shallow and deep subsurface the situation is reversed hydrological models strongly simplify subsurface processes by representing aquifers as single reservoirs while for hydrogeological models water moving along rapid flow paths is not considered in some hydrological model water reaching a deep groundwater reservoir is no longer considered for streamflow a simplified representation of groundwater can be adequate whereas for water quality a more detailed representation of flow pathways and transit times becomes necessary some of the hydrological models e g inca represent the delay between solute input and its appearance in the stream by defining a fixed time constant for the groundwater reservoir however solute breakthrough in streams or wells is usually governed by a broad transit time distribution due to variations in flow path lengths and velocities among them fig 2b furthermore solute breakthrough patterns also depend on where solutes enter the subsurface relative to the receptor which is disregarded in the case of single groundwater reservoirs in hydrogeological models subsurface flow paths are resolved spatially hence reproducing both the effect of spatial variations of solute sources and differences in solute flow paths due to their higher data requirement and calculation times they are usually only implemented for subsections of catchments often focusing on productive aquifers used for water supply furthermore especially in the context of applied modelling for water resources management also in hydrogeology simplified lumped approaches are used that resemble those in hydrology often solute transport is approximated with a transfer function approach whereby the transit time distribution is characterized by a simple lumped parameter analytical model such an approach can reproduce water quality trends in groundwater with sufficient precision especially if constrained with environmental tracer methods refined versions have also been proposed that take the spatial variability of solute input into account many models include separate soil and groundwater zones but usually simplistic formulations are used to describe how the two domains are connected often the output of the soil zone directly enters groundwater however a large mass of solutes is often stored in the vadose zone in case of nitrogen sometimes referred to as the nitrate time bomb in some hydrological models e g swat the vadose zone reservoir is coarsely represented by a fixed time delay between water leaving the soil and entering the aquifer common hydrogeological models can simulate flow and transport under variably saturated conditions and thus vadose zone processes can be included in a physically based way however as the governing equation for flow is strongly nonlinear and vadose zone processes are more dynamic than processes in groundwater calculation times strongly increase making it challenging to couple vadose zone and groundwater processes for large catchments barthel 2006 solute breakthrough in a stream or well is often strongly influenced by sorption and reactive processes fig 2b hydrological models tend to assume that solutes remain stable once they have reached the groundwater box e g inca or given that only discrete reservoirs are considered a spatially homogenous reaction rate is specified e g swat however reactive processes often vary spatially with hot spots of enhanced reactivity for example reactivity often shows a depth dependence due to more strongly reducing conditions at depth or enhanced reactivity occurs in riparian zones modifying the groundwater composition shortly before it exfiltrates the effects of such zones crucially depend on how much flow occurs through such zones i e the turnover is transport controlled and thus an explicit simulation of subsurface flow paths is required finally another difference among hydrological and hydrogeological models are the receptors that are considered while hydrological models provide groundwater concentrations they cannot directly be associated with concentrations measured at a specific location such as a pumping well in reverse classical hydrogeological models can provide solute fluxes to streams which act as boundary conditions but cannot predict stream water concentrations in summary hydrologist and hydrogeologists simplify the complex problem of water quality modelling in different and complementary ways building on concepts and tools that have evolved within their respective discipline this also leads to inconsistency in terminology interestingly in the hydrological literature models like swat or inca are often judged as process orientated bouraoui and grizzetti 2014 although these models represent groundwater in a very simplistic way how a water quality problem is simplified should be driven by the nature of the problem e g the type of solute considered and not by traditions within a discipline for example for strongly sorbing contaminants it can be sufficient to grossly simplify subsurface processes as transport mainly occurs along surficial flow paths while for well soluble compounds such as nitrate long term concentrations trends will not be captured if deeper groundwater reservoirs are ignored or merely act as a sink or for a problem where a biogeochemical time lag dominates over the hydrological time lag it is particularly important to explicitly simulate biogeochemical processes in some cases researchers already leverage on the complementary of the approaches by using one type of model to simulate one part of the system for instance soil and specifying the model output as boundary conditions for the second however there is much scope for collaboration towards a joint framework on how to best conceptualize and model solutes with different properties at the catchment scale the effect of the different flow pathways and transit times relates mainly to water quality aspects from the hydrological quantitative perspective the focus is often on faster flow pathways while deeper and longer flow pathways are ignored the hydrogeological perspective has the opposite bias short surface flow pathways might be ignored although they can be highly important for streamflow water quality one way to overcome the difference here could be to include tritium based transit times stewart and morgenstern 2016 that could bridge the perspectives of hydrologists and hydrogeologists i e hydrological models could be structured with the help of tritium and stable isotopes derived transit times 3 4 low flow periods special situations in which groundwater surface water interaction gains importance are low flow periods smakhtin 2001 that occur after prolonged dry weather or when water is stored in the snowpack during low flow only contributions from delayed sources sustain streamflow hall 1968 one of the major delayed contributions to streamflow is groundwater discharge from aquifers which are often assumed to dominate catchment storage even though there are other delayed sources such as snow or glacier melt when these delayed sources contribute to the stream low flow variability is driven by climate variability and geological catchment properties which shape storage functioning in catchments van lanen et al 2013 schneider 1957 stoelzle et al 2014 catchment storage properties staudinger et al 2017 at the surface snow vegetation soils have an effect on recharge to aquifers and storage properties in the subsurface have an effect on discharge from aquifers and hence ultimately on the streamflow during low flow periods garner et al 2015 kirchner 2009 lauber et al 2014 this is why catchment storage properties are important when studying low flows there are many hydrogeological studies that focus on the low flows of springs for instance large karst springs e g fiorillo 2009 kovács et al 2005 but few studies explicitly relate the dynamics of aquifers to streamflow under low flow conditions at the catchment scale e g käser and hunkeler 2016 while there are many hydrological studies that focus on low streamflow the attribution of the governing mechanisms climate variability and geological catchment properties is still not fully understood to better understand these mechanisms we must think about our simplified boundary conditions that separate hydrology from hydrogeology again catchment hydrologists analyze low flows often from a water balance perspective e g garner et al 2015 i e streamflow during low flow periods in the absence of precipitation is seen as a function of catchment storage kirchner 2009 low flows are quantifiable the water stored in the catchment is not groundwater contribution and its characterization are based on two assumptions 1 streamflow integrates all water releasing processes in the catchment e g snowmelt increases the flux evapotranspiration decreases the flux and more importantly 2 streamflow represents the depletion of catchment storage during prolonged dry weather under these assumptions streamflow is a function of storage and metrics like streamflow recession coefficients or baseflow indices can be used to characterize or even to estimate catchment storage from streamflow variability in hydrological practice the groundwater contribution to streamflow is often estimated with recession analysis methods which recently have been improved roques et al 2017 stewart 2015 stoelzle et al 2013 thomas et al 2015 nevertheless recession segments are only representations of a part of the storage depletion process and often superimposed by streamflow contributions of other delayed sources next to groundwater such as snowmelt in alpine catchments it would be beneficial for instance for low flow regionalization to distinguish between groundwater storage estimate and other delayed sources it is still an open question on which geological information that should be based on but such a storage characterization is crucial for more comprehensive low flow studies and regionalization approaches bloomfield et al 2015 stoelzle et al 2015 in traditional hydrogeology aquifer characterization often prioritizes high permeability zones suitable for groundwater extraction which often have a limited spatial extent relative to the size of catchments for low flow bedrock aquifers can become more important as they can release water over an extended period but much less is known about their characteristics development of new geophysical methods to gain better information on the geometry and properties of these bedrock aquifers might help receive important information for storage characterization since storage is important to understand low flow variability satellite based approaches to estimate terrestrial water storage on large spatial scales e g grace have been recently linked to periods with less water availability houborg et al 2012 small scale gravimeters can help estimate total storage in catchments creutzfeldt et al 2012 2014 hasan et al 2008 however a reliable estimation of catchment storage for mesoscale catchments remains challenging creutzfeldt et al 2014 van loon et al 2017 especially in mountainous regions due to the uncertainty of remote sensing data and a lack of groundwater level information in those regions cosmic ray soil moisture devices e g heidbüchel et al 2016 can continuously measure soil water storage over larger areas and depths which is a promising approach for an improved understanding of catchment storage and to identify the relative importance of soil water storage different types of catchment storages e g dynamic total immobile storage have been discussed in the hydrological community staudinger et al 2017 highlighting that different methods assess different types of storage there are two reasons for additional data in the context of low flow that could lead to more integrated approaches first data is needed to better understand how much water leaves catchments during low flow periods by including subsurface outflow this can be achieved by paired groundwater surface water gauging stations many gauging stations do not measure all water flowing out of the catchment but there is often a substantial flow below the gauge this subsurface outflow might contribute a significant part of the total outflow from the basin particularly during low flow periods käser and hunkeler 2016 showed that groundwater discharge below the gauging station can be substantial and is not negligible second additional data is needed to better understand and estimate groundwater storage and release and its effect during low flow in different aquifer units within a catchment which is more challenging for low flow dynamics water storage in the bedrock can play a critical role but often in these formations there are no observation wells a starting point to better understand the groundwater storage changes is thus to gain more data for bedrock aquifers the issue of missing data is also present at the surface missing measurements and measurement quality of streamflow data are an issue in low flow studies when streamflow measurements are often not precise enough during periods of zero flow there can be still groundwater flow out of the catchment below the streamflow gauging station indicating a lost connection between surface water and groundwater käser and hunkeler 2016 and a fully depleted dynamic catchment storage i e the storage that controls streamflow staudinger et al 2017 as further downstream by passed groundwater can be discharged to the river again hydrological models should consider subsurface flow as a part of total streamflow this becomes especially important during prolonged low flow periods when modelling these low flow periods it is hence important to include subsurface flow as part of total streamflow if subsurface flow is not considered in the water balance calculation simulated evapotranspiration might be erroneously increased to compensate this although a model that is calibrated with parameters that overestimate evapotranspiration may provide good results in term of performance criteria i e differences between simulated and observed streamflow internal model variables might be wrong and may induce biases in low flow processes which should be avoided when the model purpose are predictions hydrological models that use a bucket type representation of the dynamic storage have to be applied carefully for low flow simulations and can benefit from hydrogeological information payn et al 2012 found that topographic controls decreased with progressing streamflow recession while the influence of multiple aspects of the subsurface structure of the catchment increased with longer recessions staudinger et al 2011 found poor low flow performances of bucket type models related to the model structures representing the subsurface these findings suggest that in hydrological models a bucket type representation of the dynamic storage might be only adequate as long as a uniquely defined streamflow aquifer system controls regional low flows hence we have to analyze when and where the assumption of a uniquely defined streamflow aquifer system holds and find better ways to represent aquifer depletion e g le moine et al 2007 as well surface water groundwater exchange fig 2c in bucket type hydrological models staudinger et al in preparation stoelzle et al 2015 suggest that relatively simple changes of groundwater storages boxes in hydrological models can improve baseflow simulation for different geological settings this indicates that information on hydrogeology can directly improve low flow modelling in hydrology many hydrogeological models are calibrated with heads only but are used to predict e g fluxes or residence times it is challenging to calibrate a hydrogeological model based on heads only as follows directly from darcy s law the same head configuration can result in many different fluxes depending on the hydraulic conductivity thus it is important to constrain a model with some measured fluxes particularly under low flow conditions when most water in the river should originate from groundwater incorporating stream flow provides such an opportunity to consider fluxes in hydrogeological modelling as is possible in coupled furman 2008 or integrated models barthel and banzhaf 2016 4 concluding remarks this paper was written jointly by catchment hydrologists and hydrogeologists to discuss the large potential of collaboration for utilizing more detailed information about a boundary condition from the respectively other discipline we discussed general differences between the two disciplines hydrogeology and hydrology how these disciplines evolved separately and which consequences this implies for study foci data collection modelling approaches and education one important issue is that the two disciplines despite all differences often use a similar terminology however sometimes terms have different meanings and we must be careful when communicating and working together to avoid serious misunderstandings we further discussed the respective boundary conditions i e assumptions at the boundaries of the investigated system when we apply hydrological and hydrogeological models such as recharge rate hydrogeology or zero flux at the bottom of the system hydrology we described situations where the work of hydrologists and hydrogeologists should be brought together and where groundwater surface water interactions urge for a more integrated and joint approach often in these situations the boundary conditions that each discipline defines can be refined with information from the other discipline that studies these boundary conditions as being the focus of their investigations fig 2 the discussion included direct groundwater surface water interactions soil hydrology runoff generation water quality aspects and low flow periods within these issues we highlighted especially boundary conditions where closer collaboration between catchment hydrologists and hydrogeologists would be most useful often such collaborations would be relatively straight forward and require an increased awareness rather than fancy methods for instance simply accounting for ungauged subsurface flow out of a catchment can greatly increase the reliability of predictions as the water balance becomes more realistic and model calibration does not artificially increase evaporation to compensate for the subsurface outflow we hope that this paper contributes to an increased awareness of the need for collaboration between hydrologists and hydrogeologists because your work might be my boundary condition conflict of interest the authors
