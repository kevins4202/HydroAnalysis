8230,study region canada study focus intensity duration frequency curves need to be updated to account for the potential effect of climate change however sub daily regional climate model rcm simulations required for this purpose are commonly unavailable the scaling approach is often applied for temporal downscaling of point daily precipitation nevertheless difference in spatial scale between simulations and observations may complicate its application at the grid scale this study proposes a grid scale temporal downscaling approach for estimating sub daily gridded extreme rainfall intensity under climate change at regions with a relatively high station density the approach uses daily annual maximum rainfall intensity series from rcm simulations and grid scale scaling properties from observations the study evaluates two methods for estimating gridded scaling exponents needed in temporal downscaling the assessment is performed on observation based and rcm based temporally downscaled quantiles the effect of temporal downscaling and bias correction on sub daily quantiles and relative changes is also analysed the approach is applied to three case studies across canada new hydrological insights for the region piecewise simple scaling is found over the study domains indicating caution in using simple scaling the performance of the approach in estimating sub daily observation based gridded rainfall intensity quantiles is suitable with preference for point to grid transfer at the annual maximum series stage bias correction is necessary for properly estimating

curves canada 1 introduction extreme rainfall intensity duration frequency idf curves are often used for urban infrastructure design and risk assessment csa 2019 they characterise extreme rainfalls by representing the relationships between rainfall intensities or amounts of different rainfall durations usually a few minutes to a few days and different frequency of occurrences expressed as return periods nguyen and nguyen 2019 evidence of the effect of climate change on extreme precipitation across the globe e g wang et al 2017 westra et al 2014 as well as in particular in canada e g burn and taleghani 2013 requena et al 2019b shephard et al 2014 supports the need for updating idfs to account for the potential effect of climate change idf update under climate change is usually performed through the analysis of climate model simulations provided by global climate models gcms or regional climate models rcms e g willems et al 2012 simonovic et al 2016 climate models often simulate precipitation at a daily or less frequent time scale due to model limitations and computational cost e g nguyen and nguyen 2018 2020 the difficulty in assessing future changes in sub daily extreme precipitation due to the lack of sub daily climate model simulations or due to the uncertainty resulting from the ability of the models to generate them is underlined in the literature e g berg et al 2019 degaetano and castellano 2017 sunyer et al 2015 this may be the reason why many studies only provide future changes for rainfall durations that are greater than or equal to the temporal resolution of the climate model considered e g mailhot et al 2007 temperature simulations of climate models are usually more reliable than precipitation simulations in this regard several studies evaluated the clausius clapeyron c c scaling relationship according to which precipitation extremes increase at a rate of 7 per c finding out that the c c relationship presents limitations for given temperature ranges and humidity conditions and depends on rainfall duration e g drobinski et al 2018 herath et al 2016 2017 lenderink and meijgaard 2008 panthou et al 2014 wang et al 2017 however sub daily precipitation projections are needed for the estimation of future idf curves the analysis of sub daily precipitation is especially relevant since it may lead to larger urban floods sunyer et al 2015 and may be more affected by climate change than daily precipitation westra et al 2014 some studies used simple to complex empirical relationships such as empirical factors or various regression models and machine leaning techniques to obtain sub daily estimates from daily values for a given region examples are the adapted ratio formula used by switzman et al 2017 for ontario and the empirical adjustment factors used by degaetano and castellano 2017 for the state of new york gaur et al 2020 applied the support vector machine technique to establish links between different large scale simulated atmospheric variables and observed local extreme precipitation amounts of different sub daily rainfall durations nevertheless most of the studies accounting for sub daily precipitation rely on temporal downscaling temporal disaggregation to obtain sub daily estimates from daily precipitation e g hassanzadeh et al 2019 willems et al 2012 among temporal downscaling approaches scale invariance scaling is widely used see sect 2 1 1 for further information scale invariance gumbel gum or generalized extreme value gev models based either on non central moments ncms or on probability

model nguyen and nguyen 2018 2020 scaling properties are also accounted for temporal disaggregation by cascade generators e g sunyer et al 2015 difference in scale between gridded climate model simulations and point observations may complicate temporal downscaling under climate change studies obtaining sub daily simulations through temporal downscaling are commonly performed at the station scale e g herath et al 2016 nguyen and nguyen 2020 nguyen et al 2007 simonovic et al 2016 vu et al 2017 that is prior to the application of temporal downscaling gridded climate model simulations are spatially downscaled to the station for obtaining point estimates nevertheless extreme rainfall intensity is usually required at the catchment scale in practice which agrees with the grid scale since both involve areal instead of point extreme rainfall intensity e g requena et al 2019b studies performed at the grid scale do not usually account for temporal downscaling e g ekstr√∂m et al 2005 mailhot et al 2012 mladjic et al 2011 or assume that scaling properties at the station scale are valid at the grid scale e g sunyer et al 2015 to fill that gap this study proposes an approach for temporal downscaling at the grid scale to estimate sub daily gridded extreme rainfall intensity under climate change using daily rcm simulations and grid scale scaling properties derived from observations this avoids the need of spatially downscaling to the station scale to perform the temporal downscaling for later upscaling to the catchment grid scale to obtain sub daily areal gridded rainfall intensity quantiles the temporal downscaling approach adapted to the grid scale is the scale invariance gev pwm model the model showed a better performance when compared with other scaling models in ontario canada nguyen and nguyen 2018 and is applied for estimating extreme rainfall under climate change at gauged and ungauged locations in that area nguyen and nguyen 2020 nguyen et al 2018 another advantage of the scaling model is that it only requires the distribution of annual maximum rainfall intensity series and does not require the use of complete time series that are commonly unavailable for short rainfall durations the same scaling properties are commonly assumed for baseline and future periods in temporal downscaling e g herath et al 2016 studies based on this assumption either did not specifically assess the performance of temporally downscaled rainfall quantiles estimated from daily climate model simulations for a future period e g herath et al 2016 nguyen et al 2007 or divided observed records into calibration and validation period to assess their performance over time e g nguyen and nguyen 2020 nguyen et al 2018 in this study hourly temporally downscaled rainfall intensity quantiles estimated from daily rcm simulations are compared with those obtained from available hourly simulations for current and future periods for a particular rcm this allows for a direct assessment of the performance of the approach under climate change nevertheless such a comparison is performed with caution since rcms may present limitations in the representation of convective storms which may affect sub daily simulations e g berg et al 2019 the use of grid scale scaling properties from observations for estimating temporally downscaled rcm based quantiles may require applying bias correction the widespread quantile mapping bias correction method applied to rcm annual maximum series is used for that purpose e g li et al 2017 the effect of temporal downscaling and bias correction on sub daily quantile and relative change estimation is also assessed in this study the proposed grid scale temporal downscaling approach is aimed at regions that present a relatively high station density and is evaluated on three case studies across canada this allows assessing the performance of the scale invariance gev pwm model at different locations across canada since it was applied to a case study in ontario at the station scale when initially proposed daily and hourly rcm simulations from the canrcm4 canesm2 climate model belonging to the north american coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment na cordex are used for illustrating the analysis therefore the objective of the study is to propose a grid scale temporal downscaling approach for estimating sub daily gridded extreme rainfall intensities under climate change based on the scale invariance gev pwm model the approach involves the assessment of two methods for estimating gridded scaling exponents needed in temporal downscaling and the assessment of the effect of bias correction on temporally downscaled rcm based quantiles and relative changes the study is organised as follows materials and methods are shown in sect 2 where background methodology and case study and data are included results and discussion are provided in sect 3 and conclusions are presented in sect 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 background 2 1 1 scale invariance gev pwm model the scale invariance gev pwm model is the temporal downscaling approach used for adaptation to the grid scale in this study and refers to the scaling gev model based on pwms proposed by nguyen and nguyen 2018 the method is based on the scaling concept that allows modelling extreme rainfall over time scales e g from several minutes to a day under the assumption that statistical properties over time scales are related through scale ratios and scaling exponents e g see eq 1 the scale invariance gev pwm model is an appropriate temporal downscaling approach for dealing with rainfall frequency analysis this is due to the good performance of the gev distribution when used in rainfall frequency analysis e g johnson and green 2018 nguyen et al 2017 requena et al 2019a and to the benefits of using l moments that are linear combinations of pwms for parameter estimation e g see hosking and wallis 1997 for details for a simple scaling regime the scale invariance gev pwm model implies constant scaling exponents over pwms as seen through eq 1 1 Œ≤ r Œª t Œª s Œ≤ r t where Œ≤ r is the pwm of order r see hosking and wallis 1997 for details t refers to the reference time scale e g t 24 h Œª is the scale ratio linking two time scales e g Œª 1 24 if linking 1 h and t 24 h and s is the scaling exponent this results in horizontal lines in the often displayed plot of scaling exponents in respect of pwms e g yu et al 2004 simple scaling also allows relating parameters and quantiles over two time scales as indicated in eq 2 2 g Œª t Œª s g t Œ∫ Œª t Œ∫ t where g represent the location parameter scale parameter or quantile associated with a return period t of the gev distribution and Œ∫ is the shape parameter of the gev distribution hence eqs 1 and 2 allow obtaining statistical properties for sub daily extreme rainfall such as l moments parameters and quantiles from commonly available daily annual maximum series short and long rainfall durations may be governed by different mechanisms and hence present different scaling behaviours e g nguyen et al 2007 studies from the literature revealed that extreme rainfall ranging from minutes to days may be approximated by one or two different scaling regime s e g bairwa et al 2016 nguyen et al 1998 if the log log plot of the pwms of rainfall intensities or amounts versus rainfall durations does not present a breaking point break the existence of a single scaling regime for all extreme rainfalls over the selected time scales may be concluded in such a case the relationship between statistical moments and durations in the log log space may be characterized using a straight line for each order moment on the other hand the presence of a break indicates the existence of two different scaling regimes for the two groups of extreme rainfall separated by the break i e multi scaling which may be treated as piecewise simple scaling e g yu et al 2004 this leads to the estimation of two scaling exponents a scaling exponent for characterising the scaling regime of rainfall durations at and before the break and another scaling exponent for characterising the scaling regime of rainfall durations at and after the break in this case the relationship between rainfall statistical moments and durations in the log log space may be characterized using two different straight lines for each order moment therefore the presence of a break leads to the estimation of different scaling exponents for different scaling regimes based on this pwms and distributions of sub daily extreme rainfalls may be derived from those of daily data similarly pwms and distributions of sub hourly extreme rainfall may be derived from those of estimated sub daily data estimated pwms are later used for obtaining l moments gev parameters and finally t year rainfall intensity quantiles nevertheless the identification of a break is not a trivial task a numerical criterion is used in this study for objectively identifying the presence of a break nguyen and nguyen 2018 and consists of minimizing residuals of linear regression models fitted to the log log plot of pwms versus rainfall durations over durations associated with each scaling regime this is done by accounting for the first three order moments since they are needed in the estimation of gev parameters 2 1 2 quantile mapping bias correction method quantile mapping is the method used for bias correction of annual maximum series extracted from rcm simulations in this study the use of the method for bias correction of simulations associated with a baseline period is widespread e g ganguli and coulibaly 2019 li et al 2017 vu et al 2017 while different approaches may be applied when considering a future period a modified version named equidistance quantile matching is used for bias correction of simulations associated with a future period in several studies e g ganguli and coulibaly 2019 srivastav et al 2014 vu et al 2017 in this regard li et al 2017 indicated that while quantile mapping assumes that differences in rainfall magnitude between baseline simulations and observations are also valid in the future for a given magnitude equidistance quantile matching assumes this for a given percentile they argued that the latter assumption lacks physical meaning regarding the origin of bias and may lead to issues in the application of bias correction for future periods for simplicity quantile mapping is used for bias correction of rcm simulations for baseline and future periods in this study 3 x b f o 1 f b x b x f x f c f x f f o 1 f b x f f b 1 f b x f f o 1 f b x f where x b and x f are the rcm based gridded annual maximum rainfall intensity series for baseline and future period respectively and x b and x f are their associated bias corrected series c f is the correction factor f b represents the cumulative distribution function of rcm based gridded annual maximum rainfall intensity series for the baseline period f b 1 is the inverse of f b and f o 1 is the inverse of the cumulative distribution function of observation based gridded annual maximum rainfall intensity series quantile mapping may be considered as non parametric or parametric depending on whether an empirical distribution function or a given parametric distribution function is used for bias correction limited impact of this choice is found for the greater sydney region in australia li et al 2017 and for ontario in canada fig 3 in ganguli and coulibaly 2019 this study uses non parametric quantile mapping to avoid committing to a particular distribution possible larger quantiles associated with a future period are bias corrected using the correction factor associated with the largest quantile for the baseline period gudmundsson 2016 gudmundsson et al 2012 2 2 methodology the proposed approach for grid scale temporal downscaling based on the scale invariance gev pwm model consists of four steps fig 1 i estimation of gridded breaks and scaling exponents from observations ii estimation and assessment of temporally downscaled observation based gridded rainfall intensity quantiles iii bias correction of rcm annual maximum series and iv estimation and assessment of temporally downscaled rcm based gridded rainfall intensity quantiles 2 2 1 estimation of gridded breaks and scaling exponents from observations daily and sub daily annual maximum rainfall intensity records are necessary to estimate breaks and scaling exponents needed for the application of the scale invariance gev pwm model observed rainfall series are commonly available at rainfall gauge stations i e at the point scale therefore the estimation of gridded breaks and scaling exponents involves point to grid transfer which is more reliable for a higher density rainfall gauge network two methods are considered in this study to estimate gridded breaks and scaling exponents for performing temporal downscaling at the grid scale see part i in fig 1 the first method consists in estimating gridded annual maximum rainfall intensity series from point rainfall intensity to directly obtain gridded breaks and scaling exponents the method is referred to as gridams method the second method consists in firstly estimating point breaks and scaling exponents from point rainfall intensity to later obtain associated gridded exponents as estimates over a grid the method is referred to as pointams method comparison between the methods will provide insight into the effect of performing the point to grid transfer at the annual maximum series stage gridams method or at the scaling exponent stage pointams method the gridams method involves identifying stations within each grid for each duration since some stations may lack records for a particular duration for a given duration the average annual maximum rainfall intensity for stations within a grid is estimated for each year these gridded annual maximum series are then directly used for obtaining gridded breaks and scaling exponents the pointams method requires estimating point breaks and scaling exponents for each station using the annual maximum rainfall intensity series for all available durations nevertheless transferring point breaks and scaling exponents to the grid scale is not straightforward the identification of breaks is conditioned to the specific rainfall durations available e g 5 min 10 min 15 min 30 min 1 h 2 h 6 h 12 h and 24 h that usually present different time intervals between each other which complicates averaging point breaks to obtain gridded breaks furthermore the transfer from point to grid scale must keep the coherence between breaks and scaling exponents since they are linked to deal with these issues gridded breaks estimated by the gridams method are also used as gridded breaks in the pointams method and estimated point scaling exponents are adjusted so that they are associated with the value of the gridded break at the grid where they are located the adjusted estimates of the point scaling exponents are then averaged over stations within a grid to obtain corresponding gridded scaling exponents note that under an ideal dataset with a large number of rainfall durations and no missing data it would be expected that both methods would obtain similar results making it reasonable to assume similar gridded breaks the approach of estimating gridded values as average of point estimates over a grid is used in several studies e g hofstra et al 2010 tian et al 2018 visessri and mcintyre 2012 2 2 2 estimation and assessment of temporally downscaled observation based gridded rainfall intensity quantiles gridded breaks and scaling exponents obtained from the two aforementioned methods are used for estimating sub daily gridded quantiles through the scale invariance gev pwm model these temporally downscaled quantiles are compared with corresponding sub daily quantiles directly estimated from gridded annual maximum series for t 2 5 10 and 25 years see part ii in fig 1 longer return periods are not considered due to the use of a local approach for quantile estimation for which a long record length which is not usually available in practice would be necessary for accurate estimation the performance of the methods is evaluated by two error measures the relative root mean square error rrmse and relative bias rbias the rrmse represents the average accuracy of the method whereas the rbias represents its average under or over estimation the performance of a method is better as these error measures are closer to zero for a given rainfall duration and return period they are computed as follows 4 r r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i t x i t x i t 2 5 r b i a s 1 n i 1 n y i t x i t x i t where x i t represents the t year gridded rainfall intensity quantile at grid i y i t represents the temporally downscaled t year gridded rainfall intensity quantile at grid i and n is the number of studied grids 2 2 3 bias correction of rcm annual maximum series the application of grid scale temporal downscaling for estimating sub daily rcm based gridded rainfall intensity quantiles using gridded breaks and scaling exponents derived from observations may require bias correction of the daily rcm annual maximum series used as input see part iii in fig 1 bias correction should be performed using observations with a similar temporal and spatial resolution to that of the rcm maraun 2013 bias correction of rcm annual maximum series for baseline and future periods is performed by quantile mapping see sect 2 1 2 using estimated observation based gridded annual maximum series 2 2 4 estimation and assessment of temporally downscaled rcm based gridded rainfall intensity quantiles gridded breaks and scaling exponents associated with the method obtaining the best performance i e from either the gridams or the pointams method are used for estimating temporally downscaled rcm based gridded rainfall intensity quantiles from daily rcm annual maximum series the assessment of these quantiles is analogous to that performed on observations but focussed on hourly rainfall durations this validation is possible due to the use of a rcm providing both daily and hourly simulations hourly temporally downscaled quantiles obtained from daily rcm annual maximum series are compared with corresponding hourly quantiles directly estimated from hourly rcm annual maximum series for t 2 5 10 and 25 years see part iv in fig 1 this is performed by considering either bias corrected or non bias corrected rcm annual maximum series for baseline and future periods the performance of the temporally downscaled quantiles is assessed by computing the rrmse and rbias in an analogous way to when assessing observation based quantiles by eqs 4 and 5 error measure results obtained with and without considering bias correction are compared for assessing the effect of bias correction on the performance of the grid scale temporal downscaling approach the effect of bias correction and temporal downscaling on relative change estimation is also assessed for a given rainfall duration and return period the relative change c r expressed in is estimated as 6 c r x f t x b t x b t 100 x f t x b t 1 100 where x b t and x f t are the t year rcm based gridded rainfall intensity quantiles for baseline and future period respectively 2 3 case study and data 2 3 1 observed data and case studies selection the proposed grid scale temporal downscaling approach is applied to canada observed annual maximum rainfall depth series for nine rainfall durations 5 min 10 min 15 min 30 min 1 h 2 h 6 h 12 h and 24 h are available for 565 idf stations across the country environment and climate change canada eccc 2014 following the screening of the data performed in requena et al 2019a annual maximum series for rainfall durations with less than 10 years of records identified as nonstationary for short or long durations or associated with stations located north of 65 latitude are removed from the database this results in a set of 556 idf stations recently eccc released a new idf dataset version with updated records and additional stations however this study is not focused on the use of the most updated dataset but on the use of a valid dataset that allows assessing the proposed approach due to available records for daily and sub daily rainfall consisting of annual maxima in canada i e time series are not usually available for short durations gridded annual maximum series are estimated using these values all available records are considered in the analysis for a fair comparison between the gridams and pointams methods see discussion in sect 3 4 the selection of case studies across the country allows for a more general assessment of the approach since location may affect scaling innocenti et al 2017 particular case studies are selected based on station density within grids for that purpose 0 5 50 km latitude longitude grids over canada are classified according to the number of idf stations within a grid and the grid where the closest station to a capital city is located referred to as target grid is marked to identify potential case studies across the country fig 2 shows the classification obtained using the 554 idf stations with records for the 24 h rainfall duration among the 556 station dataset the maximum number of stations per grid is 16 stations stations falling on a border of a grid are assigned to the grid to the right below hijmans 2017 avoiding using them twice case studies are identified as those with the largest number of stations per grid being close to a target grid they are named after the corresponding province british columbia bc ontario on and quebec qc are the selected case studies fig 2 the highest station density across canada is located in the southern parts of these provinces the target grid in on has 16 stations the target grid in qc has nine stations and a nearby grid to the target grid in bc presents 13 stations the study domain for each case study consists of the rectangular domain that includes the grids forming the pooling group of the target grid for 24 h rainfall duration and t 100 years which corresponds with the largest pooling group considered in requena et al 2019b the rectangular domain of bc is formed by 32 i e 8 4 0 5 grids and consists of 53 stations nineteen of the grids are gauged and nine of them have one station the rectangular domains of on and qc are formed by 25 i e 5 5 0 5 grids 14 of the grids in on are gauged and three of them have one station while 19 of the grids in qc are gauged and 10 of them have one station on consists of 53 stations and qc of 38 stations the analysis is performed on all gauged grids and results for selected grids where gridded estimations may be considered as more reliable are further highlighted in this line grids with a relevant station density are selected for evaluation in hofstra et al 2010 and visessri and mcintyre 2012 the former study selected five grids with a high station density of five to 11 stations for a 0 22 resolution and seven to 19 stations for a 0 44 resolution across europe the latter study selected five grids with three to five stations for a 0 25 resolution across northwest thailand in this study the minimum number of stations per grid recommended for estimating gridded values on a 0 5 50 km grid is relaxed from four e g see requena et al 2019b to three to be able to select at least two grids in qc and additional criteria are considered for grid selection the criteria are include between three and 16 stations present a data length of at least 32 years for a given duration and have a percentage of years with data for at least two stations that is greater than 47 either considering all durations or durations shorter than 1 h this leads to the selection of four grids for bc and qc and five grids for on e g see grids with black borders in fig 3 b 2 3 2 regional climate model simulations na cordex provides simulations for a number of rcms driven by gcms for north america https na cordex org among the available na cordex rcm gcm combinations at the common 0 5 latitude longitude grid mearns et al 2017 used in requena et al 2019b for estimating gridded relative changes in 24 h extreme rainfall intensity in canada canrcm4 canesm2 is selected in this study due to the availability of both hourly and daily precipitation series this allows validating the grid scale temporal downscaling approach for obtaining sub daily rcm based gridded rainfall intensity quantiles the baseline period 1971 2000 and future period 2071 2100 horizon 2080 for the rcp 8 5 scenario e g charron 2014 are used for illustrating the analysis a total of four canrcm4 canesm2 simulations are used daily precipitation for baseline period daily precipitation for future period hourly precipitation for baseline period and hourly precipitation for future period daily precipitation simulations are provided at the common reference grid by na cordex however hourly precipitation series are only provided at the native rotated pole grid due to computational issues and to the large volume of data that implies their interpolation to the common grid for consistency canrcm4 canesm2 hourly precipitation series at the 0 44 native rotated pole are regridded to the common 0 5 latitude longitude grid following the same approach that na cordex used for regridding daily series the regridding is performed through the earth system modeling framework esmf software with the patch recovery method available in the national center for atmospheric research command language ncl ncl 2019 the use of a 0 5 grid resolution in this study is supported by diaconescu et al 2016 where canrcm4 at the native 0 4 rotated pole grid obtained better performance for extreme precipitation indices than at higher resolutions and by hofstra et al 2010 where coarser 0 44 instead of 0 22 resolutions are recommended when dealing with observation based gridded estimates in areas where a high station density is not available note that this study does not intend to provide future idfs or relative changes under climate change for which an ensemble of rcms would be necessary but to assess the proposed grid scale temporal downscaling approach using a rcm that allows for such an assessment hereafter canrcm4 canesm2 is referred to as rcm since only one rcm is used in this study the extraction of annual maximum rainfall series from daily rcm precipitation simulations for the grids in the study domains is performed according to the rainfall period categories identified in requena et al 2019b fig 1a three rainfall period categories were identified based on dates of hourly rainfall intensity records and division of the country into ecoprovinces january to december march to december and april to november annual maximum rainfall series at a grid are extracted from daily rcm precipitation using the months associated with the rainfall period category associated with the grid this is done for the four rcm simulations rcm annual maximum rainfall series are assumed to be stationary based on results from requena et al 2019b since idf estimation in canada involves dealing with 24 h instead of daily rainfall intensity daily annual maximum rainfall intensity series are converted to 24 h annual maximum rainfall intensity series by multiplying by the factor 1 13 world meteorological organization wmo 2009 requena et al 2019b 3 results and discussion the proposed approach is applied to the three case studies in canada for grid scale temporal downscaling of rainfall intensity from 5 min up to 24 h 3 1 breaks and scaling exponents most point and gridded breaks are within the range 30 min 2 h for bc 30 min 1 h for on and 15 min 1 h for qc see boxes of boxplots in fig 3a the point break range over the study domain is wider than the gridded break range fig 3 note that simple scaling could be used at the few stations and grids where breaks are close to duration range limits i e 10 min or 12 h the narrower break range for on indicates a more similar partition of scaling regimes between shorter and longer durations over the study domain which is also supported by less spatial variability at the grid scale compared to the two other case studies fig 3b the largest spatial variability of the gridded break is found for bc which is consistent with more complex rainfall processes due to topography and proximity to the pacific ocean gridded breaks obtained for selected grids support these findings see gray circles in fig 3a and marked grids in fig 3b these results indicate that simple scaling i e the same scaling regime for all durations should be applied with care when dealing with particular rainfall duration ranges in the study domains the scaling exponents range is 0 87 0 21 with most values between 0 80 and 0 35 see boxes of boxplots in fig 4 ranges in that order of magnitude are obtained in the literature 0 77 0 25 yu et al 2004 and 0 89 0 43 ghanmi et al 2016 for piecewise scaling and 0 95 0 35 innocenti et al 2017 for simple scaling the most similar scaling exponents range between all grids and selected grids gray circles in fig 4 is found for on which indicates that selected grids in on are more representative of the scaling behaviour in their study domain the scaling exponents range is similar for on and qc 0 87 0 38 and 0 80 0 41 respectively and presents lower absolute values for bc with a range of 0 66 0 21 fig 4 this agrees with lower absolute values of a simple scaling exponent for bc regarding qc and on found for 1 h to 24 h rainfall by innocenti et al 2017 figs 5b and 6 b in turn the difference between the two scaling exponents is more marked for on and qc with s 2 having greater absolute values than s 1 the opposite is found for bc note that s 2 is the scaling exponent for the scaling regime that considers longer durations i e from 24 h rainfall duration to the break while s 1 is the scaling exponent for the scaling regime that considers shorter durations i e from the break to the 5 min rainfall duration a lower absolute value of a scaling exponent indicates less statistical difference between shorter and longer duration extreme events considered under the given scaling regime due to being associated with more similar rainfall processes therefore results in fig 4 supported a more marked piecewise simple scaling with greater differences among longer duration events than among shorter duration events for on and qc i e s 2 is much greater than s 1 and a less marked piecewise simple scaling with slightly greater differences among shorter duration events than among longer duration events in bc i e s 1 is slightly greater than s 2 scaling exponents for selected grids support these findings greater absolute values of s 2 compared to s 1 such as in on and qc are also found by yu et al 2004 in northern taiwan and by ghanmi et al 2016 for all analysed stations but one in northern tunis that station was a high elevation site underlining the relevance of topography on scaling as in the case of bc the effect of topography and proximity to the ocean on weaker simple scaling over the north american west coast is reported in innocenti et al 2017 a lower absolute simple scaling exponent results in a more moderate decrease in maximum rainfall intensity with duration at high elevations in france blanchet et al 2016 lower absolute values of a simple scaling exponent are also found closer to the ocean in senegal sane et al 2018 3 2 comparison and performance of the gridams and pointams methods in general gridded scaling exponents obtained by the gridams and pointams methods are in the same order of magnitude for each case study fig 4 the most similar values between methods are found for qc fig 4c the point scaling exponent range covered the associated gridded scaling exponent range except for two outliers that belonged to s 1 obtained by the gridams method in bc fig 4a and to s 1 obtained by the pointams method in on fig 4b the former outlier is related to a grid where short duration annual maximum series are only available at one of two stations presenting different ranges and a common study period which resulted in a very low absolute value of the scaling exponent s 1 due to unbalanced gridded annual maximum series the latter outlier is related to a grid where several stations did not present data for short durations leading in this case to large values of the adjusted point s 1 this is associated with averaging the scaling exponent s 1 at the grid from adjusted values at stations with and without short duration data both gridams and pointams methods are hence affected by station and rainfall duration data availability maps of gridded scaling exponents obtained by the two methods and associated absolute differences are shown in fig 5 for on and in figs a1 and a2 for bc and qc in supplementary materials point scaling exponents are also displayed for illustration the largest spatial variability of scaling exponents is found for bc which agrees with the largest spatial variability of its gridded break fig 3 in general the scaling exponent s 1 presented less spatial variability than s 2 for the three case studies which indicates spatially closer scaling behaviour for shorter durations this agrees with innocenti et al 2017 who suggested that local precipitation processes may be similar across regions based on studies obtaining less spatial variability of the scaling exponent for short durations absolute differences between gridded scaling exponents obtained from the gridams and pointams methods are in general small the smallest differences are found for qc followed by on and then bc this may be partly affected by the fact that the same gridded scaling exponent is estimated by both methods at grids with one station three grids in bc and two grids in on presented absolute differences greater than 0 02 for either s 1 or s 2 some of them belonged to the set of selected grids and presented absolute differences up to 0 055 supporting differences between methods note that missing annual maxima may contribute to differences between methods for grids with at least two stations the performance of the gridams and pointams methods is assessed by comparing temporally downscaled gridded quantiles with corresponding observation based gridded quantiles for each case study for 2 5 10 and 25 year return periods rrmse and rbias are overall low and hence suitable reaching values up to 0 32 and 0 12 respectively fig 6 the lowest rrmse and rbias are found for qc followed by on and then bc larger values for bc are influenced by errors associated with the aforementioned outlier indeed the rrmse considering selected grids is much lower than the rrmse for all grids for bc and presented fewer differences to that of selected grids for the three case studies see fig a3 in supplementary materials the least difference between rrmse for all grids and for selected grids is found for on which supported the statement of selected grids being more representative of the study domain for this case study in general the gridams method performed better than the pointams method especially for shorter durations fig 6 while closer results are obtained for durations longer than 1 h the least differences are found for qc and the greatest for bc better performance for the gridams method than for the pointams method is also supported by results for selected grids for the three case studies fig a3 in general temporally downscaled quantiles estimated by the gridams method presented slight underestimation since rbias values were mostly negative for the three cases studies fig 6 some overestimation is seen for some short durations in bc fig 6a temporally downscaled quantiles estimated by the pointams method were also generally slightly underestimated with overestimation for short durations in bc fig 6a and to a lesser extent in on fig 6b rbias performance between all grids and selected grids depended on the case study fig a3 log scale q q plots for the gridams fig 7 a and pointams fig 7b method displayed an overall agreement between temporally downscaled and observation based gridded quantiles values further from the diagonal in bc are associated with the aforementioned outlier slight overestimation for selected grids represented as circles associated with some short durations for the pointams method are seen in agreement with positive rbias shown for the method see fig a3 the overall better performance of the gridams method could be partially attributed to the use of the 24 h gridded annual maximum series needed for estimating temporally downscaled quantiles through both methods when estimating scaling exponents see part i in fig 1 however the difference in performance between methods depended on the case study and on the rainfall duration range either method could be applied in qc whereas the gridams method is preferable when dealing with shorter durations in on and bc this indicates that point to grid transfer is preferable to be performed at the annual maximum series stage 3 3 assessment of hourly rcm based gridded quantiles and relative changes the gridams method is therefore used for further assessment of the grid scale temporal downscaling method in estimating sub daily rcm based gridded quantiles prior to the formal assessment observation based gridded quantiles and temporally downscaled rcm based gridded quantiles obtained from bias corrected 24 h rcm annual maximum series for the baseline period are analysed for all durations obtaining results in line with those for temporally downscaled observation based quantiles in fig 7a hourly rcm based gridded quantiles estimated using temporal downscaling i e through 24 h rcm annual maximum series and available hourly rcm annual maximum series are compared for baseline and future periods rrmse and rbias fig 8 are close to zero for 1 h temporally downscaled rcm based gridded quantiles for the baseline period when accounting for bias correction case 1 h b indicating a good agreement with 1 h rcm based gridded quantiles for the three case studies rrmse up to 0 46 and rbias as large as 0 44 are obtained for the corresponding future period case 1 h f in bc while rrmse up to 0 35 and rbias as large as 0 15 are obtained in qc and rrmse up to 0 21 and rbias as large as 0 1 are obtained in on note that results for cases considering bias correction i e 1 h b and 1 h f may differ if using a different bias correction method rrmse and rbias much greater than 0 5 are obtained for all case studies when not accounting for bias correction cases 1 h b and 1 h f indicating relevant overestimation of temporally downscaled rcm based quantiles this underlines the need of bias correcting rcm annual maximum series when scaling exponents obtained from observations are used in estimating temporally downscaled rcm based quantiles disagreement between 1 h temporally downscaled rcm based quantiles and 1 h rcm based quantiles which are directly obtained from hourly rcm annual maximum series may also be partially due to the reliability of the latter and to the way in which gridded annual maximum series are estimated in this study see discussion in sect 3 4 as mentioned in the introduction rcms may present issues in representing convective storms berg et al 2019 found underestimation of rcm based rainfall quantiles compared with those from observations for hourly rainfall in europe when analysing cordex rcms with a higher spatial resolution of 0 11 underestimation of 1 h gridded quantiles directly obtained from non bias corrected 1 h rcm annual maximum series is also found when compared with observation based gridded quantiles in this study not shown such underestimation agrees with positive rbias for 1 h temporally downscaled rcm based gridded quantiles when bias correction is not considered cases 1 h b and 1 h f in fig 8 the effect of temporal downscaling and bias correction on relative changes is assessed through fig 9 results indicated that 1 h relative changes from temporally downscaled rcm based gridded quantiles are similar to 24 h relative changes from rcm based gridded quantiles either considering bias correction not shown or not fig 9a in the literature greater relative changes are often associated with hourly rainfall than with daily rainfall e g delta change method in sunyer et al 2015 westra et al 2014 which is also supported when comparing 1 h and 24 h relative changes from rcm based quantiles without bias correction in this study fig 9b therefore the use of scale invariance temporal downscaling for estimating sub daily rcm quantiles may have an effect on sub daily relative changes hourly relative changes from temporally downscaled rcm based quantiles obtained by considering or not bias corrected rcm annual maximum series c r and c r respectively presented some agreement for the three case studies fig 9c with overall values around the diagonal with some exceptions e g for short return periods in bc therefore the use of bias correction may be considered as less relevant for the estimation of sub daily relative changes than for the estimation of sub daily quantiles in general relative changes for selected grids supported these findings see circles in fig 9 the use of a different bias correction method may affect results in fig 9c and discussion associated with fig 9a since bias correction affects quantile estimation for baseline and especially for future period 3 4 limitations of the study a limitation of the application of the proposed grid scale approach is related to the lack of a high density station network in canada this may affect the estimation of average annual maximum rainfall intensity series from stations within a grid more reliable gridded annual maximum series would generally be associated with a higher station density and longer common record length among stations within a grid in this study all available records are used for allowing a fair comparison between the gridams and pointams methods and results for selected grids where more reliable gridded estimates are expected are underlined and further discussed in practice techniques for filling missing data at the station level could be used for obtaining more coherent annual maximum series at the grid scale the estimation of gridded precipitation from observations by averaging them over a grid is the ideal method for obtaining gridded estimates when station density allows it fowler et al 2005 associated gridded annual maximum rainfall intensity series should ideally be obtained from time series instead of from associated annual maximum series at the stations however the lack of sub daily time series in canada prevents using that approach i e only annual maxima records are commonly available at the sub daily time scale therefore observation based gridded annual maximum series estimated in this study may be considered as an approximation of the true unknown values at the grids such an estimation should not affect the overall performance of the grid scale temporal downscaling approach on observations since the approach relies on the data given as input however it may lead to a worse performance when assessing it on rcms 3 5 alternative gridded data for bias correction available daily gridded products e g see wong et al 2017 could be considered for bias correction of daily rcm simulations where a relatively dense station network exists nevertheless observation based gridded annual maximum series estimated in this study are used due to the need of bias correcting not only 24 h but also 1 h rcm annual maximum series for assessing the performance of the grid scale temporal downscaling approach in the near future na cordex will provide bias corrected daily rcm simulations for canada using a multivariate quantile mapping algorithm cannon 2018 in principle those gridded bias corrected series will only be available at the daily time scale 3 6 grid scale approach several studies based on simple scaling for estimating current idfs interpolated point estimates of scaling exponents to a high resolution 0 1 or 1 km grid e g blanchet et al 2016 ghanmi et al 2016 grid estimates may be comparable to point estimates in that case on a different approach visessri and mcintyre 2012 interpolated point rainfall to a 0 05 5 km grid using a method based on inverse distance weighting and then averaged those estimates over a 0 25 25 km grid to obtain proper grid scale values for their assessment regarding observation based average rainfall estimates over a 0 25 grid fine 0 1 10 km grids from interpolation are also averaged over coarser 25 and 50 km grids in haylock et al 2008 the two aforementioned studies supported a grid scale approach based on average estimation over a grid as in this study that notion allows for a proper assessment of the proposed grid scale approach and for a robust evaluation of the two methods considered for estimating gridded scaling exponents since study domain does not affect results due to no information transfer from stations in different grids berg et al 2019 estimated areal and time reduction factors for assessing gridded simulations regarding point observations in europe nevertheless areal reduction factors used for converting point rainfall intensity to areal rainfall intensity may be affected by region rainfall duration and return period deneale et al 2018 as well as by climate change li et al 2015 3 7 limitations on sub daily rcm based quantiles the proposed grid scale temporal downscaling approach is assessed through three case studies across canada using daily and hourly simulations available for a given na cordex rcm the proposed approach may be applied to other rcms and case studies with a relatively high station density temporally downscaled hourly relative changes are similar to 24 h relative changes obtained from 24 h rcm based quantiles whereas they differ from hourly relative changes obtained from 1 h rcm based quantiles that underestimated observations and may not be considered as true values observation based gridded annual maximum series in this study are also approximations therefore results regarding the effect of temporal downscaling on hourly relative changes should be taken with care 3 8 contributions of the proposed approach the proposed grid scale temporal downscaling approach may be considered as an alternative for obtaining sub daily rcm based gridded quantiles for idf update under climate change until high resolution convection permitting rcms may contribute to a more precise estimation of future changes in sub daily extreme precipitation westra et al 2014 convection permitting climate models may adequately represent convection under a resolution of around 4 km which makes them computationally very demanding and hence usually only able to generate short data lengths for instance the performance of the weather research and forecasting wrf regional convection permitting climate model is assessed regarding daily precipitation in the united states by beck et al 2019 3 9 future research future research may consist in the implementation of the grid scale temporal downscaling approach under pooled frequency analysis for a more accurate estimation of rainfall intensity quantiles for longer return periods e g requena et al 2019a the use of the scale invariance gev pwm model allows dealing with the pooled approach since the scaling method is based on pwms that are linked to l moments which are commonly used in parameter estimation for regional frequency analysis e g hosking and wallis 1997 under the pooled approach it would be necessary to interpolate l moment ratios at ungauged grids and to use bias correction series available at both gauged and ungauged grids by using gridded products instead of bias corrected 24 h gridded annual maximum series 4 conclusions sub daily rcm based gridded rainfall intensity quantiles are needed to provide more reliable gridded idfs under climate change since sub daily rainfall simulations are usually unavailable or may be unreliable due to limitations of rcms in representing convective storms for that purpose this study proposed a grid scale temporal downscaling approach based on the scale invariance gev pwm model that is applied to three case studies with a relatively high station density across canada piecewise simple scaling is supported from the analysis of point and gridded breaks indicating caution in using simple scaling when dealing with particular rainfall duration ranges in the study areas both gridams and pointams methods considered for estimating gridded scaling exponents adequately obtained sub daily rainfall intensity quantiles for rainfall durations greater than 1 h nevertheless the gridams method obtained better results for shorter rainfall durations supporting point to grid transfer at the annual maximum series stage which is used for estimating sub daily rcm based gridded quantiles bias of rcm annual maximum series needs to be corrected to obtain proper sub daily rcm based rainfall intensity quantiles while its effect on estimated relative changes is less marked limitations of the study are related to station and data availability in canada which affects the estimation of gridded annual maximum series that are considered as approximations to the true unknown series a potential shortcoming of the approach may lead to sub daily relative changes that are similar to daily relative changes note that a single rcm is used in the study because the focus is to assess the proposed approach and not to provide climate change results future research may implement pooled frequency analysis within the proposed approach for a more accurate estimation of rainfall intensity quantiles for longer return periods the proposed grid scale temporal downscaled approach may be applied to

8230,study region canada study focus intensity duration frequency curves need to be updated to account for the potential effect of climate change however sub daily regional climate model rcm simulations required for this purpose are commonly unavailable the scaling approach is often applied for temporal downscaling of point daily precipitation nevertheless difference in spatial scale between simulations and observations may complicate its application at the grid scale this study proposes a grid scale temporal downscaling approach for estimating sub daily gridded extreme rainfall intensity under climate change at regions with a relatively high station density the approach uses daily annual maximum rainfall intensity series from rcm simulations and grid scale scaling properties from observations the study evaluates two methods for estimating gridded scaling exponents needed in temporal downscaling the assessment is performed on observation based and rcm based temporally downscaled quantiles the effect of temporal downscaling and bias correction on sub daily quantiles and relative changes is also analysed the approach is applied to three case studies across canada new hydrological insights for the region piecewise simple scaling is found over the study domains indicating caution in using simple scaling the performance of the approach in estimating sub daily

taleghani 2013 requena et al 2019b shephard et al 2014 supports the need for updating idfs to account for the potential effect of climate change idf update under climate change is usually performed through the analysis of climate model simulations provided by global climate models gcms or regional climate models rcms e g willems et al 2012 simonovic et al 2016 climate models often simulate precipitation at a daily or less frequent time scale due to model limitations and computational cost e g nguyen and nguyen 2018 2020 the difficulty in assessing future changes in sub daily extreme precipitation due to the lack of sub daily climate model simulations or due to the uncertainty resulting from the ability of the models to generate them is underlined in the literature e g berg et al 2019 degaetano and castellano 2017 sunyer et al 2015 this may be the reason why many studies only provide future changes for rainfall durations that are greater than or equal to the temporal resolution of the climate model considered e g mailhot et al 2007 temperature simulations of climate models are usually more reliable than precipitation simulations in this regard several studies evaluated the clausius clapeyron c c scaling relationship according to which precipitation extremes increase at a rate of 7 per c finding out that the c c relationship presents limitations for given temperature ranges and humidity conditions and depends on rainfall duration e g drobinski et al 2018 herath et al 2016 2017 lenderink and meijgaard 2008 panthou et al 2014 wang et al 2017 however sub daily precipitation projections are needed for the estimation of future idf curves the analysis of sub daily precipitation is especially relevant since it may lead to larger urban floods sunyer et al 2015 and may be more affected by climate change than daily precipitation westra et al 2014 some studies used simple to complex empirical relationships such as empirical factors or various regression models and machine leaning techniques to obtain sub daily estimates from daily values for a given region examples are the adapted ratio formula used by switzman et al 2017 for ontario and the empirical adjustment factors used by degaetano and castellano 2017 for the state of new york gaur et al 2020 applied the support vector machine technique to establish links between different large scale simulated atmospheric variables and observed local extreme precipitation amounts of different sub daily rainfall durations nevertheless most of the studies accounting for sub daily precipitation rely on temporal downscaling temporal disaggregation to obtain sub daily estimates from daily precipitation e g hassanzadeh et al 2019 willems et al 2012 among temporal downscaling approaches scale

scale e g herath et al 2016 nguyen and nguyen 2020 nguyen et al 2007 simonovic et al 2016 vu et al 2017 that is prior to the application of temporal downscaling gridded climate model simulations are spatially downscaled to the station for obtaining point estimates nevertheless extreme rainfall intensity is usually required at the catchment scale in practice which agrees with the grid scale since both involve areal instead of point extreme rainfall intensity e g requena et al 2019b studies performed at the grid scale do not usually account for temporal downscaling e g ekstr√∂m et al 2005 mailhot et al 2012 mladjic et al 2011 or assume that scaling properties at the station scale are valid at the grid scale e g sunyer et al 2015 to fill that gap this study proposes an approach for temporal downscaling at the grid scale to estimate sub daily gridded extreme rainfall intensity under climate change using daily rcm simulations and grid scale scaling properties derived from observations this avoids the need of spatially downscaling to the station scale to perform the temporal downscaling for later upscaling to the catchment grid scale to obtain sub daily areal gridded rainfall intensity quantiles the temporal downscaling approach adapted to the grid scale is the scale invariance gev pwm model the model showed a better performance when compared with other scaling models in ontario canada nguyen and nguyen 2018 and is applied for estimating extreme rainfall under climate change at gauged and ungauged locations in that area nguyen and nguyen 2020 nguyen et al 2018 another advantage of the scaling model is that it only requires the distribution of annual maximum rainfall intensity series and does not require the use of complete time series that are commonly unavailable for short rainfall durations the same scaling properties are commonly assumed for baseline and future periods in temporal downscaling e g herath et al 2016 studies based on this assumption either did not specifically assess the performance of temporally downscaled rainfall quantiles estimated from daily climate model simulations for a future period e g herath et al 2016 nguyen et al 2007 or divided observed records into calibration and validation period to assess their performance over time e g nguyen and nguyen 2020 nguyen et al 2018 in this study hourly temporally downscaled rainfall intensity quantiles estimated from daily rcm simulations are compared with those obtained from available hourly simulations for current and future periods for a particular rcm this allows for a direct assessment of the performance of the approach under climate change nevertheless such a comparison is performed with caution since rcms may present limitations in the representation of convective storms which may affect sub daily simulations e g berg et al 2019 the use of grid scale scaling properties from observations for estimating temporally downscaled rcm based quantiles may require applying bias correction the widespread quantile mapping bias correction method applied to rcm annual maximum series is used for that purpose e g li et al 2017 the effect of temporal downscaling and bias correction on sub daily quantile and relative change estimation is also assessed in this study the proposed grid scale temporal downscaling approach is aimed at regions that present a relatively high station density and is evaluated on three case studies across canada this allows assessing the performance of the scale invariance gev pwm model at different locations across canada since it was applied to a case study in ontario at the station scale when initially proposed daily and hourly rcm simulations from the canrcm4 canesm2 climate model belonging to the north american coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment na cordex are used for illustrating the analysis therefore the objective of the study is to propose a grid scale temporal downscaling approach for estimating sub daily gridded extreme rainfall intensities under climate change based on the scale invariance gev pwm model the approach involves the assessment of two methods for estimating gridded scaling exponents needed in temporal downscaling and the assessment of the effect of bias correction on temporally downscaled rcm based quantiles and relative changes the study is organised as follows materials and methods are shown in sect 2 where background methodology and case study and data are included results and discussion are provided in sect 3 and conclusions are presented in sect 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 background 2 1 1 scale invariance gev pwm model the scale invariance gev pwm model is the temporal downscaling approach used for adaptation to the grid scale in this study and refers to the scaling gev model based on pwms proposed by nguyen and nguyen 2018 the method is based on the scaling concept that allows modelling extreme rainfall over time scales e g from several minutes to a day under the assumption that statistical properties over time scales are related through scale ratios and scaling exponents e g see eq 1 the scale invariance gev pwm model is an appropriate temporal downscaling approach for dealing with rainfall frequency analysis this is due to the good performance of the gev distribution when used in rainfall frequency analysis e g johnson and green 2018 nguyen et al 2017 requena et al 2019a and to the benefits of using l moments that are linear combinations of pwms for parameter estimation e g see hosking and wallis 1997 for details for a simple scaling regime the scale invariance gev pwm model implies constant scaling exponents over pwms as seen through eq 1 1 Œ≤ r Œª t Œª s Œ≤ r t where Œ≤ r is the pwm of order r see hosking and wallis 1997 for details t refers to the reference time scale e g t 24 h Œª is the scale ratio linking two time scales e g Œª 1 24 if linking 1 h and t 24 h and s is the scaling exponent this results in horizontal lines in the often displayed plot of scaling exponents in respect of pwms e g yu et al 2004 simple scaling also allows relating parameters and quantiles over two time scales as indicated in eq 2 2 g Œª t Œª s g t Œ∫ Œª t Œ∫ t where g represent the location parameter scale parameter or quantile associated with a return period t of the gev distribution and Œ∫ is the shape parameter of the gev distribution hence eqs 1 and 2 allow obtaining statistical properties for sub daily extreme rainfall such as l moments parameters and quantiles from commonly available daily annual maximum series short and long rainfall durations may be governed by different mechanisms and hence present different scaling behaviours e g nguyen et al 2007 studies from the literature revealed that extreme rainfall ranging from minutes to days may be approximated by one or two different scaling regime s e g bairwa et al 2016 nguyen et al 1998 if the log log plot of the pwms of rainfall intensities or amounts versus rainfall durations does not present a breaking point break the existence of a single scaling regime for all extreme rainfalls over the selected time scales may be concluded in such a case the relationship between statistical moments and durations in the log log space may be characterized using a straight line for each order moment on the other hand the presence of a break indicates the existence of two different scaling regimes for the two groups of extreme rainfall separated by the break i e multi scaling which may be treated as piecewise simple scaling e g yu et al 2004 this leads to the estimation of two scaling exponents a scaling exponent for characterising the scaling regime of rainfall durations at and before the break and another scaling exponent for characterising the scaling regime of rainfall durations at and after the break in this case the relationship between rainfall statistical moments and durations in the log log space may be characterized using two different straight lines for each order moment therefore the presence of a break leads to the estimation of different scaling exponents for different scaling regimes based on this pwms and distributions of sub daily extreme rainfalls may be derived from those of daily data similarly pwms and distributions of sub hourly extreme rainfall may be derived from those of estimated sub daily data estimated pwms are later used for obtaining l moments gev parameters and finally t year rainfall intensity quantiles nevertheless the identification of a break is not a trivial task a numerical criterion is used in this study for objectively identifying the presence of a break nguyen and nguyen 2018 and consists of minimizing residuals of linear regression models fitted to the log log plot of pwms versus rainfall durations over durations associated with each scaling regime this is done by accounting for the first three order moments since they are needed in the estimation of gev parameters 2 1 2 quantile mapping bias correction method quantile mapping is the method used for bias correction of annual maximum series extracted from rcm simulations in this study the use of the method for bias correction of simulations associated with a baseline period is widespread e g ganguli and coulibaly 2019 li et al 2017 vu et al 2017 while different approaches may be applied when considering a future period a modified version named equidistance quantile matching is used for bias correction of simulations associated with a future period in several studies e g ganguli and coulibaly 2019 srivastav et al 2014 vu et al 2017 in this regard li et al 2017 indicated that while quantile mapping assumes that differences in rainfall magnitude between baseline simulations and observations are also valid in the future for a given magnitude equidistance quantile matching assumes this for a given percentile they argued that the latter assumption lacks physical meaning regarding the origin of bias and may lead to issues in the application of bias correction for future periods for simplicity quantile mapping is used for bias correction of rcm simulations for baseline and future periods in this study 3 x b f o 1 f b x b x f x f c f x f f o 1 f b x f f b 1 f b x f f o 1 f b x f where x b and x f are the rcm based gridded annual maximum rainfall intensity series for baseline and future period respectively and x b and x f are their associated bias corrected series c f is the correction factor f b represents the cumulative distribution function of rcm based gridded annual maximum rainfall intensity series for the baseline period f b 1 is the inverse of f b and f o 1 is the inverse of the cumulative distribution function of observation based gridded annual maximum rainfall intensity series quantile mapping may be considered as non parametric or parametric depending on whether an empirical distribution function or a given parametric distribution function is used for bias correction limited impact of this choice is found for the greater sydney region in australia li et al 2017 and for ontario in canada fig 3 in ganguli and coulibaly 2019 this study uses non parametric quantile mapping to avoid committing to a particular distribution possible larger quantiles associated with a future period are bias corrected using the correction factor associated with the largest quantile for the baseline period gudmundsson 2016 gudmundsson et al 2012 2 2 methodology the proposed approach for grid scale temporal downscaling based on the scale invariance gev pwm model consists of four steps fig 1 i estimation of gridded breaks and scaling exponents from observations ii estimation and assessment of temporally downscaled observation based gridded rainfall intensity quantiles iii bias correction of rcm annual maximum series and iv estimation and assessment of temporally downscaled rcm based gridded rainfall intensity quantiles 2 2 1 estimation of gridded breaks and scaling exponents from observations daily and sub daily annual maximum rainfall intensity records are necessary to estimate breaks and scaling exponents needed for the application of the scale invariance gev pwm model observed rainfall series are commonly available at rainfall gauge stations i e at the point scale therefore the estimation of gridded breaks and scaling exponents involves point to grid transfer which is more reliable for a higher density rainfall gauge network two methods are considered in this study to estimate gridded breaks and scaling exponents for performing temporal downscaling at the grid scale see part i in fig 1 the first method consists in estimating gridded annual maximum rainfall intensity series from point rainfall intensity to directly obtain gridded breaks and scaling exponents the method is referred to as gridams method the second method consists in firstly estimating point breaks and scaling exponents from point rainfall intensity to later obtain associated gridded exponents as estimates over a grid the method is referred to as pointams method comparison between the methods will provide insight into the effect of performing the point to grid transfer at the annual maximum series stage gridams method or at the scaling exponent stage pointams method the gridams method involves identifying stations within each grid for each duration since some stations may lack records for a particular duration for a given duration the average annual maximum rainfall intensity for stations within a grid is estimated for each year these gridded annual maximum series are then directly used for obtaining gridded breaks and scaling exponents the pointams method requires estimating point breaks and scaling exponents for each station using the annual maximum rainfall intensity series for all available durations nevertheless transferring point breaks and scaling exponents to the grid scale is not straightforward the identification of breaks is conditioned to the specific rainfall durations available e g 5 min 10 min 15 min 30 min 1 h 2 h 6 h 12 h and 24 h that usually present different time intervals between each other which complicates averaging point breaks to obtain gridded breaks furthermore the transfer from point to grid scale must keep the coherence between breaks and scaling exponents since they are linked to deal with these issues gridded breaks estimated by the gridams method are also used as gridded breaks in the pointams method and estimated point scaling exponents are adjusted so that they are associated with the value of the gridded break at the grid where they are located the adjusted estimates of the point scaling exponents are then averaged over stations within a grid to obtain corresponding gridded scaling exponents note that under an ideal dataset with a large number of rainfall durations and no missing data it would be expected that both methods would obtain similar results making it reasonable to assume similar gridded breaks the approach of estimating gridded values as average of point estimates over a grid is used in several studies e g hofstra et al 2010 tian et al 2018 visessri and mcintyre 2012 2 2 2 estimation and assessment of temporally downscaled observation based gridded rainfall intensity quantiles gridded breaks and scaling exponents obtained from the two aforementioned methods are used for estimating sub daily gridded quantiles through the scale invariance gev pwm model these temporally downscaled quantiles are compared with corresponding sub daily quantiles directly estimated from gridded annual maximum series for t 2 5 10 and 25 years see part ii in fig 1 longer return periods are not considered due to the use of a local approach for quantile estimation for which a long record length which is not usually available in practice would be necessary for accurate estimation the performance of the methods is evaluated by two error measures the relative root mean square error rrmse and relative bias rbias the rrmse represents the average accuracy of the method whereas the rbias represents its average under or over estimation the performance of a method is better as these error measures are closer to zero for a given rainfall duration and return period they are computed as follows 4 r r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i t x i t x i t 2 5 r b i a s 1 n i 1 n y i t x i t x i t where x i t represents the t year gridded rainfall intensity quantile at grid i y i t represents the temporally downscaled t year gridded rainfall intensity quantile at grid i and n is the number of studied grids 2 2 3 bias correction of rcm annual maximum series the application of grid scale temporal downscaling for estimating sub daily rcm based gridded rainfall intensity quantiles using gridded breaks and scaling exponents derived from observations may require bias correction of the daily rcm annual maximum series used as input see part iii in fig 1 bias correction should be performed using observations with a similar temporal and spatial resolution to that of the rcm maraun 2013 bias correction of rcm annual maximum series for baseline and future periods is performed by quantile mapping see sect 2 1 2 using estimated observation based gridded annual maximum series 2 2 4 estimation and assessment of temporally downscaled rcm based gridded rainfall intensity quantiles gridded breaks and scaling exponents associated with the method obtaining the best performance i e from either the gridams or the pointams method are used for estimating temporally downscaled rcm based gridded rainfall intensity quantiles from daily rcm annual maximum series the assessment of these quantiles is analogous to that performed on observations but focussed on hourly rainfall durations this validation is possible due to the use of a rcm providing both daily and hourly simulations hourly temporally downscaled quantiles obtained from daily rcm annual maximum series are compared with corresponding hourly quantiles directly estimated from hourly rcm annual maximum series for t 2 5 10 and 25 years see part iv in fig 1 this is performed by considering either bias corrected or non bias corrected rcm annual maximum series for baseline and future periods the performance of the temporally downscaled quantiles is assessed by computing the rrmse and rbias in an analogous way to when assessing observation based quantiles by eqs 4 and 5 error measure results obtained with and without considering bias correction are compared for assessing the effect of bias correction on the performance of the grid scale temporal downscaling approach the effect of bias correction and temporal downscaling on relative change estimation is also assessed for a given rainfall duration and return period the relative change c r expressed in is estimated as 6 c r x f t x b t x b t 100 x f t x b t 1 100 where x b t and x f t are the t year rcm based gridded rainfall intensity quantiles for baseline and future period respectively 2 3 case study and data 2 3 1 observed data and case studies selection the proposed grid scale temporal downscaling approach is applied to canada observed annual maximum rainfall depth series for nine rainfall durations 5 min 10 min 15 min 30 min 1 h 2 h 6 h 12 h and 24 h are available for 565 idf stations across the country environment and climate change canada eccc 2014 following the screening of the data performed in requena et al 2019a annual maximum series for rainfall durations with less than 10 years of records identified as nonstationary for short or long durations or associated with stations located north of 65 latitude are removed from the database this results in a set of 556 idf stations recently eccc released a new idf dataset version with updated records and additional stations however this study is not focused on the use of the most updated dataset but on the use of a valid dataset that allows assessing the proposed approach due to available records for daily and sub daily rainfall consisting of annual maxima in canada i e time series are not usually available for short durations gridded annual maximum series are estimated using these values all available records are considered in the analysis for a fair comparison between the gridams and pointams methods see discussion in sect 3 4 the selection of case studies across the country allows for a more general assessment of the approach since location may affect scaling innocenti et al 2017 particular case studies are selected based on station density within grids for that purpose 0 5 50 km latitude longitude grids over canada are classified according to the number of idf stations within a grid and the grid where the closest station to a capital city is located referred to as target grid is marked to identify potential case studies across the country fig 2 shows the classification obtained using the 554 idf stations with records for the 24 h rainfall duration among the 556 station dataset the maximum number of stations per grid is 16 stations stations falling on a border of a grid are assigned to the grid to the right below hijmans 2017 avoiding using them twice case studies are identified as those with the largest number of stations per grid being close to a target grid they are named after the corresponding province british columbia bc ontario on and quebec qc are the selected case studies fig 2 the highest station density across canada is located in the southern parts of these provinces the target grid in on has 16 stations the target grid in qc has nine stations and a nearby grid to the target grid in bc presents 13 stations the study domain for each case study consists of the rectangular domain that includes the grids forming the pooling group of the target grid for 24 h rainfall duration and t 100 years which corresponds with the largest pooling group considered in requena et al 2019b the rectangular domain of bc is formed by 32 i e 8 4 0 5 grids and consists of 53 stations nineteen of the grids are gauged and nine of them have one station the rectangular domains of on and qc are formed by 25 i e 5 5 0 5 grids 14 of the grids in on are gauged and three of them have one station while 19 of the grids in qc are gauged and 10 of them have one station on consists of 53 stations and qc of 38 stations the analysis is performed on all gauged grids and results for selected grids where gridded estimations may be considered as more reliable are further highlighted in this line grids with a relevant station density are selected for evaluation in hofstra et al 2010 and visessri and mcintyre 2012 the former study selected five grids with a high station density of five to 11 stations for a 0 22 resolution and seven to 19 stations for a 0 44 resolution across europe the latter study selected five grids with three to five stations for a 0 25 resolution across northwest thailand in this study the minimum number of stations per grid recommended for estimating gridded values on a 0 5 50 km grid is relaxed from four e g see requena et al 2019b to three to be able to select at least two grids in qc and additional criteria are considered for grid selection the criteria are include between three and 16 stations present a data length of at least 32 years for a given duration and have a percentage of years with data for at least two stations that is greater than 47 either considering all durations or durations shorter than 1 h this leads to the selection of four grids for bc and qc and five grids for on e g see grids with black borders in fig 3 b 2 3 2 regional climate model simulations na cordex provides simulations for a number of rcms driven by gcms for north america https na cordex org among the available na cordex rcm gcm combinations at the common 0 5 latitude longitude grid mearns et al 2017 used in requena et al 2019b for estimating gridded relative changes in 24 h extreme rainfall intensity in canada canrcm4 canesm2 is selected in this study due to the availability of both hourly and daily precipitation series this allows validating the grid scale temporal downscaling approach for obtaining sub daily rcm based gridded rainfall intensity quantiles the baseline period 1971 2000 and future period 2071 2100 horizon 2080 for the rcp 8 5 scenario e g charron 2014 are used for illustrating the analysis a total of four canrcm4 canesm2 simulations are used daily precipitation for baseline period daily precipitation for future period hourly precipitation for baseline period and hourly precipitation for future period daily precipitation simulations are provided at the common reference grid by na cordex however hourly precipitation series are only provided at the native rotated pole grid due to computational issues and to the large volume of data that implies their interpolation to the common grid for consistency canrcm4 canesm2 hourly precipitation series at the 0 44 native rotated pole are regridded to the common 0 5 latitude longitude grid following the same approach that na cordex used for regridding daily series the regridding is performed through the earth system modeling framework esmf software with the patch recovery method available in the national center for atmospheric research command language ncl ncl 2019 the use of a 0 5 grid resolution in this study is supported by diaconescu et al 2016 where canrcm4 at the native 0 4 rotated pole grid obtained better performance for extreme precipitation indices than at higher resolutions and by hofstra et al 2010 where coarser 0 44 instead of 0 22 resolutions are recommended when dealing with observation based gridded estimates in areas where a high station density is not available note that this study does not intend to provide future idfs or relative changes under climate change for which an ensemble of rcms would be necessary but to assess the proposed grid scale temporal downscaling approach using a rcm that allows for such an assessment hereafter canrcm4 canesm2 is referred to as rcm since only one rcm is used in this study the extraction of annual maximum rainfall series from daily rcm precipitation simulations for the grids in the study domains is performed according to the rainfall period categories identified in requena et al 2019b fig 1a three rainfall period categories were identified based on dates of hourly rainfall intensity records and division of the country into ecoprovinces january to december march to december and april to november annual maximum rainfall series at a grid are extracted from daily rcm precipitation using the months associated with the rainfall period category associated with the grid this is done for the four rcm simulations rcm annual maximum rainfall series are assumed to be stationary based on results from requena et al 2019b since idf estimation in canada involves dealing with 24 h instead of daily rainfall intensity daily annual maximum rainfall intensity series are converted to 24 h annual maximum rainfall intensity series by multiplying by the factor 1 13 world meteorological organization wmo 2009 requena et al 2019b 3 results and discussion the proposed approach is applied to the three case studies in canada for grid scale temporal downscaling of rainfall intensity from 5 min up to 24 h 3 1 breaks and scaling exponents most point and gridded breaks are within the range 30 min 2 h for bc 30 min 1 h for on and 15 min 1 h for qc see boxes of boxplots in fig 3a the point break range over the study domain is wider than the gridded break range fig 3 note that simple scaling could be used at the few stations and grids where breaks are close to duration range limits i e 10 min or 12 h the narrower break range for on indicates a more similar partition of scaling regimes between shorter and longer durations over the study domain which is also supported by less spatial variability at the grid scale compared to the two other case studies fig 3b the largest spatial variability of the gridded break is found for bc which is consistent with more complex rainfall processes due to topography and proximity to the pacific ocean gridded breaks obtained for selected grids support these findings see gray circles in fig 3a and marked grids in fig 3b these results indicate that simple scaling i e the same scaling regime for all durations should be applied with care when dealing with particular rainfall duration ranges in the study domains the scaling exponents range is 0 87 0 21 with most values between 0 80 and 0 35 see boxes of boxplots in fig 4 ranges in that order of magnitude are obtained in the literature 0 77 0 25 yu et al 2004 and 0 89 0 43 ghanmi et al 2016 for piecewise scaling and 0 95 0 35 innocenti et al 2017 for simple scaling the most similar scaling exponents range between all grids and selected grids gray circles in fig 4 is found for on which indicates that selected grids in on are more representative of the scaling behaviour in their study domain the scaling exponents range is similar for on and qc 0 87 0 38 and 0 80 0 41 respectively and presents lower absolute values for bc with a range of 0 66 0 21 fig 4 this agrees with lower absolute values of a simple scaling exponent for bc regarding qc and on found for 1 h to 24 h rainfall by innocenti et al 2017 figs 5b and 6 b in turn the difference between the two scaling exponents is more marked for on and qc with s 2 having greater absolute values than s 1 the opposite is found for bc note that s 2 is the scaling exponent for the scaling regime that considers longer durations i e from 24 h rainfall duration to the break while s 1 is the scaling exponent for the scaling regime that considers shorter durations i e from the break to the 5 min rainfall duration a lower absolute value of a scaling exponent indicates less statistical difference between shorter and longer duration extreme events considered under the given scaling regime due to being associated with more similar rainfall processes therefore results in fig 4 supported a more marked piecewise simple scaling with greater differences among longer duration events than among shorter duration events for on and qc i e s 2 is much greater than s 1 and a less marked piecewise simple scaling with slightly greater differences among shorter duration events than among longer duration events in bc i e s 1 is slightly greater than s 2 scaling exponents for selected grids support these findings greater absolute values of s 2 compared to s 1 such as in on and qc are also found by yu et al 2004 in northern taiwan and by ghanmi et al 2016 for all analysed stations but one in northern tunis that station was a high elevation site underlining the relevance of topography on scaling as in the case of bc the effect of topography and proximity to the ocean on weaker simple scaling over the north american west coast is reported in innocenti et al 2017 a lower absolute simple scaling exponent results in a more moderate decrease in maximum rainfall intensity with duration at high elevations in france blanchet et al 2016 lower absolute values of a simple scaling exponent are also found closer to the ocean in senegal sane et al 2018 3 2 comparison and performance of the gridams and pointams methods in general gridded scaling exponents obtained by the gridams and pointams methods are in the same order of magnitude for each case study fig 4 the most similar values between methods are found for qc fig 4c the point scaling exponent range covered the associated gridded scaling exponent range except for two outliers that belonged to s 1 obtained by the gridams method in bc fig 4a and to s 1 obtained by the pointams method in on fig 4b the former outlier is related to a grid where short duration annual maximum series are only available at one of two stations presenting different ranges and a common study period which resulted in a very low absolute value of the scaling exponent s 1 due to unbalanced gridded annual maximum series the latter outlier is related to a grid where several stations did not present data for short durations leading in this case to large values of the adjusted point s 1 this is associated with averaging the scaling exponent s 1 at the grid from adjusted values at stations with and without short duration data both gridams and pointams methods are hence affected by station and rainfall duration data availability maps of gridded scaling exponents obtained by the two methods and associated absolute differences are shown in fig 5 for on and in figs a1 and a2 for bc and qc in supplementary materials point scaling exponents are also displayed for illustration the largest spatial variability of scaling exponents is found for bc which agrees with the largest spatial variability of its gridded break fig 3 in general the scaling exponent s 1 presented less spatial variability than s 2 for the three case studies which indicates spatially closer scaling behaviour for shorter durations this agrees with innocenti et al 2017 who suggested that local precipitation processes may be similar across regions based on studies obtaining less spatial variability of the scaling exponent for short durations absolute differences between gridded scaling exponents obtained from the gridams and pointams methods are in general small the smallest differences are found for qc followed by on and then bc this may be partly affected by the fact that the same gridded scaling exponent is estimated by both methods at grids with one station three grids in bc and two grids in on presented absolute differences greater than 0 02 for either s 1 or s 2 some of them belonged to the set of selected grids and presented absolute differences up to 0 055 supporting differences between methods note that missing annual maxima may contribute to differences between methods for grids with at least two stations the performance of the gridams and pointams methods is assessed by comparing temporally downscaled gridded quantiles with corresponding observation based gridded quantiles for each case study for 2 5 10 and 25 year return periods rrmse and rbias are overall low and hence suitable reaching values up to 0 32 and 0 12 respectively fig 6 the lowest rrmse and rbias are found for qc followed by on and then bc larger values for bc are influenced by errors associated with the aforementioned outlier indeed the rrmse considering selected grids is much lower than the rrmse for all grids for bc and presented fewer differences to that of selected grids for the three case studies see fig a3 in supplementary materials the least difference between rrmse for all grids and for selected grids is found for on which supported the statement of selected grids being more representative of the study domain for this case study in general the gridams method performed better than the pointams method especially for shorter durations fig 6 while closer results are obtained for durations longer than 1 h the least differences are found for qc and the greatest for bc better performance for the gridams method than for the pointams method is also supported by results for selected grids for the three case studies fig a3 in general temporally downscaled quantiles estimated by the gridams method presented slight underestimation since rbias values were mostly negative for the three cases studies fig 6 some overestimation is seen for some short durations in bc fig 6a temporally downscaled quantiles estimated by the pointams method were also generally slightly underestimated with overestimation for short durations in bc fig 6a and to a lesser extent in on fig 6b rbias performance between all grids and selected grids depended on the case study fig a3 log scale q q plots for the gridams fig 7 a and pointams fig 7b method displayed an overall agreement between temporally downscaled and observation based gridded quantiles values further from the diagonal in bc are associated with the aforementioned outlier slight overestimation for selected grids represented as circles associated with some short durations for the pointams method are seen in agreement with positive rbias shown for the method see fig a3 the overall better performance of the gridams method could be partially attributed to the use of the 24 h gridded annual maximum series needed for estimating temporally downscaled quantiles through both methods when estimating scaling exponents see part i in fig 1 however the difference in performance between methods depended on the case study and on the rainfall duration range either method could be applied in qc whereas the gridams method is preferable when dealing with shorter durations in on and bc this indicates that point to grid transfer is preferable to be performed at the annual maximum series stage 3 3 assessment of hourly rcm based gridded quantiles and relative changes the gridams method is therefore used for further assessment of the grid scale temporal downscaling method in estimating sub daily rcm based gridded quantiles prior to the formal assessment observation based gridded quantiles and temporally downscaled rcm based gridded quantiles obtained from bias corrected 24 h rcm annual maximum series for the baseline period are analysed for all durations obtaining results in line with those for temporally downscaled observation based quantiles in fig 7a hourly rcm based gridded quantiles estimated using temporal downscaling i e through 24 h rcm annual maximum series and available hourly rcm annual maximum series are compared for baseline and future periods rrmse and rbias fig 8 are close to zero for 1 h temporally downscaled rcm based gridded quantiles for the baseline period when accounting for bias correction case 1 h b indicating a good agreement with 1 h rcm based gridded quantiles for the three case studies rrmse up to 0 46 and rbias as large as 0 44 are obtained for the corresponding future period case 1 h f in bc while rrmse up to 0 35 and rbias as large as 0 15 are obtained in qc and rrmse up to 0 21 and rbias as large as 0 1 are obtained in on note that results for cases considering bias correction i e 1 h b and 1 h f may differ if using a different bias correction method rrmse and rbias much greater than 0 5 are obtained for all case studies when not accounting for bias correction cases 1 h b and 1 h f indicating relevant overestimation of temporally downscaled rcm based quantiles this underlines the need of bias correcting rcm annual maximum series when scaling exponents obtained from observations are used in estimating temporally downscaled rcm based quantiles disagreement between 1 h temporally downscaled rcm based quantiles and 1 h rcm based quantiles which are directly obtained from hourly rcm annual maximum series may also be partially due to the reliability of the latter and to the way in which gridded annual maximum series are estimated in this study see discussion in sect 3 4 as mentioned in the introduction rcms may present issues in representing convective storms berg et al 2019 found underestimation of rcm based rainfall quantiles compared with those from observations for hourly rainfall in europe when analysing cordex rcms with a higher spatial resolution of 0 11 underestimation of 1 h gridded quantiles directly obtained from non bias corrected 1 h rcm annual maximum series is also found when compared with observation based gridded quantiles in this study not shown such underestimation agrees with positive rbias for 1 h temporally downscaled rcm based gridded quantiles when bias correction is not considered cases 1 h b and 1 h f in fig 8 the effect of temporal downscaling and bias correction on relative changes is assessed through fig 9 results indicated that 1 h relative changes from temporally downscaled rcm based gridded quantiles are similar to 24 h relative changes from rcm based gridded quantiles either considering bias correction not shown or not fig 9a in the literature greater relative changes are often associated with hourly rainfall than with daily rainfall e g delta change method in sunyer et al 2015 westra et al 2014 which is also supported when comparing 1 h and 24 h relative changes from rcm based quantiles without bias correction in this study fig 9b therefore the use of scale invariance temporal downscaling for estimating sub daily rcm quantiles may have an effect on sub daily relative changes hourly relative changes from temporally downscaled rcm based quantiles obtained by considering or not bias corrected rcm annual maximum series c r and c r respectively presented some agreement for the three case studies fig 9c with overall values around the diagonal with some exceptions e g for short return periods in bc therefore the use of bias correction may be considered as less relevant for the estimation of sub daily relative changes than for the estimation of sub daily quantiles in general relative changes for selected grids supported these findings see circles in fig 9 the use of a different bias correction method may affect results in fig 9c and discussion associated with fig 9a since bias correction affects quantile estimation for baseline and especially for future period 3 4 limitations of the study a limitation of the application of the proposed grid scale approach is related to the lack of a high density station network in canada this may affect the estimation of average annual maximum rainfall intensity series from stations within a grid more reliable gridded annual maximum series would generally be associated with a higher station density and longer common record length among stations within a grid in this study all available records are used for allowing a fair comparison between the gridams and pointams methods and results for selected grids where more reliable gridded estimates are expected are underlined and further discussed in practice techniques for filling missing data at the station level could be used for obtaining more coherent annual maximum series at the grid scale the estimation of gridded precipitation from observations by averaging them over a grid is the ideal method for obtaining gridded estimates when station density allows it fowler et al 2005 associated gridded annual maximum rainfall intensity series should ideally be obtained from time series instead of from associated annual maximum series at the stations however the lack of sub daily time series in canada prevents using that approach i e only annual maxima records are commonly available at the sub daily time scale therefore observation based gridded annual maximum series estimated in this study may be considered as an approximation of the true unknown values at the grids such an estimation should not affect the overall performance of the grid scale temporal downscaling approach on observations since the approach relies on the data given as input however it may lead to a worse performance when assessing it on rcms 3 5 alternative gridded data for bias correction available daily gridded products e g see wong et al 2017 could be considered for bias correction of daily rcm simulations where a relatively dense station network exists nevertheless observation based gridded annual maximum series estimated in this study are used due to the need of bias correcting not only 24 h but also 1 h rcm annual maximum series for assessing the performance of the grid scale temporal downscaling approach in the near future na cordex will provide bias corrected daily rcm simulations for canada using a multivariate quantile mapping algorithm cannon 2018 in principle those gridded bias corrected series will only be available at the daily time scale 3 6 grid scale approach several studies based on simple scaling for estimating current idfs interpolated point estimates of scaling exponents to a high resolution 0 1 or 1 km grid e g blanchet et al 2016 ghanmi et al 2016 grid estimates may be comparable to point estimates in that case on a different approach visessri and mcintyre 2012 interpolated point rainfall to a 0 05 5 km grid using a method based on inverse distance weighting and then averaged those estimates over a 0 25 25 km grid to obtain proper grid scale values for their assessment regarding observation based average rainfall estimates over a 0 25 grid fine 0 1 10 km grids from interpolation are also averaged over coarser 25 and 50 km grids in haylock et al 2008 the two aforementioned studies supported a grid scale approach based on average estimation over a grid as in this study that notion allows for a proper assessment of the proposed grid scale approach and for a robust evaluation of the two methods considered for estimating gridded scaling exponents since study domain does not affect results due to no information transfer from stations in different grids berg et al 2019 estimated areal and time reduction factors for assessing gridded simulations regarding point observations in europe nevertheless areal reduction factors used for converting point rainfall intensity to areal rainfall intensity may be affected by region rainfall duration and return period deneale et al 2018 as well as by climate change li et al 2015 3 7 limitations on sub daily rcm based quantiles the proposed grid scale temporal downscaling approach is assessed through three case studies across canada using daily and hourly simulations available for a given na cordex rcm the proposed approach may be applied to other rcms and case studies with a relatively high station density temporally downscaled hourly relative changes are similar to 24 h relative changes obtained from 24 h rcm based quantiles whereas they differ from hourly relative changes obtained from 1 h rcm based quantiles that underestimated observations and may not be considered as true values observation based gridded annual maximum series in this study are also approximations therefore results regarding the effect of temporal downscaling on hourly relative changes should be taken with care 3 8 contributions of the proposed approach the proposed grid scale temporal downscaling approach may be considered as an alternative for obtaining sub daily rcm based gridded quantiles for idf update under climate change until high resolution convection permitting rcms may contribute to a more precise estimation of future changes in sub daily extreme precipitation westra et al 2014 convection permitting climate models may adequately represent convection under a resolution of around 4 km which makes them computationally very demanding and hence usually only able to generate short data lengths for instance the performance of the weather research and forecasting wrf regional convection permitting climate model is assessed regarding daily precipitation in the united states by beck et al 2019 3 9 future research future research may consist in the implementation of the grid scale temporal downscaling approach under pooled frequency analysis for a more accurate estimation of rainfall intensity quantiles for longer return periods e g requena et al 2019a the use of the scale invariance gev pwm model allows dealing with the pooled approach since the scaling method is based on pwms that are linked to l moments which are commonly used in parameter estimation for regional frequency analysis e g hosking and wallis 1997 under the pooled approach it would be necessary to interpolate l moment ratios at ungauged grids and to use bias correction series available at both gauged and ungauged grids by using gridded products instead of bias corrected 24 h gridded annual maximum series 4 conclusions sub daily rcm based gridded rainfall intensity quantiles are needed to provide more reliable gridded idfs under climate change since sub daily rainfall simulations are usually unavailable or may be unreliable due to limitations of rcms in representing convective storms for that purpose this study proposed a grid scale temporal downscaling approach based on the scale invariance gev pwm model that is applied to three case studies with a relatively high station density across canada piecewise simple scaling is supported from the analysis of point and gridded breaks indicating caution in using simple scaling when dealing with particular rainfall duration ranges in the study areas both gridams and pointams methods considered for estimating gridded scaling exponents adequately obtained sub daily rainfall intensity quantiles for rainfall durations greater than 1 h nevertheless the gridams method obtained better results for shorter rainfall durations supporting point to grid transfer at the annual maximum series stage which is used for estimating sub daily rcm based gridded quantiles bias of rcm annual maximum series needs to be corrected to obtain proper sub daily rcm based rainfall intensity quantiles while its effect on estimated relative changes is less marked limitations of the study are related to station and data availability in canada which affects the estimation of gridded annual maximum series that are considered as approximations to the true unknown series a potential shortcoming of the approach may lead to sub daily relative changes that are similar to daily relative changes note that a single rcm is used in the study because the focus is to assess the proposed approach and not to provide climate change results future research may implement pooled frequency analysis within the proposed approach for a more accurate estimation of rainfall intensity quantiles for longer return periods the proposed grid scale temporal downscaled approach may be applied to obtain sub daily quantiles from daily rcm annual maximum series for regions in other countries where a relatively high station density is available declaration of competing interest the authors

goodrich et al 2004 seasonal water contributions from snowmelt runoff usepa 2015 and the physical conditions of the streambed and aquifer for example where the depth to groundwater is large the river can become disconnected from groundwater producing an unsaturated zone beneath the streambed which controls the rate of streambed infiltration brunner et al 2009 2011 shanafield et al 2012a it is possible to make direct estimates of recharge using groundwater mounding as measured in monitoring wells e g goodrich et al 2004 and by groundwater dating e g bethke and johnson 2008 however these

measurements e g sorman and abdulrazzak 1993 or streambed infiltration besbes et al 1978 subyani 2004 gooseff and mcglynn 2005 have been used as proxies for recharge although these surficial

extensive data collection has been possible e g niswonger et al 2008 wang et al 2017 some of these models take advantage of the unsaturated properties of intermittent rivers during the onset of streamflow to estimate spatial variability in infiltration assuming streambed hydraulic conductivity is the primary control e g noorduijn et al 2014 shanafield et al 2012b hypothetical intermittent stream hydrologic models have also been used to further explore the sensitivity of recharge processes to potential input parameters reid and dreiss 1990 regardless of whether groundwater recharge is estimated through field observations or modeling studies of groundwater recharge from streambed infiltration typically either assume that the system is homogeneous or that the volume of flow is the main control on recharge here we use field hydrologic data and drone aeromagnetic data to develop place based conceptual and numerical models of surface water groundwater connectivity to explore how subsurface geology controls the location and magnitude of aquifer recharge this work builds off of previous research such as brunner et al 2009 who numerically explored how groundwater and surface water interact in disconnected systems here rather than exploring the physical controls on disconnection we assume our stream is connected but generally losing and look at the role of geology in controlling recharge from the stream to the subsurface geologic controls on groundwater recharge are not well studied e g carlier et al 2018 although it is thought that it may be a more important variable than topography on streamflow generation in some systems e g fenicia et al 2016 our work is motivated by the alamosa river in the san luis valley of south central colorado fig 1 a intermittent rivers like the alamosa are not just common in the san luis valley but are the dominant river type in the american southwest e g stromberg et al 2017 like most of these rivers the alamosa is key to livelihoods in the region and is therefore heavily managed and much of its flow is diverted for irrigation purposes understanding geologic controls on aquifer recharge in this region would be helpful to predicting water availability as well as how these systems will be affected given climate change both in terms of river and aquifer storage 2 site description the san luis valley is a basin covering an area of 5030 km2 with an average elevation of 2350 m emery et al 1969 the valley is bounded to the west by the san juan mountains and to the east by the sangre de cristo mountains fig 1a the san juan mountains are composed of volcanic flows tuffs and breccias whereas the sangre de cristo mountains are made up of igneous metamorphic and sedimentary rocks the valley floor is bordered by alluvial fans the valley is underlain by up to 9 km of alluvium clay volcanic debris and interbedded volcanic flows and tuffs that were deposited between the oligocene and the holocene emery et al 1969 the san luis valley drains a snowmelt fed watershed area of 7560 km2 fig 1a the northern part of the valley is a closed basin that is drained internally by evapotranspiration the southern portion is drained by the rio grande river and its tributaries which are the main water source for the residents of the san luis valley emery et al 1969 well logs obtained from the colorado division of water resources cdwr indicate the presence of an unconfined aquifer a confining unit and an upper confined aquifer in the study area none of the wells are drilled deep enough to reach the lower confined aquifer consequently the study area is modeled as a three layer hydrologic system recharge to the confined aquifers predominantly occurs along the edge of the basin especially in the san juan foothills which drives water from the basin edge down into the center of the basin fig 2 harmon 1987b shallow aquifer recharge occurs in the center of the basin due to streambed infiltration into the alluvial fans along the valley floor during periods of snowmelt emery et al 1969 deep aquifer recharge occurs in the center of the basin due to fractures faults and jointing that bring all of the aquifers into hydraulic connection with one another hanna and harmon 1989 the unconfined unit is composed of the upper sands of the alamosa formation and typically ranges between 12 and 30 m thick the hydraulic conductivity of the unit ranges from 10 to 70 m day increasing towards the west both the blue grey lacustrine clays at the base of the alamosa formation and the volcanic deposits of the hinsdale formation form the upper confining unit fig 2 which reduces the vertical hydraulic conductivity leading to the stratification of the unconfined and upper confined aquifer harmon 1987a the upper confined aquifer is made up of the lower alamosa santa fe and los pinos formations and varies in thickness from 150 to 300 m fig 2 the hydraulic conductivity ranges from 0 5 to 60 m day the lower confined unit ranges from 750 to 4500 m deep with hydraulic conductivity and water quality decreasing with depth hanna and harmon 1989 kilometer scale aeromagnetic data bankey et al 2005 indicates the presence of a north south trending fault to the north of the study area personal communication v j s grauch b drenth april 8 2020 which harmon and seitz 2021 hypothesized may extend into the study area and hydrologically connect the aquifers the alamosa river one of many intermittent tributaries to the rio grande river originates in the san juan mountains as snowmelt runoff and runs through the terrace reservoir which is located approximately 40 km west southwest of alamosa in south central colorado fig 1a like most intermittent rivers in the region the alamosa river is heavily managed inflows flow freely into the reservoir year round from april to november outflows are set to mimic inflows by releasing water at the rate of the previous day s inflows along with any requested storage releases from december to march no water is released from the reservoir and the alamosa river downstream of the reservoir is fed by precipitation and is typically dry for a significant portion of this time period when the river is flowing most of the water is diverted by an extensive network of irrigation ditches thus during the late summer fall the river goes dry approximately 1 km upstream of the town of capulin which is 24 km downstream of the reservoir fig 1a our study area fig 1b is a 4 0 km stretch of the alamosa river from 0 1 km east of the gunbarrel road river crossing to the county road 8 river crossing well construction reports indicate the presence of the hinsdale basalt in the eastern portion of the study area there are few constraining geologic data in the western portion of the study area like most of the alamosa river this reach is heavily managed and contains nine head gates used for measuring river diversions fig 1b ford and skidmore 1996 noted streamflow reductions of 13 15 across this reach and local residents confirm the river flows seasonally in the downstream portion of the study area to quantify the amount of water available for use in the region the state developed the rio grande decision support system rgdss a collection of numerical models including consumptive use statecu groundwater modflow surface water statemod and water budget statewb models the rgdss has struggled to predict accurate groundwater levels for this reach of the alamosa river for the past decade harmon and seitz 2021 which is problematic because colorado relies on these models to aid in the fulfillment of the 1939 rio grande compact which promises substantial water deliveries to new mexico and texas 3 methods 3 1 hydrological data collection stream velocity profiles were collected on august 6 8 2019 to estimate river discharge above and below the recharge area 0 4 km upstream of the gunbarrel road river crossing vp 1 and 0 8 km upstream of the county road 8 crossing vp 2 respectively fig 1b the discharge data from vp 1 were used to calculate the modeled streamflow rate at the upstream end of the model the discharge data from vp 2 were used to determine model parameters by matching modeled streamflow to the measured streamflow at vp 2 3 2 geophysical data collection geophysical measurements were collected to explore subsurface controls on the geology near the alamosa river and to parameterize zones within the model on november 30 2018 a drone magnetometer survey was conducted by juniper unmanned www juniperunmanned com covering 5 5 km from 1 4 km north of the gunbarrel road alamosa river crossing to 0 2 km east of the county road 8 crossing fig 1b the area was covered by three flight lines providing total magnetic intensity tmi data for the surveyed area which is a function of both induced and remnant magnetization high tmi values indicate geologic features with strong magnetizations such as volcanic rock salem et al 2007 contrasts in tmi data have been used previously in the san luis valley to locate abrupt changes in subsurface geology grauch et al 2013 initial examination of the magnetometer data identified three zones of differing tmi two high tmi zones above and below a low tmi zone thought to include the most important section of losing river which were used to parameterize the model in section 3 3 these data are discussed in detail in the results and conclusions below 3 3 modeling setup niswonger and prudic 2010 developed the streamflow routing package sfr2 as a package for modflow that simulates stream and aquifer interactions by routing flow through a network of surface water channels within sfr2 streambed hydraulic conductivity can be parameterized separately from the underlying aquifers allowing consideration of factors such as streambed clogging e g deposition of fine material here a modflow sfr2 model was designed to resemble a highly simplified version of the alamosa river s hydrogeologic system fig 3 table 1 that is a river above unconfined and confined aquifers separated by a confining unit the model is 4 km long by 2 km wide with a cell size of 40 m by 40 m and three layers which represent the alamosa river alluvium layer 1 the alamosa formation clay or the hinsdale basalt layer 2 a confining unit and the lower alamosa santa fe and los pinos formations layer 3 which comprise the upper confined aquifer the components of the upper confined aquifer have hydraulic conductivity values within a similar range and thus were modeled as a unit the layer thicknesses were determined from well logs drilled along the reach that were obtained from cdwr the well logs indicate the presence of the alamosa formation clay in most wells in the modeled area and the existence of the hinsdale basalt in the eastern portion of the reach the thickness of layers 1 and 2 are 18 m and 5 m respectively the thickness of layer 3 ranges from 77 m at the upstream boundary to 55 m at the downstream boundary model domain elevations are defined as the height above the lower boundary of the modeling domain which is set to 0 m the elevations of the start and end of the modeled reach were taken from lidar data to be approximately 100 and 73 m above the model datum giffin 2011 the river and associated aquifers and confining unit were all modeled as sloping planes the upstream and downstream model boundaries were set as constant head boundaries with values of 91 and 62 m estimated from water levels measured in wells near the upstream and downstream ends of the model respectively the downstream water levels were obtained from the cdwr database the same constant head boundary values were used for all three layers the northern and southern model boundaries parallel to flow are no flow boundaries the river is modeled as a straight reach 3920 m long and 10 m wide through the middle of the model domain the river and each modeled layer are homogenous and thus one set of aquifer parameter values is used for each table 1 the river was divided into three segments based on the drone aeromagnetic data signatures where the upstream and downstream buffer segments represent the high tmi zones and the central segment from 1460 to 2500 m represents the low tmi zone thought to be a recharge area fig 3 the buffer segments separate the recharge segment from the upstream and downstream constant head boundary conditions and thus data from the buffer segments were not analyzed the models were run as steady state flow models in our conceptual models we evaluate 1 the presence of a fault as low permeability faults form barriers to groundwater flow and high permeability faults may connect otherwise disconnected aquifers e g bense and van balen 2004 2 variation

expected to increase instream depletions e g butler et al 2001 jasechko et al 2021 a base case model scenario 0 was simulated using realistic model parameters that generally matched field data while ignoring subsurface heterogeneity outside of the three layered system this base case was then compared to the five scenarios described in detail below the hydraulic conductivity values for layers 1 and 3 of the base case were derived from hanna and harmon 1989 and the nearest order of magnitude value was used the streambed was filled with gravel and cobbles and streambed hydraulic conductivity ks values were taken from the literature niswonger et al 2008 alluvial hydraulic conductivity data suggest layer 1 hydraulic conductivity k1 hanna and harmon 1989 and streambed hydraulic conductivity ks niswonger et al 2008 can reasonably vary over three orders of magnitude from 1 10 3 1 10 5 m s thus nine models were tested with this range of values for both parameters to see what best matched measured streamflow data on august 7 2019 at the end of the recharge segment the pair of k1 and ks values that best matched the field data were used in the base case vertical hydraulic conductivity values were taken to be 1 10 of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity given an understanding of the anisotropy present alluvial aquifers within the san luis valley powell 1958 the base case was compared to five scenarios table 2 each of which included a variation in subsurface properties along the recharge segment these scenarios were chosen because they could potentially explain the recharge segment anomaly in the drone aeromagnetic data and could also control streambed infiltration given limited field data to determine the exact cause of the aeromagnetics anomaly and aquifer recharge in this system we developed place based conceptual models to then numerically explore how geologic changes along the recharge segment would influence recharge for these scenarios three metrics were calculated and compared to the base case streamflow streambed infiltration rate defined as simulated streambed leakage in m3 s from sfr2 output divided by the wetted area of the river in m2 and recharge to the confined aquifer layer 3 for scenario 1 a fault was introduced at the midpoint which could serve as a conduit or a barrier the fault was 40 m the width of one model cell crossing the model domain in a vertical north south orientation and penetrating all three model layers fig 3 approximating the alamosa river fault hypothesized by harmon and seitz 2021 to simulate a high permeability fault a fault conductivity kf of 1 m s was tested scenario 1 1 to explore a low permeability mineralized fault a low kf value of 1 10 7 m s was tested scenario 1 2 in scenario 2 k1 was increased and decreased along the recharge segment to test the influence that aquifer hydraulic conductivity has in controlling the rate at which water could leave the streambed and become aquifer recharge a k1 of 1 10 3 m s was used in the base case which is at the upper range of known values for alluvium in the san luis valley for these simulations k1 was increased to 5 10 3 m s scenario 2 1 and decreased to 5 10 4 m s scenario 2 2 for scenario 3 the streambed thickness st was increased and decreased streambed clogging is known to affect infiltration rates so we included this scenario to explore the potential importance of this process and parameter the st parameter value used in the base model was 0 3 m and values of 1 0 m scenario 3 1 0 5 m scenario 3 2 and 0 1 m scenario 3 3 were analyzed scenario 4 explored the role of a confining unit layer 2 layer 2 was first replaced by thickening layer 1 k2 1 10 3 m s scenario 4 1 and then the confining unit was replaced by thickening layer 3 k2 1 10 4 m s scenario 4 2 these changes would affect the transmissivity of layer 1 and therefore how quickly water can exit the streambed as well as the spatial extent of recharge lastly scenario 5 looked at the impact of introducing a single pumping well screened in the unconfined aquifer at the midway point of the model at 1980 m which would increase stream depletions three pumping rates we were tested 1 10 1 m3 s scenario 5 1 1 10 2 m3 s scenario 5 2 and 1 10 3 m3 s scenario 5 3 these rates mimicked the rates of a large scale production well a small scale production well and a domestic well well records indicate the presence of domestic wells in the study area and municipal wells just downstream in capulin and the presence of sprinkler pivot suggests the presence of irrigation wells fig 1b 4 field results on august 6th and 7th streamflow at vp 1 was 5 15 m3 s from the vp 1 data the predicted inflow to the model domain was calculated taking into account known diversions to irrigation ditches as well as documented reductions in streamflow along this reach of the alamosa river ford and skidmore 1996 on both days inflow to the model was calculated to be 3 88 m3 s on august 7th and 8th streamflow at vp 2 was 2 38 m3 s and 2 40 m3 s respectively and 2 77 m3 s and 2 79 m3 s when accounting for diversions this information provided the streamflow target at the downstream end of our model for all scenarios the drone magnetometer survey measured variability in tmi in nanoteslas along the surveyed reach fig 4 these data constrain subsurface geology we identified a low tmi zone with high areas on either side and used these data to parameterize our model 5 modeling results 5 1 scenario 0 base case model a k1 value of 1 10 3 m s and a ks value of 1 10 4 m s resulted in a streamflow of 2 70 m3 s which matched the measured streamflow of 2 77 m3 s at vp 2 on august 7 2019 with a percent difference of 2 table 3 fig si 1 boundary conditions showed little impact on groundwater heads along the recharge segment where the potentiometric surface mirrored the elevation of the river base the layer 1 head was above the bottom of the river but below the river stage consequently the river was a net losing river and the river and layer 1 groundwater remained in hydraulic connection throughout the model domain groundwater head in layers 2 and 3 remained below the base of the stream infiltration was the highest at the upstream end of the reach and generally declined along the reach as the flow rate in the river decreased however infiltration exhibited a bowing pattern which was the result of the river gaining minimally from groundwater and in turn reduced the net infiltration in the middle of the recharge area total streambed infiltration along the recharge segment for the base case was 0 11 m3 s we note that in these models a positive infiltration means water leaks from the river and into groundwater i e a losing river segment and a negative infiltration means groundwater is discharging into the river than is leaking through the streambed i e a gaining river segment layer 3 was recharged at a rate of 0 035 m3 s driven by downward flow from layer 2 table 4 there was no upward flow from layer 3 into layer 2 5 2 scenario 1 fault introduced at 1980 m along the river reach when a high permeability fault is introduced in scenario 1 1 at 1980 m infiltration increases by an order of magnitude reaching peak infiltration at the fault location between the fault and 80 m downstream of it infiltration returns to near base case levels fig 5 b which is coupled to a reduction in streamflow total streambed infiltration from scenario 1 1 was 47 greater than the base case but streamflow was only reduced by 1 5 this increase in infiltration led to a reduction in streamflow near the fault fig 5a the addition of a low permeability fault in scenario 1 2 results in a much larger disruption to the streamflow in the vicinity of the fault from the base case fig 5a but only results in a 4 increase in streamflow from at vp 2 infiltration is negative and decreasing until 40 m upstream of the fault indicating that the river is gaining water from groundwater rather than losing water to groundwater immediately downstream of the fault groundwater head drops streamflow decreases and infiltration increases although the infiltration pattern for scenario 1 2 is distinctly different from the base case it resulted in only 10 less total infiltration in the subsurface scenario 1 1 resulted in a decrease in layer 1 groundwater head below the base of the river in the immediate vicinity of the fault 100 m table 4 fig 5c resulting in hydraulic connection between all three model layers this is evidenced by the presence of both upward and downward flow at the layer boundaries and a net recharge to layer 3 that is 60 greater than the base case table 4 scenario 1 2 resulted in notable changes to groundwater levels with a distinct groundwater mound upstream of the fault fig 5d which led to negative infiltration and increased streamflow described above downstream of the fault there is an abrupt drop in groundwater levels infiltration becomes positive and streamflow decreases net recharge to layer 3 is minimal with a 5 increase relative to the base case 5 3 scenario 2 increasing and decreasing layer 1 hydraulic conductivity k1 along the recharge segment when k1 is increased to 5 10 3 m s along the recharge segment from 1460 to 2500 m in scenario 2 1 streamflow is reduced and the bowing pattern in streamflow exhibited in fig 8a is caused by the transition of the river from losing to gaining streamflow reaches a minimum of 2 3 m3 s at 2140 m which is 17 less than the base case fig 6 a at vp 2 streamflow was 7 lower than the base case for this scenario increasing k1 along the recharge segment leads to infiltration increasing abruptly near the boundaries of the buffer segments which have the same value of hydraulic conductivity fig 6b upstream of 2060 m infiltration is positive and the river is losing downstream infiltration is negative and the river is gaining total infiltration is 71 higher in scenario 2 1 0 06 m s than the base case 0 04 m s as infiltration is enhanced by the higher k1 value along the recharge segment when k1 is decreased to 5 10 4 m s in scenario 2 2 the streamflow is consistently higher than the base case fig 6a but resulted in only a 2 9 increase total infiltration for scenario 2 2 was 28 less than the base case fig 6b table 4 in scenario 2 1 the layer 1 groundwater level reaches a minimum of 0 15 m below the ground surface at 1460 m near the upstream end of the recharge segment fig 6c downstream of that point groundwater levels steadily increase due to the k1 decrease at 2520 m fig 6c thus the impact of the higher k1 zone in the recharge segment is limited by the lower k1 values in the buffer segments net recharge to layer 3 is similar to the base case with an increase of 4 for scenario 2 2 there was no visible change in layer 1 groundwater levels from the base case fig 6c which never dropped below the base of the stream and net recharge to layer 3 only increased by 1 table 4 5 4 scenario 3 increasing and decreasing streambed thickness st along the recharge segment when streambed thickness is increased in the recharge segment from 1460 to 2500 m to 1 0 m in scenario 3 1 and to 0 5 m in scenario 3 2 from 0 3 m in the base case the streamflow remained similar with an increase of 1 relative to the base case fig 7 a this is because ks k1 so when ks is applied to a thicker streambed it results in a slight decrease in infiltration 2 for scenarios 3 1 and 3 2 table 4 when st was decreased to 0 1 m in scenario 3 3 the streamflow rate decreased 1 relative to the base case fig 7a because the thinner streambed reduced the influence of ks allowing for a slight increase in infiltration of 1 fig 7b layer 1 groundwater levels and net recharge to layer 3 were not notably impacted by changing st resulting in changes of 1 relative to the base case 5 5 scenario 4 removal of the confining unit along the recharge segment in scenarios 4 1 and 4 2 the k of the confining unit in the recharge segment from 1460 to 2500 m was set equal to layer 1 and layer 3 respectively both scenarios 4 1 and 4 2 resulted in a decrease in streamflow from the base case by 0 04 m3 s 2 and by 0 01 m3 s 1 respectively at vp 2 as infiltration through the streambed is controlled by the presence of the confining unit fig 8 a scenario 4 1 resulted in a greater reduction in streamflow and more total streambed infiltration than scenario 4 2 because scenario 4 1 assigned a higher k value to the area where the confined unit had been streambed infiltration for scenario 4 2 was always above the base case along the entire river length fig 8b whereas scenario 4 1 had infiltration larger than the base case until 2260 m where it drops fig 8b this decrease in infiltration is likely caused by the drop in streamflow rate the increase in groundwater levels for all three layers fig 8c d and approaching the boundary of the buffer segment where the confining unit returns scenarios 4 1 and 4 2 resulted in increased infiltration with values of 0 043 m s 24 and 0 041 m s 16 respectively relative to the base case value of 0 035 m s net recharge to layer 3 also increased relative to the base case for both scenarios with volumes of 0 066 m3 s 86 and 0 064 m3 s 82 relative to the base case value of 0 035 m3 s 5 6 scenario 5 pumping well introduced at 1980 m along the river reach introduction of a pumping well at 1980 m screened in the alluvial aquifer in scenarios 5 1 5 2 and 5 3 resulted in less streamflow than the base case streamflow decreased more rapidly than the base case until approximately 100 m downstream of the pumping well and then continued decreasing at a rate similar to the base case resulting in a small change by vp 2 fig 9 a the decrease in streamflow was proportional to the pumping rate resulting in 2 less streamflow than the base case for scenario 5 1 and changes of 1 for scenarios 5 2 and 5 3 there was also an increase in infiltration in the vicinity of the pumping well proportional to the pumping rate and resulting in greater infiltration than the base case fig 9b for scenarios 5 1 5 2 and 5 3 infiltration remained positive along the reach and the river remained a losing stream scenarios 5 1 5 2 and 5 3 resulted in approximately 92 9 and 1 greater total infiltration than the base case despite adding a pumping well layer 1 groundwater head never dropped below the base of the stream groundwater head for all three layers for scenario 5 2 and 5 3 closely matched the base case fig 9c for scenario 5 1 layer 1 groundwater head decreased approaching the river base from 50 m upstream of the pumping well to 50 m downstream of the pumping well fig 9d head in layer 2 also decreased slightly in response to well pumping net recharge to layer 3 was reduced proportionally by the introduction of a pumping well with scenario 5 1 resulting in an 2 change from the base case and scenarios 5 2 and 5 3 resulting in changes of 1 6 discussion and conclusions for the alamosa river test case the drone magnetometer data were used to divide the study area into the recharge segment based on the low tmi zone and the upstream and downstream buffer segments the magnetometer data suggested that the recharge segment is geologically distinct from the buffer zones the high tmi zones could be related to the presence of volcanics well construction reports in the eastern high tmi zone indicate the presence of volcanics and the western zone has little available constraining geologic data similar to the results of grauch et al 2013 our data suggest that the low tmi zone may represent a fault crosscutting the alamosa river with these data as a general guide we created a suite of conceptual numerical models to explore which subsurface heterogeneities could realistically control streambed infiltration and consequently groundwater recharge on intermittent rivers similar to the alamosa fig 10 conceptually all of the scenarios we explored could influence streambed infiltration and groundwater recharge processes the three simulated results we considered were streamflow streambed infiltration and recharge to the confined aquifer layer 3 fig 11 net recharge to the confined aquifer was enhanced by scenarios that provided a conduit through the confining unit including a high permeability fault scenario 1 1 and removal of the confining unit along the recharge segment scenario 4 similar results have been previously documented both in fractured aquifer scenarios by in the rhine river bense and van balen 2004 and in paleochannels crosscutting confining units offshore north carolina usa mulligan et al 2007 streamflow was also decreased in these scenarios which makes sense given the connections between streamflow infiltration and recharge increased streamflow was seen in scenarios with less infiltration and less recharge such as the low permeability fault scenario 1 2 and decreasing k1 scenario 2 2 overall scenarios that involved changing k values had the greatest impacts on these results including a fault scenario 1 the hydraulic conductivity of the shallow k of the system scenario 2 and removal of the confining unit scenario 4 fig 11 the three metrics were least influenced by changing the thickness of the streambed scenario 3 and the introduction of a pumping well scenario 5 particularly a low volume production well scenario 5 2 or the introduction of a domestic well scenario 5 3 the latter of which resulted in no notable changes to any of the output parameters fig 11 the introduction of a high volume pumping well scenario 5 1 resulted in a large increase in infiltration but only small decreases to streamflow and net recharge to the confined aquifer scenario 5 1 resulted in a decrease in water levels near the pumping well but scenarios 5 2 and 5 3 resulted in no notable change in groundwater levels while niswonger and prudic 2010 found that increasing and decreasing streambed thickness resulted in important changes in streambed infiltration and groundwater levels we found the influence of streambed thickness to be negligible this difference is likely due to the fact that in our model ks and layer 1 vertical hydraulic conductivity had the same value of 1 10 4 m s powell 1958 thus hydraulically speaking there was no distinction between streambed material and aquifer material the only impact of streambed thickness was artificially introduced by modflow which calculates the gradient between stream stage and aquifer head by dividing by the streambed thickness our results help explain why regional decision support tools can struggle to accurately represent groundwater levels beneath non perennial river reaches complicating management efforts we show that the homogeneous subsurface conditions which are typically a tacit assumption in studies of groundwater recharge through streambed infiltration may greatly affect the estimated distribution of recharge our model results suggest that subsurface k values are the most important model parameters tested in terms of controls on aquifer recharge but determining when and where infiltration occurs in complex field systems remains a challenge in field settings because real streams are spatially heterogeneous dense data on subsurface heterogeneities are often needed however capturing these data may be difficult geophysics has the potential to map streambed and subsurface heterogeneities relatively quickly and inexpensively and can constrain the location of facies such as confining units that control flow and transport in some systems e g fitterman and grauch 2010 gu et al 2019 malenda et al 2019 martinez segura et al 2019 we also note that we did not address many complexities that further complicate behaviors in field systems for example we intentionally generalized the model setup to be a straight river with steady state flows in reality a variety of real world complexities such as temporal variability in flow and therefore bank storage drying and rewetting processes and complex topography and river sinuosity would provide further controls on both streambed infiltration and groundwater recharge however we simplified the model so that we could explore the impact of geologic subsurface controls alone for the alamosa river the fault scenario is highly plausible given the geophysical signatures additional work is also needed to understand how temporal variability affects these findings for instance how dam releases and storm events interact with geologic controls or how these systems vary when surface water and groundwater are not connected or transition temporally between connection and disconnection in this latter case the presence of an unsaturated zone beneath the streambed alters the typical relationship between water level and infiltration that is found in perennial rivers brunner et al 2009 2011 shanafield et al 2012a additional field data would be useful to more definitively characterize the conditions of rivers in this region so that variability in time and space can be more thoroughly investigated these additional data could include water level data from observation wells along the stream could have been used to track hydraulic head e g goodrich et al 2004 isotopic and chemical tracers could have been used to track water movement between the stream and the two aquifers e g gooseff and mcglynn 2005 or water quality signatures from the streams and the two aquifers could have been used to

subsurface geological heterogeneities that impact recharge is key for assessing the resilience of non perennial rivers a decrease in snowpack is predicted to result in declining streamflow e g cayan et al 2007 and the transition of more rivers from perennial to intermittent or ephemeral e g gutierrez jurado et al 2019 this outcome will result in more river reaches remaining dry longer and in reduced alluvial aquifer recharge e g taylor et al 2013 meixner et al 2016 this work demonstrates that the spatial distribution of subsurface geological heterogeneities is a factor in the extent to

8231,study region this study is along an intermittent reach of the alamosa river in the san luis valley of south central colorado a river that is typical of the semi arid southwestern united states with respect to climate land use and the impacts of upstream dam regulation study focus we use conceptual steady state models to identify geologic factors that may control water loss through infiltration these conceptual models are parameterized according to a range of conditions observed from stream discharge topographic data geologic data and drone magnetometer data new hydrological insights the introduction of a fault variation in the alluvial aquifer hydraulic conductivity and presence or absence of a confining unit in the numerical models were the primary geologic controls that affected infiltration across the study reach conversely variation in the thickness of the streambed had little impact this information may help determine future data collection within this and similar semi arid regions where rivers are controlled by a combination of surface water availability e g through dam regulation and complex subsurface geology which are often not well constrained keywords geophysics heterogeneity numerical modeling arid hydrology aquifer recharge non perennial rivers streambed dynamics 1 introduction non perennial rivers which have no surface flows for some part of the year are the main surface water source in arid and semi arid climates stromberg et al 2017 consequently humans living in these climates tend to rely heavily on groundwater to supplement the limited surface water supply which has resulted in groundwater overexploitation and aquifer depletion llamas and mart√≠nez santos 2005 bajjali and al hadidi 2006 kundzewicz and d√∂ll 2009 simultaneously water use in arid climates is increasing due to population growth and migration e g v√∂r√∂smarty et al 2000 and is shifting from agriculture to urbanization which decreases irrigation return flows e g dinatale et al 2008 and leads to a reduction in aquifer recharge e g de graaf et al 2014 water supplies are further impacted by climate change which is increasing the number of in

goodrich et al 2004 seasonal water contributions from snowmelt runoff usepa 2015 and the physical conditions of the streambed and aquifer for example where the depth to groundwater is large the river can become disconnected from groundwater producing an unsaturated zone beneath the streambed which controls the rate of streambed infiltration brunner et al 2009 2011 shanafield et al 2012a it is possible to make direct estimates of recharge using groundwater mounding as measured in monitoring wells e g goodrich et al 2004 and by groundwater dating e g bethke and johnson 2008 however these techniques often necessitate the installation of several monitoring wells and do not easily allow for an exploration of small scale heterogeneity controls alternatively differential streamflow measurements e g sorman and abdulrazzak 1993 or streambed infiltration besbes et al 1978 subyani 2004 gooseff and mcglynn 2005 have been used as proxies for recharge although these surficial

extensive data collection has been possible e g niswonger et al 2008 wang et al 2017 some of these models take advantage of the unsaturated properties of intermittent rivers during the onset of streamflow to estimate spatial variability in infiltration assuming streambed hydraulic conductivity is the primary control e g noorduijn et al 2014 shanafield et al 2012b hypothetical intermittent stream hydrologic models have also been used to further explore the sensitivity of recharge processes to potential input parameters reid and dreiss 1990 regardless of whether groundwater recharge is estimated through field observations or modeling studies of groundwater recharge from streambed infiltration typically either assume that the system is homogeneous or that the volume of flow is the main control on recharge here we use field hydrologic data and drone aeromagnetic data to develop place based conceptual and numerical models of surface water groundwater connectivity to explore how subsurface geology controls the location and magnitude of aquifer recharge this work builds off of previous research such as brunner et al 2009 who numerically explored how groundwater and surface water interact in disconnected systems here rather than exploring the physical controls on disconnection we assume our stream is connected but generally losing and look at the role of geology in controlling recharge from the stream to the subsurface geologic controls on groundwater recharge are not well studied e g carlier et al 2018 although it is thought that it may be a more important variable than topography on streamflow generation in some systems e g fenicia et al 2016 our work is motivated by the alamosa river in the san luis valley of south central colorado fig 1 a intermittent rivers like the alamosa are not just common in the san luis valley but are the dominant river type in the american southwest e g stromberg et al 2017 like most of these rivers the alamosa is key to livelihoods in the region and is therefore heavily managed and much of its flow is diverted for irrigation purposes understanding geologic controls on aquifer recharge in this region would be helpful to predicting water availability as well as how these systems will be affected given climate change both in terms of river and aquifer storage 2 site description the san luis valley is a basin covering an area of 5030 km2 with an average elevation of 2350 m emery et al 1969 the valley is bounded to the west by the san juan mountains and to the east by the sangre de cristo mountains fig 1a the san juan mountains are composed of volcanic flows tuffs and breccias whereas the sangre de cristo mountains are made up of igneous metamorphic and sedimentary rocks the valley floor is bordered by alluvial fans the valley is underlain by up to 9 km of alluvium clay volcanic debris and interbedded volcanic flows and tuffs that were deposited between the oligocene and the holocene emery et al 1969 the san luis valley drains a snowmelt fed watershed area of 7560 km2 fig 1a the northern part of the valley is a closed basin that is drained internally by evapotranspiration the southern portion is drained by the rio grande river and its tributaries which are the main water source for the residents of the san luis valley emery et al 1969 well logs obtained from the colorado division of water resources cdwr indicate the presence of an unconfined aquifer a confining unit and an upper confined aquifer in the study area none of the wells are drilled deep enough to reach the lower confined aquifer consequently the study area is modeled as a three layer hydrologic system recharge to the confined aquifers predominantly occurs along the edge of the basin especially in the san juan foothills which drives water from the basin edge down into the center of the basin fig 2 harmon 1987b shallow aquifer recharge occurs in the center of the basin due to streambed infiltration into the alluvial fans along the valley floor during periods of snowmelt emery et al 1969 deep aquifer recharge occurs in the center of the basin due to fractures faults and jointing that bring all of the aquifers into hydraulic connection with one another hanna and harmon 1989 the unconfined unit is composed of the upper sands of the alamosa formation and typically ranges between 12 and 30 m thick the hydraulic conductivity of the unit ranges from 10 to 70 m day increasing towards the west both the blue grey lacustrine clays at the base of the alamosa formation and the volcanic deposits of the hinsdale formation form the upper confining unit fig 2 which reduces the vertical hydraulic conductivity leading to the stratification of the unconfined and upper confined aquifer harmon 1987a the upper confined aquifer is made up of the lower alamosa santa fe and los pinos formations and varies in thickness from 150 to 300 m fig 2 the hydraulic conductivity ranges from 0 5 to 60 m day the lower confined unit ranges from 750 to 4500 m deep with hydraulic conductivity and water quality decreasing with depth hanna and harmon 1989 kilometer scale aeromagnetic data bankey et al 2005 indicates the presence of a north south trending fault to the north of the study area personal communication v j s grauch b drenth april 8 2020 which harmon and seitz 2021 hypothesized may extend into the study area and hydrologically connect the aquifers the alamosa river one of many intermittent tributaries to the rio grande river originates in the san juan mountains as snowmelt runoff and runs through the terrace reservoir which is located approximately 40 km west southwest of alamosa in south central colorado fig 1a like most intermittent rivers in the region the alamosa river is heavily managed inflows flow freely into the reservoir year round from april to november outflows are set to mimic inflows by releasing water at the rate of the previous day s inflows along with any requested storage releases from december to march no water is released from the reservoir and the alamosa river downstream of the reservoir is fed by precipitation and is typically dry for a significant portion of this time period when the river is flowing most of the water is diverted by an extensive network of irrigation ditches thus during the late summer fall the river goes dry approximately 1 km upstream of the town of capulin which is 24 km downstream of the reservoir fig 1a our study area fig 1b is a 4 0 km stretch of the alamosa river from 0 1 km east of the gunbarrel road river crossing to the county road 8 river crossing well construction reports indicate the presence of the hinsdale basalt in the eastern portion of the study area there are few constraining geologic data in the western portion of the study area like most of the alamosa river this reach is heavily managed and contains nine head gates used for measuring river diversions fig 1b ford and skidmore 1996 noted streamflow reductions of 13 15 across this reach and local residents confirm the river flows seasonally in the downstream portion of the study area to quantify the amount of water available for use in the region the state developed the rio grande decision support system rgdss a collection of numerical models including consumptive use statecu groundwater modflow surface water statemod and water budget statewb models the rgdss has struggled to predict accurate groundwater levels for this reach of the alamosa river for the past decade harmon and seitz 2021 which is problematic because colorado relies on these models to aid in the fulfillment of the 1939 rio grande compact which promises substantial water deliveries to new mexico and texas 3 methods 3 1 hydrological data collection stream velocity profiles were collected on august 6 8 2019 to estimate river discharge above and below the recharge area 0 4 km upstream of the gunbarrel road river crossing vp 1 and 0 8 km upstream of the county road 8 crossing vp 2 respectively fig 1b the discharge data from vp 1 were used to calculate the modeled streamflow rate at the upstream end of the model the discharge data from vp 2 were used to determine model parameters by matching modeled streamflow to the measured streamflow at vp 2 3 2 geophysical data collection geophysical measurements were collected to explore subsurface controls on the geology near the alamosa river and to parameterize zones within the model on november 30 2018 a drone magnetometer survey was conducted by juniper unmanned www juniperunmanned com covering 5 5 km from 1 4 km north of the gunbarrel road alamosa river crossing to 0 2 km east of the county road 8 crossing fig 1b the area was covered by three flight lines providing total magnetic intensity tmi data for the surveyed area which is a function of both induced and remnant magnetization high tmi values indicate geologic features with strong magnetizations such as volcanic rock salem et al 2007 contrasts in tmi data have been used previously in the san luis valley to locate abrupt changes in subsurface geology grauch et al 2013 initial examination of the magnetometer data identified three zones of differing tmi two high tmi zones above and below a low tmi zone thought to include the most important section of losing river which were used to parameterize the model in section 3 3 these data are discussed in detail in the results and conclusions below 3 3 modeling setup niswonger and prudic 2010 developed the streamflow routing package sfr2 as a package for modflow that simulates stream and aquifer interactions by routing flow through a network of surface water channels within sfr2 streambed hydraulic conductivity can be parameterized separately from the underlying aquifers allowing consideration of factors such as streambed clogging e g deposition of fine material here a modflow sfr2 model was designed to resemble a highly simplified version of the alamosa river s hydrogeologic system fig 3 table 1 that is a river above unconfined and confined aquifers separated by a confining unit the model is 4 km long by 2 km wide with a cell size of 40 m by 40 m and three layers which represent the alamosa river alluvium layer 1 the alamosa formation clay or the hinsdale basalt layer 2 a confining unit and the lower alamosa santa fe and los pinos formations layer 3 which comprise the upper confined aquifer the components of the upper confined aquifer have hydraulic conductivity values within a similar range and thus were modeled as a unit the layer thicknesses were determined from well logs drilled along the reach that were obtained from cdwr the well logs indicate the presence of the alamosa formation clay in most wells in the modeled area and the existence of the hinsdale basalt in the eastern portion of the reach the thickness of layers 1 and 2 are 18 m and 5 m respectively the thickness of layer 3 ranges from 77 m at the upstream boundary to 55 m at the downstream boundary model domain elevations are defined as the height above the lower boundary of the modeling domain which is set to 0 m the elevations of the start and end of the modeled reach were taken from lidar data to be approximately 100 and 73 m above the model datum giffin 2011 the river and associated aquifers and confining unit were all modeled as sloping planes the upstream and downstream model boundaries were set as constant head boundaries with values of 91 and 62 m estimated from water levels measured in wells near the upstream and downstream ends of the model respectively the downstream water levels were obtained from the cdwr database the same constant head boundary values were used for all three layers the northern and southern model boundaries parallel to flow are no flow boundaries the river is modeled as a straight reach 3920 m long and 10 m wide through the middle of the model domain the river and each modeled layer are homogenous and thus one set of aquifer parameter values is used for each table 1 the river was divided into three segments based on the drone aeromagnetic data signatures where the upstream and downstream buffer segments represent the high tmi zones and the central segment from 1460 to 2500 m represents the low tmi zone thought to be a recharge area fig 3 the buffer segments separate the recharge segment from the upstream and downstream constant head boundary conditions and thus data from the buffer segments were not analyzed the models were run as steady state flow models in our conceptual models we evaluate 1 the presence of a fault as low permeability faults form barriers to groundwater flow and high permeability faults may connect otherwise disconnected aquifers e g bense and van balen 2004 2 variation

expected to increase instream depletions e g butler et al 2001 jasechko et al 2021 a base case model scenario 0 was simulated using realistic model parameters that generally matched field data while ignoring subsurface heterogeneity outside of the three layered system this base case was then compared to the five scenarios described in detail below the hydraulic conductivity values for layers 1 and 3 of the base case were derived from hanna and harmon 1989 and the nearest order of magnitude value was used the streambed was filled with gravel and cobbles and streambed hydraulic conductivity ks values were taken from the literature niswonger et al 2008 alluvial hydraulic conductivity data suggest layer 1 hydraulic conductivity k1 hanna and harmon 1989 and streambed hydraulic conductivity ks niswonger et al 2008 can reasonably vary over three orders of magnitude from 1 10 3 1 10 5 m s thus nine models were tested with this range of values for both parameters to see what best matched measured streamflow data on august 7 2019 at the end of the recharge segment the pair of k1 and ks values that best matched the field data were used in the base case vertical hydraulic conductivity values were taken to be 1 10 of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity given an understanding of the anisotropy present alluvial aquifers within the san luis valley powell 1958 the base case was compared to five scenarios table 2 each of which included a variation in subsurface properties along the recharge segment these scenarios were chosen because they could potentially explain the recharge segment anomaly in the drone aeromagnetic data and could also control streambed infiltration given limited field data to determine the exact cause of the aeromagnetics anomaly and aquifer recharge in this system we developed place based conceptual models to then numerically explore how geologic changes along the recharge segment would influence recharge for these scenarios three metrics were calculated and compared to the base case streamflow streambed infiltration rate defined as simulated streambed leakage in m3 s from sfr2 output divided by the wetted area of the river in m2 and recharge to the confined aquifer layer 3 for scenario 1 a fault was introduced at the midpoint which could serve as a conduit or a barrier the fault was 40 m the width of one model cell crossing the model domain in a vertical north south orientation and penetrating all three model layers fig 3 approximating the alamosa river fault hypothesized by harmon and seitz 2021 to simulate a high permeability fault a fault conductivity kf of 1 m s was tested scenario 1 1 to explore a low permeability mineralized fault a low kf value of 1 10 7 m s was tested scenario 1 2 in scenario 2 k1 was increased and decreased along the recharge segment to test the influence that aquifer hydraulic conductivity has in controlling the rate at which water could leave the streambed and become aquifer recharge a k1 of 1 10 3 m s was used in the base case which is at the upper range of known values for alluvium in the san luis valley for these simulations k1 was increased to 5 10 3 m s scenario 2 1 and decreased to 5 10 4 m s scenario 2 2 for scenario 3 the streambed thickness st was increased and decreased streambed clogging is known to affect infiltration rates so we included this scenario to explore the potential importance of this process and parameter the st parameter value used in the base model was 0 3 m and values of 1 0 m scenario 3 1 0 5 m scenario 3 2 and 0 1 m scenario 3 3 were analyzed scenario 4 explored the role of a confining unit layer 2 layer 2 was first replaced by thickening layer 1 k2 1 10 3 m s scenario 4 1 and then the confining unit was replaced by thickening layer 3 k2 1 10 4 m s scenario 4 2 these changes would affect the transmissivity of layer 1 and therefore how quickly water can exit the streambed as well as the spatial extent of recharge lastly scenario 5 looked at the impact of introducing a single pumping well screened in the unconfined aquifer at the midway point of the model at 1980 m which would increase stream depletions three pumping rates we were tested 1 10 1 m3 s scenario 5 1 1 10 2 m3 s scenario 5 2 and 1 10 3 m3 s scenario 5 3 these rates mimicked the rates of a large scale production well a small scale production well and a domestic well well records indicate the presence of domestic wells in the study area and municipal wells just downstream in capulin and the presence of sprinkler pivot suggests the presence of irrigation wells fig 1b 4 field results on august 6th and 7th streamflow at vp 1 was 5 15 m3 s from the vp 1 data the predicted inflow to the model domain was calculated taking into account known diversions to irrigation ditches as well as documented reductions in streamflow along this reach of the alamosa river ford and skidmore 1996 on both days inflow to the model was calculated to be 3 88 m3 s on august 7th and 8th streamflow at vp 2 was 2 38 m3 s and 2 40 m3 s respectively and 2 77 m3 s and 2 79 m3 s when accounting for diversions this information provided the streamflow target at the downstream end of our model for all scenarios the drone magnetometer survey measured variability in tmi in nanoteslas along the surveyed reach fig 4 these data constrain subsurface geology we identified a low tmi zone with high areas on either side and used these data to parameterize our model 5 modeling results 5 1 scenario 0 base case model a k1 value of 1 10 3 m s and a ks value of 1 10 4 m s resulted in a streamflow of 2 70 m3 s which matched the measured streamflow of 2 77 m3 s at vp 2 on august 7 2019 with a percent difference of 2 table 3 fig si 1 boundary conditions showed little impact on groundwater heads along the recharge segment where the potentiometric surface mirrored the elevation of the river base the layer 1 head was above the bottom of the river but below the river stage consequently the river was a net losing river and the river and layer 1 groundwater remained in hydraulic connection throughout the model domain groundwater head in layers 2 and 3 remained below the base of the stream infiltration was the highest at the upstream end of the reach and generally declined along the reach as the flow rate in the river decreased however infiltration exhibited a bowing pattern which was the result of the river gaining minimally from groundwater and in turn reduced the net infiltration in the middle of the recharge area total streambed infiltration along the recharge segment for the base case was 0 11 m3 s we note that in these models a positive infiltration means water leaks from the river and into groundwater i e a losing river segment and a negative infiltration means groundwater is discharging into the river than is leaking through the streambed i e a gaining river segment layer 3 was recharged at a rate of 0 035 m3 s driven by downward flow from layer 2 table 4 there was no upward flow from layer 3 into layer 2 5 2 scenario 1 fault introduced at 1980 m along the river reach when a high permeability fault is introduced in scenario 1 1 at 1980 m infiltration increases by an order of magnitude reaching peak infiltration at the fault location between the fault and 80 m downstream of it infiltration returns to near base case levels fig 5 b which is coupled to a reduction in streamflow total streambed infiltration from scenario 1 1 was 47 greater than the base case but streamflow was only reduced by 1 5 this increase in infiltration led to a reduction in streamflow near the fault fig 5a the addition of a low permeability fault in scenario 1 2 results in a much larger disruption to the streamflow in the vicinity of the fault from the base case fig 5a but only results in a 4 increase in streamflow from at vp 2 infiltration is negative and decreasing until 40 m upstream of the fault indicating that the river is gaining water from groundwater rather than losing water to groundwater immediately downstream of the fault groundwater head drops streamflow decreases and infiltration increases although the infiltration pattern for scenario 1 2 is distinctly different from the base case it resulted in only 10 less total infiltration in the subsurface scenario 1 1 resulted in a decrease in layer 1 groundwater head below the base of the river in the immediate vicinity of the fault 100 m table 4 fig 5c resulting in hydraulic connection between all three model layers this is evidenced by the presence of both upward and downward flow at the layer boundaries and a net recharge to layer 3 that is 60 greater than the base case table 4 scenario 1 2 resulted in notable changes to groundwater levels with a distinct groundwater mound upstream of the fault fig 5d which led to negative infiltration and increased streamflow described above downstream of the fault there is an abrupt drop in groundwater levels infiltration becomes positive and streamflow decreases net recharge to layer 3 is minimal with a 5 increase relative to the base case 5 3 scenario 2 increasing and decreasing layer 1 hydraulic conductivity k1 along the recharge segment when k1 is increased to 5 10 3 m s along the recharge segment from 1460 to 2500 m in scenario 2 1 streamflow is reduced and the bowing pattern in streamflow exhibited in fig 8a is caused by the transition of the river from losing to gaining streamflow reaches a minimum of 2 3 m3 s at 2140 m which is 17 less than the base case fig 6 a at vp 2 streamflow was 7 lower than the base case for this scenario increasing k1 along the recharge segment leads to infiltration increasing abruptly near the boundaries of the buffer segments which have the same value of hydraulic conductivity fig 6b upstream of 2060 m infiltration is positive and the river is losing downstream infiltration is negative and the river is gaining total infiltration is 71 higher in scenario 2 1 0 06 m s than the base case 0 04 m s as infiltration is enhanced by the higher k1 value along the recharge segment when k1 is decreased to 5 10 4 m s in scenario 2 2 the streamflow is consistently higher than the base case fig 6a but resulted in only a 2 9 increase total infiltration for scenario 2 2 was 28 less than the base case fig 6b table 4 in scenario 2 1 the layer 1 groundwater level reaches a minimum of 0 15 m below the ground surface at 1460 m near the upstream end of the recharge segment fig 6c downstream of that point groundwater levels steadily increase due to the k1 decrease at 2520 m fig 6c thus the impact of the higher k1 zone in the recharge segment is limited by the lower k1 values in the buffer segments net recharge to layer 3 is similar to the base case with an increase of 4 for scenario 2 2 there was no visible change in layer 1 groundwater levels from the base case fig 6c which never dropped below the base of the stream and net recharge to layer 3 only increased by 1 table 4 5 4 scenario 3 increasing and decreasing streambed thickness st along the recharge segment when streambed thickness is increased in the recharge segment from 1460 to 2500 m to 1 0 m in scenario 3 1 and to 0 5 m in scenario 3 2 from 0 3 m in the base case the streamflow remained similar with an increase of 1 relative to the base case fig 7 a this is because ks k1 so when ks is applied to a thicker streambed it results in a slight decrease in infiltration 2 for scenarios 3 1 and 3 2 table 4 when st was decreased to 0 1 m in scenario 3 3 the streamflow rate decreased 1 relative to the base case fig 7a because the thinner streambed reduced the influence of ks allowing for a slight increase in infiltration of 1 fig 7b layer 1 groundwater levels and net recharge to layer 3 were not notably impacted by changing st resulting in changes of 1 relative to the base case 5 5 scenario 4 removal of the confining unit along the recharge segment in scenarios 4 1 and 4 2 the k of the confining unit in the recharge segment from 1460 to 2500 m was set equal to layer 1 and layer 3 respectively both scenarios 4 1 and 4 2 resulted in a decrease in streamflow from the base case by 0 04 m3 s 2 and by 0 01 m3 s 1 respectively at vp 2 as infiltration through the streambed is controlled by the presence of the confining unit fig 8 a scenario 4 1 resulted in a greater reduction in streamflow and more total streambed infiltration than scenario 4 2 because scenario 4 1 assigned a higher k value to the area where the confined unit had been streambed infiltration for scenario 4 2 was always above the base case along the entire river length fig 8b whereas scenario 4 1 had infiltration larger than the base case until 2260 m where it drops fig 8b this decrease in infiltration is likely caused by the drop in streamflow rate the increase in groundwater levels for all three layers fig 8c d and approaching the boundary of the buffer segment where the confining unit returns scenarios 4 1 and 4 2 resulted in increased infiltration with values of 0 043 m s 24 and 0 041 m s 16 respectively relative to the base case value of 0 035 m s net recharge to layer 3 also increased relative to the base case for both scenarios with volumes of 0 066 m3 s 86 and 0 064 m3 s 82 relative to the base case value of 0 035 m3 s 5 6 scenario 5 pumping well introduced at 1980 m along the river reach introduction of a pumping well at 1980 m screened in the alluvial aquifer in scenarios 5 1 5 2 and 5 3 resulted in less streamflow than the base case streamflow decreased more rapidly than the base case until approximately 100 m downstream of the pumping well and then continued decreasing at a rate similar to the base case resulting in a small change by vp 2 fig 9 a the decrease in streamflow was proportional to the pumping rate resulting in 2 less streamflow than the base case for scenario 5 1 and changes of 1 for scenarios 5 2 and 5 3 there was also an increase in infiltration in the vicinity of the pumping well proportional to the pumping rate and resulting in greater infiltration than the base case fig 9b for scenarios 5 1 5 2 and 5 3 infiltration remained positive along the reach and the river remained a losing stream scenarios 5 1 5 2 and 5 3 resulted in approximately 92 9 and 1 greater total infiltration than the base case despite adding a pumping well layer 1 groundwater head never dropped below the base of the stream groundwater head for all three layers for scenario 5 2 and 5 3 closely matched the base case fig 9c for scenario 5 1 layer 1 groundwater head decreased approaching the river base from 50 m upstream of the pumping well to 50 m downstream of the pumping well fig 9d head in layer 2 also decreased slightly in response to well pumping net recharge to layer 3 was reduced proportionally by the introduction of a pumping well with scenario 5 1 resulting in an 2 change from the base case and scenarios 5 2 and 5 3 resulting in changes of 1 6 discussion and conclusions for the alamosa river test case the drone magnetometer data were used to divide the study area into the recharge segment based on the low tmi zone and the upstream and downstream buffer segments the magnetometer data suggested that the recharge segment is geologically distinct from the buffer zones the high tmi zones could be related to the presence of volcanics well construction reports in the eastern high tmi zone indicate the presence of volcanics and the western zone has little available constraining geologic data similar to the results of grauch et al 2013 our data suggest that the low tmi zone may represent a fault crosscutting the alamosa river with these data as a general guide we created a suite of conceptual numerical models to explore which subsurface heterogeneities could realistically control streambed infiltration and consequently groundwater recharge on intermittent rivers similar to the alamosa fig 10 conceptually all of the scenarios we explored could influence streambed infiltration and groundwater recharge processes the three simulated results we considered were streamflow streambed infiltration and recharge to the confined aquifer layer 3 fig 11 net recharge to the confined aquifer was enhanced by scenarios that provided a conduit through the confining unit including a high permeability fault scenario 1 1 and removal of the confining unit along the recharge segment scenario 4 similar results have been previously documented both in fractured aquifer scenarios by in the rhine river bense and van balen 2004 and in paleochannels crosscutting confining units offshore north carolina usa mulligan et al 2007 streamflow was also decreased in these scenarios which makes sense given the connections between streamflow infiltration and recharge increased streamflow was seen in scenarios with less infiltration and less recharge such as the low permeability fault scenario 1 2 and decreasing k1 scenario 2 2 overall scenarios that involved changing k values had the greatest impacts on these results including a fault scenario 1 the hydraulic conductivity of the shallow k of the system scenario 2 and removal of the confining unit scenario 4 fig 11 the three metrics were least influenced by changing the thickness of the streambed scenario 3 and the introduction of a pumping well scenario 5 particularly a low volume production well scenario 5 2 or the introduction of a domestic well scenario 5 3 the latter of which resulted in no notable changes to any of the output parameters fig 11 the introduction of a high volume pumping well scenario 5 1 resulted in a large increase in infiltration but only small decreases to streamflow and net recharge to the confined aquifer scenario 5 1 resulted in a decrease in water levels near the pumping well but scenarios 5 2 and 5 3 resulted in no notable change in groundwater levels while niswonger and prudic 2010 found that increasing and decreasing streambed thickness resulted in important changes in streambed infiltration and groundwater levels we found the influence of streambed thickness to be negligible this difference is likely due to the fact that in our model ks and layer 1 vertical hydraulic conductivity had the same value of 1 10 4 m s powell 1958 thus hydraulically speaking there was no distinction between streambed material and aquifer material the only impact of streambed thickness was artificially introduced by modflow which calculates the gradient between stream stage and aquifer head by dividing by the streambed thickness our results help explain why regional decision support tools can struggle to accurately represent groundwater levels beneath non perennial river reaches complicating management efforts we show that the homogeneous subsurface conditions which are typically a tacit assumption in studies of groundwater recharge through streambed infiltration may greatly affect the estimated distribution of recharge our model results suggest that subsurface k values are the most important model parameters tested in terms of controls on aquifer recharge but determining when and where infiltration occurs in complex field systems remains a challenge in field settings because real streams are spatially heterogeneous dense data on subsurface heterogeneities are often needed however capturing these data may be difficult geophysics has the potential to map streambed and subsurface heterogeneities relatively quickly and inexpensively and can constrain the location of facies such as confining units that control flow and transport in some systems e g fitterman and grauch 2010 gu et al 2019 malenda et al 2019 martinez segura et al 2019 we also note that we did not address many complexities that further complicate behaviors in field systems for example we intentionally generalized the model setup to be a straight river with steady state flows in reality a variety of real world complexities such as temporal variability in flow and therefore bank storage drying and rewetting processes and complex topography and river sinuosity would provide further controls on both streambed infiltration and groundwater recharge however we simplified the model so that we could explore the impact of geologic subsurface controls alone for the alamosa river the fault scenario is highly plausible given the geophysical signatures additional work is also needed to understand how temporal variability affects these findings for instance how dam releases and storm events interact with geologic controls or how these systems vary when surface water and groundwater are not connected or transition temporally between connection and disconnection in this latter case the presence of an unsaturated zone beneath the streambed alters the typical relationship between water level and infiltration that is found in perennial rivers brunner et al 2009 2011 shanafield et al 2012a additional field data would be useful to more definitively characterize the conditions of rivers in this region so that variability in time and space can be more thoroughly investigated these additional data could include water level data from observation wells along the stream could have been used to track hydraulic head e g goodrich et al 2004 isotopic and chemical tracers could have been used to track water movement between the stream and the two aquifers e g gooseff and mcglynn 2005 or water quality signatures from the streams and the two aquifers could have been used to determine where the unit s are in hydrologic connection e g subyani 2004 these data could help evaluate specific scenarios if they have been available or possible to collect locating and modeling subsurface geological heterogeneities that impact recharge is key for assessing the resilience of non perennial rivers a decrease in snowpack is predicted to result in declining streamflow e g cayan et al 2007 and the transition of more rivers from perennial to intermittent or ephemeral e g gutierrez jurado et al 2019 this outcome will result in more river reaches remaining dry longer and in reduced alluvial aquifer recharge e g taylor et al 2013 meixner et al 2016 this work demonstrates that the spatial distribution of subsurface geological heterogeneities is a factor in the extent to

8232,study region lake ikeda japan study focus few previous studies on the contribution of meteorological factors to lake evaporation e have been conducted with comprehensive analyses of lake surface temperature t s under different climate scenarios this study aimed to compute and compare the sensitivities of monthly and annual e to changes in solar r s and atmospheric radiation r a air temperature t a relative humidity rh and wind speed u under two climate scenarios through a 36 year numerical simulation for lake ikeda new hydrological insights for the region where climate shifted unidirectionally r s and r a were the greatest driving forces for e the mean contributions of r s and r a to annual e change were approximated to be 2 4 and 5 4 times larger than that of t a or rh respectively thus under warming or cooling condition around the lake r a working with t a was dominant for e in contrast considering seasonal climate variability a remarkable effect of the seasonal variability in t a on e indicating negative correlation was estimated e changes were characterized by the dilatory thermal reaction of t s enhanced by the seasonal switching effect of heat conduction between the lake and atmosphere and seasonal temperature dependency of vapor pressure the driving factors of e and t s correlations between e and meteorological factors and variabilities of meteorological factors were compared and summarized for lakes located between 30 n 45 n worldwide keywords lake evaporation surface water temperature meteorology numerical simulation climate scenario sensitivity analysis 1 introduction over the land surfaces of the earth evaporation contributes on average approximately 60 65 of the average precipitation making this factor the second most important component of the hydrological cycle after precipitation brutsaert 2005 in the climatology of the hydrological cycle lakes are primary water resources where evaporation is one of the essential water budget components and the primary component for water loss hostetler and bartlein 1990 recent climatic variations and increased freshwater demand due to an increase in the human population have increased the significance of quantifying lake evaporation to achieve a steady and sustainable water resource management it is indispensable to evaluate the impact of climate change on lake evaporation and to accurately predict future evaporation correlative analysis is useful for the study of meteorological effects on lake evaporation and the results are sorted according to timescales friedrich et al 2018 summarized that the driving force of reservoir evaporation was wind for diurnal wind and air temperature for diurnal to seasonal and wind air temperature and radiation for seasonal to interannual timescales in lake erhai china lake evaporation measured by the eddy covariance method correlates to daily and weekly wind speed correlation coefficients of r 0 76 and 0 62 respectively monthly air temperature r 0 74 and annual solar radiation r 0 81 meng et al 2020 similar results were obtained through correlative analyses on biweekly to annual timescales using the bowen ratio energy budget breb method brutsaert 1982 asce 1996 in lake sparkling usa lenters et al 2005 these results suggest that an increase in radiation requires significantly more time for an evaporative response compared with a brief increase in wind speed weeks to month and the response to a change in air temperature can happen more quickly than that of radiation and more slowly than that of wind speed to quantitatively assess relationships between lake evaporation and meteorological factors sensitivity analyses using various evaporation estimation approaches have been applied to several lakes the breb method the penman method penman 1948 and the complementary relationship lake evaporation crle model morton 1983a b show that monthly evaporation from lake ziway ethiopia is sensitive to solar radiation given that the sensitivities were different among the approaches evaporation changed by 14 5 11 2 and 6 9 with 10 change in solar radiation respectively vallet coulomb et al 2001 in lake vegoritis greece a numerical simulation estimated that lake evaporation changed by 6 1 32 2 and 18 7 with 10 changes in solar radiation atmospheric radiation and air temperature respectively gianniou and antonopoulos 2007 recently the crle model applied to lake nam co china estimated annual evaporation changes of 14 6 14 1 1 7 2 4 and 1 1 0 1 for 10 increases decreases in solar radiation air temperature and relative humidity respectively ma et al 2016 in lake siling co china a single layer model computed the annual evaporative sensitivities of 11 0 10 7 1 4 1 5 and 3 2 3 2 to 10 increases decreases in solar radiation air temperature and wind speed respectively guo et al 2019 in lake taihu china field observations and numerical simulations revealed that solar and atmospheric radiation were the main factors for the annual variability in evaporation hu et al 2017 xiao et al 2020 analogous results were found in lake dongping china based on statistical analyses rong et al 2013 and in lake nam co where the complex influences of solar radiation atmospheric radiation and air temperature on annual variations in evaporation were estimated lazhu et al 2016 moreover in lake erhai an evaporation estimation formula based on solar radiation evaluated that the contribution of air temperature to the upward trend of annual evaporation for 38 years was 2 3 times larger than that of solar radiation meng et al 2020 although these studies were valuable as quantitative investigations of the evaporative response to meteorological changes comparisons or discussion of the results are limited by the differences in analysis conditions e g timescale and estimation method and lack of information about the evaporation related variables e g lake surface temperature and vapor pressure difference when examining the evaporative response to climate change using sensitivity analysis the analysis should be designed to include the following steps first to compare the analysis results between different timescales it is necessary to organize the results for each timescale i e time dependency second to verify the analysis values and to study the evaporative response in detail the response should be analyzed and discussed in combination with evaporation related variables such as lake surface temperature and vapor pressure difference third the difference in the type of meteorological change e g a meteorological factor changes over a year or only during specific season should be considered in the analysis because the sensitivity analysis results should be different for each type of meteorological change i e time dependency finally the comparison of analysis results among several lakes is indispensable since the driving force of evaporation varies depending on lake structure hydrogeological conditions around the lake and climate i e site dependency the objective of this study was to calculate and compare the sensitivities of lake evaporation to each meteorological factor via numerical simulations under different timescales and types of climate change to accomplish the study goal five meteorological factors solar radiation atmospheric radiation air temperature relative humidity and wind speed were fixed as input parameters into a lake evaporation model for a temperate and deep lake lake ikeda japan to minutely investigate the evaporative responses to climate change the sensitivities of four evaporation related variables of lake surface temperature the temperature and vapor pressure differences between the lake surface and the atmosphere and atmospheric stability near the lake surface were also numerically computed along with the sensitivity of evaporation two climate scenarios were designed for lake ikeda for a 36 year period and sensitivity analyses sas 1 and 2 were performed for each scenario it was hypothesized that in the first scenario sa 1 the climate would shift unidirectionally in the future whereas in the second scenario sa 2 seasonal climate variability would change the arithmetic 36 year averages of the amount and variability of evaporation were used as indices for the climate effect assessment on evaporation the present study focused on evaporation as water loss from lakes for which the influence of evaporation on water storage is more significant over longer timescales therefore annual and monthly seasonal data were calculated by averaging the daily outputs from the model the results from this study were compared with those from other lakes in order to infer possible common patterns although previous datasets are limited 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site lake ikeda is located in the southwest region of kagoshima japan 31 14 n 130 55 e and has been an important freshwater resource for the irrigation of approximately 6000 ha of the surrounding agricultural lands since 1983 ito et al 2009 it is a caldera lake formed by volcanic activity more than 5000 years ago and is classified as a semi closed lake without large inlet or outlet streams but with groundwater outflow through the lakebed ito et al 2009 the lake surface area is 10 62 km2 within a catchment area of 22 96 km2 the lake level is at approximately 64 m amsl maximum and mean depths of the lake are 233 m and 125 m respectively making it the fourth deepest lake in japan the region around the lake is temperate and humid with a mean annual air temperature of 18 1 a mean annual relative humidity of 73 6 table 1 and mean annual precipitation of 2408 mm from 1978 to 2013 the surface water temperature generally ranges from 10 in winter to 30 in summer and the climatic conditions in this region typically induce a uniform 10 vertical water temperature profile each winter in february momii and ito 2008 2 2 meteorological data we collected meteorological data from two local stations managed by the japan meteorological agency http www jma go jp to numerically compute the lake evaporation these stations are 25 km west makurazaki and 5 km east ibusuki of lake ikeda daily values of average humidity atmospheric pressure and wind speed were obtained from makurazaki station while daily values of average air temperature wind speed and sunshine duration were obtained from ibusuki station the precisions of the meteorological instruments are 0 15 1 0 0 2 m s 1 0 15 hpa and 2 0 for temperature humidity wind speed atmospheric pressure and sunshine duration respectively and follow the observational standards by the commission for instruments and methods of observation cimo wind speed data were corrected using a quadric function based on the observation that the wind speed at ibusuki station is overestimated at the lake during strong winds ito and momii 2015 the corrected data were used as wind speed at 2 m height above the lake surface as there are no observations for radiation fluxes at the lake these were estimated using meteorological data air temperature relative humidity sunshine duration and atmospheric pressure and the model proposed by kondo and xu 1997 which was verified in a previous study momii and ito 2008 2 3 lake evaporation model and model verification the evaporation from lake ikeda was numerically computed using a one dimensional model often employed for deep lakes which simulates from the lake surface to the lakebed in the model the energy budget equation across the lake surface takes the form 1 s r n h l e where s is the lake storage heat r n is the net radiation h is the sensible heat l is the latent heat of vaporization and e is the lake evaporation i e le is the latent heat for a deep lake with a large heat capacity such as lake ikeda the heat fluxes associated with inflow and outflow of water masses are neglected brutsaert 1982 assouline and mahrer 1993 thus s was estimated based on the temporal change in the thermal content of the lake as 2 s 0 z b c w œÅ w t w t d z where z b is the depth to the lake bottom c w is the specific heat of water œÅw is the density of water and t w z t a function of depth z and time t is the lake water temperature in the model t w z t is numerically determined by a one dimensional heat transfer model e g swayne et al 2005 where data of the vertical water temperature profile on the first day are required as the initial temperature condition the net radiation r n is expressed as the radiation budget 3 r n 1 Œ± w r s Œµ w r a œÉ s t s 4 where Œ±w is the surface albedo 0 06 r s is the solar radiation to the lake surface Œµw is the emissivity coefficient of water 0 97 r a is the downward atmospheric longwave radiation œÉs is the stefan boltzmann constant and t s is the surface water temperature the latent heat le and the sensible heat h across the water surface are given as aerodynamic bulk formulae 4 h c a œÅ a c b u Œ¥t 5 l e c a œÅ a c b u 1 Œ≥ Œ¥e where c a is the specific heat of air œÅa is the density of air u is the wind speed 2 m above the water surface Œ¥t t s t a is the temperature difference between the water surface temperature t s and the air temperature t a Œ≥ is the psychrometric constant and Œ¥e e s e a is the vapor pressure difference between the vapor pressure at the water surface e s and the vapor pressure in the atmosphere e a the bulk transfer coefficient c b was assumed to be the same for sensible and latent heat to include atmospheric stability hondzo and stefan 1991 lee and swancar 1997 c b was modeled by the atmospheric stability parameter Œª which is expressed as 6 Œª t a t s u 2 7 c b c 1 Œª c 2 where c 1 and c 2 are constants as the value of c 1 in eq 7 is generally negative the stability parameter Œª decreases and the bulk transfer coefficient c b tends to increase during winter periods lee and swancar 1997 for lake ikeda c 1 0 002 and c 2 0 0012 as determined by comparison of the measured and calculated daily mean surface water temperature for a year momii and ito 2008 lake ikeda is considered a suitable candidate for the analysis of evaporation because the anthropogenic effects on the lake are limited e g it has a small catchment without large rivers the validity of the model has already been confirmed by previous studies momii and ito 2008 ito et al 2009 ito and momii 2015 when all model constants parameters and meteorological data are given each energy budget component is expressed as a function of t s thus the model computes e under which t s is determined so as to balance the heat fluxes across the lake surface under a given meteorological condition e is obtained by dividing le in eq 5 by l and is output daily where the detailed calculation of the initial and boundary conditions convergence criterion time step and heat transfer parameters followed that of ito and momii 2015 the estimated seasonal changes in le by the breb method brutsaert 1982 asce 1996 are reproduced well by the model in which the calculated water temperature agrees well with the measured value the difference between the monthly e estimated by the breb method and the numerical model in a 43 month period from 1999 to 2005 is summarized as the root mean square error rmse 0 51 mm day 1 the mean bias error mbe 0 17 mm day 1 and the correlation coefficient r 0 93 fig 1 seasonal changes in evaporation from lake ikeda can be calculated with sufficient accuracy using the proposed model 2 4 sensitivity analysis the sensitivities of e to meteorological changes were examined based on numerical computations for 36 years during the analyses e was output daily from 1 february 1977 to 31 december 2013 however the output e from 1978 to 2013 36 year was used in these analyses because the seasonal variations in the calculated energy budget were unstable for approximately one year after the start of the calculation this was owing to inconsistencies in the thermal balance between the hypothetical meteorological conditions and the vertical water temperature profile given under actual conditions thus the sensitivities of e were analyzed using the daily output from 1978 to 2013 to perform two sensitivity analyses sas 1 and 2 climate scenarios 1 and 2 were assumed by means of changing meteorological factors fig 2 in both scenarios the five meteorological factors of r s r a t a rh and u were changed by rates of 20 15 10 5 5 10 15 and 20 relative to each actual 0 condition where each factor was assumed as an independent variable with no interactions to derive the effect of each individual factor on e in sa 1 fig 2a the daily meteorological factors were corrected by adding the product of the change rate e g 20 and the actual daily values e g actual t a to the actual values for instance t a 0 2 t a thus sa 1 simulates evaporation from the lake under the first climate scenario where climate shifts unidirectionally independent of season in this scenario the 20 change in t a yielded a mean temperature rise of 3 6 corresponding to the projected mean t a rise for the late 21 st century in case of the rcp8 5 scenario introduced in the fifth assessment report ar 5 of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2013 the 5 change in r s yielded a mean increase of 7 9 w m 2 corresponding to the condition in which the radiative forcing is changed by r s alone in the rcp8 5 scenario in sa 2 fig 2b the daily meteorological factors were corrected by adding the product of the change rate e g 20 and the difference of the annual mean e g actual t a mean a from the monthly mean e g actual t a mean m to the daily values e g actual t a for instance t a 0 2 t a mean m t a mean a regarding the corrected meteorological factors the monthly standard deviations were set to each change rate but the annual mean was equivalent to the actual annual mean thus sa 2 simulates the evaporation from the lake under the second climate scenario where the seasonal variability in climate increases or decreases depending on the change rate used to evaluate the effects on e in more detail the responses of four evaporation related factors t s Œ¥t Œ¥e and Œª were additionally investigated the effects of meteorological changes on e and the four related factors were evaluated using two indices in sas 1 and 2 the first index considers the magnitude of e t s Œ¥t Œ¥e and Œª and is calculated as 8 Œ¥x x sim x act where x is e t s Œ¥t Œ¥e or Œª x sim is x simulated when r s r a t a rh or u are changed individually and x act is x calculated under actual meteorological conditions the second index considers the temporal variabilities in e t s Œ¥t Œ¥e and Œª and is calculated as the difference in the standard deviation of each variable 9 Œ¥ œÉ x œÉ xsim œÉ xact where œÉx is the standard deviation of e t s Œ¥t Œ¥e or Œª œÉxsim is œÉx simulated when r s r a t a rh or u are changed individually and œÉxact is œÉx calculated under actual conditions in this study the monthly and annual Œ¥x were calculated using the monthly and annual averages of x sim and x act from 1978 to 2013 respectively and the monthly and annual œÉx were likewise calculated using the averages of œÉxsim and œÉxact thus the climatic effects on e t s Œ¥t Œ¥e and Œª were estimated using both indices Œ¥x and Œ¥œÉx which were averaged on a monthly seasonally and annual base for 36 years 3 results and discussion 3 1 annual and seasonal lake evaporation and meteorological parameters annual statistics of lake evaporation e and meteorological variables were investigated table 1 the numerical model estimated a mean annual e of 932 4 mm from 1978 to 2013 in lake ikeda the standard deviation œÉe of the annual e was 44 mm with a coefficient of variation cv of 4 7 e increased by 2 11 mm y 1 with a significantly monotonic upward trend p 2 4 10 3 based on the mann kendall test hirsch et al 1982 annual solar radiation r s atmospheric radiation r a air temperature t a relative humidity rh and wind speed u were 158 8 w m 2 353 7 w m 2 18 1 73 6 and 2 2 m s 1 respectively the standard deviations of the five meteorological variables œÉrs œÉra œÉta œÉrh and œÉu were 5 5 w m 2 2 8 w m 2 0 45 1 9 and 0 11 m s 1 respectively the calculated cv values showed relatively large variabilities in r s and u the smallest variability was in r a ranging from one sixth to one third of the other values during the 36 year period most of the variables had an upward trend p 2 0 10 4 to p 6 1 10 2 except for rh p 5 6 10 7 similar downward trends of rh have been observed at many other places in japan including abashiri city 44 1 n 144 11 e to ishigaki city 24 20 n 124 10 e according to the database of the japan meteorological agency http www jma go jp r s and rh had relatively high r values of 0 75 and 0 61 for e while the other variables were not correlated details about the relationship between e and the five investigated meteorological variables are discussed in the following sections monthly e and meteorological variables were calculated and compared r s r a t a and rh generally showed a seasonal variation of high in summer and low in winter although this pattern was opposite for u fig 3 with larger cv values table 2 relative to the annual values table 1 despite the common seasonal variation in meteorological variables with peaks in summer and winter e was maximized in autumn and minimized in spring that is its seasonal pattern did not follow that of the meteorological variables momii and ito 2008 reported that heat stored in the lake from spring to summer is mainly released via latent heat from autumn to winter this means that the seasonal patterns of e are dominated by the thermal balance of the deep lake which has a large heat capacity this results in the absence of a significant and direct correlation between e and meteorological variables i e small values of r in table 2 a further discussion on comparisons between the seasonal patterns of e and the meteorological variables is given in section 3 4 3 2 evaporation under climate scenario 1 sa 1 climate shifts unidirectionally the sensitivities by sa 1 were compared and assessed with that in other lake studies the numerical model estimated the sensitivities of annual evaporation as Œ¥e 124 119 284 261 49 49 53 51 and 3 1 mm y 1 for 10 increases or decreases in r s r a t a rh and u respectively fig 4 a the rates of Œ¥e to the actual mean e 932 mm y 1 corresponded to 13 3 12 8 30 5 28 0 5 3 5 2 5 7 5 5 and 0 3 0 1 for each meteorological variable the crle model for lake nam co china ma et al 2016 estimated the annual Œ¥e of 14 6 14 1 1 7 2 4 and 1 1 0 1 for 10 increases or decreases in r s t a and rh respectively in lake siling co china guo et al 2019 the single layer model estimated the annual Œ¥e of 11 0 10 7 1 4 1 5 and 3 2 3 2 for 10 increases or decreases in r s t a and u respectively in lake vegoritis greece gianniou and antonopoulos 2007 daily mean Œ¥e of 6 1 32 2 and 18 7 were estimated through a numerical simulation under 10 changes in r s r a and t a respectively the rates of lake ikeda do not coincide with those of lake nam co lake siling co and lake vegoritis but are relatively close to those of lake nam co and lake siling co the different e estimation approach timescale in the estimation lake structure and hydrogeological conditions around the lake can result in the Œ¥e difference between the lakes to more precisely study the reasons for the differences in Œ¥e numerical simulations performed under the same analysis conditions at least in terms of timescale are required for the sensitivity analyses for various lakes the discrepancy of larger changes in e enforced by both radiation fluxes r s and r a was investigated figs 4 6 and the reasons for the discrepancy were considered first r a had the second largest energy to change the surface water temperature t s fig 7 a which promotes the phase transition of water from the liquid to the vapor phase as there was no correction of t a in the r a change condition in the sensitivity analysis the large response of t s to a change in r a can make the large change in the temperature difference Œ¥t t s t a fig 7b furthermore it leads to significant shifts in the vapor pressure difference Œ¥e e s e a fig 7c and atmospheric stability Œª fig 7d for instance for an increase in r a t s Œ¥t and Œ¥e increased whereas Œª decreased destabilization of atmosphere all of which enhanced e and thus contributed to the increase in e the inherent energy in r a was approximately twice that in r s table 1 providing about twice the difference between the effects of r a and r s on t s i e Œ¥ts in fig 7a owing to the same mechanism of the effects of r a and r s on Œ¥t Œ¥e and Œª under the hypothetical conditions no changes in other meteorological factors during each change in r a or r s the two times larger Œ¥ts under r a change showed that r a led to twice the change in e compared with r s when using the absolute Œ¥e at the 5 10 15 and 20 changes the mean responses of e to r s and r a were approximately 2 4 and 5 4 times larger than that to t a or rh respectively thus these values suggest a difference between the influence of climate change with r s or r a on e when r s and r a change at the same rate in the future nevertheless in the annual variation of e the effect of r s was superior to that of r a fig 4b in lake ikeda the annual variation of r s was two fold larger than that of r a shown as œÉ in table 1 but the radiative energy in r s was half that in r a table 1 these results indicate that in long term climate change r s and r a are the greatest potential driving forces for e where the difference between the impacts of r s and r a on e comes from discrepancies in inherent energy and variability in each radiation type to further examine the impact of meteorological factors on e the results of the sensitivity analysis of t s Œ¥t Œ¥e and Œª are discussed with reference to the analysis result under a 20 rise in t a fig 7 it is noted that the effect of t a on e does not reach the intensity of r s or r a fig 4a despite the fact that t a is the most important factor for changes in t s fig 7a moreover the relationship between t a and e showed a negative correlation these findings can be explained by an incompatible effect of t a on e that is a rise in t a should lead to a stimulatory effect on e because of an increase in the lake surface vapor pressure e s with rise in t s fig 7a but there were inhibitory effects on e with a decrease in Œ¥e fig 7c and an increase in Œª fig 7d inhibitory effects are especially important and are generated from the dilatory thermal response of the lake water where t s only increased by on average 2 5 for a 3 6 average increase in t a consequently this resulted in a decline in Œ¥t t s t a i e negative Œ¥Œ¥t in fig 7b inducing an average decrease of Œ¥e i e average negative Œ¥Œ¥e in fig 7c throughout the year and an increase in Œª i e positive Œ¥Œª in fig 7d so as to stabilize the atmosphere above the water surface as a function of Œ¥t t a t s in eq 6 these results suggest that under the climate condition of increase in t a the incompatible effect of t a on e depressed e and resulted in negative correlation between t a and e however the inhibitory effect on e with a rise in t a can be altered by changes in other meteorological factors under real climatic conditions r a is dependent on t a e g brutsaert 1982 with a change in r a by t a having a composite or a reinforcing effect on e r a has a positive correlation with t a therefore when r a varies in response to a change in t a although an increase in t a inhibits e the inhibitory effect on e is erased by the stimulatory effect with an increase in r a caused by an increase in t a owing to the large e effect of r a as mentioned above indeed the model simulated a stimulation of e under an increasing t a and an inhibition of e under a decrease in t a by including the effects of r a as a function of t a gray line in fig 4a resulting in differences from the original simulation under which t a did not affect r a line with triangles in fig 4a the results indicate that under warming or cooling climate condition increase or decrease in t a r a working with t a has a dominant effect on e the incompatible effect of t a and dominant effect of r a on e have been hardly discussed previous studies using the crle model ma et al 2016 and numerical evaporation model lazhu et al 2016 for lake nam co the single layer model for lake siling co guo et al 2019 and the evaporation formula based on solar radiation for lake erhai meng et al 2020 presented positive correlations between t a and e however the causes of the positive correlation in these lakes were unclear with no detailed descriptions of the incompatible effect of t a and dominant effect of r a for predicting future lake evaporation more accurately it is important to comprehensively evaluate the impacts of meteorological changes on not only e but also on t s Œ¥t Œ¥e and Œª and to explain the mechanism of evaporation change based on the analysis results 3 3 evaporation under climate scenario 2 sa 2 seasonal climate variability increases or decreases in the second scenario where seasonal changes in a meteorological factor increased or decreased the response of e was different from that in the first scenario the results show that t a had the strongest effect on e among all meteorological factors but indicate a negative correlation see section 3 2 r s and r a had the next strongest effect on e whereas rh and u did not significantly affect e figs 8 10 larger effects of the seasonal variation in t a on the seasonal e were caused by a dilatory reaction of t s to a change in t a as discussed for the first scenario see section 3 2 as well as by the fact that t a had the largest seasonal variation among the five meteorological factors table 2 for instance in the case of a 20 increase in the seasonal variation in t a the changes in the mean t a of 1 64 in summer june to august and 1 72 in winter december to february produced only mean Œ¥ts 0 99 and mean Œ¥ts 1 00 respectively line with triangles in fig 11 a Œ¥ts should be more suppressed in the cases of changes in r s r a rh and u with smaller potential effects on t s when compared with the case of change in t a therefore the effect of seasonal variability in t a on Œ¥ts could be relatively large compared with those of r s r a rh and u consequently the seasonal difference in Œ¥t t s t a increased line with triangles in fig 11b this resulted in decreasing Œ¥e in summer relative to winter line with triangles in fig 11c increasing Œª stabilization of atmosphere in summer and decreasing Œª destabilization of atmosphere in winter line with triangles in fig 11d these seasonal responses of Œ¥e and Œª to t a inhibited e in summer and stimulated it in winter line with triangles in fig 9 which was the most notable among all meteorological factors investigated the dilatory reaction of t s to a change in t a can be exercised for a shorter timescale of the change in t a in the first scenario in which the timescale of the change in t a is longer than in the second scenario the rates of Œ¥ts to the change in t a was 69 2 5 3 6 a global sensitivity analysis by schmid et al 2014 estimated a typical temperature change rate of 70 80 in temperate regions the rate in the first scenario was close to the typical global rate but the rates in the second scenario 60 0 99 1 64 and 58 1 00 1 72 for summer and winter respectively were relatively low the lower rates can be attributed to heat conduction by the energy budget components e g le shown as evaporation in fig 9 between the lake and atmosphere being suppressed by the seasonal switching of conduction conditions during the shorter period in sa 2 since the time required for the response of the water temperature to a change in t a might be insufficient Œ¥ts appears smaller thus the results of the second scenario confirm that the response of e to changes in climate is characterized by the thermal dilatory effect in the t s response to t a which is potentiated by the seasonal switching effect of the condition of heat conduction between the lake surface and atmosphere it is interesting to note that the annual amount of e was altered according to the seasonal variations in meteorology fig 8a regardless of there being no change in the annual variability of e fig 8b since the second climate scenario does not include differences between the annual means of the actual and virtual meteorological factors see section 2 4 the climatic effects on the annual variability of e were fairly small fig 8b nevertheless an increase or decrease in the annual amounts of e was simulated in the cases of r s r a and t a but not in the cases of rh and u fig 8a this was attributable to an exponential change in e s when estimating Œ¥e an increased seasonal variation of r s for instance enhanced e s in summer by a small increase in t s line with gray circles in fig 11a while e s hardly declined with a small decrease in t s line with gray circles in fig 11a in winter the magnitude of the change in e s i e Œ¥es was larger in summer than in winter because e s exponentially increases with temperature that is the increase is large in summer with high temperatures and small in winter with low temperatures hence in spite of equivalent increases and decreases in t s in summer and winter respectively Œ¥e increased more intensely in summer line with gray circles in fig 11c consequently as the seasonal variation in Œ¥e was large and unbalanced the annual Œ¥e increased leading to an increase in the annual amount of e line with gray circles in fig 8a this mechanism also applies to r a and t a but with the opposite direction for t a and demonstrates that the extreme seasonal variations in r s r a and t a caused the changes in the annual amount of e as well as changes in the seasonal fig 10 but not annual variability fig 8b nowadays unusual climatic phenomena such as droughts and floods as indicated by ar 5 ipcc 2013 and increase in seasonal variation of t a as indicated by imada et al 2017 are of specific concern therefore the results in this scenario would be essential for examining the energy budgets or evaporative events in a lake under unusual climate conditions such as heat waves droughts or cold snaps in the future 3 4 comparison of evaporative response to meteorological change in different lakes we first focus on r a which is a key factor in evaporation studies r a is the most significant energy source of all incoming energy to evaporate water schmid et al 2014 as noted through the 21 year numerical energy budget analysis for lake ikeda momii and ito 2008 and intensive e observations for several lakes sturrock et al 1992 sacks et al 1994 lee and swancar 1997 winter et al 2003 lenters et al 2005 in north america table 3 and fig 12 this supports our study findings r a is the largest potential driving force for the evaporation of water as indicated in sa 1 however this finding cannot be obtained by a simple statistical analysis or through the comparison of correlation coefficients because the actual r a may have smaller variabilities see next paragraph and is dependent on other factors such as t a and rh indeed there was no significant relationship between e and r a in lake ikeda tables 1 and 2 to precisely understand the role of r a in evaporation processes it is necessary to considering the nonlinear relationship between e and r a that is the effects of r a on t s or Œ¥e as shown in fig 7 simple error analyses using the breb method showed that e is very sensitive to errors in r a in several north american lakes sacks et al 1994 lee and swancar 1997 lenters et al 2005 implying an inherent potential driving force of r a although there are few studies taking these nonlinear relationships into consideration gianniou and antonopoulos 2007 using similar numerical model as in this study indicated that r a has the greatest impact on the evaporation from lake vegoritis common findings across various lakes were observed for the annual variations in r a and r s the annual variability in r a was smallest when compared with the other meteorological variables and e cv in table 1 indicating no correlation between r a and e a minor variability in r a was also found for lake biwa lake kasumigaura and lake towada in japan the coefficients of variation cv 1 0 1 1 and 1 3 respectively of r a for the three lakes were estimated using the radiation model kondo and xu 1997 and meteorological data http www jma go jp observed around the lakes and were smaller than the cvs recorded for the other meteorological variables table 4 in contrast large cv values for r s were observed for these lakes as well as lake ikeda table 1 in lake ikeda the large annual variation in r s induced the major variability to e fig 4b such impacts of r s on e have also been reported in some previous studies on lake ziway in ethiopia vallet coulomb et al 2001 lake sparkling in the usa lenters et al 2005 lake dongping in china rong et al 2013 lake taihu in china hu et al 2017 and lake van in turkey aydin and karaku≈ü 2016 table 3 and fig 12 with a significant correlation between e and r s as confirmed for lake ikeda table 1 the annual impacts of r s can be detected even through simple correlative analyses since real r s may have larger annual variability and can be estimated as an independent variable not associated with other meteorological factors it has to be noted that lakes in polar and high altitude regions likely need to be exempted from the above findings because r s and r a can vary depending on latitude orvig 1970 brutsaert 2005 and altitude lazhu et al 2016 friedrich et al 2018 we considered not only the relationships between e and meteorological factors described in section 3 1 but also the relationships between e and t s or Œ¥e the seasonal pattern of e was not consistent with that of the five meteorological factors r s r a t a rh and u fig 3 and there was no significant correlation between e and each factor table 2 in lake sparkling lenters et al 2005 the seasonal e correlates highly with r n t s t a u and Œ¥e r 0 78 0 96 0 93 0 90 and 0 96 respectively in lake ikeda r was 0 36 0 39 0 17 0 34 and 0 90 for these variables respectively lake sparkling is shallow and ice covered during winter and has a small lake surface area in contrast to lake ikeda moreover the hydrogeological characteristics such as catchment area and vegetation around the lake differ from those of lake ikeda e g ito et al 2009 therefore the discrepancies in the r values between lake ikeda and lake sparkling appear to be attributable to the differences in the structural and hydrogeological characteristics of both lakes nevertheless the r values of Œ¥e were high in both lakes the strong dependency of Œ¥e on e has been measured on timescales of shorter than a month in several lakes yamamoto and kondo 1964 ikebuchi et al 1988 sturrock et al 1992 sacks et al 1994 gianniou and antonopoulos 2007 wang et al 2014 table 3 and fig 12 for timescales of less than a month Œ¥e was confirmed to be an informative parameter for estimating and measuring e from lakes even with different structure and hydrogeological conditions the relationship between t a and t s one of the key factors affecting e was compared and evaluated the air temperature t a was found to have the greatest potential effect on t s fig 7a for sa 1 and fig 11a for sa 2 on time scales covering more than a month high correlations between t s and t a have been reported for several lakes including lake williams in the usa sturrock et al 1992 lake serra azul in brazil dos reis and dias 1998 lake vegoritis in greece gianniou and antonopoulos 2007 lake sparkling in the usa lenters et al 2005 and lake van in turkey aydin and karaku≈ü 2016 table 3 and fig 12 both monthly temperatures in lake ikeda were also highly correlated with an r of 0 97 however in lake harp canada different simulation results wherein r a strongly affected t s were reported hadley et al 2014 it seems that this inconsistency was due to the limited period of study shorter than a year for the sensitivity analysis of lake harp as a case study for long term analysis the global scale 30 year sensitivity analysis of schmid et al 2014 revealed a significant increase in t s with a rise in t a in many lakes under various conditions e g lake structure hydrogeological condition and climate the consistency of our results with those of a long term global study concerning the t a t s relationship verifies that our results well represent the thermal features of the temperate deep lake finally the common characteristics between lake ikeda and various lakes worldwide are summarized as follows table 3 and fig 12 in the first scenario sa 1 which hypothesized a unidirectional climate shift in the future the greatest potential driving force for e was a shift in r a and the shift in r s had the greatest effect on the annual variability of e these results are likely also valid for various other lakes in europe asia and north america which are located from 30 n to 45 n as described above except for lakes in high altitude regions in the second scenario sa 2 which hypothesized extreme seasonal variations in future climates t a was the most significant factor for seasonal and annual e and the greatest potential driving force of t s in section 3 3 we discussed the seasonal temperature dependency of e s where Œ¥e is key for the evaporative processes in this scenario in this section the significant correlation between Œ¥e and e and the strong dependency of t s on t a were confirmed for various lakes with different structures and hydrogeological conditions which coincide with the results for lake ikeda therefore it can be inferred that the large climatic impact on e originates from the extreme variation in t a at least on a monthly timescale for the lakes investigated between 30 n and 45 n 4 conclusions when accurately estimating the influence of the meteorological factor on the lake evaporation e the requisite assessments can be enumerated as follows 1 a comprehensive assessment of the responses of e and e related variables such as lake surface temperature t s to the meteorological change 2 the assessment of the influence of the type of meteorological change i e different climate scenarios and 3 the assessment of the influence of the timescale on the analysis results in this study sensitivity analyses employing a 36 year numerical simulation were designed to address the above key assessments the effects of changes in climate on monthly and annual e from lake ikeda were estimated by two sensitivity analyses in different climate scenarios in the first scenario unidirectional shifts in climate revealed the behavior of e and t s for changes in each meteorological factor solar r s and atmospheric radiation r a were the greatest potential driving forces for e the mean contributions of r s and r a to change in the annual mean value of e were 2 4 and 5 4 times larger than that of air temperature t a or relative humidity rh respectively the discrepancy between the effects of r s and r a on e is induced by the magnitudes of the inherent energy and the variabilities of each radiation type t a was the third effective factor for e and was the greatest potential driving force for t s the e response to change in t a showed a negative correlation explained by an incompatible e effect of the lake surface vapor pressure e s vapor pressure difference Œ¥e and atmospheric stability Œª however under the real condition where r a works in combination with t a e had a positive correlation with t a due to the effect of r a which is the greatest driving force for e therefore r a should be dominant for e in a warming or cooling climate such detailed analyses and findings are unprecedented indicating the significance of the comprehensive assessment with e and e related variables e g t s Œ¥e and Œª for the second scenario in which the seasonal climate variability changed t a had the strongest effect on the seasonal and annual e where the evaporative response to climate change was different from that in the first scenario in this scenario stronger influence of the seasonal variability in t a on the seasonal e was caused by the thermal dilatory effect in the t s response to t a inhibiting the change in t s Œ¥ts the suppression of Œ¥ts becomes pronounced in the case of change in r s r a rh and wind speed u with smaller potential effects on t s when compared with the case of change in t a therefore the effect of seasonal variability in t a on Œ¥ts could be relatively large resulting in the larger effect on seasonal e the results also indicated that the thermal dilatory effect is potentiated by the seasonal switching of the condition of heat conduction between the lake surface and atmosphere moreover the seasonal Œ¥ts gave the large change in Œ¥e during the summer season owing to the temperature dependency of e s the seasonal unbalance in Œ¥e produced the greatest annual change in e under change in t a demonstrating the mechanism of the climatic effects of annual e when seasonal climate variability changes in the future these findings would be useful for the examination of energy budgets or evaporative events in a lake under extreme changes in climate such as heat waves droughts and cold snaps to evaluate a site dependent difference in the climatic effects on e the results were compared with previous evaporation studies of several lakes monthly or annual commonalities of the driving forces of e and t s correlations between e and r s r a t a or Œ¥e and variabilities of meteorological factors were summarized for lakes located between 30 n 45 n worldwide correlative analyses for the assessments of climatic effects on e were also compared with the numerical analyses of this study confirming the advantages of numerical analysis the present sensitivity analysis through numerical simulation is valuable for understanding the evaporative mechanism under meteorological change estimating the meteorological

8232,study region lake ikeda japan study focus few previous studies on the contribution of meteorological factors to lake evaporation e have been conducted with comprehensive analyses of lake surface temperature t s under different climate scenarios this study aimed to compute and compare the sensitivities of monthly and annual e to changes in solar r s and atmospheric radiation r a air temperature t a relative humidity rh and wind speed u under two climate scenarios through a 36 year numerical simulation for lake ikeda new hydrological insights for the region where climate shifted unidirectionally r s and r a were the greatest driving forces for e the mean contributions of r s and r a to annual e change were approximated to be 2 4 and 5 4 times larger than that of t a or rh respectively thus under warming or cooling condition around the lake r a working with t a was dominant for e in contrast considering seasonal climate variability a remarkable effect of the seasonal variability in t a on e indicating negative correlation was estimated e changes were characterized by the dilatory thermal reaction of t s enhanced by the seasonal switching effect of heat conduction between the lake and atmosphere and seasonal temperature dependency of vapor pressure the driving factors of e and t s correlations between e and meteorological factors and variabilities of meteorological factors were compared and summarized for lakes located between 30 n 45 n worldwide keywords lake evaporation surface water temperature meteorology numerical simulation climate scenario sensitivity analysis 1 introduction over the land surfaces of the earth evaporation contributes on average approximately 60 65 of the average precipitation making this factor the second most important component of the hydrological cycle after precipitation brutsaert 2005 in the climatology of the hydrological cycle lakes are primary water resources where evaporation is one of the essential water budget components and the primary component for water loss hostetler and bartlein 1990 recent climatic variations and increased freshwater demand due to an increase in the human population have increased the significance of quantifying lake evaporation to achieve a steady and sustainable water resource management it is indispensable to evaluate the impact of climate change on lake evaporation and to accurately predict future evaporation correlative analysis is useful for the study of meteorological effects on lake evaporation and the results are sorted according to timescales friedrich et al 2018 summarized that the driving force of reservoir evaporation was wind for diurnal wind and air temperature for diurnal to seasonal and wind air temperature and radiation for seasonal to interannual timescales in lake erhai china lake evaporation measured by the eddy covariance method correlates to daily and weekly wind speed correlation coefficients of r 0 76 and 0 62 respectively monthly air temperature r 0 74 and annual solar radiation r 0 81 meng et al 2020 similar results were obtained through correlative analyses on biweekly to annual timescales using the bowen ratio energy budget breb method brutsaert 1982 asce 1996 in lake sparkling usa lenters et al 2005 these results suggest that an increase in radiation requires significantly more time for an evaporative response compared with a brief increase in wind speed weeks to month and the response to a change in air temperature can happen more quickly than that of radiation and more slowly than that of wind speed to quantitatively assess relationships between lake evaporation and meteorological factors sensitivity analyses using various evaporation estimation approaches have been applied to several lakes the breb method the penman method penman 1948 and the complementary relationship lake evaporation crle model morton 1983a b show that monthly evaporation from lake ziway ethiopia is sensitive to solar radiation given that the sensitivities were different among the approaches evaporation changed by 14 5 11 2 and 6 9 with 10 change in solar radiation respectively vallet coulomb et al 2001 in lake vegoritis greece a numerical simulation estimated that lake evaporation changed by 6 1 32 2 and 18 7 with 10 changes in solar radiation atmospheric radiation and air temperature respectively gianniou and antonopoulos 2007 recently the crle model applied to lake nam co china estimated annual evaporation changes of 14 6 14 1 1 7 2 4 and 1 1 0 1 for 10 increases decreases in solar radiation air temperature and relative humidity respectively ma et al 2016 in lake siling co china a single layer model computed the annual evaporative sensitivities of 11 0 10 7 1 4 1 5 and 3 2 3 2 to 10 increases decreases in solar radiation air temperature and wind speed respectively guo et al 2019 in lake taihu china field observations and numerical simulations revealed that solar and atmospheric radiation were the main factors for the annual variability in evaporation hu et al 2017 xiao et al 2020 analogous results were found in lake dongping china based on statistical analyses rong et al 2013 and in lake nam co where the complex influences of solar radiation atmospheric radiation and air temperature on annual variations in evaporation were estimated lazhu et al 2016 moreover in lake erhai an evaporation estimation formula based on solar radiation evaluated that the contribution of air temperature to the upward trend of annual evaporation for 38 years was 2 3 times larger than that of solar radiation meng et al 2020 although these studies were valuable as quantitative investigations of the evaporative response to meteorological changes comparisons or discussion of the results are limited by the differences in analysis conditions e g timescale and estimation method and lack of information about the evaporation related variables e g lake surface temperature and vapor pressure difference when examining the evaporative response to climate change using sensitivity analysis the analysis should be designed to include the following steps first to compare the analysis results between different timescales it is necessary to organize the results for each timescale i e time dependency second to verify the analysis values and to study the evaporative response in detail the response should be analyzed and discussed in combination with evaporation related variables such as lake surface temperature and vapor pressure difference third the difference in the type of meteorological change e g a meteorological factor changes over a year or only during specific season should be considered in the analysis because the sensitivity analysis results should be different for each type of meteorological change i e time dependency finally the comparison of analysis results among several lakes is indispensable since the driving force of evaporation varies depending on lake structure hydrogeological conditions around the lake and climate i e site dependency the objective of this study was to calculate and compare the sensitivities of lake evaporation to each meteorological factor via numerical simulations under different timescales and types of climate change to accomplish the study goal five meteorological factors solar radiation atmospheric radiation air temperature relative humidity and wind speed were fixed as input parameters into a lake evaporation model for a temperate and deep lake lake ikeda japan to minutely investigate the evaporative responses to climate change the sensitivities of four evaporation related variables of lake surface temperature the temperature and vapor pressure differences between the lake surface and the atmosphere and atmospheric stability near the lake surface were also numerically computed along with the sensitivity of evaporation two climate scenarios were designed for lake ikeda for a 36 year period and sensitivity analyses sas 1 and 2 were performed for each scenario it was hypothesized that in the first scenario sa 1 the climate would shift unidirectionally in the future whereas in the second scenario sa 2 seasonal climate variability would change the arithmetic 36 year averages of the amount and variability of evaporation were used as indices for the climate effect assessment on evaporation the present study focused on evaporation as water loss from lakes for which the influence of evaporation on water storage is more significant over longer timescales therefore annual and monthly seasonal data were calculated by averaging the daily outputs from the model the results from this study were compared with those from other lakes in order to infer possible common patterns although previous datasets are limited 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site lake ikeda is located in the southwest region of kagoshima japan 31 14 n 130 55 e and has been an important freshwater resource for the irrigation of approximately 6000 ha of the surrounding agricultural lands since 1983 ito et al 2009 it is a caldera lake formed by volcanic activity more than 5000 years ago and is classified as a semi closed lake without large inlet or outlet streams but with groundwater outflow through the lakebed ito et al 2009 the lake surface area is 10 62 km2 within a catchment area of 22 96 km2 the lake level is at approximately 64 m amsl maximum and mean depths of the lake are 233 m and 125 m respectively making it the fourth deepest lake in japan the region around the lake is temperate and humid with a mean annual air temperature of 18 1 a mean annual relative humidity of 73 6 table 1 and mean annual precipitation of 2408 mm from 1978 to 2013 the surface water temperature generally ranges from 10 in winter to 30 in summer and the climatic conditions in this region typically induce a uniform 10 vertical water temperature profile each winter in february momii and ito 2008 2 2 meteorological data we collected meteorological data from two local stations managed by the japan meteorological agency http www jma go jp to numerically compute the lake evaporation these stations are 25 km west makurazaki and 5 km east ibusuki of lake ikeda daily values of average humidity atmospheric pressure and wind speed were obtained from makurazaki station while daily values of average air temperature wind speed and sunshine duration were obtained from ibusuki station the precisions of the meteorological instruments are 0 15 1 0 0 2 m s 1 0 15 hpa and 2 0 for temperature humidity wind speed atmospheric pressure and sunshine duration respectively and follow the observational standards by the commission for instruments and methods of observation cimo wind speed data were corrected using a quadric function based on the observation that the wind speed at ibusuki station is overestimated at the lake during strong winds ito and momii 2015 the corrected data were used as wind speed at 2 m height above the lake surface as there are no observations for radiation fluxes at the lake these were estimated using meteorological data air temperature relative humidity sunshine duration and atmospheric pressure and the model proposed by kondo and xu 1997 which was verified in a previous study momii and ito 2008 2 3 lake evaporation model and model verification the evaporation from lake ikeda was numerically computed using a one dimensional model often employed for deep lakes which simulates from the lake surface to the lakebed in the model the energy budget equation across the lake surface takes the form 1 s r n h l e where s is the lake storage heat r n is the net radiation h is the sensible heat l is the latent heat of vaporization and e is the lake evaporation i e le is the latent heat for a deep lake with a large heat capacity such as lake ikeda the heat fluxes associated with inflow and outflow of water masses are neglected brutsaert 1982 assouline and mahrer 1993 thus s was estimated based on the temporal change in the thermal content of the lake as 2 s 0 z b c w œÅ w t w t d z where z b is the depth to the lake bottom c w is the specific heat of water œÅw is the density of water and t w z t a function of depth z and time t is the lake water temperature in the model t w z t is numerically determined by a one

expressed as the radiation budget 3 r n 1 Œ± w r s Œµ w r a œÉ s t s 4 where Œ±w is the surface albedo 0 06 r s is the solar radiation to the lake surface Œµw is the emissivity coefficient of water 0

are given as aerodynamic bulk formulae 4 h c a œÅ a c b u Œ¥t 5 l e c a œÅ a c b u 1 Œ≥ Œ¥e where c a is the specific heat of air œÅa is the density of air u is the wind speed 2 m above the water

include atmospheric stability hondzo and stefan 1991 lee and swancar 1997 c b was modeled by the atmospheric stability parameter Œª which is expressed as 6 Œª t a t s u 2 7 c b c 1 Œª c 2 where c 1 and c 2 are constants as the value of c 1 in eq 7 is generally negative the stability parameter Œª decreases and the bulk transfer coefficient c b tends to increase during winter periods lee and swancar 1997 for lake ikeda c 1 0 002 and c 2 0 0012 as determined by comparison of the measured and calculated daily mean surface water temperature for a year momii and ito 2008 lake ikeda is considered a suitable candidate for the analysis of evaporation because the anthropogenic effects on the lake are limited e g it has a small catchment without large rivers the validity of the model has already been confirmed by previous studies momii and ito 2008 ito et al 2009 ito and momii 2015 when all model constants parameters and meteorological data are given each energy budget component is expressed as a function of t s thus the model computes e under which t s is determined so as to balance the heat fluxes across the lake surface under a given meteorological condition e is obtained by dividing le in eq 5 by l and is output daily where the detailed calculation of the initial and boundary conditions convergence criterion time step and heat transfer parameters followed that of ito and momii 2015 the estimated seasonal changes in le by the breb method brutsaert 1982 asce 1996 are reproduced well by the model in which the calculated water temperature agrees well with the measured value the difference between the monthly e estimated by the breb method and the numerical model in a 43 month period from 1999 to 2005 is summarized as the root mean square error rmse 0 51 mm day 1 the mean bias error mbe 0 17 mm day 1 and the correlation coefficient r 0 93 fig 1 seasonal changes in evaporation from lake ikeda can be calculated with sufficient accuracy using the proposed model 2 4 sensitivity analysis the sensitivities of e to meteorological changes were examined based on numerical computations for 36 years during the analyses e was output daily from 1 february 1977 to 31 december 2013 however the output e from 1978 to 2013 36 year was used in these analyses because the seasonal variations in the calculated energy budget were unstable for approximately one year after the start of the calculation this was owing to inconsistencies in the thermal balance between the hypothetical meteorological conditions and the vertical water temperature profile given under actual conditions thus the sensitivities of e were analyzed using the daily output from 1978 to 2013 to perform two sensitivity analyses sas 1 and 2 climate scenarios 1 and 2 were assumed by means of changing meteorological factors fig 2 in both scenarios the five meteorological factors of r s r a t a rh and u were changed by rates of 20 15 10 5 5 10 15 and 20 relative to each actual 0 condition where each factor was assumed as an independent variable with no interactions to derive the effect of each individual factor on e in sa 1 fig 2a the daily meteorological factors were corrected by adding the product of the change rate e g 20 and the actual daily values e g actual t a to the actual values for instance t a 0 2 t a thus sa 1 simulates evaporation from the lake under the first climate scenario where climate shifts unidirectionally independent of season in this scenario the 20 change in t a yielded a mean temperature rise of 3 6 corresponding to the projected mean t a rise for the late 21 st century in case of the rcp8 5 scenario introduced in the fifth assessment report ar 5 of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2013 the 5 change in r s yielded a mean increase of 7 9 w m 2 corresponding to the condition in which the radiative forcing is changed by r s alone in the rcp8 5 scenario in sa 2 fig 2b the daily meteorological factors were corrected by adding the product of the change rate e g 20 and the difference of the annual mean e g actual t a mean a from the monthly mean e g actual t a mean m to the daily values e g actual t a for instance t a 0 2 t a mean m t a mean a regarding the corrected meteorological factors the monthly standard deviations were set to each change rate but the annual mean was equivalent to the actual annual mean thus sa 2 simulates the evaporation from the lake under the second climate scenario where the seasonal variability in climate increases or decreases depending on the change rate used to evaluate the effects on e in more detail the responses of four evaporation related factors t s Œ¥t Œ¥e and Œª were additionally investigated the effects of meteorological changes on e and the four related factors were evaluated using two indices in sas 1 and 2 the first index considers the magnitude of e t s Œ¥t Œ¥e and Œª and is calculated as 8 Œ¥x x sim x act where x is e t s Œ¥t Œ¥e or Œª x sim is x simulated when r s r a t a rh or u are changed individually and x act is x calculated under actual meteorological conditions the second index considers the temporal variabilities in e t s Œ¥t Œ¥e and Œª and is calculated as the difference in the standard deviation of each variable 9 Œ¥ œÉ x œÉ xsim œÉ xact where œÉx is the standard deviation of e t s Œ¥t Œ¥e or Œª œÉxsim is œÉx simulated when r s r a t a rh or u are changed individually and œÉxact is œÉx calculated under actual conditions in this study the monthly and annual Œ¥x were calculated using the monthly and annual averages of x sim and x act from 1978 to 2013 respectively and the monthly and annual œÉx were likewise calculated using the averages of œÉxsim and œÉxact thus the climatic effects on e t s Œ¥t Œ¥e and Œª were estimated using both indices Œ¥x and Œ¥œÉx which were averaged on a monthly seasonally and annual base for 36 years 3 results and discussion 3 1 annual and seasonal lake evaporation and meteorological parameters annual statistics of lake evaporation e and meteorological variables were investigated table 1 the numerical model estimated a mean annual e of 932 4 mm from 1978 to 2013 in lake ikeda the standard deviation œÉe of the annual e was 44 mm with a coefficient of variation cv of 4 7 e increased by 2 11 mm y 1 with a significantly monotonic upward trend p 2 4 10 3 based on the mann kendall test hirsch et al 1982 annual solar radiation r s atmospheric radiation r a air temperature t a relative humidity rh and wind speed u were 158 8 w m 2 353 7 w m 2 18 1 73 6 and 2 2 m s 1 respectively the standard deviations of the five meteorological variables œÉrs œÉra œÉta œÉrh and œÉu were 5 5 w m 2 2 8 w m 2 0 45 1 9 and 0 11 m s 1 respectively the calculated cv values showed relatively large variabilities in r s and u the smallest variability was in r a ranging from one sixth to one third of the other values during the 36 year period most of the variables had an upward trend p 2 0 10 4 to p 6 1 10 2 except for rh p 5 6 10 7 similar downward trends of rh have been observed at many other places in japan including abashiri city 44 1 n 144 11 e to ishigaki city 24 20 n 124 10 e according to the database of the japan meteorological agency http www jma go jp r s and rh had relatively high r values of 0 75 and 0 61 for e while the other variables were not correlated details about the relationship between e and the five investigated meteorological variables are discussed in the following sections monthly e and meteorological variables were calculated and compared r s r a t a and rh generally showed a seasonal variation of high in summer and low in winter although this pattern was opposite for u fig 3 with larger cv values table 2 relative to the annual values table 1 despite the common seasonal variation in meteorological variables with peaks in summer and winter e was maximized in autumn and minimized in spring that is its seasonal pattern did not follow that of the meteorological variables momii and ito 2008 reported that heat stored in the lake from spring to summer is mainly released via latent heat from autumn to winter this means that the seasonal patterns of e are dominated by the thermal balance of the deep lake which has a large heat capacity this results in the absence of a significant and direct correlation between e and meteorological variables i e small values of r in table 2 a further discussion on comparisons between the seasonal patterns of e and the meteorological variables is given in section 3 4 3 2 evaporation under climate scenario 1 sa 1 climate shifts unidirectionally the sensitivities by sa 1 were compared and assessed with that in other lake studies the numerical model estimated the sensitivities of annual evaporation as Œ¥e 124 119 284 261 49 49 53 51 and 3 1 mm y 1 for 10 increases or decreases in r s r a t a rh and u respectively fig 4 a the rates of Œ¥e to the actual mean e 932 mm y 1 corresponded to 13 3 12 8 30 5 28 0 5 3 5 2 5 7 5 5 and 0 3 0 1 for each meteorological variable the crle model for lake nam co china ma et al 2016 estimated the annual Œ¥e of 14 6 14 1 1 7 2 4 and 1 1 0 1 for 10 increases or decreases in r s t a and rh respectively in lake siling co china guo et al 2019 the single layer model estimated the annual Œ¥e of 11 0 10 7 1 4 1 5 and 3 2 3 2 for 10 increases or decreases in r s t a and u respectively in lake vegoritis greece gianniou and antonopoulos 2007 daily mean Œ¥e of 6 1 32 2 and 18 7 were estimated through a numerical simulation under 10 changes in r s r a and t a respectively the rates of lake ikeda do not coincide with those of lake nam co lake siling co and lake vegoritis but are relatively close to those of lake nam co and lake siling co the different e estimation approach timescale in the estimation lake structure and hydrogeological conditions around the lake can result in the Œ¥e difference between the lakes to more precisely study the reasons for the differences in Œ¥e numerical simulations performed under the same analysis conditions at least in terms of timescale are required for the sensitivity analyses for various lakes the discrepancy of larger changes in e enforced by both radiation fluxes r s and r a was investigated figs 4 6 and the reasons for the discrepancy were considered first r a had the second largest energy to change the surface water temperature t s fig 7 a which promotes the phase transition of water from the liquid to the vapor phase as there was no correction of t a in the r a change condition in the sensitivity analysis the large response of t s to a change in r a can make the large change in the temperature difference Œ¥t t s t a fig 7b furthermore it leads to significant shifts in the vapor pressure difference Œ¥e e s e a fig 7c and atmospheric stability Œª fig 7d for instance for an increase in r a t s Œ¥t and Œ¥e increased whereas Œª decreased destabilization of atmosphere all of which enhanced e and thus contributed to the increase in e the inherent energy in r a was approximately twice that in r s table 1 providing about twice the difference between the effects of r a and r s on t s i e Œ¥ts in fig 7a owing to the same mechanism of the effects of r a and r s on Œ¥t Œ¥e and Œª under the hypothetical conditions no changes in other meteorological factors during each change in r a or r s the two times larger Œ¥ts under r a change showed that r a led to twice the change in e compared with r s when using the absolute Œ¥e at the 5 10 15 and 20 changes the mean responses of e to r s and r a were approximately 2 4 and 5 4 times larger than that to t a or rh respectively thus these values suggest a difference between the influence of climate change with r s or r a on e when r s and r a change at the same rate in the future nevertheless in the annual variation of e the effect of r s was superior to that of r a fig 4b in lake ikeda the annual variation of r s was two fold larger than that of r a shown as œÉ in table 1 but the radiative energy in r s was half that in r a table 1 these results indicate that in long term climate change r s and r a are the greatest potential driving forces for e where the difference between the impacts of r s and r a on e comes from discrepancies in inherent energy and variability in each radiation type to further examine the impact of meteorological factors on e the results of the sensitivity analysis of t s Œ¥t Œ¥e and Œª are discussed with reference to the analysis result under a 20 rise in t a fig 7 it is noted that the effect of t a on e does not reach the intensity of r s or r a fig 4a despite the fact that t a is the most important factor for changes in t s fig 7a moreover the relationship between t a and e showed a negative correlation these findings can be explained by an incompatible effect of t a on e that is a rise in t a should lead to a stimulatory effect on e because of an increase in the lake surface vapor pressure e s with rise in t s fig 7a but there were inhibitory effects on e with a decrease in Œ¥e fig 7c and an increase in Œª fig 7d inhibitory effects are especially important and are generated from the dilatory thermal response of the lake water where t s only increased by on average 2 5 for a 3 6 average increase in t a consequently this resulted in a decline in Œ¥t t s t a i e negative Œ¥Œ¥t in fig 7b inducing an average decrease of Œ¥e i e average negative Œ¥Œ¥e in fig 7c throughout the year and an increase in Œª i e positive Œ¥Œª in fig 7d so as to stabilize the atmosphere above the water surface as a function of Œ¥t t a t s in eq 6 these results suggest that under the climate condition of increase in t a the incompatible effect of t a on e depressed e and resulted in negative correlation between t a and e however the inhibitory effect on e with a rise in t a can be altered by changes in other meteorological factors under real climatic conditions r a is dependent on t a e g brutsaert 1982 with a change in r a by t a having a composite or a reinforcing effect on e r a has a positive correlation with t a therefore when r a varies in response to a change in t a although an increase in t a inhibits e the inhibitory effect on e is erased by the stimulatory effect with an increase in r a caused by an increase in t a owing to the large e effect of r a as mentioned above indeed the model simulated a stimulation of e under an increasing t a and an inhibition of e under a decrease in t a by including the effects of r a as a function of t a gray line in fig 4a resulting in differences from the original simulation under which t a did not affect r a line with triangles in fig 4a the results indicate that under warming or cooling climate condition increase or decrease in t a r a working with t a has a dominant effect on e the incompatible effect of t a and dominant effect of r a on e have been hardly discussed previous studies using the crle model ma et al 2016 and numerical evaporation model lazhu et al 2016 for lake nam co the single layer model for lake siling co guo et al 2019 and the evaporation formula based on solar radiation for lake erhai meng et al 2020 presented positive correlations between t a and e however the causes of the positive correlation in these lakes were unclear with no detailed descriptions of the incompatible effect of t a and dominant effect of r a for predicting future lake evaporation more accurately it is important to comprehensively evaluate the impacts of meteorological changes on not only e but also on t s Œ¥t Œ¥e and Œª and to explain the mechanism of evaporation change based on the analysis results 3 3 evaporation under climate scenario 2 sa 2 seasonal climate variability increases or decreases in the second scenario where seasonal changes in a meteorological factor increased or decreased the response of e was different from that in the first scenario the results show that t a had the strongest effect on e among all meteorological factors but indicate a negative correlation see section 3 2 r s and r a had the next strongest effect on e whereas rh and u did not significantly affect e figs 8 10 larger effects of the seasonal variation in t a on the seasonal e were caused by a dilatory reaction of t s to a change in t a as discussed for the first scenario see section 3 2 as well as by the fact that t a had the largest seasonal variation among the five meteorological factors table 2 for instance in the case of a 20 increase in the seasonal variation in t a the changes in the mean t a of 1 64 in summer june to august and 1 72 in winter december to february produced only mean Œ¥ts 0 99 and mean Œ¥ts 1 00 respectively line with triangles in fig 11 a Œ¥ts should be more suppressed in the cases of changes in r s r a rh and u with smaller potential effects on t s when compared with the case of change in t a therefore the effect of seasonal variability in t a on Œ¥ts could be relatively large compared with those of r s r a rh and u consequently the seasonal difference in Œ¥t t s t a increased line with triangles in fig 11b this resulted in decreasing Œ¥e in summer relative to winter line with triangles in fig 11c increasing Œª stabilization of atmosphere in summer and decreasing Œª destabilization of atmosphere in winter line with triangles in fig 11d these seasonal responses of Œ¥e and Œª to t a inhibited e in summer and stimulated it in winter line with triangles in fig 9 which was the most notable among all meteorological factors investigated the dilatory reaction of t s to a change in t a can be exercised for a shorter timescale of the change in t a in the first scenario in which the timescale of the change in t a is longer than in the second scenario the rates of Œ¥ts to the change in t a was 69 2 5 3 6 a global sensitivity analysis by schmid et al 2014 estimated a typical temperature change rate of 70 80 in temperate regions the rate in the first scenario was close to the typical global rate but the rates in the second scenario 60 0 99 1 64 and 58 1 00 1 72 for summer and winter respectively were relatively low the lower rates can be attributed to heat conduction by the energy budget components e g le shown as evaporation in fig 9 between the lake and atmosphere being suppressed by the seasonal switching of conduction conditions during the shorter period in sa 2 since the time required for the response of the water temperature to a change in t a might be insufficient Œ¥ts appears smaller thus the results of the second scenario confirm that the response of e to changes in climate is characterized by the thermal dilatory effect in the t s response to t a which is potentiated by the seasonal switching effect of the condition of heat conduction between the lake surface and atmosphere it is interesting to note that the annual amount of e was altered according to the seasonal variations in meteorology fig 8a regardless of there being no change in the annual variability of e fig 8b since the second climate scenario does not include differences between the annual means of the actual and virtual meteorological factors see section 2 4 the climatic effects on the annual variability of e were fairly small fig 8b nevertheless an increase or decrease in the annual amounts of e was simulated in the cases of r s r a and t a but not in the cases of rh and u fig 8a this was attributable to an exponential change in e s when estimating Œ¥e an increased seasonal variation of r s for instance enhanced e s in summer by a small increase in t s line with gray circles in fig 11a while e s hardly declined with a small decrease in t s line with gray circles in fig 11a in winter the magnitude of the change in e s i e Œ¥es was larger in summer than in winter because e s exponentially increases with temperature that is the increase is large in summer with high temperatures and small in winter with low temperatures hence in spite of equivalent increases and decreases in t s in summer and winter respectively Œ¥e increased more intensely in summer line with gray circles in fig 11c consequently as the seasonal variation in Œ¥e was large and unbalanced the annual Œ¥e increased leading to an increase in the annual amount of e line with gray circles in fig 8a this mechanism also applies to r a and t a but with the opposite direction for t a and demonstrates that the extreme seasonal variations in r s r a and t a caused the changes in the annual amount of e as well as changes in the seasonal fig 10 but not annual variability fig 8b nowadays unusual climatic phenomena such as droughts and floods as indicated by ar 5 ipcc 2013 and increase in seasonal variation of t a as indicated by imada et al 2017 are of specific concern therefore the results in this scenario would be essential for examining the energy budgets or evaporative events in a lake under unusual climate conditions such as heat waves droughts or cold snaps in the future 3 4 comparison of evaporative response to meteorological change in different lakes we first focus on r a which is a key factor in evaporation studies r a is the most significant energy source of all incoming energy to evaporate water schmid et al 2014 as noted through the 21 year numerical energy budget analysis for lake ikeda momii and ito 2008 and intensive e observations for several lakes sturrock et al 1992 sacks et al 1994 lee and swancar 1997 winter et al 2003 lenters et al 2005 in north america table 3 and fig 12 this supports our study findings r a is the largest potential driving force for the evaporation of water as indicated in sa 1 however this finding cannot be obtained by a simple statistical analysis or through the comparison of correlation coefficients because the actual r a may have smaller variabilities see next paragraph and is dependent on other factors such as t a and rh indeed there was no significant relationship between e and r a in lake ikeda tables 1 and 2 to precisely understand the role of r a in evaporation processes it is necessary to considering the nonlinear relationship between e and r a that is the effects of r a on t s or Œ¥e as shown in fig 7 simple error analyses using the breb method showed that e is very sensitive to errors in r a in several north american lakes sacks et al 1994 lee and swancar 1997 lenters et al 2005 implying an inherent potential driving force of r a although there are few studies taking these nonlinear relationships into consideration gianniou and antonopoulos 2007 using similar numerical model as in this study indicated that r a has the greatest impact on the evaporation from lake vegoritis common findings across various lakes were observed for the annual variations in r a and r s the annual variability in r a was smallest when compared with the other meteorological variables and e cv in table 1 indicating no correlation between r a and e a minor variability in r a was also found for lake biwa lake kasumigaura and lake towada in japan the coefficients of variation cv 1 0 1 1 and 1 3 respectively of r a for the three lakes were estimated using the radiation model kondo and xu 1997 and meteorological data http www jma go jp observed around the lakes and were smaller than the cvs recorded for the other meteorological variables table 4 in contrast large cv values for r s were observed for these lakes as well as lake ikeda table 1 in lake ikeda the large annual variation in r s induced the major variability to e fig 4b such impacts of r s on e have also been reported in some previous studies on lake ziway in ethiopia vallet coulomb et al 2001 lake sparkling in the usa lenters et al 2005 lake dongping in china rong et al 2013 lake taihu in china hu et al 2017 and lake van in turkey aydin and karaku≈ü 2016 table 3 and fig 12 with a significant correlation between e and r s as confirmed for lake ikeda table 1 the annual impacts of r s can be detected even through simple correlative analyses since real r s may have larger annual variability and can be estimated as an independent variable not associated with other meteorological factors it has to be noted that lakes in polar and high altitude regions likely need to be exempted from the above findings because r s and r a can vary depending on latitude orvig 1970 brutsaert 2005 and altitude lazhu et al 2016 friedrich et al 2018 we considered not only the relationships between e and meteorological factors described in section 3 1 but also the relationships between e and t s or Œ¥e the seasonal pattern of e was not consistent with that of the five meteorological factors r s r a t a rh and u fig 3 and there was no significant correlation between e and each factor table 2 in lake sparkling lenters et al 2005 the seasonal e correlates highly with r n t s t a u and Œ¥e r 0 78 0 96 0 93 0 90 and 0 96 respectively in lake ikeda r was 0 36 0 39 0 17 0 34 and 0 90 for these variables respectively lake sparkling is shallow and ice covered during winter and has a small lake surface area in contrast to lake ikeda moreover the hydrogeological characteristics such as catchment area and vegetation around the lake differ from those of lake ikeda e g ito et al 2009 therefore the discrepancies in the r values between lake ikeda and lake sparkling appear to be attributable to the differences in the structural and hydrogeological characteristics of both lakes nevertheless the r values of Œ¥e were high in both lakes the strong dependency of Œ¥e on e has been measured on timescales of shorter than a month in several lakes yamamoto and kondo 1964 ikebuchi et al 1988 sturrock et al 1992 sacks et al 1994 gianniou and antonopoulos 2007 wang et al 2014 table 3 and fig 12 for timescales of less than a month Œ¥e was confirmed to be an informative parameter for estimating and measuring e from lakes even with different structure and hydrogeological conditions the relationship between t a and t s one of the key factors affecting e was compared and evaluated the air temperature t a was found to have the greatest potential effect on t s fig 7a for sa 1 and fig 11a for sa 2 on time scales covering more than a month high correlations between t s and t a have been reported for several lakes including lake williams in the usa sturrock et al 1992 lake serra azul in brazil dos reis and dias 1998 lake vegoritis in greece gianniou and antonopoulos 2007 lake sparkling in the usa lenters et al 2005 and lake van in turkey aydin and karaku≈ü 2016 table 3 and fig 12 both monthly temperatures in lake ikeda were also highly correlated with an r of 0 97 however in lake harp canada different simulation results wherein r a strongly affected t s were reported hadley et al 2014 it seems that this inconsistency was due to the limited period of study shorter than a year for the sensitivity analysis of lake harp as a case study for long term analysis the global scale 30 year sensitivity analysis of schmid et al 2014 revealed a significant increase in t s with a rise in t a in many lakes under various conditions e g lake structure hydrogeological condition and climate the consistency of our results with those of a long term global study concerning the t a t s relationship verifies that our results well represent the thermal features of the temperate deep lake finally the common characteristics between lake ikeda and various lakes worldwide are summarized as follows table 3 and fig 12 in the first scenario sa 1 which hypothesized a unidirectional climate shift in the future the greatest potential driving force for e was a shift in r a and the shift in r s had the greatest effect on the annual variability of e these results are likely also valid for various other lakes in europe asia and north america which are located from 30 n to 45 n as described above except for lakes in high altitude regions in the second scenario sa 2 which hypothesized extreme seasonal variations in future climates t a was the most significant factor for seasonal and annual e and the greatest potential driving force of t s in section 3 3 we discussed the seasonal temperature dependency of e s where Œ¥e is key for the evaporative processes in this scenario in this section the significant correlation between Œ¥e and e and the strong dependency of t s on t a were confirmed for various lakes with different structures and hydrogeological conditions which coincide with the results for lake ikeda therefore it can be inferred that the large climatic impact on e originates from the extreme variation in t a at least on a monthly timescale for the lakes investigated between 30 n and 45 n 4 conclusions when accurately estimating the influence of the meteorological factor on the lake evaporation e the requisite assessments can be enumerated as follows 1 a comprehensive assessment of the responses of e and e related variables such as lake surface temperature t s to the meteorological change 2 the assessment of the influence of the type of meteorological change i e different climate scenarios and 3 the assessment of the influence of the timescale on the analysis results in this study sensitivity analyses employing a 36 year numerical simulation were designed to address the above key assessments the effects of changes in climate on monthly and annual e from lake ikeda were estimated by two sensitivity analyses in different climate scenarios in the first scenario unidirectional shifts in climate revealed the behavior of e and t s for changes in each meteorological factor solar r s and atmospheric radiation r a were the greatest potential driving forces for e the mean contributions of r s and r a to change in the annual mean value of e were 2 4 and 5 4 times larger than that of air temperature t a or relative humidity rh respectively the discrepancy between the effects of r s and r a on e is induced by the magnitudes of the inherent energy and the variabilities of each radiation type t a was the third effective factor for e and was the greatest potential driving force for t s the e response to change in t a showed a negative correlation explained by an incompatible e effect of the lake surface vapor pressure e s vapor pressure difference Œ¥e and atmospheric stability Œª however under the real condition where r a works in combination with t a e had a positive correlation with t a due to the effect of r a which is the greatest driving force for e therefore r a should be dominant for e in a warming or cooling climate such detailed analyses and findings are unprecedented indicating the significance of the comprehensive assessment with e and e related variables e g t s Œ¥e and Œª for the second scenario in which the seasonal climate variability changed t a had the strongest effect on the seasonal and annual e where the evaporative response to climate change was different from that in the first scenario in this scenario stronger influence of the seasonal variability in t a on the seasonal e was caused by the thermal dilatory effect in the t s response to t a inhibiting the change in t s Œ¥ts the suppression of Œ¥ts becomes pronounced in the case of change in r s r a rh and wind speed u with smaller potential effects on t s when compared with the case of change in t a therefore the effect of seasonal variability in t a on Œ¥ts could be relatively large resulting in the larger effect on seasonal e the results also indicated that the thermal dilatory effect is potentiated by the seasonal switching of the condition of heat conduction between the lake surface and atmosphere moreover the seasonal Œ¥ts gave the large change in Œ¥e during the summer season owing to the temperature dependency of e s the seasonal unbalance in Œ¥e produced the greatest annual change in e under change in t a demonstrating the mechanism of the climatic effects of annual e when seasonal climate variability changes in the future these findings would be useful for the examination of energy budgets or evaporative events in a lake under extreme changes in climate such as heat waves droughts and cold snaps to evaluate a site dependent difference in the climatic effects on e the results were compared with previous evaporation studies of several lakes monthly or annual commonalities of the driving forces of e and t s correlations between e and r s r a t a or Œ¥e and variabilities of meteorological factors were summarized for lakes located between 30 n 45 n worldwide correlative analyses for the assessments of climatic effects on e were also compared with the numerical analyses of this study confirming the advantages of numerical analysis the present sensitivity analysis through numerical simulation is valuable for understanding the evaporative mechanism under meteorological change estimating the meteorological observation error included in the calculation of lake evaporation and obtaining fundamental insights into the effects of climate change on lake evaporation in the future author statement y ito

floodplains imposing runoff and soil erosion in the upper catchments and flooding and sedimentation at floodplains this study was conducted in the upland runoff source catchments study focus the focus is to investigate catchment characteristics that control the event runoff response in upland catchments and how recent land management practices may have contributed to improved hydrological conditions event rainfall and runoff data were obtained at five minute time steps through automated divers and tipping bucket rain gauges and related to catchment characteristics new hydrological insights for the region our results show that the catchment event quickflow response was controlled by different factors of both natural and anthropogenic nature of which forest and shrubs bund

complex process controlled by catchment characteristics including land use and management soil topography and lithology sitterson et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 it is a hydrological process that has a high degree of temporal and spatial variability de vente and poesen 2005 lemma et al 2018 2019a for instance the hydrological response of small catchments is mostly different and more variable than that of large catchments pilgrim et al 1982 while runoff processes are relatively well understood at the plot scale the runoff generated from small catchments i e 1 100 ha is rather complex and underrepresented in hydrological studies de vente and poesen 2005 johansson 1994 poesen 2018 the complexity of the hydrological response of small catchments is partly due to the effect of variations in routing and connectivity of the different units boardman 2018 heckmann et al 2018 but also to interactions of surface and sub surface hydrological processes which become more important at catchment

total of n 2348 rainfall runoff events were analysed for all sub catchments occurring during the rainy seasons of three consecutive years sixty percent of the events had p 5 mm average event p and i 30 did not vary significantly among the sub catchments p 0 05 however temporal variation was significant with p in june and i 30 in august being higher than in other months fig 5 fig 6 in addition average event rainfall variability was significant across years 4 2 spatial and temporal variability of hydrological variables baseflow q b for the wet season starts in late june to early july peaked in august and declined gradually towards november fig 5 it was significantly higher in august than in other months p 0 01 the average baseflow coefficient rc b during rainfall runoff event was 7 3 while that of the seasonal rc b which also includes the baseflow between runoff events was 25 quickflow there was significant variation in mean event q qf among sub catchments and years p 0 05 table 2 fig 6 the average quickflow depth at sc6 was significantly lower than that at sc4 however there was no significant difference in q qf among the remaining catchments the average q qf depth increased from june to august when it was at its highest and then declined until october the average rc qf across all catchments and years was 17 lag time q l varied significantly among the sub catchments p 0 05 the average q l at sc3 was significantly lower than the average q l at sc5 and sc6 table 2 4 3 relationship between rainfall and runoff variables event rainfall depth p and maximum 30 minute intensity i 30 had significant positive correlations …ë 0 05 with quickflow q qf and the runoff coefficient rc qf fig 7 the correlation between event quickflow and rainfall depth was strong and that between quickflow and i 30 was moderate fig 7 the correlation between event rainfall and rc qf and between i 30 and rc qf was also significant analysis of variance among the three amc groups revealed that there was a significant difference in the runoff coefficient as a function of antecedent moisture condition …ë 0 01 mean separation indicated that the runoff coefficient at a m c i i i was significantly larger than that at a m c i and a m c i i fig 8 the seasonal distribution of runoff showed high runoff coefficients in august at a m c i i i fig 9 during high antecedent moisture conditions the rate of infiltration is low prompting an immediate generation of runoff hence the high rate of quickflow during a m c i i i which was mostly in august resulted in high runoff coefficient in august in general as compared to other months besides the spatial variability shows that the relationship between runoff response to antecedent moisture condition was minimized where forest cover was high sc1 on the contrary this relationship was more pronounced where cropland is dominant sc3 and sc5 fig 8 the variation in seasonal quickflow for different antecedent moisture conditions indicated that in the beginning of the rainy season june and at the end of the rainy season october the quickflow runoff coefficient response shows a clearly increasing trend from a m c i to a m c i i i however in august the quickflow coefficient response was high at all moisture conditions this could be due to increasing ground water table in the middle of the rainy season which increased the quickflow response regardless of the antecedent moisture condition 4 4 rainfall and catchment characteristics on the hydrological response the rainfall variables such as p and i 30 are strongly and positively correlated with runoff parameters particularly with quickflow fig 7 however the correlation between p and i 30 with the quickflow runoff coefficient was not strong the association of catchment characteristics with hydrological response variables of the sub catchments is presented in a principal component biplot fig 10 principal component one dim1 and principal component two dim2 explain 53 1 and 31 respectively of the variability in the catchment characteristics and hydrological response of the catchments therefore the two principal components explain 84 of the variance which is sufficient to consider the association to be strong accordingly the hydrological response variables q qf rc qf are negatively associated with catchment area forest steep slopes with vegetation soil organic matter content and bund density fig 10 on the other hand crop land area lc c is positively associated with the hydrological response variables this clearly indicates the impact of land management and land cover characteristics to be prominent for catchment runoff response increasing vegetation cover soil organic matter content and bund density reduces catchment quickflow and corresponding runoff coefficients whereas increasing percent cropland area result in increasing runoff response 4 5 analysis of the curve number method for runoff prediction 4 5 1 cn values from nrcs cn table and least square fitting methods the cn from the nrcs cn table of values ranged from 59 to 91 while the model derived cn ranged from 63 to 96 table 3 the average abstraction ratio Œª determined from the rainfall runoff dataset was 0 05 however the Œª value for 88 of the observations was zero 4 5 2 model performance analysis the cn fitted to the rainfall runoff dataset demonstrated that it was best fitted at Œª 0 01 and Œª 0 explaining approximately 57 69 of the variability in the quickflow response fig 11 however the data fitted at Œª 0 2 could explain only 49 63 of the quickflow response the table cn prediction also confirmed that the capability of the nrcs cn model was less satisfactory at Œª 0 2 table 4 the nrcs cn model performance was relatively good for Œª 0 05 and 0 01 explaining 56 76 of the variability in the quickflow response the data based models at Œª 0 01 and Œª 0 produced comparable results compared to the other models Œª 0 01 and Œª 0 performed well with nse values ranging from 0 51 to 0 64 table 4 this implies that Œª values 0 01 improve the prediction efficiency in general the data based nrcs cn model performance for Œª 0 01 and Œª 0 showed relatively satisfactory performance for most of the evaluation criteria moriasi et al 2007 5 discussion 5 1 effect of rainfall variables on the runoff response quickflow was positively correlated with rainfall depth and intensity but the runoff coefficient rc was not significant this can be due to the effect of the antecedent moisture condition amc which had a significant effect on the rc this indicates that runoff was mostly of the saturation excess type rather than the infiltration excess type hence during high values of amc rc was large irrespective of rainfall depth similarly steenhuis et al 2009 reported that the runoff generation mechanism is mostly saturation excess in the lake tana basin the higher quickflow in august is also associated with low surface roughness as a result of smoothing due to local erosion and deposition as well as raindrop impact of the prior rainfall events whereas the land management activities in june particularly plowing increases the surface roughness and enhances infiltration resulting in low quickflow the higher baseflow in august can be attributed to the frequent rains besides the ground water table normally rises during august which could contribute to the peak baseflow 5 2 the performance of the cn method for runoff prediction the nrcs cn set Œª 0 2 in its initial publication however this was found to be too high and a new value of Œª 0 05 was reported as an improved standard descheemaeker et al 2008 savvidou et al 2018 woodward et al 2003a the nrcs cn was developed for gentle slopes of approximately 5 savvidou et al 2018 in addition the nrcs cn model predicts cn values that are too large for small rainfall events woodward et al 2003b from the least square fitting approach we found a much lower value close to zero and Œª 0 01 was found to be appropriate for the study area this low abstraction ratio implies that the initial abstraction is only a small fraction of the potential retention this may be related to the amc which was relatively larger in our sub humid study area than in semi arid locations where a Œª value of 0 05 was more appropriate descheemaeker et al 2008 fu 2016 therefore determining the most appropriate Œª values in sub humid locations where the soil is mostly saturated requires further investigation examination of the performance using different Œª values indicated that Œª 0 01 and Œª 0 were significant in most cases considered table 4 the runoff prediction using nrcs table cn overestimated the quickflow fig 12 b while the data derived models underestimate it fig 12a in addition the distribution of data along the l 1 line exhibits considerably higher variability this implies that the applicability of the cn method for runoff prediction needs further consideration including improvement of the abstraction ratio and reconsideration of the range of the amc when grouping amc into three categories one of the limitations of the use of the cn method is its consideration of only high rainfall events 25 mm which represent only a small fraction of the total rainfall events even in the heavy rainy seasons in the present study 5 3 rainfall and catchment characteristics that affect the runoff response the depth of rainfall alone could explain approximately 60 of the variability in quickflow response but could only explain approximately 5 of the variability in the runoff coefficient this indicates that the runoff coefficient is a more complex variable that could be more strongly influenced by catchment characteristics runoff was negatively associated with vegetation cover stone bund density and average soil organic matter content most of the forest and shrubs were located on steep slopes fig 2 this would have enhanced water retention through interception improved infiltration and reduced overland flow depth runoff responses vary among land uses descheemaeker et al 2008 sultan et al 2017 rehabilitating degraded areas through exclosures reduced runoff significantly making vegetation cover the primary variable explaining differences in runoff generation increasing vegetation was also associated with reducing runoff curve numbers from rehabilitating lands in semi arid areas descheemaeker et al 2008 bayabil et al 2010 demonstrated that runoff from gentle sloping cropland areas was higher than for grasslands and woodlands on steeper plots rehabilitating runoff source areas including degraded steep slopes and grazing areas plays a vital role in reducing catchment runoff the results of this study are also in agreement with those studies the topographic position also exerts an influence on runoff mechanisms it explains the type of runoff in the area which is characterised by saturation excess particularly during the main rainy season akale et al 2017 steenhuis et al 2009 tilahun et al 2016 due to the presence of a hardpan hussein et al 2019 or rapidly rising shallow groundwater tables hence upslope steep areas are less likely to be saturated from rising water tables and they drain soil moisture quickly through sub surface flows therefore the generation of runoff in steep slopes can be relatively slow during the wet season compared to the mostly saturated low lying gentle slopes dessie et al 2014 in the lake tana basin and taye et al 2013 in northern ethiopia also demonstrated that runoff decreased with increasing areas of steep slopes in northern ethiopia this trend was explained by an increased rock fragment cover with increasing slope gradient resulting in larger infiltration rates on steep slopes taye et al 2013 a subject of great concern related to the efficient drainage of steep upland slopes versus high runoff generation on gentle valley floor slopes is the development of valley floor gullies especially since intensive soil and water conservation efforts are not paying off in terms of gully control frankl et al 2021 valley floor vegetation in runoff concentration zones has been suggested as a measure to increase the resistance of soil to gully development frankl et al 2019 stone bunds are important land management practices that are widely practiced in cultivated landscapes of sub sahara africa wolka et al 2018 and the highlands of ethiopia in particular nyssen et al 2015 vancampenhout et al 2006 in ethiopia soil and water conservation practices have significantly reduced soil erosion and improved soil moisture retention and agricultural productivity akale et al 2017 jemberu et al 2018 vancampenhout et al 2006 wolka et al 2011 in general multitude of catchment characteristics of both natural and anthropogenic factors affect the runoff mechanism in an intertwined manner hence the land management in the area should take into account of the role of vegetation and stone bunds in steep slope areas and practices that enhance soil organic matter in cropland areas 6 conclusions this study demonstrated that runoff in the studied catchments was strongly correlated to rainfall characteristics and antecedent soil moisture content the runoff mechanism in the area was found to be mostly of saturation excess the average runoff coefficient of quickflow was only 17 this low value is mainly attributed to the role of recent land management activities intensively implemented in the area particularly the installation of stone bunds and vegetation rehabilitation however quickflow exhibited significant variability in space and time catchment runoff is a complex process affected by a multitude of catchment characteristics including catchment shape parameters topography vegetation cover management and soil properties in particular vegetation cover stone bunds and soil organic matter are negatively associated with quickflow underlining the role of management on runoff production hence measures that enhance the infiltration capacity of the soil and modify local topography are of paramount importance in land management in this regard stone bunds and especially vegetation rehabilitation in steep slope areas should be encouraged especially in runoff concentration zones susceptible to gullying the available nrcs cn table values were found to overestimate the predicted runoff and to show a wide scatter around the 1 1 line this is because the model was developed based on large rainfall events yet often used to predict event runoff from small rainfall depths hence there is a need to optimize the model to make it more appropriate for areas where event rainfall is low but frequent an important finding of this study was that the abstraction ratio Œª for use in the nrcs cn model for runoff prediction was optimal at 0 01 rather than the usually recommended 0 05 or 0 2 used in hydrological modelling programs such as swat unless a locally optimised Œª is used we recommend application of our value in similar agroecological areas author statement amaury frankl jan nyssen jean poesen enyew adgo derege tsegaye

high degree of temporal and spatial variability de vente and poesen 2005 lemma et al 2018 2019a for instance the hydrological response of small catchments is mostly different and more variable than that of large catchments pilgrim et al 1982 while runoff processes are relatively well understood at the plot scale the runoff generated from small catchments i e 1 100 ha is rather complex and underrepresented in hydrological studies de vente and poesen 2005 johansson 1994 poesen 2018 the complexity of the hydrological response of small catchments is partly due to the effect of variations in routing and connectivity of the different units boardman 2018 heckmann et al 2018 but also to interactions of surface and sub surface hydrological processes which become more important at catchment scales rodr√≠guez blanco et al 2012 therefore it is vital to enhance our understanding of how small catchments behave hydrologically based on empirical studies such as those presented here a critical

2003a and provide further insights into the applicability of the nrcs cn model in similar areas as the nrcs cn model is also integrated with other physically distributed models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat the determination of appropriate Œª values is of paramount importance in quantifying runoff for future water resource development in the lake tana basin runoff and erosion in the upper catchments and flooding and sedimentation in the lowland areas are severe challenges to sustainable development abate et al 2015 dessie et al 2014 lemma et al 2019b in addition population growth is fast and associated changes in land use and management are rapid bruin et al 2015 minale 2013 extensive use of traditional seasonal drainage ditches in cropland feses resulted in more runoff and a lowering of the topographic threshold for gully head development monsieurs et al 2015 significant reductions in runoff at the plot scale have been reported due to the implementation of soil and water conservation structures such as soil bunds along the contour e g sultan et al 2017 ebabu et al 2019 large efforts have been made to improve catchment characteristics towards controlling fluxes of water and sediment to lake tana therefore we examined the impact of such improvements on the runoff response of small 100 ha upland catchments in this basin the objectives of this study were to better understand the hydrological response of small catchments fine tune the site specific abstraction ratio Œª of nrcs cn and thereby investigate how recent land management efforts may have contributed to improved hydrological conditions 2 study area description this study was conducted in the enkulal catchment fig 1 in the headwaters of the gumara river eastern lake tana basin 11¬∫37 to

rainy seasons i e june october for 2018 2020 event rainfall p mm was obtained by summing the 5 minute rainfall depth for each rainfall event maximum rainfall intensity over 30 min i 30 mm hr 1 was determined and the nearest rain gauge was used for each sub catchment hydrological monitoring stations were established at the outlet of every sub catchment the monitoring stations have a sharp crested rectangular weir in five catchments and a v notch weir at one sub catchment fig 3 during rainy seasons the runoff stage was recorded every five minutes using a staff gauge and automatic pressure transducer divers 3 2 determining runoff discharge from weirs the discharge at the rectangular weirs was calculated as a function of the stage of the discharge aydin et al 2011 using eq 1 3 1

derived from measured p and q data this method assumes that the initial abstraction ia is proportional to the maximum potential retention s mm which is expressed as i a Œª s where ia is the initial

possible least square of residuals generally cn is modelled for rainfall events exceeding 25 mm hawkins 1993 but in this study we considered events exceeding 10 mm because we found few events exceeding 25 mm cns calculated from the rainfall runoff data were compared with the tabulated nrcs cn and analysed in relation to catchment characteristics and management the runoff prediction

increases with an increasing number of independent variables curtin and schulz 1998 otherwise a significance level of Œ± 0 05 was used 4 results 4 1 spatial and temporal variability of rainfall a total of n 2348 rainfall runoff events were analysed for all sub catchments occurring during the rainy seasons of three consecutive years sixty percent of the events had p 5 mm average event p and i 30 did not vary significantly among the sub catchments p 0 05 however temporal variation was significant with p in june and i 30 in august being higher than in other months fig 5 fig 6 in addition average event rainfall variability was significant across years 4 2 spatial and temporal variability of hydrological variables baseflow q b for the wet season starts in late june to early july peaked in august and declined gradually towards november fig 5 it was significantly higher in august than in other months p 0 01 the average baseflow coefficient rc b during rainfall runoff event was 7 3 while that of the seasonal rc b which also includes the baseflow between runoff events was 25 quickflow there was significant variation in mean event q qf among sub catchments and years p 0 05 table 2 fig 6 the average quickflow depth at sc6 was significantly lower than that at sc4 however there was no significant difference in q qf among the remaining catchments the average q qf depth increased from june to august when it was at its highest and then declined until october the average rc qf across all catchments and years was 17 lag time q l varied significantly among the sub catchments p 0 05 the average q l at sc3 was significantly lower than the average q l at sc5 and sc6 table 2 4 3 relationship between rainfall and runoff variables event rainfall depth p and maximum 30 minute intensity i 30 had significant positive correlations …ë 0 05 with quickflow q qf and the runoff coefficient rc qf fig 7 the correlation between event quickflow and rainfall depth was strong and that between quickflow and i 30 was moderate fig 7 the correlation between event rainfall and rc qf and between i 30 and rc qf was also significant analysis of variance among the three amc groups revealed that there was a significant difference in the runoff coefficient as a function of antecedent moisture condition …ë 0 01 mean separation indicated that the runoff coefficient at a m c i i i was significantly larger than that at a m c i and a m c i i fig 8 the seasonal distribution of runoff showed high runoff coefficients in august at a m c i i i fig 9 during high antecedent moisture conditions the rate of infiltration is low prompting an immediate generation of runoff hence the high rate of quickflow during a m c i i i which was mostly in august resulted in high runoff coefficient in august in general as compared to other months besides the spatial variability shows that the relationship between runoff response to antecedent moisture condition was minimized where forest cover was high sc1 on the contrary this relationship was more pronounced where cropland is dominant sc3 and sc5 fig 8 the variation in seasonal quickflow for different antecedent moisture conditions indicated that in the beginning of the rainy season june and at the end of the rainy season october the quickflow runoff coefficient response shows a clearly increasing trend from a m c i to a m c i i i however in august the quickflow coefficient response was high at all moisture conditions this could be due to increasing ground water table in the middle of the rainy season which increased the quickflow response regardless of the antecedent moisture condition 4 4 rainfall and catchment characteristics on the hydrological response the rainfall variables such as p and i 30 are strongly and positively correlated with runoff parameters particularly with quickflow fig 7 however the correlation between p and i 30 with the quickflow runoff coefficient was not strong the association of catchment characteristics with hydrological response variables of the sub catchments is presented in a principal component biplot fig 10 principal component one dim1 and principal component two dim2 explain 53 1 and 31 respectively of the variability in the catchment characteristics and hydrological response of the catchments therefore the two principal components explain 84 of the variance which is sufficient to consider the association to be strong accordingly the hydrological response variables q qf rc qf are negatively associated with catchment area forest steep slopes with vegetation soil organic matter content and bund density fig 10 on the other hand crop land area lc c is positively associated with the hydrological response variables this clearly indicates the impact of land management and land cover characteristics to be prominent for catchment runoff response increasing vegetation cover soil organic matter content and bund density reduces catchment quickflow and corresponding runoff coefficients whereas increasing percent cropland area result in increasing runoff response 4 5 analysis of the curve number method for runoff prediction 4 5 1 cn values from nrcs cn table and least square fitting methods the cn from the nrcs cn table of values ranged from 59 to 91 while the model derived cn ranged from 63 to 96 table 3 the average abstraction ratio Œª determined from the rainfall runoff dataset was 0 05 however the Œª value for 88 of the observations was zero 4 5 2 model performance analysis the cn fitted to the rainfall runoff dataset demonstrated that it was best fitted at Œª 0 01 and Œª 0 explaining approximately 57 69 of the variability in the quickflow response fig 11 however the data fitted at Œª 0 2 could explain only 49 63 of the quickflow response the table cn prediction also confirmed that the capability of the nrcs cn model was less satisfactory at Œª 0 2 table 4 the nrcs cn model performance was relatively good for Œª 0 05 and 0 01 explaining 56 76 of the variability in the quickflow response the data based models at Œª 0 01 and Œª 0 produced comparable results compared to the other models Œª 0 01 and Œª 0 performed well with nse values ranging from 0 51 to 0 64 table 4 this implies that Œª values 0 01 improve the prediction efficiency in general the data based nrcs cn model performance for Œª 0 01 and Œª 0 showed relatively satisfactory performance for most of the evaluation criteria moriasi et al 2007 5 discussion 5 1 effect of rainfall variables on the runoff response quickflow was positively correlated with rainfall depth and intensity but the runoff coefficient rc was not significant this can be due to the effect of the antecedent moisture condition amc which had a significant effect on the rc this indicates that runoff was mostly of the saturation excess type rather than the infiltration excess type hence during high values of amc rc was large irrespective of rainfall depth similarly steenhuis et al 2009 reported that the runoff generation mechanism is mostly saturation excess in the lake tana basin the higher quickflow in august is also associated with low surface roughness as a result of smoothing due to local erosion and deposition as well as raindrop impact of the prior rainfall events whereas the land management activities in june particularly plowing increases the surface roughness and enhances infiltration resulting in low quickflow the higher baseflow in august can be attributed to the frequent rains besides the ground water table normally rises during august which could contribute to the peak baseflow 5 2 the performance of the cn method for runoff prediction the nrcs cn set Œª 0 2 in its initial publication however this was found to be too high and a new value of Œª 0 05 was reported as an improved standard descheemaeker et al 2008 savvidou et al 2018 woodward et al 2003a the nrcs cn was developed for gentle slopes of approximately 5 savvidou et al 2018 in addition the nrcs cn model predicts cn values that are too large for small rainfall events woodward et al 2003b from the least square fitting approach we found a much lower value close to zero and Œª 0 01 was found to be appropriate for the study area this low abstraction ratio implies that the initial abstraction is only a small fraction of the potential retention this may be related to the amc which was relatively larger in our sub humid study area than in semi arid locations where a Œª value of 0 05 was more appropriate descheemaeker et al 2008 fu 2016 therefore determining the most appropriate Œª values in sub humid locations where the soil is mostly saturated requires further investigation examination of the performance using different Œª values indicated that Œª 0 01 and Œª 0 were significant in most cases considered table 4 the runoff prediction using nrcs table cn overestimated the quickflow fig 12 b while the data derived models underestimate it fig 12a in addition the distribution of data along the l 1 line exhibits considerably higher variability this implies that the applicability of the cn method for runoff prediction needs further consideration including improvement of the abstraction ratio and reconsideration of the range of the amc when grouping amc into three categories one of the limitations of the use of the cn method is its consideration of only high rainfall events 25 mm which represent only a small fraction of the total rainfall events even in the heavy rainy seasons in the present study 5 3 rainfall and catchment characteristics that affect the runoff response the depth of rainfall alone could explain approximately 60 of the variability in quickflow response but could only explain approximately 5 of the variability in the runoff coefficient this indicates that the runoff coefficient is a more complex variable that could be more strongly influenced by catchment characteristics runoff was negatively associated with vegetation cover stone bund density and average soil organic matter content most of the forest and shrubs were located on steep slopes fig 2 this would have enhanced water retention through interception improved infiltration and reduced overland flow depth runoff responses vary among land uses descheemaeker et al 2008 sultan et al 2017 rehabilitating degraded areas through exclosures reduced runoff significantly making vegetation cover the primary variable explaining differences in runoff generation increasing vegetation was also associated with reducing runoff curve numbers from rehabilitating lands in semi arid areas descheemaeker et al 2008 bayabil et al 2010 demonstrated that runoff from gentle sloping cropland areas was higher than for grasslands and woodlands on steeper plots rehabilitating runoff source areas including degraded steep slopes and grazing areas plays a vital role in reducing catchment runoff the results of this study are also in agreement with those studies the topographic position also exerts an influence on runoff mechanisms it explains the type of runoff in the area which is characterised by saturation excess particularly during the main rainy season akale et al 2017 steenhuis et al 2009 tilahun et al 2016 due to the presence of a hardpan hussein et al 2019 or rapidly rising shallow groundwater tables hence upslope steep areas are less likely to be saturated from rising water tables and they drain soil moisture quickly through sub surface flows therefore the generation of runoff in steep slopes can be relatively slow during the wet season compared to the mostly saturated low lying gentle slopes dessie et al 2014 in the lake tana basin and taye et al 2013 in northern ethiopia also demonstrated that runoff decreased with increasing areas of steep slopes in northern ethiopia this trend was explained by an increased rock fragment cover with increasing slope gradient resulting in larger infiltration rates on steep slopes taye et al 2013 a subject of great concern related to the efficient drainage of steep upland slopes versus high runoff generation on gentle valley floor slopes is the development of valley floor gullies especially since intensive soil and water conservation efforts are not paying off in terms of gully control frankl et al 2021 valley floor vegetation in runoff concentration zones has been suggested as a measure to increase the resistance of soil to gully development frankl et al 2019 stone bunds are important land management practices that are widely practiced in cultivated landscapes of sub sahara africa wolka et al 2018 and the highlands of ethiopia in particular nyssen et al 2015 vancampenhout et al 2006 in ethiopia soil and water conservation practices have significantly reduced soil erosion and improved soil moisture retention and agricultural productivity akale et al 2017 jemberu et al 2018 vancampenhout et al 2006 wolka et al 2011 in general multitude of catchment characteristics of both natural and anthropogenic factors affect the runoff mechanism in an intertwined manner hence the land management in the area should take into account of the role of vegetation and stone bunds in steep slope areas and practices that enhance soil organic matter in cropland areas 6 conclusions this study demonstrated that runoff in the studied catchments was strongly correlated to rainfall characteristics and antecedent soil moisture content the runoff mechanism in the area was found to be mostly of saturation excess the average runoff coefficient of quickflow was only 17 this low value is mainly attributed to the role of recent land management activities intensively implemented in the area particularly the installation of stone bunds and vegetation rehabilitation however quickflow exhibited significant variability in space and time catchment runoff is a complex process affected by a multitude of catchment characteristics including catchment shape parameters topography vegetation cover management and soil properties in particular vegetation cover stone bunds and soil organic matter are negatively associated with quickflow underlining the role of management on runoff production hence measures that enhance the infiltration capacity of the soil and modify local topography are of paramount importance in land management in this regard stone bunds and especially vegetation rehabilitation in steep slope areas should be encouraged especially in runoff concentration zones susceptible to gullying the available nrcs cn table values were found to overestimate the predicted runoff and to show a wide scatter around the 1 1 line this is because the model was developed based on large rainfall events yet often used to predict event runoff from small rainfall depths hence there is a need to optimize the model to make it more appropriate for areas where event rainfall is low but frequent an important finding of this study was that the abstraction ratio Œª for use in the nrcs cn model for runoff prediction was optimal at 0 01 rather than the usually recommended 0 05 or 0 2 used in hydrological modelling programs such as swat unless a locally optimised Œª is used we recommend application of our value in similar agroecological areas author statement amaury frankl jan nyssen jean poesen enyew adgo derege tsegaye

8234,study region senegal river basin in west africa study focus this work aimed to assess reference evapotranspiration et0 trends and its sensitivity to climate variables on the period 2036 2065 in the senegal river basin seven general circulation models gcms and seven regional climate models rcms of the cmip5 project were used under the scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the performance of gcms and rcms was first evaluated by comparing their outputs with the reanalyses data the change of et0 is determined between the periods 1971 2000 and 2036 2065 a sensitivity coefficient was calculated to analyze the influence of climatic variables on et0 finally the mann kendall test and sen slope were used to detect future trends in et0 and climate variables new hydrological insights for the region it was found that rcms were here more robust than gcms in estimating reference evapotranspiration over the period 1984 2000 compared to the period 1971 2000 the rcms show that et0 will increase by 14 293 mm under rcp4 5 and by 55 387 mm under rcp8 5 according to the climatic zones the maximum values are observed in sahelian zone and the minimum one in guinean area the sensitivity analysis shows that et0 is more sensitive to relative humidity maximum temperature and solar radiation the trend analysis reveals generally a significant increase in et0 and in maximum and minimum temperatures in the period 2036 2065 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios this means that et0 will not be stationary and may continue to increase after 2065 because of the increase of temperature keywords evapotranspiration climate change trend sensitivity coefficient climate models senegal river basin 1 introduction climate change are now affecting both natural and anthropic ecosystems and are of major concern to the scientific community and policy makers ipcc 2018 ouhamdouch et al 2020 bahir et al 2020 according to the latest estimations from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2018 human activities have caused global warming of 1 c above pre industrial levels with a range of 0 8 1 2 c this warming could reach 1 5 c between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate ipcc 2018 this climate change could impact a large panel of sector and activities by raising pressure on water resources reducing agricultural productivity and greater development of vector borne and water borne diseases ipcc 2014 in addition a continuous increase in temperatures could intensify the hydrological cycle and lead to the more frequent occurrence of extreme weather events chaouche et al 2010 tao et al 2015 rahman et al 2018 wilcox et al 2018 ouhamdouch et al 2020 therefore it is important to determine the potential impacts of climate change on water resources and the spatiotemporal variation of hydrological processes reference evapotranspiration et0 a key indicator of climate change is one of those hydrological processes that directly links the energy balance to the water balance evapotranspiration rates mainly depend on the water and energy available and the vapor pressure dong et al 2019 however these three factors are strongly affected by climate change sarkar and sarkar 2018 detecting future changes in evapotranspiration can help to determine the impact of climate change on water resources and to constitute a benchmark for the management of water resources and the optimization of agricultural water demands lin et al 2018 dong et al 2019 mubialiwo et al 2020 furthermore analysis of trends in climatic variables temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation provides a better understanding of the sensitivity of et0 to climate variables and helps determine the potential impacts of climate changes on evapotranspiration lin et al 2018 in recent years several authors moratiel et al 2011 huo et al 2013 delghandi et al 2017 gim√©nez and garc√≠a galiano 2018 dong et al 2019 yang et al 2020 ouhamdouch et al 2020 used general circulation models gcms or regional climatic models rcms to assess the potential impacts of climate change on evapotranspiration for example dong et al 2019 used four gcms to analyze current and future trend of evapotranspiration in an arid and sub humid climate of xinjiang province in china according to the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios they concluded that evapotranspiration will continue to increase during the 21 st century delghandi et al 2017 assessed the impacts of climate change on the spatiotemporal variation of et0 in an arid and semi arid climate of iran using fifteen gcms their results show an increase in evapotranspiration during the periods 2015 2045 and 2070 2099 compared to the period 1971 2000 in the semi arid zone of spain gim√©nez and garc√≠a galiano 2018 used the average of sixteen regional models to estimate evapotranspiration by the method of hargreaves and samani 1985 by 2035 2021 2050 they noted that et0 will continue to rise due to rising temperatures in west africa obada et al 2017 used three regional models from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex project to estimate the annual evapotranspiration in benin over the period 1951 2100 their results show an increase in evapotranspiration by 2100 according to the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios to our knowledge the study of obada et al 2017 is the only one that looks at future trends and rate of change in evapotranspiration in west africa however this study did not take into account the sensitivity analysis of et0 to climate variables which is an effective way to understand the impact of climate change on evapotranspiration wang et al 2019 and climate projections are not homogeneous across west africa the objective of this work is to analyze the trends of evapotranspiration as well as its sensitivity to climatic variables in the senegal river basin on the period 2036 2065 specifically it seeks to i evaluate the performance of climate models gcms and rcms compared to reference data for estimating evapotranspiration ii detect future trends in evapotranspiration and climatic variables temperature wind speed relative humidity radiation solar iii analyze the sensitivity of et0 to climatic variables and determine the change rate of et0 between the periods 1971 2000 and 2036 2065 understanding future trends in evapotranspiration is essential to assess the impact of climate change on water resources and develop adequate and efficient management strategies notably in the senegal river basin where resources are under increasing pressure to supply agriculture hydroelectric production drinking water navigation etc 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the senegal river basin is the second largest transboundary basin in west africa it covers an area over of 300 000 km¬≤ and its population is estimated at 6 5 million in 2015 and could reach 9 5 million in 2025 sdage omvs 2009 the basin spans four states guinea mali mauritania senegal which created the organization for the development of the senegal river in french l organisation pour la mise en valeur du fleuve s√©n√©gal omvs the senegal river basin is at the heart of the socio economic development strategies of the riparian countries the establishment of hydraulic infrastructure fig 1 a has enabled agricultural development hydroelectric production and the exploitation of mineral resources from a climatic point of view the longitudinal distribution of precipitation divides the basin into three climatic zones sahelian sudanian and guinean dione 1996 fig 1b the sahelian zone occupies 37 of the basin and the average annual rainfall is less than 500 mm over the period 1951 2004 in the sudanian zone 62 of the basin area the annual average precipitation varies between 500 and 1500 mm the guinean zone 1 records the most abundant precipitations with an average greater than 1500 mm the daily maximum temperature can reach 43 c in guinean area 48 c in the sahelian zone and 49 c in sudanian area over the period 1984 2017 the sahelian zone is here influenced by the sea leading to a dampening of temperatures 2 2 data in this study data from reanalysis general circulation models gcms and regional climate models rcms are used reanalysis weather data from the nasa langley research center larc power project driven by nasa earth science applied science program https power larc nasa gov data accessviewer accessed december 20 2018 are used as alternatives to observed data generally sparse and inaccessible in africa poccard leclercq 2000 bodian et al 2020 ndiaye et al 2020a b indeed too few stations with long time series are available which represents a major obstacle both to use data from these meteorological stations but also to carry out an evaluation of any data sets of reanalyses thus nasa reanalyses are used as reference data to assess the spatiotemporal consistency of the outputs of climate models in this study we take into account seven gcms included in the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 the seven rcms datasets used were extracted from the cordex africa project and the r1i1p1 set and correspond to the rossby center regional atmospheric model rca4 which has been forced by the seven gcms mentioned above table 1 the simulation domain spans longitude 24 w 60 e and latitude 45 s 42 n the characteristics of the models used are summarized in table 1 the scenarios used are rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the rcp4 5 scenario recommends stabilizing the concentration of co2 with an increase in temperatures of 2 4 c by 2100 ipcc 2014 rcp8 5 is the pessimistic scenario which predicts a high concentration of co2 and an increase in temperatures of over 4 c by 2100 ipcc 2014 the multi model ensemble represents a variety of best effort attempts to simulate the climate system and can provide a consensus representation of the climate system taylor et al 2012 yin et al 2015 dong et al 2019 in this study the multi model is considered as the average ensemble of the seven models in gcms and rcms for both climate models monthly data of air temperature max and min relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation are used to estimate evapotranspiration in three periods indeed the period 1984 2000 is used to assess the performance of climate models against reanalyses for estimating et0 by the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 this assessment only concerns the historical period of climate models 1984 2000 the period 1984 2000 is used not only because of the length of the data series available but also to have a homogeneous period for reanalyses and climate models for the same reason of data availability the historical period is 1971 2000 and the projection one is 2036 2065 the annual and seasonal et0 are obtained by summing monthly et0 values for climate variables the averages values are used two seasons are considered a dry season november to may and a rainy season june to october even though the length of the seasons varies according to the climatic zones of the basin ndiaye et al 2020b the coordinates of 31 omvs weather stations and 33 virtual stations fig 1 ndiaye et al 2020b were used to extract both reanalyses and outputs of climate models 2 3 methodology the methodology employed here consists of i the performance evaluation of reanalyses compared to observations ii the performance evaluation of the gcms and rcms compared to the reanalyses for the estimation of reference evapotranspiration et0 over the period 1984 2000 iii evaluation of the change of et0 and climate variables between the periods 1971 2000 and 2036 2065 iv the sensitivity analysis of et0 to climatic variables and detection of the trends of et0 and climate variables over the period 2036 2065 2 3 1 performance evaluation of reanalyses data due to the lack of sufficient climate observations in the senegal river basin reanalyses data were used here the meteorological variables extracted from the nasa databases were first evaluated against ground based observations to establish their temporal consistency and verify if they reproduce the same trend for this we chose the stations which have at least three meteorological variables available on a daily scale these are the stations of kayes kita nioro du sahel and bamako senou these four stations cover the range of climatic zones found in the senegal river basin fig 1b for each station for the sake of better legibility of the results a single year was chosen to represent the trend of climatic variables to evaluate the agreement between the reanalyses and the observed data the kling gupta efficiency gupta et al 2009 is used eq 2 in order to take into account the climate zones sahelian sudanian and guinean of the basin two stations labe and mamou are added to the four previous ones for assessing the kge 2 3 2 evaluating the performance of climate model projections the performance of climate models projections is assessed in two steps first the difference between the yearly average of et0 of reanalyses and that of gcms and rcms is assessed over the period 1984 2000 by using the following equation 1 Œ¥ e t 0 r e a m o d e l 1 n e t 0 m o d e l e t 0 r e a where Œ¥ e t 0 r e a m o d e l is the difference between et0 of reanalyses and models e t 0 r e a is the et0 calculated with reanalyses data e t 0 m o d e l is et0 calculated with gcms and rcms and n the length of the series then the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 and the percentage of bias pbias are used as evaluation criteria at monthly scale the kge combines the correlation coefficient r the biases Œ≤ and the variability Œ± it varies from to 1 and its optimal value is 1 the formulation of the kge is as follows 2 k g e 1 r 1 2 Œ≤ 1 2 Œ± 1 2 percent bias pbias indicates the underestimation overestimation of et0 by climate models it varies from to and its optimal value is 0 its formulation is as follows 3 p b i a s 1 n i 1 n e t o c m e t 0 r e a 1 n i 1 n e t o c m 100 where e t o c m is the reference evapotranspiration estimated from the climate models e t 0 r e a is the et0 estimated by the reanalysis and n is the length of the data 2 3 3 sensitivity analysis and calculation of the rate of change the sensitivity analysis allows to determine the impact of climate variables on the reference evapotranspiration zhao et al 2014 the influence of each variable is determined by calculating a sensitivity coefficient its wording is as follows 4 s v i e t 0 v i v i e t 0 where s v i is the sensitivity coefficient et0 variation of the reference evapotranspiration et0 caused by the change of a variable v i is the considered variable a positive negative sensitivity coefficient indicates that the variable causes an increase decrease in et0 the higher the absolute value of the sensitivity coefficient the more influence the variable has on et0 li et al 2017 the rate of change of et0 is calculated between the mean of et0 on the historical period 1971 2000 and the projections 2036 2065 according to the following formula 5 r c e t 0 p r o e t 0 h i s t e t 0 h i s t 100 where rc is the rate of change in e t 0 h i s t is the mean reference evapotranspiration calculated over the historical period and e t 0 p r o is the mean reference evapotranspiration calculated in the future a positive negative value for the rate of change indicates an increase decrease in evapotranspiration in the future the same eq 4 is used for calculating the rate change of climate variables 2 3 4 trend in reference evapotranspiration and climatic variables the mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1975 is used to detect the trend of annual and seasonal et0 and climate variables on the period 2036 2065 according to the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the mann kendall test is based on two hypotheses hypothesis denoted h0 which assumes that the series is stationary without trend and the alternative hypothesis h1 which indicates the existence of a trend by rejecting h0 a positive negative trend is obtained from the sign of the z value of the mann kendall test the trend obtained is measured by its degree of significance that is to say the probability associated with the rejection or not of the null hypothesis the significance level used in this study is 0 05 when z 1 96 the null hypothesis is rejected and the trend is significant at 5 the amplitude of the trend is measured by the slope of sen sen 1968 denoted Œ≤ the method of interpolation of the inverse distance weighting idw chu et al 2017 is used to spatialize the et0 and climate variables on an annual and seasonal scale the idw interpolation technique is widely used to analyze the spatial distribution of evapotranspiration qi et al 2017 malamos et al 2017 ndiaye et al 2020b 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of reanalyses against observed data the climate variables available for the four weather stations bamako senou kayes kita and nioro du sahel are maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity and wind speed the latter is only available for bamako senou weather station the temporal consistency between observed data and reanalyses is shown in fig 2 for a given year table 2 provides the kge values and its components r alpha beta according to climate variables available and climate zones fig 2 shows good consistency for tmax tmin and lesser for rh table 2 confirms good performance for tmax with kge above 0 5 for all stations kge for tmin is also high except on guinean stations this may be explained by the coarse resolution of reanalyse data and the fact that their reliability appears to vary with the location time period and variables considered martins et al 2016 for rh despite some variability in fig 2 kge remains high wind speed kge values are much lower around 0 2 but fig 2 shows relative agreement in the overall amplitude of the wind overall these results show acceptable consistency between the observed data and the reanalyses for the key climatic variables at the kayes kita nioro du sahel and bamako senou stations accordingly the reanalyses were used as reference here for assessing the performance of climate models 3 2 performance of gcms and rcms against reanalyses data fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of the difference in the annual et0 of climate models and reanalyses over the period 1984 2000 results show that the difference in annual et0 between reanalyses and gcms varies from 1560 to 820 mm depending on the models fig 3 the maximum negative values are obtained by ipsl cm5a rc and csiro mk3 6 0 models in sahelian and sudanian climate zones for the ensemble average of all models the difference ranges from 747 to 283 mm individually the hadgem cnrm and canesm models exhibit et0 values closer to reanalyses rcms on the other hand show et0 values that are closer to reanalyses compared to gcms however they generally tend to overestimate evapotranspiration while gcms here tend to underestimate it for example the difference in annual et0 between reanalyses and regional models ranges from 483 to 1110 mm depending on the model the ensemble average of all regional models shows a difference ranging from 139 to 720 mm fig 4 the et0 values of the regional models canesm2 rca4 cnrm cm5 rca4 and hadgem2 es rca4 are closer to those obtained with reanalyses overall the results show that the differences between et0 values from reanalysis data and climate models are relatively high this may be explained by the difficulty of climate models to reproduce correctly the climate variables used for estimating reference evapotranspiration indeed the et0 values obtained from reanalyses are closer to those of bodian 2011 and djaman et al 2015 in senegal river basin according to bodian 2011 at lab√© and siguiri guinean zone weather stations the observed values of et0 were 1611 mm and 1969 mm over the period 1960 1996 for these two stations the values of reanalyses are 1838 mm and 1936 mm over the period 1984 2017 moreover in sahelian zone djaman et al 2015 used the observed data of africa rice center research stations at ndiaye and fanaye sahelian regional station senegal for estimation reference evapotranspiration over february 2013 and may 2014 they showed that reference evapotranspiration varies from 1 to 14 mm day with an average of 6 mm day 2190 mm year at ndiaye and from 3 to 18 mm day with an average of 10 mm day 3650 mm year at fanaye for the reanalyses et0 varies between 1 18 mm day with an average of 8 mm day 2920 mm year over the period 1984 2017 at fanaye figs 4 and 5 respectively give the spatial distribution of kge and pbias and fig 6 gives a synthesis of kge and pbias as a function of climatic zones for the gcms the kge vary from 0 35 to 0 68 the highest values are obtained by the canesm2 and gdfl esm2m models and the lowest by csiro mk3 6 0 and hadgem2 es the biases vary from 124 to 38 the mean values of pbias show that gcms underestimate evapotranspiration in 91 of stations in the basin the average of all gcms shows kge values of 0 09 to 0 48 and biases of 58 to 24 from a spatial point of view the results are almost similar depending on the climatic zones from the guinean zone to the sahelian one the gcms have kge of less than 0 60 and underestimate the evapotranspiration these results obtained show that gcms are less robust for the estimation of evapotranspiration this can be explained by the coarse resolution of the gcms and their uncertainty in estimating the climate variables necessary for the estimation of evapotranspiration fig 4 shows that the kge of rcms are greater than 0 60 in the most of the stations and are more in agreement with the reanalyses than the gcms the average kge and pbias of the regional models vary from 0 21 to 0 87 and from 8 to 27 respectively unlike gcms rcms overestimate et0 at 88 of stations from a spatial point of view the mean kge values of multi models ensemble are 0 70 min and max vary from 0 54 to 0 87 in guinean zone 0 72 0 43 to 0 83 in sudanian area and 0 67 0 36 to 0 85 in the sahelian zone the pbias show that all rcms overestimate evapotranspiration in all climate zones with the exception of csiro mk3 6 0 rca4 and miroc5rc rca4 which underestimate it in the guinean zone moreover some regional models have better performances than the ensemble average of all models in some climate zones for example in guinean zone the kge values of csiro mk3 6 0 rca4 hadgem2 es rca4 and miroc5rc rca4 are respectively 0 73 0 74 and 0 76 and that of the ensemble average models is 0 70 however in sahelian and sudanian zones the ensemble performs better than the individual models overall rcms are more robust than gcms for estimating evapotranspiration in the senegal river basin for this purpose only rcms will be taken into account in subsequent analyses the reanalyses data used to perform climate models seem coherent with observed data used by bodian 2011 and djaman et al 2015 in the high basin and the valley of senegal river moreover the different values of kge and pbias obtained by the models in the climate zones may be explained by the structure of the models the heterogeneity of the landscape and the number of stations used in each climate zones for example in guinean zone 1 of the basin only the mean values of five stations are analyzed against 33 and 26 stations in sudanian 37 and sahelian zones 62 respectively the reanalyses used as a reference are not validated by observed data which can influence the calculation of the rate of reference evapotranspiration the difficulty of climate models in correctly simulating the variables necessary for estimating et0 would also be a source of uncertainty 3 3 change in evapotranspiration by 2065 all the models agree on a positive variation in evapotranspiration on the period 2036 2065 fig 7 shows mean values of annual evapotranspiration in both historical and projection periods according to the climate zones fig 8 gives the spatial distribution of the et0 change at annual and seasonal scales in the guinean zone the minimum and maximum values of annual et0 vary from 1355 to 2521 mm on the period 1971 2000 according to climate models during the period 2036 2065 these values vary from 1455 to 2657 mm for rcp4 5 and 1457 2696 mm for rcp8 5 the maximum values were obtained by ipsl cm5a mr rca4 the increase of et0 in the guinean zone varies from 14 to 173 mm i e 2 11 for rcp4 5 and from 55 to 196 mm i e 2 4 11 for rcp8 5 according to the models in sudanian zone the et0 values vary from 1902 to 2390 mm over the period 1971 2000 the et0 for the period 2036 2065 vary from 2046 to 2386 for rcp4 5 and 2051 4056 mm for rcp8 5 this means that according to the models et0 will increase by 2 9 56 285 mm for rcp4 5 and 4 11 99 365 mm for rcp8 5 until 2065 the et0 values will reach 4095 mm for rcp4 5 and 4153 mm for rcp8 5 compared to the period 1971 2000 where the maximum value of et0 was 3810 mm in the sahelian zone the increase of et0 varies between 3 10 63 and 293 mm for rcp4 5 and 3 12 106 387 mm for rcp8 5 moreover it is interesting to note that among the models miroc5 rca4 shows higher values of et0 for rcp4 5 than rcp8 5 in the three climate zones this surprising result may be explained by the interactions between local climatic processes and the reduced maximum temperature and wind speed modelled by this rcms under scenario rcp8 5 section 3 4 2 at the seasonal scale the models show that until 2065 evapotranspiration will increase during the dry and wet season for example in the sahelian zone the et0 will increase between 27 and 181 mm 2 9 for rcp4 5 and 72 189 mm 4 10 for rcp8 5 in the guinean and sudanian zones the maximum values of et0 will respectively reach 123 150 mm for rcp4 5 and 128 176 mm for rcp8 5 during the rainy season et0 will increase at a rate of 0 18 in sahelian and sudanian zones according to the models and the two scenarios it will increase from 3 to 15 in the guinean zone overall according to the rcms the et0 will continue to increase until 2065 in senegal river basin similar results have been obtained in different regions of the world thus obada et al 2017 noted that all three models they used project an increase in et0 from 3 to 10 91 in benin west africa over the period 2041 2070 in a semi climate arid in spain gim√©nez and garc√≠a galiano 2018 predict an increase in et0 from 4 42 to 16 21 by 2050 compared to the average for the period 1960 1990 the increase in et0 by 2050 could be accompanied by a decrease in flows indeed according to bodian et al 2018 compared to the period 1971 2000 the annual flows of the bafing the main tributary of the senegal river will decrease by 8 according to the rcp4 5 scenario and by 16 under rcp8 5 scenario by 2050 in west africa this means that the annual flows depend on precipitation variability and evapotranspiration the continued increase of the latter may affect the water resources and exacerbate competition between users moreover it is important to note that ndiaye et al 2020b highlighted a significant decrease of evapotranspiration in the sahelian zone and mentioned the existence of an evaporation paradox in the senegal river basin on the period 1987 2017 however no model has highlighted a significant decrease of evapotranspiration on the period 2036 2065 therefore the evaporation paradox will not exist on the period 2036 2065 according to the rcms 3 4 sensitivity of future evapotranspiration to climatic variables the influence of climatic variables on evapotranspiration is determined by calculating a sensitivity coefficient thus fig 9 gives the spatial distribution of the annual sensitivity coefficients according to the models and table 2 indicates the average values of the coefficients according to climatic zones with the exception of relative humidity all variables have positive sensitivity coefficients in other words their increase leads to an increase in evapotranspiration table 3 shows that the relative humidity sensitivity coefficients vary from 0 90 to 8 from 0 90 to 8 4 depending on the models under both the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the maximum values of relative humidity are observed in the guinean zone and those minimum in the sahelian zone the maximum temperature coefficients range from 1 35 to 2 59 under rcp4 5 and from 1 35 to 2 49 under rcp8 5 the influence of maximum temperature on evapotranspiration is greater in the sahelian and sudanian areas solar radiation is the third variable that has the most influence on et0 with coefficients varying from 0 60 to 0 97 under the two scenarios its maximum values are noted in the guinean zone wind speed and minimum temperature have less influence on et0 with coefficients below 0 35 wind speed has more influence on et0 in the sahelian and sudanian areas the results obtained confirm those of ndiaye et al 2020b who noted that evapotranspiration is more sensitive to relative humidity maximum temperature and solar radiation in the senegal river basin over the period 1984 2017 on a seasonal scale relative humidity maximum temperature and solar radiation are always the variables that have the most influence on evapotranspiration the influence of relative humidity on et0 is more significant during the rainy season and in the guinean zone with coefficients varying from 0 86 to 3 49 under rcp4 5 and from 8 07 to 15 36 under rcp8 5 et0 is more sensitive to maximum temperature during the dry season and in the sudanese and sahelian areas solar radiation has more influence on et0 in the guinean area and during the rainy season the sensitivity analysis shows that future evapotranspiration will be more influenced by relative humidity maximum temperature and solar radiation therefore it would be important to pay more attention to the measurement and or estimation of these climatic variables in order to ensure a good estimate of evapotranspiration it is also important to note that the climate variable influence on et0 depend on climate zones the influence of relative humidity and solar radiation is more significant in guinean zone than in sahelian and sudanian ones however in sudanian and sahelian zones the et0 is most sensible to maximum temperature minimum temperature and wind 3 5 is the climate stationary in 2036 2065 3 5 1 future trends in evapotranspiration the spatial distribution of mann kendall s z of annual and seasonal evapotranspiration on the period 2036 2065 is given in fig 10 the average of all regional models shows a significant increase p 0 05 in annual and seasonal et0 over the entire basin according to the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the hadgem2 es rca4 ipsl cm5a mr rca4 csiro mk3 6 0 rca4 and canesm2 rca4 models show a significant increase in annual evapotranspiration for all the models only gfdl esm2m rca4 shows a non significant trend in annual and seasonal et0 over the entire basin fig 11 shows the magnitude of the et0 trends depending on the models in the guinean zone the annual et0 increases by 1 78 mm year according to the rcp4 5 scenario and by 3 06 mm year according to rcp8 5 by 2065 according to the two scenarios the annual average et0 increases respectively by 2 55 mm year to 3 78 mm year in the sudanian zone and from 2 83 mm year to 4 4 mm year in the sahelian zone the trend analysis shows that overall evapotranspiration will increase significantly p 0 05 by 2065 in the senegal river basin similar results are obtained by some studies across the world indeed the work of dong et al 2019 pointed out a continuous increase in evapotranspiration throughout the 21 st century in china s semi arid climate ndiaye et al 2020b showed a significant increase in the annual et0 in 32 of the senegal river basin during the period 1984 2017 however ndiaye et al 2020b also showed a significant drop in et0 in sahelian area of the basin despite the increase in temperature here projections do not reveal a drop in et0 and results indicate that this evaporation paradox will disappear from the basin by 2050 the increase in et0 could have impacts on the hydrological cycle and on agriculture indeed from a hydrological point of view the continuous increase in et0 can affect the rainfall effective and exacerbate the arid conditions of a given environment goyal 2004 in agriculture sector increasing et0 tends to increase aridity decrease soil moisture and effective rainfall aub√© 2016 this increase in et0 could also lead to an increase in crop water demand and an increase in irrigation costs rahman et al 2018 3 5 2 future trends in climate variables fig 12 shows the future spatial distribution of mann kendall s z of climate variables at the annual scale all models agree on a significant increase in minimum and maximum temperatures with the exception of the rcp4 5 scenario of the noaa gfdl esm2m rca4 and miroc5 rca4 models which shows a non significant trend in these two climate variables a non significant decrease p 0 05 in relative humidity was also noted over the entire basin of all the models only canesm2 rca4 hadgem2 es rca4 miroc5 rca4 and multi model exhibit a significant decrease in wind speed and solar radiation hadgem2 es rca4 showed a decrease in wind speed in 8 of the basin area for the rcp4 5 scenario and in 12 of this for rcp8 5 this decrease in wind speed mentioned in ndiaye et al 2020b is confirmed in future projections in addition to the decrease in wind speed some models show a significant decrease in solar radiation indeed the ensemble shows a significant decrease in solar radiation for 46 of the basin area according to the two scenarios a significant decrease in radiation is also highlighted by ipsl cm5a mr rca4 in 11 and 99 of the basin according to the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively according to the rcp8 5 scenario miroc5 rca4 and canesm2 rca4 respectively show a significant decrease in radiation in 21 and 83 of the basin area table 4 gives a summary of sen slope values of climate variables over the period 2036 2065 according to climatic zones considering the average of all the models the minimum temperature varies from 0 02 c year to 0 04 c year according to the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the maximum temperature increases from 0 05 c year to 0 06 c year for rcp4 5 and from 0 01 c year to 0 02 c year for rcp8 5 for maximum temperature the low values obtained by ensemble rcp8 5 can be explained by the low values of csiro mk3 6 0 rca4 hadgem2 es rca4 and miroc5 rca4 this indicates that the multi model ensemble is not always preferable as it here leads to a lower incongruous increase in temperature with rcp8 5 than with rcp4 5 moreover for the rcp4 5 the models show that the maximum temperature will increase from 1 3 to 2 5 c in guinean zone 1 3 2 7 c in sudanian zone and from 1 3 to 2 8 c in sahelian one for the rcp8 5 the high values of maximum temperature vary between 3 1 and 3 3 c depending on climate zones the minimum temperature will respectively increase by 2 9 3 2 and 3 3 c in guinean sudanian and sahelian zones under rcp4 5 according to rcp8 5 the minimum temperature will vary between 3 2 3 9 c according to the climate models the maximum values are noted in sahelian and sudanian zones it is also important to note that the minimum temperatures increase faster than the maximum ones the same results are obtained by ly et al 2013 in west africa and samba and nganga 2014 in congo brazzaville who noted that the increase of minimum temperature is more important than the maximum this situation may be explained by the concentration of aerosol which reduce the solar radiation reaching the earth surface ringard et al 2014 this increase in temperature can also affect crops for example diop 2009 mentioned that ecological monitoring carried out in nianga podor senegal river basin showed that certain varieties of rice have abortion rates of 33 57 when the temperature exceeds 35 c relative humidity varies from 0 17 to 7 year in the guinean zone from 0 6 7 in the sudanese one and from 0 9 to 6 year in the sahelian zone according to the two scenarios wind speed and solar radiation vary respectively from 0 025 to 4 11 m year and from 1 6 to 1 7 mj m 2 d 1 year depending on both scenarios and depending on climatic zones on a seasonal scale all models predict a significant increase in temperatures during the dry and rainy season the models also predict an insignificant decrease in wind speed and relative humidity during both seasons the downward trend in solar radiation is generally insignificant on a seasonal scale trend analysis show a significant increase in temperatures in the senegal river basin this rise in temperatures would be considered the main reason for the significant increase in evapotranspiration in the period 2036 2065 this information associated with the trend of et0 and climate variable allow to note that horizon 2036 2065 will not be stationary and the climate will continue to change if the temperature increase at the current rate indeed significant positive trend is both et0 and temperatures is showed by rcms this confirms the studies by abiye et al 2019 and ndiaye et al 2020b according to which the temperature maximum and minimum is the main factor of variation of evapotranspiration during the periods 1906 2015 and 1984 2017 in west africa and in the senegal river basin of all the variables only wind speed and solar radiation show a significant decrease depending on the models the decrease in wind speed wind stilling and solar radiation global dimming explains the decrease in evapotranspiration mentioned by some authors mcvicar et al 2012 chu et al 2017 han et al 2019 bian et al 2020 ndiaye et al 2020b this decrease in solar radiation is linked to the concentration of aerosols in the atmosphere due to human activities han et al 2019 4 conclusion the results of this study show that the et0 values obtained by the rcms are closer to those of the reanalyses than the gcms though they tend to overestimate et0 trend analysis shows almost all models agree on a significant increase in reference evapotranspiration in the period 2036 2065 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the ensemble provides an increase in et0 of 39 mm for rcp4 5 and 144 mm for rcp8 5 in the guinean zone in the sudanese and sahelian zones et0 will increase respectively from 48 mm to 266 mm and from 57 mm to 277 mm according to the two scenarios trends in climate variables show a significant increase in maximum and minimum temperatures this rise in temperatures is shown to be the primary explanation for the increase in et0 though some models also highlight a significant decrease in wind speed and solar radiation sensitivity analysis reveals that et0 is more sensitive to relative humidity maximum temperature and solar radiation the increase in the future will increase crop water requirements accentuate water losses in reservoirs reduce hydroelectric deliverability and increase competition between different users it is important to note that this increase of et0 will not be stationary in 2065 and may continue to increase if the temperatures rise at the same rate furthermore this work underlines the discrepancies between results based on gcms and rcms as well as those between individual rcms when estimating evapotranspiration these differences highlight the importance of improving the performance of climate circulation models both gcms and rcms to allow for a more accurate and reliable estimate of climate variables needed to analyze long term et0 variations projections it would also be important to have complete in situ meteorological observations to fill in the gaps and improve climate simulations author statement conceptualization p m n a b and l d methodology p m n a b

8234,study region senegal river basin in west africa study focus this work aimed to assess reference evapotranspiration et0 trends and its sensitivity to climate variables on the period 2036 2065 in the senegal river basin seven general circulation models gcms and seven regional climate models rcms of the cmip5 project were used under the scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the performance of gcms and rcms was first evaluated by comparing their outputs with the reanalyses data the change of et0 is determined between the periods 1971 2000 and 2036 2065 a sensitivity coefficient was calculated to analyze the influence of climatic variables on et0 finally the mann kendall test and sen slope were used to detect future trends in et0 and climate variables new hydrological insights for the region it was found that rcms were here more robust than gcms in estimating reference evapotranspiration over the period 1984 2000 compared to the period 1971 2000 the rcms show that et0 will increase by 14 293 mm under rcp4 5 and by 55 387 mm under rcp8 5 according to the climatic zones the maximum values are observed in sahelian zone and the minimum one in guinean area the sensitivity analysis shows that et0 is more sensitive to relative humidity maximum temperature and solar radiation the trend analysis reveals generally a significant increase in et0 and in maximum and minimum temperatures in the period 2036 2065 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios this means that et0 will not be stationary and may continue to increase after 2065 because of the increase of temperature keywords evapotranspiration climate change trend sensitivity coefficient climate models senegal river basin 1 introduction climate change are now affecting both natural and anthropic ecosystems and are of major concern to the scientific community and policy makers ipcc 2018 ouhamdouch et al 2020 bahir et al 2020 according to the latest estimations from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2018 human activities have caused global warming of 1 c above pre industrial levels with a range of 0 8 1 2 c this warming could reach 1 5 c between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate ipcc 2018 this climate change could impact a large panel of sector and activities by raising pressure on water resources reducing agricultural productivity and greater development of vector borne and water borne diseases ipcc 2014 in addition a continuous increase in temperatures could intensify the hydrological cycle and lead to the more frequent occurrence of extreme weather events chaouche et al 2010 tao et al 2015 rahman et al 2018 wilcox et al 2018 ouhamdouch et al 2020 therefore it is important to determine the potential impacts of climate change on water resources and the spatiotemporal variation of hydrological processes reference evapotranspiration et0 a key indicator of climate change is one of those hydrological processes that directly links the energy balance to the water balance evapotranspiration rates mainly depend on the water and energy available and the vapor pressure dong et al 2019 however these three factors are strongly affected by climate change sarkar and sarkar 2018 detecting future changes in evapotranspiration can help to determine the impact of climate change on water resources and to constitute a benchmark for the management of water resources and the optimization of agricultural water demands lin et al 2018 dong et al 2019 mubialiwo et al 2020 furthermore analysis of trends in climatic variables temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation provides a better understanding of the sensitivity of et0 to climate variables and helps determine the potential impacts of climate changes on evapotranspiration lin et al 2018 in recent years several authors moratiel et al 2011 huo et al 2013 delghandi et al 2017 gim√©nez and garc√≠a galiano 2018 dong et al 2019 yang et al 2020 ouhamdouch et al 2020 used general circulation models gcms or regional climatic models rcms to assess the potential impacts of climate change on evapotranspiration for example dong et al 2019 used four gcms to analyze current and future trend of evapotranspiration in an arid and sub humid climate of xinjiang province in china according to the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios they concluded that evapotranspiration will continue to increase during the 21 st century delghandi et al 2017 assessed the impacts of climate change on the spatiotemporal variation of et0 in an arid and semi arid climate of iran using fifteen gcms their results show an increase in evapotranspiration during the periods 2015 2045 and 2070 2099 compared to the period 1971 2000 in the semi arid zone of spain gim√©nez and garc√≠a galiano 2018 used the average of sixteen regional models to estimate evapotranspiration by the method of hargreaves and samani 1985 by 2035 2021 2050 they noted that et0 will continue to rise due to rising temperatures in west africa obada et al 2017 used three regional models from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex project to estimate the annual evapotranspiration in benin over the period 1951 2100 their results show an increase in evapotranspiration by 2100 according to the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios to our knowledge the study of obada et al 2017 is the only one that looks at future trends and rate of change in evapotranspiration in west africa however this study did not take into account the sensitivity analysis of et0 to climate variables which is an effective way to understand the impact of climate change on evapotranspiration wang et al 2019 and climate projections are not homogeneous across west africa the objective of this work is to analyze the trends of evapotranspiration as well as its sensitivity to climatic variables in the senegal river basin on the period 2036 2065 specifically it seeks to i evaluate the performance of climate models gcms and rcms compared to reference data for estimating evapotranspiration ii detect future trends in evapotranspiration and climatic variables temperature wind speed relative humidity radiation solar iii analyze the sensitivity of et0 to climatic variables and determine the change rate of et0 between the periods 1971 2000 and 2036 2065 understanding future trends in evapotranspiration is essential to assess the impact of climate change on water resources and develop adequate and efficient management strategies notably in the senegal river basin where resources are under increasing pressure to supply agriculture hydroelectric production drinking water navigation etc 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the senegal river basin is the second largest transboundary basin in west africa it covers an area over of 300 000 km¬≤ and its population is estimated at 6 5 million in 2015 and could reach 9 5 million in 2025 sdage omvs 2009 the basin spans four states guinea mali mauritania senegal which created the organization for the development of the senegal river in french l organisation pour la mise en valeur du fleuve s√©n√©gal omvs the senegal river basin is at the heart of the socio economic development strategies of the riparian countries the establishment of hydraulic infrastructure fig 1 a has enabled agricultural development hydroelectric production and the exploitation of mineral resources from a climatic point of view the longitudinal distribution of precipitation divides the basin into three climatic zones sahelian sudanian and guinean dione 1996 fig 1b the sahelian zone occupies 37 of the basin and the average annual rainfall is less than 500 mm over the period 1951 2004 in the sudanian zone 62 of the basin area the annual average precipitation varies between 500 and 1500 mm the guinean zone 1 records the most abundant precipitations with an average greater than 1500 mm the daily maximum temperature can reach 43 c in guinean area 48 c in the sahelian zone and 49 c in sudanian area over the period 1984 2017 the sahelian zone is here influenced by the sea leading to a dampening of temperatures 2 2 data in this study data from reanalysis general circulation models gcms and regional climate models rcms are used reanalysis weather data from the nasa langley research center larc power project driven by nasa earth science applied science program https power larc nasa gov data accessviewer accessed december 20 2018 are used as alternatives to observed data generally sparse and inaccessible in africa poccard leclercq 2000 bodian et al 2020 ndiaye et al 2020a b indeed too few stations with long time series are available which represents a major obstacle both to use data from these meteorological stations but also to carry out an evaluation of any data sets of reanalyses thus nasa reanalyses are used as reference data to assess the spatiotemporal consistency of the outputs of climate models in this study we take into account seven gcms included in the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 the seven rcms datasets used were extracted from the cordex africa project and the r1i1p1 set and correspond to the rossby center regional atmospheric model rca4 which has been forced by the seven gcms mentioned above table 1 the simulation domain spans longitude 24 w 60 e and latitude 45 s 42 n the characteristics of the models used are summarized in table 1 the scenarios used are rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the rcp4 5 scenario recommends stabilizing the concentration of co2 with an increase in temperatures of 2 4 c by 2100 ipcc 2014 rcp8 5 is the pessimistic scenario which predicts a high concentration of co2 and an increase in temperatures of over 4 c by 2100 ipcc 2014 the multi model ensemble represents a variety of best effort attempts to simulate the climate system and can provide a consensus representation of the climate system taylor et al 2012 yin et al 2015 dong et al 2019 in this study the multi model is considered as the average ensemble of the seven models in gcms and rcms for both climate models monthly data of air temperature max and min relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation are used to estimate evapotranspiration in three periods indeed the period 1984 2000 is used to assess the performance of climate models against reanalyses for estimating et0 by the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 this assessment only concerns the historical period of climate models 1984 2000 the period 1984 2000 is used not only because of the length of the data series available but also to have a homogeneous period for reanalyses and climate models for the same reason of data availability the historical period is 1971 2000 and the projection one is 2036 2065 the annual and seasonal et0 are obtained by summing monthly et0 values for climate variables the averages values are used two seasons are considered a dry season november to may and a rainy season june to october even though the length of the seasons varies according to the climatic zones of the basin ndiaye et al 2020b the coordinates of 31 omvs weather stations and 33 virtual stations fig 1 ndiaye et al 2020b were used to extract both reanalyses and outputs of climate models 2 3 methodology the methodology employed here consists of i the performance evaluation of reanalyses compared to observations ii the performance evaluation of the gcms and rcms compared to the reanalyses for the estimation of reference evapotranspiration et0 over the period 1984 2000 iii evaluation of the change of et0 and climate variables between the periods 1971 2000 and 2036 2065 iv the sensitivity analysis of et0 to climatic variables and detection of the trends of et0 and climate variables over the period 2036 2065 2 3 1 performance evaluation of reanalyses data due to the lack of sufficient climate observations in the senegal river basin reanalyses data were used here the meteorological variables extracted from the nasa databases were first evaluated against ground based observations to establish their temporal consistency and verify if they reproduce the same trend for this we chose the stations which have at least three meteorological variables available on a daily scale these are the stations of kayes kita nioro du sahel and bamako senou these four stations cover the range of climatic zones found in the senegal river basin fig 1b for each station for the sake of better legibility of the results a single year was chosen to represent the trend of climatic variables to evaluate the agreement between the reanalyses and the observed data the kling gupta efficiency gupta et al 2009 is used eq 2 in order to take into account the climate zones sahelian sudanian and guinean of the basin two stations labe and mamou are added to the four previous ones for assessing the kge 2 3 2 evaluating the performance of climate model projections the performance of climate models projections is assessed in two steps first the difference between the yearly average of et0 of reanalyses and that of gcms and rcms is assessed over the period 1984 2000 by using the following equation 1 Œ¥ e t 0 r e a m o d e l 1 n e t 0 m o d e l e t 0 r e a where Œ¥ e t 0 r e a m o d e l is the difference between et0 of reanalyses and models e t 0 r e a is the et0 calculated with reanalyses data e t 0 m o d e l is et0 calculated with gcms and rcms and n the length of the series then the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 and the percentage of bias pbias are used as evaluation criteria at monthly scale the kge combines the correlation coefficient r the biases Œ≤ and the variability Œ± it varies from to 1 and its optimal value is 1 the formulation of the kge is as follows 2 k g e 1 r 1 2 Œ≤ 1 2 Œ± 1 2 percent bias pbias indicates the underestimation overestimation of et0 by climate models it varies from to and its optimal value is 0 its formulation is as follows 3 p b i a s 1 n i 1 n e t o c m e t 0 r e a 1 n i 1 n e t o c m 100 where e t o c m is the reference evapotranspiration estimated from the climate models e t 0 r e a is the et0 estimated by the reanalysis and n is the length of the data 2 3 3 sensitivity analysis and calculation of the rate of change the sensitivity analysis allows to determine the impact of climate variables on the reference evapotranspiration zhao et al 2014 the influence of each variable is determined by calculating a sensitivity coefficient its wording is as follows 4 s v i e t 0 v i v i e t 0 where s v i is the sensitivity coefficient et0 variation of the reference evapotranspiration et0 caused by the change of a variable v i is the considered variable a positive negative sensitivity coefficient indicates that the variable causes an increase decrease in et0 the higher the absolute value of the sensitivity coefficient the more influence the variable has on et0 li et al 2017 the rate of change of et0 is calculated between the mean of et0 on the historical period 1971 2000 and the projections 2036 2065 according to the following formula 5 r c e t 0 p r o e t 0 h i s t e t 0 h i s t 100 where rc is the rate of change in e t 0 h i s t is the mean reference evapotranspiration calculated over the historical period and e t 0 p r o is the mean reference evapotranspiration calculated in the future a positive negative value for the rate of change indicates an increase decrease in evapotranspiration in the future the same eq 4 is used for calculating the rate change of climate variables 2 3 4 trend in reference evapotranspiration and climatic variables the mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1975 is used to detect the trend of annual and seasonal et0 and climate variables on the period 2036 2065 according to the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the mann kendall test is based on two hypotheses hypothesis denoted h0 which assumes that the series is stationary without trend and the alternative hypothesis h1 which indicates the existence of a trend by rejecting h0 a positive negative trend is obtained from the sign of the z value of the mann kendall test the trend obtained is measured by its degree of significance that is to say the probability associated with the rejection or not of the null hypothesis the significance level used in this study is 0 05 when z 1 96 the null hypothesis is rejected and the trend is significant at 5 the amplitude of the trend is measured by the slope of sen sen 1968 denoted Œ≤ the method of interpolation of the inverse distance weighting idw chu et al 2017 is used to spatialize the et0 and climate variables on an annual and seasonal scale the idw interpolation technique is widely used to analyze the spatial distribution of evapotranspiration qi et al 2017 malamos et al 2017 ndiaye et al 2020b 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of reanalyses against observed data the climate variables available for the four weather stations bamako senou kayes kita and nioro du sahel are maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity and wind speed the latter is only available for bamako senou weather station the temporal consistency between observed data and reanalyses is shown in fig 2 for a given year table 2 provides the kge values and its components r alpha beta according to climate variables available and climate zones fig 2 shows good consistency for tmax tmin and lesser for rh table 2 confirms good performance for tmax with kge above 0 5 for all stations kge for tmin is also high except on guinean stations this may be explained by the coarse resolution of reanalyse data and the fact that their reliability appears to vary with the location time period and variables considered martins et al 2016 for rh despite some variability in fig 2 kge remains high wind speed kge values are much lower around 0 2 but fig 2 shows relative agreement in the overall amplitude of the wind overall these results show acceptable consistency between the observed data and the reanalyses for the key climatic variables at the kayes kita nioro du sahel and bamako senou stations accordingly the reanalyses were used as reference here for assessing the performance of climate models 3 2 performance of gcms and rcms against reanalyses data fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of the difference in the annual et0 of climate models and reanalyses over the period 1984 2000 results show that the difference in annual et0 between reanalyses and gcms varies from 1560 to 820 mm depending on the models fig 3 the maximum negative values are obtained by ipsl cm5a rc and csiro mk3 6 0 models in sahelian and sudanian climate zones for the ensemble average of all models the difference ranges from 747 to 283 mm individually the hadgem cnrm and canesm models exhibit et0 values closer to reanalyses rcms on the other hand show et0 values that are closer to reanalyses compared to gcms however they generally tend to overestimate evapotranspiration while gcms here tend to underestimate it for example the difference in annual et0 between reanalyses and regional models ranges from 483 to 1110 mm depending on the model the ensemble average of all regional models shows a difference ranging from 139 to 720 mm fig 4 the et0 values of the regional models canesm2 rca4 cnrm cm5 rca4 and hadgem2 es rca4 are closer to those obtained with reanalyses overall the results show that the differences between et0 values from reanalysis data and climate models are relatively high this may be explained by the difficulty of climate models to reproduce correctly the climate variables used for estimating reference evapotranspiration indeed the et0 values obtained from reanalyses are closer to those of bodian 2011 and djaman et al 2015 in senegal river basin according to bodian 2011 at lab√© and siguiri guinean zone weather stations the observed values of et0 were 1611 mm and 1969 mm over the period 1960 1996 for these two stations the values of reanalyses are 1838 mm and 1936 mm over the period 1984 2017 moreover in sahelian zone djaman et al 2015 used the observed data of africa rice center research stations at ndiaye and fanaye sahelian regional station senegal for estimation reference evapotranspiration over february 2013 and may 2014 they showed that reference evapotranspiration varies from 1 to 14 mm day with an average of 6 mm day 2190 mm year at ndiaye and from 3 to 18 mm day with an average of 10 mm day 3650 mm year at fanaye for the reanalyses et0 varies between 1 18 mm day with an average of 8 mm day 2920 mm year over the period 1984 2017 at fanaye figs 4 and 5 respectively give the spatial distribution of kge and pbias and fig 6 gives a synthesis of kge and pbias as a function of climatic zones for the gcms the kge vary from 0 35 to 0 68 the highest values are obtained by the canesm2 and gdfl esm2m models and the lowest by csiro mk3 6 0 and hadgem2 es the biases vary from 124 to 38 the mean values of pbias show that gcms underestimate evapotranspiration in 91 of stations in the basin the average of all gcms shows kge values of 0 09 to 0 48 and biases of 58 to 24 from a spatial point of view the results are almost similar depending on the climatic zones from the guinean zone to the sahelian one the gcms have kge of less than 0 60 and underestimate the evapotranspiration these results obtained show that gcms are less robust for the estimation of evapotranspiration this can be explained by the coarse resolution of the gcms and their uncertainty in estimating the climate variables necessary for the estimation of evapotranspiration fig 4 shows that the kge of rcms are greater than 0 60 in the most of the stations and are more in agreement with the reanalyses than the gcms the average kge and pbias of the regional models vary from 0 21 to 0 87 and from 8 to 27 respectively unlike gcms rcms overestimate et0 at 88 of stations from a spatial point of view the mean kge values of multi models ensemble are 0 70 min and max vary from 0 54 to 0 87 in guinean zone 0 72 0 43 to 0 83 in sudanian area and 0 67 0 36 to 0 85 in the sahelian zone the pbias show that all rcms overestimate evapotranspiration in all climate zones with the exception of csiro mk3 6 0 rca4 and miroc5rc rca4 which underestimate it in the guinean zone moreover some regional models have better performances than the ensemble average of all models in some climate zones for example in guinean zone the kge values of csiro mk3 6 0 rca4 hadgem2 es rca4 and miroc5rc rca4 are respectively 0 73 0 74 and 0 76 and that of the ensemble average models is 0 70 however in sahelian and sudanian zones the ensemble performs better than the individual models overall rcms are more robust than gcms for estimating evapotranspiration in the senegal river basin for this purpose only rcms will be taken into account in subsequent analyses the reanalyses data used to perform climate models seem coherent with observed data used by bodian 2011 and djaman et al 2015 in the high basin and the valley of senegal river moreover the different values of kge and pbias obtained by the models in the climate zones may be explained by the structure of the models the heterogeneity of the landscape and the number of stations used in each climate zones for example in guinean zone 1 of the basin only the mean values of five stations are analyzed against 33 and 26 stations in sudanian 37 and sahelian zones 62 respectively the reanalyses used as a reference are not validated by observed data which can influence the calculation of the rate of reference evapotranspiration the difficulty of climate models in correctly simulating the variables necessary for estimating et0 would also be a source of uncertainty 3 3 change in evapotranspiration by 2065 all the models agree on a positive variation in evapotranspiration on the period 2036 2065 fig 7 shows mean values of annual evapotranspiration in both historical and projection periods according to the climate zones fig 8 gives the spatial distribution of the et0 change at annual and seasonal scales in the guinean zone the minimum and maximum values of annual et0 vary from 1355 to 2521 mm on the period 1971 2000 according to climate models during the period 2036 2065 these values vary from 1455 to 2657 mm for rcp4 5 and 1457 2696 mm for rcp8 5 the maximum values were obtained by ipsl cm5a mr rca4 the increase of et0 in the guinean zone varies from 14 to 173 mm i e 2 11 for rcp4 5 and from 55 to 196 mm i e 2 4 11 for rcp8 5 according to the models in sudanian zone the et0 values vary from 1902 to 2390 mm over the period 1971 2000 the et0 for the period 2036 2065 vary from 2046 to 2386 for rcp4 5 and 2051 4056 mm for rcp8 5 this means that according to the models et0 will increase by 2 9 56 285 mm for rcp4 5 and 4 11 99 365 mm for rcp8 5 until 2065 the et0 values will reach 4095 mm for rcp4 5 and 4153 mm for rcp8 5 compared to the period 1971 2000 where the maximum value of et0 was 3810 mm in the sahelian zone the increase of et0 varies between 3 10 63 and 293 mm for rcp4 5 and 3 12 106 387 mm for rcp8 5 moreover it is interesting to note that among the models miroc5 rca4 shows higher values of et0 for rcp4 5 than rcp8 5 in the three climate zones this surprising result may be explained by the interactions between local climatic processes and the reduced maximum temperature and wind speed modelled by this rcms under scenario rcp8 5 section 3 4 2 at the seasonal scale the models show that until 2065 evapotranspiration will increase during the dry and wet season for example in the sahelian zone the et0 will increase between 27 and 181 mm 2 9 for rcp4 5 and 72 189 mm 4 10 for rcp8 5 in the guinean and sudanian zones the maximum values of et0 will respectively reach 123 150 mm for rcp4 5 and 128 176 mm for rcp8 5 during the rainy season et0 will increase at a rate of 0 18 in sahelian and sudanian zones according to the models and the two scenarios it will increase from 3 to 15 in the guinean zone overall according to the rcms the et0 will continue to increase until 2065 in senegal river basin similar results have been obtained in different regions of the world thus obada et al 2017 noted that all three models they used project an increase in et0 from 3 to 10 91 in benin west africa over the period 2041 2070 in a semi climate arid in spain gim√©nez and garc√≠a galiano 2018 predict an increase in et0 from 4 42 to 16 21 by 2050 compared to the average for the period 1960 1990 the increase in et0 by 2050 could be accompanied by a decrease in flows indeed according to bodian et al 2018 compared to the period 1971 2000 the annual flows of the bafing the main tributary of the senegal river will decrease by 8 according to the rcp4 5 scenario and by 16 under rcp8 5 scenario by 2050 in west africa this means that the annual flows depend on precipitation variability and evapotranspiration the continued increase of the latter may affect the water resources and exacerbate competition between users moreover it is important to note that ndiaye et al 2020b highlighted a significant decrease of evapotranspiration in the sahelian zone and mentioned the existence of an evaporation paradox in the senegal river basin on the period 1987 2017 however no model has highlighted a significant decrease of evapotranspiration on the period 2036 2065 therefore the evaporation paradox will not exist on the period 2036 2065 according to the rcms 3 4 sensitivity of future evapotranspiration to climatic variables the influence of climatic variables on evapotranspiration is determined by calculating a sensitivity coefficient thus fig 9 gives the spatial distribution of the annual sensitivity coefficients according to the models and table 2 indicates the average values of the coefficients according to climatic zones with the exception of relative humidity all variables have positive sensitivity coefficients in other words their increase leads to an increase in evapotranspiration table 3 shows that the relative humidity sensitivity coefficients vary from 0 90 to 8 from 0 90 to 8 4 depending on the models under both the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the maximum values of relative humidity are observed in the guinean zone and those minimum in the sahelian zone the maximum temperature coefficients range from 1 35 to 2 59 under rcp4 5 and from 1 35 to 2 49 under rcp8 5 the influence of maximum temperature on evapotranspiration is greater in the sahelian and sudanian areas solar radiation is the third variable that has the most influence on et0 with coefficients varying from 0 60 to 0 97 under the two scenarios its maximum values are noted in the guinean zone wind speed and minimum temperature have less influence on et0 with coefficients below 0 35 wind speed has more influence on et0 in the sahelian and sudanian areas the results obtained confirm those of ndiaye et al 2020b who noted that evapotranspiration is more sensitive to relative humidity maximum temperature and solar radiation in the senegal river basin over the period 1984 2017 on a seasonal scale relative humidity maximum temperature and solar radiation are always the variables that have the most influence on evapotranspiration the influence of relative humidity on et0 is more significant during the rainy season and in the guinean zone with coefficients varying from 0 86 to 3 49 under rcp4 5 and from 8 07 to 15 36 under rcp8 5 et0 is more sensitive to maximum temperature during the dry season and in the sudanese and sahelian areas solar radiation has more influence on et0 in the guinean area and during the rainy season the sensitivity analysis shows that future evapotranspiration will be more influenced by relative humidity maximum temperature and solar radiation therefore it would be important to pay more attention to the measurement and or estimation of these climatic variables in order to ensure a good estimate of evapotranspiration it is also important to note that the climate variable influence on et0 depend on climate zones the influence of relative humidity and solar radiation is more significant in guinean zone than in sahelian and sudanian ones however in sudanian and sahelian zones the et0 is most sensible to maximum temperature minimum temperature and wind 3 5 is the climate stationary in 2036 2065 3 5 1 future trends in evapotranspiration the spatial distribution of mann kendall s z of annual and seasonal evapotranspiration on the period 2036 2065 is given in fig 10 the average of all regional models shows a significant increase p 0 05 in annual and seasonal et0 over the entire basin according to the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the hadgem2 es rca4 ipsl cm5a mr rca4 csiro mk3 6 0 rca4 and canesm2 rca4 models show a significant increase in annual evapotranspiration for all the models only gfdl esm2m rca4 shows a non significant trend in annual and seasonal et0 over the entire basin fig 11 shows the magnitude of the et0 trends depending on the models in the guinean zone the annual et0 increases by 1 78 mm year according to the rcp4 5 scenario and by 3 06 mm year according to rcp8 5 by 2065 according to the two scenarios the annual average et0 increases respectively by 2 55 mm year to 3 78 mm year in the sudanian zone and from 2 83 mm year to 4 4 mm year in the sahelian zone the trend analysis shows that overall evapotranspiration will increase significantly p 0 05 by 2065 in the senegal river basin similar results are obtained by some studies across the world indeed the work of dong et al 2019 pointed out a continuous increase in evapotranspiration throughout the 21 st century in china s semi arid climate ndiaye et al 2020b showed a significant increase in the annual et0 in 32 of the senegal river basin during the period 1984 2017 however ndiaye et al 2020b also showed a significant drop in et0 in sahelian area of the basin despite the increase in temperature here projections do not reveal a drop in et0 and results indicate that this evaporation paradox will disappear from the basin by 2050 the increase in et0 could have impacts on the hydrological cycle and on agriculture indeed from a hydrological point of view the continuous increase in et0 can affect the rainfall effective and exacerbate the arid conditions of a given environment goyal 2004 in agriculture sector increasing et0 tends to increase aridity decrease soil moisture and effective rainfall aub√© 2016 this increase in et0 could also lead to an increase in crop water demand and an increase in irrigation costs rahman et al 2018 3 5 2 future trends in climate variables fig 12 shows the future spatial distribution of mann kendall s z of climate variables at the annual scale all models agree on a significant increase in minimum and maximum temperatures with the exception of the rcp4 5 scenario of the noaa gfdl esm2m rca4 and miroc5 rca4 models which shows a non significant trend in these two climate variables a non significant decrease p 0 05 in relative humidity was also noted over the entire basin of all the models only canesm2 rca4 hadgem2 es rca4 miroc5 rca4 and multi model exhibit a significant decrease in wind speed and solar radiation hadgem2 es rca4 showed a decrease in wind speed in 8 of the basin area for the rcp4 5 scenario and in 12 of this for rcp8 5 this decrease in wind speed mentioned in ndiaye et al 2020b is confirmed in future projections in addition to the decrease in wind speed some models show a significant decrease in solar radiation indeed the ensemble shows a significant decrease in solar radiation for 46 of the basin area according to the two scenarios a significant decrease in radiation is also highlighted by ipsl cm5a mr rca4 in 11 and 99 of the basin according to the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively according to the rcp8 5 scenario miroc5 rca4 and canesm2 rca4 respectively show a significant decrease in radiation in 21 and 83 of the basin area table 4 gives a summary of sen slope values of climate variables over the period 2036 2065 according to climatic zones considering the average of all the models the minimum temperature varies from 0 02 c year to 0 04 c year according to the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the maximum temperature increases from 0 05 c year to 0 06 c year for rcp4 5 and from 0 01 c year to 0 02 c year for rcp8 5 for maximum temperature the low values obtained by ensemble rcp8 5 can be explained by the low values of csiro mk3 6 0 rca4 hadgem2 es rca4 and miroc5 rca4 this indicates that the multi model ensemble is not always preferable as it here leads to a lower incongruous increase in temperature with rcp8 5 than with rcp4 5 moreover for the rcp4 5 the models show that the maximum temperature will increase from 1 3 to 2 5 c in guinean zone 1 3 2 7 c in sudanian zone and from 1 3 to 2 8 c in sahelian one for the rcp8 5 the high values of maximum temperature vary between 3 1 and 3 3 c depending on climate zones the minimum temperature will respectively increase by 2 9 3 2 and 3 3 c in guinean sudanian and sahelian zones under rcp4 5 according to rcp8 5 the minimum temperature will vary between 3 2 3 9 c according to the climate models the maximum values are noted in sahelian and sudanian zones it is also important to note that the minimum temperatures increase faster than the maximum ones the same results are obtained by ly et al 2013 in west africa and samba and nganga 2014 in congo brazzaville who noted that the increase of minimum temperature is more important than the maximum this situation may be explained by the concentration of aerosol which reduce the solar radiation reaching the earth surface ringard et al 2014 this increase in temperature can also affect crops for example diop 2009 mentioned that ecological monitoring carried out in nianga podor senegal river basin showed that certain varieties of rice have abortion rates of 33 57 when the temperature exceeds 35 c relative humidity varies from 0 17 to 7 year in the guinean zone from 0 6 7 in the sudanese one and from 0 9 to 6 year in the sahelian zone according to the two scenarios wind speed and solar radiation vary respectively from 0 025 to 4 11 m year and from 1 6 to 1 7 mj m 2 d 1 year depending on both scenarios and depending on climatic zones on a seasonal scale all models predict a significant increase in temperatures during the dry and rainy season the models also predict an insignificant decrease in wind speed and relative humidity during both seasons the downward trend in solar radiation is generally insignificant on a seasonal scale trend analysis show a significant increase in temperatures in the senegal river basin this rise in temperatures would be considered the main reason for the significant increase in evapotranspiration in the period 2036 2065 this information associated with the trend of et0 and climate variable allow to note that horizon 2036 2065 will not be stationary and the climate will continue to change if the temperature increase at the current rate indeed significant positive trend is both et0 and temperatures is showed by rcms this confirms the studies by abiye et al 2019 and ndiaye et al 2020b according to which the temperature maximum and minimum is the main factor of variation of evapotranspiration during the periods 1906 2015 and 1984 2017 in west africa and in the senegal river basin of all the variables only wind speed and solar radiation show a significant decrease depending on the models the decrease in wind speed wind stilling and solar radiation global dimming explains the decrease in evapotranspiration mentioned by some authors mcvicar et al 2012 chu et al 2017 han et al 2019 bian et al 2020 ndiaye et al 2020b this decrease in solar radiation is linked to the concentration of aerosols in the atmosphere due to human activities han et al 2019 4 conclusion the results of this study show that the et0 values obtained by the rcms are closer to those of the reanalyses than the gcms though they tend to overestimate et0 trend analysis shows almost all models agree on a significant increase in reference evapotranspiration in the period 2036 2065 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the ensemble provides an increase in et0 of 39 mm for rcp4 5 and 144 mm for rcp8 5 in the guinean zone in the sudanese and sahelian zones et0 will increase respectively from 48 mm to 266 mm and from 57 mm to 277 mm according to the two scenarios trends in climate variables show a significant increase in maximum and minimum temperatures this rise in temperatures is shown to be the primary explanation for the increase in et0 though some models also highlight a significant decrease in wind speed and solar radiation sensitivity analysis reveals that et0 is more sensitive to relative humidity maximum temperature and solar radiation the increase in the future will increase crop water requirements accentuate water losses in reservoirs reduce hydroelectric deliverability and increase competition between different users it is important to note that this increase of et0 will not be stationary in 2065 and may continue to increase if the temperatures rise at the same rate furthermore this work underlines the discrepancies between results based on gcms and rcms as well as those between individual rcms when estimating evapotranspiration these differences highlight the importance of improving the performance of climate circulation models both gcms and rcms to allow for a more accurate and reliable estimate of climate variables needed to analyze long term et0 variations projections it would also be important to have complete in situ meteorological observations to fill in the gaps and improve climate simulations author statement conceptualization p m n a b and l d methodology p m n a b
