spectroscopy ftir sem tem and tga that all confirmed the successful functionalization of go structure polysulfone psf ultrafiltration membranes incorporating varied loadings of go and rgo dda were then fabricated via phase inversion approach all membranes were characterized in terms of chemical structure morphology hydrophilicity porosity and mean pore size cross section sem images showed the distribution of go and rgo dda between the pores and on the polymer walls afm results demonstrated that go addition increased the roughness of membrane while with rgo dda addition the surface became smoother pristine psf and rgo dda based membranes exhibited similar hydrophilicity while go based membranes exhibited higher hydrophilicity as revealed by contact angle measurements permeability separation and antifouling experiments were performed in a cross flow membrane setup and showed that flux decreases with the increase in go and rgo dda concentration rgo dda membranes showed higher antifouling and antibacterial performance compared to the pristine psf and go membranes neat psf exhibited 65 4 flux recovery ratio frr against bsa that was increased to 86 9 and 89 1 with go 0 1 and rgo dda 0 1 respectively against ha frr was improved from 87 8 for neat psf to 95 6 and 99 3 with go 0 1 and rgo dda 0 1 respectively additionally rgo dda membrane exhibited higher bacteriostatis rate 83 6 against h aquamarina than go membrane 62 9 moreover rgo dda nanoparticles exhibited excellent dispersibility in several solvents making them promising nanofillers for various membranes with high antifouling and antibacterial performance keywords dodecylamine graphene oxide ultrafiltration antifouling antibacterial effect 1 introduction amongst the several technologies evolved in water treatment and purification sector membrane based processes are considered promising solution to afford clean water 1 it is considered efficient and economical due to the low energy consumption small footprint and the relatively low cost compared to other technologies 2 several membrane based processes have been arisen to meet the various needs in water treatment sector including microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis ro and forward osmosis fo among them uf is a fast growing technology that has demonstrated a remarkable contribution to water treatment sector because of its capability to separate a wide range of impurities from water at low cost it is considered an efficient and economical pre treatment process for nf and ro 3 uf can separate proteins turbidity viruses bacteria and various organic matters from wastewater in a safe clean and efficient way the utilization of uf membranes is not only limited to water treatment but also it showed an increasing interest in chemical recovery dairy production food industry pharmaceutical applications and textile industry and paint treatment 4 5 despite of the several advantages of membranes their susceptibility to fouling is still a bottleneck issue in many applications fouling is a phenomenon where pollutants in the wastewater accumulate onto the membrane surface and block the pores resulting in a decline in the membrane performance and shortage in its service life 6 hence investigating new methods materials and fillers became the focus of most studies aiming to produce high efficient membranes with high fouling resistance the use of nanomaterials as membrane fillers is one of the well established methods being developed in membrane sector 7 the addition of nanofillers can improve membrane performance and properties like antifouling antibacterial activity flux and rejection 8 various nanomaterials have been investigated as membrane nanofillers and exhibited high performance such as carbon nanotubes cnts 9 zeolites 10 metal organic frame works mofs 11 graphene based materials 12 13 sio2 14 mxene 15 tio2 16 etc among them graphene oxide go and go based materials attracted remarkable research interest in the past few years due to their stability tuneability mechanical strength and easy accessibility 17 furthermore go based materials exhibit high fouling resistance and bactericidal effects against various foulants and bacteria making them promising nanofillers to produce high antifouling membranes 18 19 additionally the oxygen content in the functional groups e g hydroxyls carboxyls ketones and epoxides existing on the go sheets edges enriches go hydrophilicity and make it a versatile platform for further functionalization to derive other graphene based materials to meet different purposes 20 21 furthermore go can be easily exfoliated in various polymer matrices and polar aprotic solvents 22 which makes it a good candidate to be utilized as nanofiller in membranes fabrication sector the efficient utilization of nanofillers in membranes fabrication depends on the better interfacial interaction between polymeric matrix and the nanofiller as well as the uniform and stable dispersion in the matrix 23 however pristine nanoparticles e g cnts go etc cannot achieve stable and uniform dispersion which limits the efficiency of using them as fillers in some polymer matrices 24 therefore several studies investigated the effect of functionalization on the properties of nanoparticles as well as on the overall membrane performance studies reported that a successful functionalization could significantly enhance go properties to fit different purposes and applications for example go functionalization with hydrophobic materials like octadecylamine oda 25 and n butylamine nba 26 enhances the performance in membrane distillation md processes where the membrane hydrophobicity is preferable in contrast go functionalization with hydrophilic materials like polydopamine pda 27 polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp 28 and starch 29 enhances the performance in membrane processes where the hydrophilicity is desirable e g uf nf ro etc several studies have been conducted in literature on the functionalization of go for different membrane based water treatment processes including fo ro nf and uf safarpour et al 30 31 studied the effect of go functionalization with tio2 on ro and nf membranes and reported a clear improvement of fouling resistance rajakumaran et al 32 prepared ro membranes by incorporating amino functionalized zinc oxide zno and go composites go zno into the thin film nanocomposite layer tfn and reported better antifouling performance compared to pristine membrane zhang et al 33 have recently reported that modifying go with p aminophenol enhanced the antibacterial of ro membranes significantly when compared to goro and pristine ro membranes similar studies investigated the effect of go functionalization with various functional groups on the fouling resistance of uf membranes and showed clear improvement against various foulants functional materials used to functionalize go include isocyanate 34 hyperbranched polyethyleneimine hpei 35 cysteine 36 guanidyl 37 polydopamine pda 27 among the various functional groups investigated in the functionalization of go nanosheets amines are considered promising agents that can enhance go properties as well as the overall membrane performance the amination of go nanosheets is not novel and was investigated in different studies using various amines for example the amination of go with hpei could improve the interactions between the nanofiller e g go hpei and the polymer matrix which enhanced the mechanical properties of polyethersulfone pes membrane 35 in a previous work we demonstrated that the go amination with pda could enhance the flux and the fouling resistance without compromising the rejection performance 27 similar observation has been also reported with 3 aminopropyl triethoxysilane apts aminated go that showed significant enhancement of the sulfonated pes performance in terms of flux and organic fouling resistance 38 moreover amine functionalization of go nanosheets was found to enhance the membrane s antibacterial activity 35 39 in this context dodecylamine dda a cationic surfactant can be a promising functionalizing agent that enhances go properties in terms of fouling resistance and antibacterial activity dda was previously used to functionalize multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts and exhibited 46 antifouling enhancement against proteins 40 additionally studies reported that dda has strong bactericidal effects against several bacteria 41 dda can also promote the formation of alkyl group on the edges of go nanosheets providing better dispersibility of go in non polar solvents and a better distribution within the polymer matrix 42 the higher dispersibility of go nanosheets in the solvent leads to a better distribution and interactions of go with the polymer matrix in this work amine functionalized go nanoparticles were prepared and used as nanofiller in uf polysulfone psf composite membranes the amination of go was carried out using the direct functionalization of go nanosheets with dda via a simple temperature assisted reflux method we aim through this study to investigate the synergetic effects of go and dda on the antifouling properties and the bactericidal activity of psf composite membranes pristine go and rgo dda nanosheets were incorporated into psf via the non solvent induced phase separation technique nips at low concentrations 0 0 15 wt the dynamic fouling resistance of the fabricated membranes was investigated against organic and protein fouling represented by humic acid ha and bovine serum albumin bsa respectively the antibacterial activity of the prepared membranes against halomonas aquamarina h aquamarina as the model bacterium was studied using bacteriostasis rate determination approach the effect of go and rgo dda incorporation on the psf morphology hydrophilicity permeability and separation efficiency was investigated too moreover

schematic representation of the go synthesis the amination reaction with dda and the anticipated structure of rgo dda is presented in fig 1 2 3 membranes preparation bare psf psf go and psf rgo dda mixed matrix membranes mmms were prepared using the well known non solvent induced phase separation method 44 in brief psf 17 wt in nmp was used as the main casting solution with 3 wt pvp as the pore former for the preparation of psf go and psf rgo dda casting solutions two stock dispersions 0 5 mg ml of the pristine go and rgo dda in nmp were prepared and sonicated for 2 h different loadings of go and rgo dda were then added to nmp according to table 1 psf and pvp were then slowly added to the dispersions and stirred vigorously for 2 h followed by slow stirring overnight until homogenous solutions were obtained figure s1 in the supplementary information the obtained solutions were then casted on a clean glass plate at a uniform speed using an automated casting machine equipped with a film applicator elcometer uk the casted solutions were then soaked into a coagulant bath di where the phase inversion took place and the membrane detached freely from the glass plate the obtained membranes were then washed and kept in di for until testing fig 2 illustrates the phase inversion technique for the fabrication of membranes studied in this work the compositions and codes of the prepared membranes are presented in table 1 2 4 nanoparticles characterization the properties of the synthesized go and rgo dda nanoparticles were analyzed using different characterization techniques

tecnai f20 200 kv and scanning electron microscopy sem using jeol model jsm 6390lv moreover the thermal stability of both nanoparticles was analyzed using the thermogravimetric analysis tga with a perkinelmer thermogravimetric analyzer pyris 6 tga at a heating rate of 10 c min temperature range of 30 800 c and under nitrogen 2 5 dispersion studies of go and rgo dda the dispersibility of go and rgo dda nanoparticles was investigated in di and various organic solvents including dodecane hexane toluene nmp dmf and dmac the dispersibility measurements were conducted with a concentration of 0 5 mg ml in an ultrasonic bath sonicator at room temperature for 2 h 2 6 membranes characterization to investigate the effect of go incorporation into the psf matrix the prepared membranes were characterized using ftir uatr perkin elmer 2000 surface and cross section sem images at different magnifications were obtained using jeol model jsm 6390lv the preparation of cross section samples was done by freezing the membrane samples in liquid nitrogen and then fracturing them to prevent the deformation of the membranes structure 45 46 the surface roughness of the prepared membranes in terms of the root mean square roughness rms and average roughness ra were evaluated using the atomic force microscopy afm mfp 3d from asylum research us afm images were obtained over a scan area of 5 5 μm with 1 hz scan rate membranes hydrophilicity in terms of water contact angle ca was measured with a dataphysics contact angle analyzer oca15 pro germany the ca measurements were conducted using di droplets of 2 μm at minimum of 15 points of each membrane membranes porosity measurements were carried out using the gravimetric method two circular samples of the prepared membranes were obtained

immediately ww the samples were dried overnight and the dry membrane weight wd was then recorded the membrane porosity was then estimated using eq 1 27 47 1 ε w w w d a l ρ w where a cm2 is the effective membrane area l cm is the membrane thickness determined from the cross section sem images and ρw is the density of water at 23 c 0 998 g cm3 guerout elford ferry equation eq 2 was used to estimate the mean pore size rm of the prepared membranes 48 2 r m 2 9 1 75 ε 8 η l q ε a δ p where δp pa is the operational pressure q m3 s is the volumetric flow rate of the permeate and ƞ is the viscosity of water at 23 c 9 3 10 4 pa s 2 7 permeability rejection and antifouling measurements pure water flux rejection and dynamic fouling measurements were performed using a cross flow membrane unit obtained from sterlitech corp us the feed tank is equipped with a cooling heating water circulator to control the feed temperature fig 3 illustrates the process flow diagram of the membrane unit used in this work all filtration experiments were performed at 1 bar 46 1 0 3 cm s 1 cross flow velocity and a temperature of 23 0 5 c briefly the membrane was firstly compacted with di for 30 min at 4 bar the pressure was then reduced to 1 bar and kept for additional 30 min to ensure a stable flux the pure water flux jw0 lmh and permeability pwp lmh bar of membranes were then calculated using eqs 3 and 4 respectively 49 3 j v a t 4 p w p q δ p a where v l is the volume of permeate t h is the sampling time a m2 is the effective filtration area q l h is the volumetric flow rate of permeate and δp bar is the trans membrane pressure difference the rejection and antifouling experiments were then conducted by shifting the feed to freshly prepared solutions of ha 25 mg l and bsa 500 mg l as model organic and protein foulants respectively after 1 h filtration time the foulant flux jwf and rejection r were then calculated according to eqs 3 and 5 respectively 5 r 1 c p c f 100 where cf and cp are the foulant concentrations in the feed and permeate respectively ha and bsa concentrations were measured at 254 nm 47 50 and 278 nm 51 52 respectively with a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2700 shimadzu japan after foulants filtration the feed was shifted back to di for membrane washing three washing cycles 10 min each were performed without an applied pressure at 46 1 0 3 cm s 1 cross flow velocity the steady pwf jw1 was then recorded at 1 bar and the same cross flow velocity the flux recovery ratio frr total fouling ratio rt irreversible fouling ratio rir and reversible fouling ratio

measurements the antibacterial properties of the pristine psf and composite membranes were evaluated by the bacteriostasis rate determination method 35 55 h aquamarina were used as the model bacterium 16 mg of the psf psf go and psf rgo dda were cut and washed with ethanol then with di to remove ethanol residuals membrane samples were then added to 10 ml of luria bertani lb solution incubated with appropriate volume of halomonas to obtain initial optical density of 0 1 at 600 nm od600 samples were then incubated at 30 c for 18 h after which they were removed from cultures and rinsed with saline the serial dilution technique was employed to get the actual number of cells at the beginning and the end of experiment t 0 and t 18 h the number of colonies on each plate was determined using the counting method bacteristasis rate br was then calculated using eq 10 10 b r n 0 n 1 n 0 100 where n0 and n1 represent the number of colonies on the plates treated with the control membrane e g pristine psf and plates treated with the hybrid membranes e g psf go and psf rgo dda respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 nanoparticles characterization the ftir uatr spectra of dda pristine go and rgo dda are presented in fig 4 a the graphite oxidation can be confirmed by the presence of different bands related to the oxygenated functional groups in the spectra of pristine go these bands were previously reported with go nanoparticles 43 56 fig 4a confirms also the successful functionalization of go with dda by the emergence of different bands the two bands around 2917 and 2849 cm 1 correspond to c h stretching vibration 57 moreover the formation of amide carbonyl bonds between dda and go sheets is confirmed by the presence of nh amide bending and cn amide stretching at 1546 and 1464 cm 1 respectively 58 the spectra also show that the co band at 1707 cm 1 was reduced with the rgo dda due to the reduction of the oxygen along with the alkyl chain addition to the go structure 22 fig 4b shows the raman spectra of the pristine go and rgo dda and confirms the go formation through the presence of d and g bands that are characteristic for go based materials 43 it has been reported in various studies that the intensities ratio of d and g bands id ig is related to the crystallite properties of go 59 60 the id ig ratio for the pristine go and rgo dda were estimated from the spectra deconvolution and fitting and were found to be 1 8 and 2 1 respectively indicating an obvious change in the crystallite structure caused by the functionalization reaction with dda the increase in the id ig ratio can be attributed to the formation of sp3 carbon within the sp2 carbon network of graphene 57 the deconvolution and fitting of raman spectra as well as the bands parameters are presented in figure s2 and table s1 in the supplementary information respectively the elemental analysis results table 2 shows good degree of graphite oxidation represented by the high oxygen content and o c ratio 50 and 1 1 respectively however the functionalization with dda reduced the go oxygen content to 12 3 wt and increased c n and h compositions to 77 4 3 8 and 6 5 wt respectively due to the addition of the alkyl chain which agrees with the findings of the ftir analysis the sem images shown in fig 5 a show clear difference in the morphology of go and rgo dda nanoparticles the pristine go nanoparticles exhibit clear sharp and smooth surface while rgo dda showed irregular structure and high roughness this observation has been reported with different amine functionalized go nanoparticles 23 25 61 and can be explained by the intercalation and attachment of dda molecules between go sheets the different morphological structure can be also confirmed by the tem images shown in fig 5b the pristine go sheets exhibit wrinkled surface with high transparency indicating a low stacking level and high oxidation degree of go nanoparticles 43 56 on the other hand rgo dda exhibits opaque and dense surfaces caused by the go reduction which cause an increase in the staking level of go sheets similar observations were reported with the functionalization of go with different amines such as pda 61 oda 62 p phenylenediamine ppd and hexamethylene diamine hmd 63 the thermal stability of go and rgo dda nanoparticles was investigated using the tga analysis the tga curves shown in figure s3 in the supplementary information suggest different thermal stabilities of go and rgo dda nanoparticles which is mainly attributed to the difference of their elemental compositions 43 the tga curve of pristine go shows a slight weight reduction around 100 c attributed to the evaporation of water molecules between the go nanosheets however no weight loss was observed before 100 c with rgo dda which indicates a hydrophobic nature of rgo dda that resists water to be attached to its surface during functionalization both go and rgo dda exhibited a major weight loss around 243 c and 307 c the major loss in this temperature range is usually attributed to the thermal degradation of oxygenated functional groups of go 64 the oxygenated groups of go sheets were reduced when functionalized with dda as revealed by the ftir and the elemental analysis therefore the major weight loss with rgo dda nanoparticles occurred at higher temperature compared to the pristine go in summary all characterization techniques confirm the successful functionalization and incorporation of dda molecules on the surface and between go sheets 3 2 dispersion studies of go and rgo dda photographs of go and rgo dda dispersions just after sonication are shown in fig 6 go showed good degree of dispersion in di dmf dma and nmp however in dodecane toluene and hexane the dispersion was very poor which agrees with other studies in the literature 23 61 in comparison rgo dda exhibited higher dispersibility in all solvents except in di the poor dispersion of rgo dda in di can be related to the reduction of the oxygen along with the alkyl chain addition to the go structure 22 which reduces the hydrophilicity of go sheets the good dispersion of rgo dda in other solvents allows it utilization as membrane filler with various types of polymers psf pvdf pes pan etc and for different applications uf nf fo and ro however the limited dispersion properties of the raw go restrict its usage for such applications 24 3 3 membranes characterization 3 3 1 ftir uatr spectra ftir uatr spectra of the control psf psf go and psf rgo dda composite membranes are presented in fig 7 the psf characteristic bands are presented in all spectra around 1664 1320 1291 1241 1150 1108 cm 1 corresponding to aromatic ring breathing oso asymmetric stretching so stretching coc stretching oso symmetric stretching and so stretching the two bands around 1586 and 1487 cm 1 correspond to the aromatic ring stretching these bands have been previously reported with psf membranes 65 66 the spectra of the composite membranes are almost identical to this of the pristine psf and depict no difference which can be related to the dominance of psf and the low concentrations of nanofillers in the polymer matrix 67 3 3 2 morphology sem afm surface and cross section sem were studied at various magnifications to investigate the influence of go and rgo dda incorporation on psf morphological structure figs 8 and 9 show the obtained sem images with different concentrations of go and rgo dda respectively in the surface sem images no clear difference between the bare psf psf go and psf rgo dda can be observed on the other hand clear influence of go and rgo dda addition on psf structure can be observed from the cross section sem images all membranes showed two distinct layers a top layer with a semi dense structure and a sublayer with a sponge structure the sub layer is characterized by the presence of several macro voids with finger like structure that have been enlarged and became wider with the go embedding fig 8 similar findings have been reported in the literature and can be attributed to the go hydrophilicity that accelerates the mass transfer between water and solvent during the nips process 54 68 69 in contrast no significant enlargement can be observed in the pore structure with the addition of rgo dda fig 9 which can be related to its hydrophobic nature as discussed earlier high magnification sem images presented in fig 10 show that both nanofillers aggregate in some areas of the sublayer and partially clog the membrane pores this is considered one of the drawbacks of go embedding in mmms as this blockage decreases the water permeance across the membrane as elaborated in the following sections the membrane separation and antifouling properties are also affected by the surface roughness 70 therefore afm analysis was employed to investigate the effects of go and rgo dda embedding on the surface roughness the 3d afm images over 5 5 μm scan area and roughness parameters of the tested membranes are shown in fig 11 and table 3 respectively the results show a clear increase in the surface roughness with the high concentrations of pristine go while it remains the same with low concentrations of go e g 0 02 the roughness parameters of the neat psf were 7 1 and 5 7 nm for rms and ra respectively that increased up to 16 and 11 5 nm with 0 15 wt go when comparing psf and go based membranes with rgo dda based membranes rms and ra were found to decrease with rgo dda addition indicating that rgo dda based membrane were apparently smoother than the neat psf and go based mmms it well known that membranes with rough surfaces have higher fouling propensity because of the accumulation of foulants in the surface valleys 67 71 while membranes with smoother surface have higher fouling resistance capability 72 3 3 3 hydrophilicity porosity and mean pore size water contact angle ca of the prepared membranes was measured to investigate the effect of go and rgo dda embedding on psf hydrophilicity and is presented in fig 12 the results show a slight enhancement in the hydrophilicity with the embedding of pristine go as the ca decreased from 83 5 with psf to 75 5 with go 0 15 the hydrophilicity enhancement with go addition is attributed to the go hydrophilicity which was observed and reported in several studies 67 73 in contrast rgo dda based mmms exhibited less hydrophilicity than go based mmms the average ca of rgo dda based membranes were close to this of the pristine psf and were in the range of 81 9 83 1 this agrees with the characterization results of rgo dda that showed a hydrophobic nature of rgo dda compared to unfunctionalized go the effect of go rgo dda incorporation on the membrane porosity ɛ and mean pore size rm was investigated by the gravimetric method and the measured values of ɛ and rm are listed in table 3 low dosage of both go and rgo dda e g 0 02 wt increased the porosity of psf from 81 2 to about 86 6 and 86 5 respectively this increase can be attributed to the acceleration of mass transfer rate between the solvent and the coagulant during the nips process as discussed earlier however when increasing the concentration to 0 15 the porosity decreased to 79 9 and 78 7 for go and rgo dda respectively excessive compositions of nanofiller increase the dope solution viscosity which slows the mass transfer rate during the nips process lowers the membrane porosity and forms smaller pores 27 the mean pore size rm of the bare psf membrane was estimated to be 37 5 nm and was decreased with the addition of both nanofillers the estimated rm values were ranging between 33 36 9 nm and 27 5 36 6 nm with go and rgo dda membranes respectively similar findings were reported in the literature 68 73 74 and can be attributed to the increase in dope solution viscosity accompanied with the accumulation of nanofillers in the pores as revealed by the sem analysis fig 10 3 4 permeability and rejection properties the performance of the prepared membranes in terms of the pure water permeability pwp and rejection is illustrated in fig 13 the measured pwp of the neat psf was 181 7 4 6 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 with low concentration of nanomaterial no significant change was observed and the measured pwp was 181 1 9 4 and 180 4 4 5 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 for go 0 02 and rgo dda 0 02 respectively however with excessive concentrations of the go and rgo dda membranes exhibited higher decreases in pwp with 0 15 wt go pwp decreased by approximately 26 while the decrease was much higher with 0 15 wt rgo dda 51 the flux decline at high go concentrations was reported in many studies 35 67 73 and is mainly attributed to the increase in dope solution viscosity 75 77 as discussed earlier the increase in viscosity decreases the porosity and the mean pore size and hence decreases the water flux the filler concentration after which the permeability decreases is generally referred to as the tipping mass percentage that differs depending on the type of polymer and filler 67 hence the findings in this work indicate that the tipping mass percentage of both go and rgo dda is lower than 0 02 wt further analysis of the pwp results obtained taking into consideration porosity mean pore size and contact angle measurements shows that pwp decreases as the porosity and pore size decrease regardless the increases in surface hydrophilicity this observation suggests that porosity and pore size have more impact on permeability compared to surface hydrophilicity which agrees with findings by several studies 67 78 79 as depicted in fig 13 a complete rejection of both ha and bsa was observed with the pristine psf and all the go and rgo dda composite membranes figure s4 in the supplementary information presents photographs of feed and permeate samples taken during ha separation experiments the high rejection can be mainly linked to main mechanisms the molecular size exclusion mechanism that retain large molecules like ha and bsa accompanied with the charge based mechanisms that enhances the electrostatic repulsion of foulant molecules with the negatively charged membranes 38 80 similar results were obtained with other go based mmms investigated in the literature like pes spsf go 80 psf go 67 psf go pda 27 pes csgo 36 psf goqd 81 and spes go sio2 nh2 38 3 5 antifouling measurements the high fouling resistance against various foulants is an essential characteristic of a high efficient membrane fouling is a typical phenomenon associated with the membrane filtration process caused by the concentration polymerization and formation of cake layers that block the membrane pores and reduces the flux and permeate quality 2 a flux reduction was observed with all the tested membranes when shifting the feed solution from di to ha or bsa due to the accumulation of foulant molecules on the surface and the formation of cake layers after 1 h of foulant filtration the membranes were washed with di three times 10 min each and exhibited a partial flux recovery that was accordingly calculated frr the antifouling performance against both foulants bsa and ha of the prepared membranes represented by frr values is depicted in fig 14 a obviously all go and rgo dda based membranes showed higher frr compared to this of the neat psf that exhibited 65 4 and 87 8 with bsa and ha respectively with bsa as foulant the frr was significantly improved to 81 3 84 6 89 1 and 93 7 with the embedding of 0 02 0 05 0 1 and 0 15 wt rgo dda respectively in contrast the frr enhancement with the pristine go addition was lower and the maximum frr was 86 9 with go 0 1 when using ha as foulant the frr increased up to 97 0 and 99 3 with go 0 15 and rgo dda 0 1 respectively the antifouling properties of the tested membrane were further analyzed by estimating the fouling resistance parameters that are presented in fig 14b and c for ha and bsa respectively obviously the total fouling ratio rt and the irreversible fouling ratio rir of the pristine psf were higher than these of all modified membranes and vice versa for the reversible fouling ratio rr these results lead to the same conclusion that the modified membranes have higher fouling resistance compared to the neat psf it is well known that the reversible fouling ratio rr of a membrane is highly affected by its surface hydrophilicity and roughness 82 as confirmed by the afm analysis rgo dda based membranes have relatively smoother surfaces than psf and go based membranes therefore the accumulation of foulants is restricted and can be washed easily from the surface during the washing cycles in contrast go based membranes showed higher surface roughness than this of the pristine psf and rgo dda based membranes hence surface roughness enhances the accumulation of foulant molecules in the valleys which cause a significant reduction in the flux during the foulant filtration stage in the next stage washing with di the hydrophilic nature of go nanoparticles distributed on the membrane surface and within the membrane pores induces the removal and washing of foulants with water 82 83 therefore the fouling resistance was enhanced with go embedding regardless the high surface roughness which agrees with some studies in the literature 38 70 84 taken together the findings herein suggest that the fouling resistance of the composite membranes were enhanced by the hydrophilicity in case of the pristine go addition and by the lower surface roughness in case of rgo dda addition figures s5 and s6 in the supplementary information present sem images for some fouled membranes at magnification of 10 000 x at two different locations on the surface with bsa and ha respectively figure s7 in the supplementary information shows microphotographs of ha fouled membranes at two different locations on the surface both sem images and microphotographs confirm the higher fouling resistance of go and rgo dda based mmms compared to the bare psf 3 6 antibacterial activity measurements bacteriostasis rate br determination is commonly performed to quantitatively evaluate the membranes antibacterial activity 35 55 73 as depicted in fig 15 the number of colonies on the pristine psf plate indicates no bactericidal effect against h aquamarina in contrast the number of colonies was much lower with go 0 15 and rgo dda 0 15 composite membranes suggesting a clear antibacterial activity of both nanoparticles the lowest number of bacterial colonies was observed with rgo dda 0 15 that exhibited an antibacterial rate of 83 6 while the antibacterial rate of go 0 15 was only 62 9 both go and dda have bactericidal activity against various bacteria the bactericidal activity of go nanosheets is mainly attributed to two mechanisms the sharp edges of go sheets cause a physical disruption and damage of the bacterial cells when contacting go nanoparticles additionally go induces the oxidative stress on the bacterial cells due to the formation of reactive oxygen species ros 55 85 some studies have reported that the oxidative stress is the major antibacterial mechanism of go based materials and hence go possesses an antibacterial effect even if there is no direct contact between the bacterial cells and go edges 86 87 the go bactericidal activity is further enhanced when functionalized with dda due to the amine functionality that assists the electrostatic interactions between the bacteria and go nanosheets 39 therefore rgo dda exhibited a synergetic antibacterial effect against h aquamarina resulting in a higher bacteriostasis rate duan et al 55 prepared pes uf membranes incorporating graphene oxide immobilized lysozyme go ly and reduced graphene oxide crgo and reported antibacterial rate of 68 and 71 respectively similar work was conducted by yu et al 35 by embedding go modified by hyperbranched polyethylenimine hepi go into pes and reported a bacteriostasis rate of 74 88 it is commonly known that the antibacterial activity of a go based material is highly dependent on the topography roughness wettability and hydrophobicity of the surface 88 89 furthermore the bacterial adsorption on surfaces with moderate hydrophobicity contact angle of 45 130 is stronger than this on hydrophilic surfaces 88 90 therefore the bacterial adsorption on rgo dda membranes might be higher than this on go based membranes as they have slightly higher hydrophobicity this implies that dda increased the adsorption of bacterial cells to go sheets due to its hydrophobicity along with the amine functionality and hence increased the contact and interactions between them resulting in more physical damage to the microorganisms therefore rgo dda based membranes showed as well as or better antibacterial activity than other go based membranes reported in literature it is worth mentioning that uf membranes are resistant to chlorine that is widely used as disinfectant 2 however other membrane technologies relying on polyamide materials like ro and nf are not chlorine tolerant and chlorine must be removed from water before reaching the polyamide membranes with increasing concerns about chlorine usage in environment and especially the potential formation trihalomethanes which are considered as carcinogenic products a need to look for alternatives is a vital issue developing new membranes with antibacterial properties offers a good alternative to eliminate or reduce using the disinfectants go membranes and functionalized go membranes are offering such an advantage over using the disinfectants especially when used as a pre treatment process for nf and ro processes table 4 compares the performance of go 0 1 go 0 15 rgo dda 0 1 and rgo dda 0 15 with other go based uf mmms in literature in terms of pwp rejection frr and bacteriostasis rate most of these membranes were prepared using polyethersulfone pes as the main polymeric material while psf pvdf pvc and pei were used in some studies obviously go 0 1 and go 0 15 lies in the range of other go based membranes in literature with respect to frr and rejection rgo dda 0 1 and rgo dda 0 15 showed higher frr against both foulants with pure water flux in the range of other recently reported go based membranes some literature reported high flux go based membranes 300 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 47 70 73 82 91 but these membranes have either low frr or low rejection 4 conclusion in this work the potential use of rgo dda as membrane nanofiller was investigated go nanoparticles were successfully synthesized and functionalized with dda as revealed by the characterization results and formed rgo dda rgo dda was found to have better dispersion properties in several organic solvent however it showed poor dispersion in water caused by its hydrophobic nature the effect of rgo dda on the flux rejection antifouling and antibacterial properties of psf mmms was also investigated the incorporation of go and rgo dda was performed via sonication and direct mixing followed by casting using the nips technique results obtained from membrane characterizations confirmed the successful incorporation of nanoparticles into the polymeric matrix of psf the synthesized membranes exhibited different characteristics with respect to morphology hydrophilicity porosity and mean pore size surface roughness increased with go addition while membrane surface became smoother with rgo dda addition hydrophilicity was also found to increase with go addition due to its hydrophilic nature in contrast due to the hydrophobic characteristics of rgo dda no obvious change on hydrophilicity of psf was recorded with the addition of rgo dda flux and rejection experiments performed in a cross flow membrane setup revealed that the increase in concentration of both go and rgo dda in the polymeric matrix lead to reduction of the pure water flux this can be related to the smaller pore size of these membranes as depicted in the mean pore size measurements all membranes including the bare psf showed complete rejection of ha and bsa antifouling and antibacterial properties of the go based mmms were in the range of other go based membranes reported in literature however rgo dda based membranes exhibited superior antifouling and antibacterial properties compared to pristine psf and go based membranes in summary the functionalization of go with dda enhanced go characteristics and therefore resulted in high antifouling and antibacterial uf membranes the utilization of rgo dda is not limited to the incorporation with psf it has the potential to be used as nanofiller with several polymers due to its ability to be well dispersed in various organic solvents additionally it can be incorporated as nanofiller in tfn layers to form nf or ro membranes for example in interfacial polymerization technique that is commonly used for nf and ro membranes 94 rgo dda can be easily incorporated in the organic layer by the dispersion in hexane or dodecane declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

13425,the potential use of dodecylamine functionalized graphene oxide rgo dda nanoparticles as an antifoulant and antibacterial nanofiller was investigated go and rgo dda were analyzed using raman spectroscopy ftir sem tem and tga that all confirmed the successful functionalization of go structure polysulfone psf ultrafiltration membranes incorporating varied loadings of go and rgo dda were then fabricated via phase inversion approach all membranes were characterized in terms of chemical structure morphology hydrophilicity porosity and mean pore size cross section sem images showed the distribution of go and rgo dda between the pores and on the polymer walls afm results demonstrated that go addition increased the roughness of membrane while with rgo dda addition the surface became smoother pristine psf and rgo dda based membranes exhibited similar hydrophilicity while go based membranes exhibited higher hydrophilicity as revealed by contact angle measurements permeability separation and antifouling experiments were performed in a cross flow membrane setup and showed that flux decreases with the increase in go and rgo dda concentration rgo dda membranes showed higher antifouling and antibacterial performance compared to the pristine psf and go membranes neat psf exhibited 65 4 flux recovery ratio frr against bsa that was increased to 86 9 and 89 1 with go 0 1 and rgo dda 0 1 respectively against ha frr was improved from 87 8 for neat psf to 95 6 and 99 3 with go 0 1 and rgo dda 0 1 respectively additionally rgo dda membrane exhibited higher bacteriostatis rate 83 6 against h aquamarina than go membrane 62 9 moreover rgo dda nanoparticles exhibited excellent dispersibility in several solvents making them promising nanofillers for various membranes with high antifouling and antibacterial performance keywords dodecylamine graphene oxide ultrafiltration antifouling antibacterial effect 1 introduction amongst the several technologies evolved in water treatment and purification sector membrane based processes are considered promising solution to afford clean water 1 it is considered efficient and economical due to the low energy consumption small footprint and the relatively low cost compared to other technologies 2 several membrane based processes have been arisen to meet the various needs in water treatment sector including microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis ro and forward osmosis fo among them uf is a fast growing technology that has demonstrated a remarkable contribution to water treatment sector because of its capability to separate a wide range of impurities from water at low cost it is considered an efficient and economical pre treatment process for nf and ro 3 uf can separate proteins turbidity viruses bacteria and various organic matters from wastewater in a safe clean and efficient way the utilization of uf membranes is not only limited to water treatment but also it showed an increasing interest in chemical recovery dairy production food industry pharmaceutical applications and textile industry and paint treatment 4 5 despite of the several advantages of membranes their susceptibility to fouling is still a bottleneck issue in many applications fouling is a phenomenon where pollutants in the wastewater accumulate onto the membrane surface and block the pores resulting in a decline in the membrane performance and shortage in its service life 6 hence investigating new methods materials and fillers became the focus of most studies aiming to produce high efficient membranes with high fouling resistance the use of nanomaterials as membrane fillers is one of the well established methods being developed in membrane sector 7 the addition of nanofillers can improve membrane performance and properties like antifouling antibacterial activity flux and rejection 8 various nanomaterials have been investigated as membrane nanofillers and exhibited high performance such as carbon nanotubes cnts 9 zeolites 10 metal organic frame works mofs 11 graphene based materials 12 13 sio2 14 mxene 15 tio2 16 etc among them graphene oxide go and go based materials attracted remarkable research interest in the past few years due to their stability tuneability mechanical strength and easy accessibility 17 furthermore go based materials exhibit high fouling resistance and bactericidal effects against various foulants and bacteria making them promising nanofillers to produce high antifouling membranes 18 19 additionally the oxygen content in the functional groups e g hydroxyls carboxyls ketones and epoxides existing on the go sheets edges enriches go hydrophilicity and make it a versatile platform for further functionalization to derive other graphene based materials to meet different purposes 20 21 furthermore go can be easily exfoliated in various polymer matrices and polar aprotic solvents 22 which makes it a good candidate to be utilized as nanofiller in membranes fabrication sector the efficient utilization of nanofillers in membranes fabrication depends on the better interfacial interaction between polymeric matrix and the nanofiller as well as the uniform and stable dispersion in the matrix 23 however pristine nanoparticles e g cnts go etc cannot achieve stable and uniform dispersion which limits the efficiency of using them as fillers in some polymer matrices 24 therefore several studies investigated the effect of functionalization on the properties of nanoparticles as well as on the overall membrane performance studies reported that a successful functionalization could significantly enhance go properties to fit different purposes and applications for example go functionalization with hydrophobic materials like octadecylamine oda 25 and n butylamine nba 26 enhances the performance in membrane distillation md processes where the membrane hydrophobicity is preferable in contrast go functionalization with hydrophilic materials like polydopamine pda 27 polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp 28 and starch 29 enhances the performance in membrane processes where the hydrophilicity is desirable e g uf nf ro etc several studies have been conducted in literature on the functionalization of go for different membrane based water treatment processes including fo ro nf and uf safarpour et al 30 31 studied the effect of go functionalization with tio2 on ro and nf membranes and reported a clear improvement of fouling resistance rajakumaran et al 32 prepared ro membranes by incorporating amino functionalized zinc oxide zno and go composites go zno into the thin film nanocomposite layer tfn and reported better antifouling performance compared to pristine membrane zhang et al 33 have recently reported that modifying go with p aminophenol enhanced the antibacterial of ro membranes significantly when compared to goro and pristine ro membranes similar studies investigated the effect of go functionalization with various functional groups on the fouling resistance of uf membranes and showed clear improvement against various foulants functional materials used to functionalize go include isocyanate 34 hyperbranched polyethyleneimine hpei 35 cysteine 36 guanidyl 37 polydopamine pda 27 among the various functional groups investigated in the functionalization of go nanosheets amines are considered promising agents that can enhance go properties as well as the overall membrane performance the amination of go nanosheets is not novel and was investigated in different studies using various amines for example the amination of go with hpei could improve the interactions between the nanofiller e g go hpei and the polymer matrix which enhanced the mechanical properties of polyethersulfone pes membrane 35 in a previous work we demonstrated that the go amination with pda could enhance the flux and the fouling resistance without compromising the rejection performance 27 similar observation has been also reported with 3 aminopropyl triethoxysilane apts aminated go that showed significant enhancement of the sulfonated pes performance in terms of flux and organic fouling resistance 38 moreover amine functionalization of go nanosheets was found to enhance the membrane s antibacterial activity 35 39 in this context dodecylamine dda a cationic surfactant can be a promising functionalizing agent that enhances go properties in terms of fouling resistance and antibacterial activity dda was previously used to functionalize multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts and exhibited 46 antifouling enhancement against proteins 40 additionally studies reported that dda has strong bactericidal effects against several bacteria 41 dda can also promote the formation of alkyl group on the edges of go nanosheets providing better dispersibility of go in non polar solvents and a better distribution within the polymer matrix 42 the higher dispersibility of go nanosheets in the solvent leads to a better distribution and interactions of go with the polymer matrix in this work amine functionalized go nanoparticles were prepared and used as nanofiller in uf polysulfone psf composite membranes the amination of go was carried out using the direct functionalization of go nanosheets with dda via a simple temperature assisted reflux method we aim through this study to investigate the synergetic effects of go and dda on the antifouling properties and the bactericidal activity of psf composite membranes pristine go and rgo dda nanosheets were incorporated into psf via the non solvent induced phase separation technique nips at low concentrations 0 0 15 wt the dynamic fouling resistance of the fabricated membranes was investigated against organic and protein fouling represented by humic acid ha and bovine serum albumin bsa respectively the antibacterial activity of the prepared membranes against halomonas aquamarina h aquamarina as the model bacterium was studied using bacteriostasis rate determination approach the effect of go and rgo dda incorporation on the psf morphology hydrophilicity permeability and separation efficiency was investigated too moreover the structural and spectral properties of go and rgo dda were studied 2 experimental details 2 1 materials graphite gr flakes 99 9 10 mesh were supplied by alfa aesar potassium permanganate kmno4 99

30 min followed by the addition of 50 ml deionized water di and stirring for another 30 min at the same conditions the reaction was then terminated by adding di 150 ml and h2o2 20 ml the mixture was then diluted with hcl 20 and centrifuged followed by several washing centrifugation cycles with di until obtaining a neutral ph go nanoparticles were then obtained by drying the samples overnight at 80 c the dried go nanoparticles were then aminated with dda using the temperature assisted solution interaction technique 23 in brief 100 mg of go were dispersed in di 50 ml and 300 mg of dda were dispersed in ethanol 50 ml and both solutions were then ultrasonicated for 1 h both go and dda suspensions were mixed in a round bottom flask and stirred in an oil bath 60 c 48 h under the reflux conditions the aminated go rgo dda nanoparticles were then obtained by the solvent evaporation technique followed by several washings with ethanol followed by vacuum drying at 85 c overnight a schematic representation of the go synthesis the amination reaction with dda and the anticipated structure of rgo dda is presented in fig 1 2 3 membranes preparation bare psf psf go and psf rgo dda mixed matrix membranes mmms were prepared using the well known non solvent induced phase separation method 44 in brief psf 17 wt in nmp was used as the main casting solution with 3 wt pvp as the pore former for the preparation of psf go and psf rgo dda casting solutions two stock dispersions 0 5 mg ml of the pristine go and rgo dda in nmp were prepared and sonicated for 2 h different loadings of go and rgo dda were then added to nmp according to table 1 psf and pvp were then slowly added to the dispersions and stirred vigorously for 2 h followed by slow stirring overnight until homogenous solutions were obtained figure s1 in the supplementary information the obtained solutions were then casted on a clean glass plate at a uniform speed using an automated casting machine equipped with a film applicator elcometer uk the casted solutions were then soaked into a coagulant bath di where the phase inversion took place and the membrane detached freely from the glass plate the obtained membranes were then washed and kept in di for until testing fig 2 illustrates the phase inversion technique for the fabrication of membranes studied in this work the compositions and codes of the prepared membranes are presented in table 1 2 4 nanoparticles characterization the properties of the synthesized go and rgo dda nanoparticles were analyzed using different characterization techniques

analyzer flash 2000 thermo scientific ftir spectra were recorded using perkin elmer 2000 ftir uatr spectrometer in the range of 400 4000 cm 1 dxr raman spectrometer with a 532 nm laser and a 10 objective thermo scientific was used to obtain raman spectra at room temperature the morphological structures of go and rgo dda were evaluated using the transmission electron microscopy tem with fei tecnai f20 200 kv and scanning electron microscopy sem using jeol model jsm 6390lv moreover the thermal stability of both nanoparticles was analyzed using the thermogravimetric analysis tga with a perkinelmer thermogravimetric analyzer pyris 6 tga at a heating rate of 10 c min temperature range of 30 800 c and under nitrogen 2 5 dispersion studies of go and rgo dda the dispersibility of go and rgo dda nanoparticles was investigated in di and various organic solvents including dodecane hexane toluene nmp dmf and dmac the dispersibility measurements were conducted with a concentration of 0 5 mg ml in an ultrasonic bath sonicator at room temperature for 2 h 2 6 membranes characterization to investigate the effect of go incorporation into the psf matrix the prepared membranes were characterized using ftir uatr perkin elmer 2000 surface and cross section sem images at different magnifications were obtained using jeol model jsm 6390lv the preparation of cross section samples was done by freezing the membrane samples in liquid nitrogen and then fracturing them to prevent the deformation of the membranes structure 45 46 the surface roughness of the prepared membranes in terms of the root mean square roughness rms and average roughness ra were evaluated using the atomic force microscopy afm mfp 3d from asylum research us afm images were obtained over a scan area of 5 5 μm with 1 hz scan rate membranes hydrophilicity in terms of water contact angle ca was measured with a dataphysics contact angle analyzer oca15 pro germany the ca measurements were conducted using di droplets of 2 μm at minimum of 15 points of each membrane membranes porosity measurements were carried out using the gravimetric method two circular samples of the prepared membranes were obtained using a circular cutter with a fixed cutting area of 12 6 cm2 the samples were then kept in di overnight at room temperature excess water was then carefully mopped with a tissue paper and weighted immediately ww the samples were dried overnight and the dry membrane weight wd was then recorded the membrane porosity was then estimated using eq 1 27 47 1 ε w w w d a l ρ w where a cm2 is the effective membrane area l cm is the membrane thickness determined from the cross section sem images and ρw is the density of water at 23 c 0 998 g cm3 guerout elford ferry equation eq 2 was used to estimate the mean pore size rm of the prepared membranes 48 2 r m 2 9 1 75 ε 8 η l q ε a δ p where δp pa is the operational pressure q m3 s is the volumetric flow rate of the permeate and ƞ is the viscosity of water at 23 c 9 3 10 4 pa s 2 7 permeability rejection and antifouling measurements pure water flux rejection and dynamic fouling measurements were performed using a cross flow membrane unit obtained from sterlitech corp us the feed tank is equipped with a cooling heating water circulator to control the feed temperature fig 3 illustrates the process flow diagram of the membrane unit used in this work all filtration experiments were performed at 1 bar 46 1 0 3 cm s 1 cross flow velocity and a temperature of 23 0 5 c briefly the membrane was firstly compacted with di for 30 min at 4 bar the pressure was then reduced to 1 bar and kept for additional 30 min to ensure a stable flux the pure water flux jw0 lmh and permeability pwp lmh bar of membranes were then calculated using eqs 3 and 4 respectively 49 3 j v a t 4 p w p q δ p a where v l is the volume of permeate t h is the sampling time a m2 is the effective filtration area q l h is the volumetric flow rate of permeate and δp bar is the trans membrane pressure difference the rejection and antifouling experiments were then conducted by shifting the feed to freshly prepared solutions of ha 25 mg l and bsa 500 mg l as model organic and protein foulants respectively after 1 h filtration time the foulant flux jwf and rejection r were then calculated according to eqs 3 and 5 respectively 5 r 1 c p c f 100 where cf and cp are the foulant concentrations in the feed and permeate respectively ha and bsa concentrations were measured at 254 nm 47 50 and 278 nm 51 52 respectively with a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2700 shimadzu japan after foulants filtration the feed was shifted back to di for membrane washing three washing cycles 10 min each were performed without an applied pressure at 46 1 0 3 cm s 1 cross flow

measurements the antibacterial properties of the pristine psf and composite membranes were evaluated by the bacteriostasis rate determination method 35 55 h aquamarina were used as the model bacterium 16 mg of the psf psf go and psf rgo dda were cut and washed with ethanol then with di to remove ethanol residuals membrane samples were then added to 10 ml of luria bertani lb solution incubated with appropriate volume of halomonas to obtain initial optical density of 0 1 at 600 nm od600 samples were then incubated at 30 c for 18 h after which they were removed from cultures and rinsed with saline the serial dilution technique was employed to get the actual number of cells at the beginning and the end of experiment t 0 and t 18 h the number of colonies on each plate was determined using the counting method bacteristasis rate br was then calculated using eq 10 10 b r n 0 n 1 n 0 100 where n0 and n1 represent the number of colonies on the plates treated with the control membrane e g pristine psf and plates treated with the hybrid membranes e g psf go and psf rgo dda respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 nanoparticles characterization the ftir uatr spectra of dda pristine go and rgo dda are presented in fig 4 a the graphite oxidation can be confirmed by the presence of different bands related to the oxygenated functional groups in the spectra of pristine go these bands were previously reported with go nanoparticles 43 56 fig 4a confirms also the successful functionalization of go with dda by the emergence of different bands the two bands around 2917 and 2849 cm 1 correspond to c h stretching vibration 57 moreover the formation of amide carbonyl bonds between dda and go sheets is confirmed by the presence of nh amide bending and cn amide stretching at 1546 and 1464 cm 1 respectively 58 the spectra also show that the co band at 1707 cm 1 was reduced with the rgo dda due to the reduction of the oxygen along with the alkyl chain addition to the go structure 22 fig 4b shows the raman spectra of the pristine go and rgo dda and confirms the go formation through the presence of d and g bands that are characteristic for go based materials 43 it has been reported in various studies that the intensities ratio of d and g bands id ig is related to the crystallite properties of go 59 60 the id ig ratio for the pristine go and rgo dda were estimated from the spectra deconvolution and fitting and were found to be 1 8 and 2 1 respectively indicating an obvious change in the crystallite structure caused by the functionalization reaction with dda the increase in the id ig ratio can be attributed to the formation of sp3 carbon within the sp2 carbon network of graphene 57 the deconvolution and fitting of raman spectra as well as the bands parameters are presented in figure s2 and table s1 in the supplementary information respectively the elemental analysis results table 2 shows good degree of graphite oxidation represented by the high oxygen content and o c ratio 50 and 1 1 respectively however the functionalization with dda reduced the go oxygen content to 12 3 wt and increased c n and h compositions to 77 4 3 8 and 6 5 wt respectively due to the addition of the alkyl chain which agrees with the findings of the ftir analysis the sem images shown in fig 5 a show clear difference in the morphology of go and rgo dda nanoparticles the pristine go nanoparticles exhibit clear sharp and smooth surface while rgo dda showed irregular structure and high roughness this observation has been reported with different amine functionalized go nanoparticles 23 25 61 and can be explained by the intercalation and attachment of dda molecules between go sheets the different morphological structure can be also confirmed by the tem images shown in fig 5b the pristine go sheets exhibit wrinkled surface with high transparency indicating a low stacking level and high oxidation degree of go nanoparticles 43 56 on the other hand rgo dda exhibits opaque and dense surfaces caused by the go reduction which cause an increase in the staking level of go sheets similar observations were reported with the functionalization of go with different amines such as pda 61 oda 62 p phenylenediamine ppd and hexamethylene diamine hmd 63 the thermal stability of go and rgo dda nanoparticles was investigated using the tga analysis the tga curves shown in figure s3 in the supplementary information suggest different thermal stabilities of go and rgo dda nanoparticles which is mainly attributed to the difference of their elemental compositions 43 the tga curve of pristine go shows a slight weight reduction around 100 c attributed to the evaporation of water molecules between the go nanosheets however no weight loss was observed before 100 c with rgo dda which indicates a hydrophobic nature of rgo dda that resists water to be attached to its surface during functionalization both go and rgo dda exhibited a major weight loss around 243 c and 307 c the major loss in this temperature range is usually attributed to the thermal degradation of oxygenated functional groups of go 64 the oxygenated groups of go sheets were reduced when functionalized with dda as revealed by the ftir and the elemental analysis therefore the major weight loss with rgo dda nanoparticles occurred at higher temperature compared to the pristine go in summary all characterization techniques confirm the successful functionalization and incorporation of dda molecules on the surface and between go sheets 3 2 dispersion studies of go and rgo dda photographs of go and rgo dda dispersions just after sonication are shown in fig 6 go showed good degree of dispersion in di dmf dma and nmp however in dodecane toluene and hexane the dispersion was very poor which agrees with other studies in the literature 23 61 in comparison rgo dda exhibited higher dispersibility in all solvents except in di the poor dispersion of rgo dda in di can be related to the reduction of the oxygen along with the alkyl chain addition to the go structure 22 which reduces the hydrophilicity of go sheets the good dispersion of rgo dda in other solvents allows it utilization as membrane filler with various types of polymers psf pvdf pes pan etc and for different applications uf nf fo and ro however the limited dispersion properties of the raw go restrict its usage for such applications 24 3 3 membranes characterization 3 3 1 ftir uatr spectra ftir uatr spectra of the control psf psf go and psf rgo dda composite membranes are presented in fig 7 the psf characteristic bands are presented in all spectra around 1664 1320 1291 1241 1150 1108 cm 1 corresponding to aromatic ring breathing oso asymmetric stretching so stretching coc stretching oso symmetric stretching and so stretching the two bands around 1586 and 1487 cm 1 correspond to the aromatic ring stretching these bands have been previously reported with psf membranes 65 66 the spectra of the composite membranes are almost identical to this of the pristine psf and depict no difference which can be related to the dominance of psf and the low concentrations of nanofillers in the polymer matrix 67 3 3 2 morphology sem afm surface and cross section sem were studied at various magnifications to investigate the influence of go and rgo dda incorporation on psf morphological structure figs 8 and 9 show the obtained sem images with different concentrations of go and rgo dda respectively in the surface sem images no clear difference between the bare psf psf go and psf rgo dda can be observed on the other hand clear influence of go and rgo dda addition on psf structure can be observed from the cross section sem images all membranes showed two distinct layers a top layer with a semi dense structure and a sublayer with a sponge structure the sub layer is characterized by the presence of several macro voids with finger like structure that have been enlarged and became wider with the go embedding fig 8 similar findings have been reported in the literature and can be attributed to the go hydrophilicity that accelerates the mass transfer between water and solvent during the nips process 54 68 69 in contrast no significant enlargement can be observed in the pore structure with the addition of rgo dda fig 9 which can be related to its hydrophobic nature as discussed earlier high magnification sem images presented in fig 10 show that both nanofillers aggregate in some areas of the sublayer and partially clog the membrane pores this is considered one of the drawbacks of go embedding in mmms as this blockage decreases the water permeance across the membrane as elaborated in the following sections the membrane separation and antifouling properties are also affected by the surface roughness 70 therefore afm analysis was employed to investigate the effects of go and rgo dda embedding on the surface roughness the 3d afm images over 5 5 μm scan area and roughness parameters of the tested membranes are shown in fig 11 and table 3 respectively the results show a clear increase in the surface roughness with the high concentrations of pristine go while it remains the same with low concentrations of go e g 0 02 the roughness parameters of the neat psf were 7 1 and 5 7 nm for rms and ra respectively that increased up to 16 and 11 5 nm with 0 15 wt go when comparing psf and go based membranes with rgo dda based membranes rms and ra were found to decrease with rgo dda addition indicating that rgo dda based membrane were apparently smoother than the neat psf and go based mmms it well known that membranes with rough surfaces have higher fouling propensity because of the accumulation of foulants in the surface valleys 67 71 while membranes with smoother surface have higher fouling resistance capability 72 3 3 3 hydrophilicity porosity and mean pore size water contact angle ca of the prepared membranes was measured to investigate the effect of go and rgo dda embedding on psf hydrophilicity and is presented in fig 12 the results show a slight enhancement in the hydrophilicity with the embedding of pristine go as the ca decreased from 83 5 with psf to 75 5 with go 0 15 the hydrophilicity enhancement with go addition is attributed to the go hydrophilicity which was observed and reported in several studies 67 73 in contrast rgo dda based mmms exhibited less hydrophilicity than go based mmms the average ca of rgo dda based membranes were close to this of the pristine psf and were in the range of 81 9 83 1 this agrees with the characterization results of rgo dda that showed a hydrophobic nature of rgo dda compared to unfunctionalized go the effect of go rgo dda incorporation on the membrane porosity ɛ and mean pore size rm was investigated by the gravimetric method and the measured values of ɛ and rm are listed in table 3 low dosage of both go and rgo dda e g 0 02 wt increased the porosity of psf from 81 2 to about 86 6 and 86 5 respectively this increase can be attributed to the acceleration of mass transfer rate between the solvent and the coagulant during the nips process as discussed earlier however when increasing the concentration to 0 15 the porosity decreased to 79 9 and 78 7 for go and rgo dda respectively excessive compositions of nanofiller increase the dope solution viscosity which slows the mass transfer rate during the nips process lowers the membrane porosity and forms smaller pores 27 the mean pore size rm of the bare psf membrane was estimated to be 37 5 nm and was decreased with the addition of both nanofillers the estimated rm values were ranging between 33 36 9 nm and 27 5 36 6 nm with go and rgo dda membranes respectively similar findings were reported in the literature 68 73 74 and can be attributed to the increase in dope solution viscosity accompanied with the accumulation of nanofillers in the pores as revealed by the sem analysis fig 10 3 4 permeability and rejection properties the performance of the prepared membranes in terms of the pure water permeability pwp and rejection is illustrated in fig 13 the measured pwp of the neat psf was 181 7 4 6 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 with low concentration of nanomaterial no significant change was observed and the measured pwp was 181 1 9 4 and 180 4 4 5 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 for go 0 02 and rgo dda 0 02 respectively however with excessive concentrations of the go and rgo dda membranes exhibited higher decreases in pwp with 0 15 wt go pwp decreased by approximately 26 while the decrease was much higher with 0 15 wt rgo dda 51 the flux decline at high go concentrations was reported in many studies 35 67 73 and is mainly attributed to the increase in dope solution viscosity 75 77 as discussed earlier the increase in viscosity decreases the porosity and the mean pore size and hence decreases the water flux the filler concentration after which the permeability decreases is generally referred to as the tipping mass percentage that differs depending on the type of polymer and filler 67 hence the findings in this work indicate that the tipping mass percentage of both go and rgo dda is lower than 0 02 wt further analysis of the pwp results obtained taking into consideration porosity mean pore size and contact angle measurements shows that pwp decreases as the porosity and pore size decrease regardless the increases in surface hydrophilicity this observation suggests that porosity and pore size have more impact on permeability compared to surface hydrophilicity which agrees with findings by several studies 67 78 79 as depicted in fig 13 a complete rejection of both ha and bsa was observed with the pristine psf and all the go and rgo dda composite membranes figure s4 in the supplementary information presents photographs of feed and permeate samples taken during ha separation experiments the high rejection can be mainly linked to main mechanisms the molecular size exclusion mechanism that retain large molecules like ha and bsa accompanied with the charge based mechanisms that enhances the electrostatic repulsion of foulant molecules with the negatively charged membranes 38 80 similar results were obtained with other go based mmms investigated in the literature like pes spsf go 80 psf go 67 psf go pda 27 pes csgo 36 psf goqd 81 and spes go sio2 nh2 38 3 5 antifouling measurements the high fouling resistance against various foulants is an essential characteristic of a high efficient membrane fouling is a typical phenomenon associated with the membrane filtration process caused by the concentration polymerization and formation of cake layers that block the membrane pores and reduces the flux and permeate quality 2 a flux reduction was observed with all the tested membranes when shifting the feed solution from di to ha or bsa due to the accumulation of foulant molecules on the surface and the formation of cake layers after 1 h of foulant filtration the membranes were washed with di three times 10 min each and exhibited a partial flux recovery that was accordingly calculated frr the antifouling performance against both foulants bsa and ha of the prepared membranes represented by frr values is depicted in fig 14 a obviously all go and rgo dda based membranes showed higher frr compared to this of the neat psf that exhibited 65 4 and 87 8 with bsa and ha respectively with bsa as foulant the frr was significantly improved to 81 3 84 6 89 1 and 93 7 with the embedding of 0 02 0 05 0 1 and 0 15 wt rgo dda respectively in contrast the frr enhancement with the pristine go addition was lower and the maximum frr was 86 9 with go 0 1 when using ha as foulant the frr increased up to 97 0 and 99 3 with go 0 15 and rgo dda 0 1 respectively the antifouling properties of the tested membrane were further analyzed by estimating the fouling resistance parameters that are presented in fig 14b and c for ha and bsa respectively obviously the total fouling ratio rt and the irreversible fouling ratio rir of the pristine psf were higher than these of all modified membranes and vice versa for the reversible fouling ratio rr these results lead to the same conclusion that the modified membranes have higher fouling resistance compared to the neat psf it is well known that the reversible fouling ratio rr of a membrane is highly affected by its surface hydrophilicity and roughness 82 as confirmed by the afm analysis rgo dda based membranes have relatively smoother surfaces than psf and go based membranes therefore the accumulation of foulants is restricted and can be washed easily from the surface during the washing cycles in contrast go based membranes showed higher surface roughness than this of the pristine psf and rgo dda based membranes hence surface roughness enhances the accumulation of foulant molecules in the valleys which cause a significant reduction in the flux during the foulant filtration stage in the next stage washing with di the hydrophilic nature of go nanoparticles distributed on the membrane surface and within the membrane pores induces the removal and washing of foulants with water 82 83 therefore the fouling resistance was enhanced with go embedding regardless the high surface roughness which agrees with some studies in the literature 38 70 84 taken together the findings herein suggest that the fouling resistance of the composite membranes were enhanced by the hydrophilicity in case of the pristine go addition and by the lower surface roughness in case of rgo dda addition figures s5 and s6 in the supplementary information present sem images for some fouled membranes at magnification of 10 000 x at two different locations on the surface with bsa and ha respectively figure s7 in the supplementary information shows microphotographs of ha fouled membranes at two different locations on the surface both sem images and microphotographs confirm the higher fouling resistance of go and rgo dda based mmms compared to the bare psf 3 6 antibacterial activity measurements bacteriostasis rate br determination is commonly performed to quantitatively evaluate the membranes antibacterial activity 35 55 73 as depicted in fig 15 the number of colonies on the pristine psf plate indicates no bactericidal effect against h aquamarina in contrast the number of colonies was much lower with go 0 15 and rgo dda 0 15 composite membranes suggesting a clear antibacterial activity of both nanoparticles the lowest number of bacterial colonies was observed with rgo dda 0 15 that exhibited an antibacterial rate of 83 6 while the antibacterial rate of go 0 15 was only 62 9 both go and dda have bactericidal activity against various bacteria the bactericidal activity of go nanosheets is mainly attributed to two mechanisms the sharp edges of go sheets cause a physical disruption and damage of the bacterial cells when contacting go nanoparticles additionally go induces the oxidative stress on the bacterial cells due to the formation of reactive oxygen species ros 55 85 some studies have reported that the oxidative stress is the major antibacterial mechanism of go based materials and hence go possesses an antibacterial effect even if there is no direct contact between the bacterial cells and go edges 86 87 the go bactericidal activity is further enhanced when functionalized with dda due to the amine functionality that assists the electrostatic interactions between the bacteria and go nanosheets 39 therefore rgo dda exhibited a synergetic antibacterial effect against h aquamarina resulting in a higher bacteriostasis rate duan et al 55 prepared pes uf membranes incorporating graphene oxide immobilized lysozyme go ly and reduced graphene oxide crgo and reported antibacterial rate of 68 and 71 respectively similar work was conducted by yu et al 35 by embedding go modified by hyperbranched polyethylenimine hepi go into pes and reported a bacteriostasis rate of 74 88 it is commonly known that the antibacterial activity of a go based material is highly dependent on the topography roughness wettability and hydrophobicity of the surface 88 89 furthermore the bacterial adsorption on surfaces with moderate hydrophobicity contact angle of 45 130 is stronger than this on hydrophilic surfaces 88 90 therefore the bacterial adsorption on rgo dda membranes might be higher than this on go based membranes as they have slightly higher hydrophobicity this implies that dda increased the adsorption of bacterial cells to go sheets due to its hydrophobicity along with the amine functionality and hence increased the contact and interactions between them resulting in more physical damage to the microorganisms therefore rgo dda based membranes showed as well as or better antibacterial activity than other go based membranes reported in literature it is worth mentioning that uf membranes are resistant to chlorine that is widely used as disinfectant 2 however other membrane technologies relying on polyamide materials like ro and nf are not chlorine tolerant and chlorine must be removed from water before reaching the polyamide membranes with increasing concerns about chlorine usage in environment and especially the potential formation trihalomethanes which are considered as carcinogenic products a need to look for alternatives is a vital issue developing new membranes with antibacterial properties offers a good alternative to eliminate or reduce using the disinfectants go membranes and functionalized go membranes are offering such an advantage over using the disinfectants especially when used as a pre treatment process for nf and ro processes table 4 compares the performance of go 0 1 go 0 15 rgo dda 0 1 and rgo dda 0 15 with other go based uf mmms in literature in terms of pwp rejection frr and bacteriostasis rate most of these membranes were prepared using polyethersulfone pes as the main polymeric material while psf pvdf pvc and pei were used in some studies obviously go 0 1 and go 0 15 lies in the range of other go based membranes in literature with respect to frr and rejection rgo dda 0 1 and rgo dda 0 15 showed higher frr against both foulants with pure water flux in the range of other recently reported go based membranes some literature reported high flux go based membranes 300 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 47 70 73 82 91 but these membranes have either low frr or low rejection 4 conclusion in this work the potential use of rgo dda as membrane nanofiller was investigated go nanoparticles were successfully synthesized and functionalized with dda as revealed by the characterization results and formed rgo dda rgo dda was found to have better dispersion properties in several organic solvent however it showed poor dispersion in water caused by its hydrophobic nature the effect of rgo dda on the flux rejection antifouling and antibacterial properties of psf mmms was also investigated the incorporation of go and rgo dda was performed via sonication and direct mixing followed by casting using the nips technique results obtained from membrane characterizations confirmed the successful incorporation of nanoparticles into the polymeric matrix of psf the synthesized membranes exhibited different characteristics with respect to morphology hydrophilicity porosity and mean pore size surface roughness increased with go addition while membrane surface became smoother with rgo dda addition hydrophilicity was also found to increase with go addition due to its hydrophilic nature in contrast due to the hydrophobic characteristics of rgo dda no obvious change on hydrophilicity of psf was recorded with the addition of rgo dda flux and rejection experiments performed in a cross flow membrane setup revealed that the increase in concentration of both go and rgo dda in the polymeric matrix lead to reduction of the pure water flux this can be related to the smaller pore size of these membranes as depicted in the mean pore size measurements all membranes including the bare psf showed complete rejection of ha and bsa antifouling and antibacterial properties of the go based mmms were in the range of other go based membranes reported in literature however rgo dda based membranes exhibited superior antifouling and antibacterial properties compared to pristine psf and go based membranes in summary the functionalization of go with dda enhanced go characteristics and therefore resulted in high antifouling and antibacterial uf membranes the utilization of rgo dda is not limited to the incorporation with psf it has the potential to be used as nanofiller with several polymers due to its ability to be well dispersed in various organic solvents additionally it can be incorporated as nanofiller in tfn layers to form nf or ro membranes for example in interfacial polymerization technique that is commonly used for nf and ro membranes 94 rgo dda can be easily incorporated in the organic layer by the dispersion in hexane or dodecane declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

13426,ozone oxidation was applied to a fraction 30 of the return activated sludge ras of a full scale wastewater treatment plant for reducing the high sludge production 20 t week the amount of sludge sent to final disposal was decreased by 50 and 75 at 0 55 kgo3 h and 0 80 kgo3 h dosage respectively when the same ozonation system was applied to the aerobic digestion 0 06 0 50 0 67 kgo3 h the reduction was 27 77 a thorough economic analysis was carried out considering the overall sludge quantity finally extracted from the plant in the presence and absence of ozonation the corresponding costs of final disposal and the ozone oxidation operation costs the net cost saving for sludge disposal was calculated to be 66 6 d and 109 9 d due to ozone in the return activated sludge at the two dosages respectively when ozonation was applied to the recycled sludge of the digestion unit the net cost saving was in the range 235 655 d depending on the reduction percentage achieved the ozone oxidation showed to become economically convenient for a sludge disposal cost lower than that sustained by the company the results obtained prove feasibility of ozonation for sludge reduction in both locations of the wwtp therefore with respect to other disintegration techniques ozonation possesses a high technical and economic advantage along with a high versatility furthermore it is also shown the feasibility of lowering the applied dosages with respect to the past experiences since effectiveness of the system is still guaranteed keywords cost analysis ozone oxidation return activated sludge sludge digestion sludge reduction 1 introduction treatment and disposal of excess sludge produced in the biological processes represent one of the main concerns in the operation of the wastewater treatment plants wwtps indeed the associated costs may account for up to 60 of the total operating costs of wwtps besides the restricted limits posed by the recent regulations on sludge quality for landfill disposal or agricultural applications increase difficulties in finding ultimate disposal solutions 1 2 it is also worth noting that a significant increase of sludge production is expected to occur in the near future due to the larger diffusion and extension of both wwtps and sewage networks as well as the higher depuration efficiency required to better protect the environment these issues will lead to further rising the costs associated to treatment post processing handling transport and disposal of excess sludge one of the best solutions to reduce these costs is represented by minimization of sludge production 3 the wide number of technologies and processes proposed to this purpose can be grouped into two main classes 1 those acting to induce a net decrease of the bacterial growth yield in the sludge generation process e g by the uncoupling metabolism 2 those promoting lysis of the new bacterial cells by means of disintegration which may involve mechanical chemical thermal or biological forces 2 4 7 most of these technologies introduces additional costs for wwtps operation besides the management complexity is increased and some negative effects on the plant treatment efficiency can occur e g higher turbidity in the final effluent more nitrogen and cod in the bioreactor to be oxidized 3 8 first experiments on ozonation started at the laboratory scale in the past century and soon proved the powerful action of ozone in reducing excess sludge production 9 12 the process was then intensively studied and demonstrated to be often superior to other techniques for its simplified operation high efficiency no secondary pollutants and being readable adaptable to existing wwtps due also to the compactness there are many reports in the scientific literature on the solution of excess sludge by ozonation 3 5 additional benefits include enhanced biodegradation or removal of emerging contaminants and destruction of pathogens 13 however with respect to economic aspects ozonation can require higher investment and operational costs as compared to other techniques for sludge reduction 4 because of the numerous advantages ozonation was also widely applied at the full scale where it was implemented either in the wastewater or sludge treatment line of the plants 4 in the former case o3 has been applied to the activated sludge taken directly from the aeration tank or more commonly to a fraction of the return activated sludge ras flow in both configurations the ozone flux facilitates solubilisation and mineralisation of sludge particles with the release of internal constituents both biodegradable and non biodegradable returning the ozonated sludge to the main bioreactor provides microorganisms with this additional substrate the biomass of the aeration tank accomplishes oxidation of both influent and additional substrate into co2 h2o and ammonia synthesis of new bacterial cells also occurs which is referred to as cryptic growth since contribution of each substrate cannot be distinguished the continuous cycle of sludge solubilisation cryptic growth results in a net reduction of the bacterial growth yield and therefore of the amount of sludge produced 3 4 during ozonation a slight deterioration of the effluent quality can be observed due to an increase of inert soluble and colloidal cod and phosphorous both released in the sludge from the ozonated cells furthermore the nitrification rate can decrease due to the direct influence of ozone on nitrifiers and floc structure although it may also be influenced by the higher soluble cod released 4 several authors reported biomass reduction due to o3 oxidation above 30 along with an improvement of the settling properties of the solids in the mixed liquors 14 ozone in the activated sludge process was referred to be economically viable with doses between 25 and 45 mgo3 gcod approximately 9 however other studies observed the need to use higher o3 quantities from 40 to 300 and rarely up to 1400 mgo3 gcod 15 intermittent oxidation of two thirds of the recycle sludge in a laboratory sequencing batch reactor at an average dose of 0 019 go3 gts allowed to accomplish a decrease of about 50 in sludge growth with respect to the control operated without ozonation as a side effect a slight deterioration of the effluent quality was observed 16 ozone oxidation is implemented in the sludge handling units as a pre treatment to the aerobic or anaerobic digestion tank to enhance sludge biodegradability and consequently stabilization efficiency along with biogas production rate in the latter case 4 17 using 0 1 go3 gts led to a sludge reduction improvement of 20 under the following aerobic or anaerobic conditions in comparison with other disintegration techniques ultrasonic and ozone treatment determined the highest increase of solid removal with the best cost reduction 6 anaerobic digestion pre treatment by ozonation at dosages below 100 mgo3 gts favoured an additional methane production of about 6 and 30 for mixed and waste activated sludge respectively furthermore the maximum ch4 production rate increased of about 21 and 33 for mixed and waste activated sludge respectively 18 during 9 months of operation of a full scale aerobic digestion total suspended solid efficiency increased up to 89 with a specific dose of 9 7 mg o3 gtss compared to the conventional treatment with air only whose efficiency was 30 as average 19 various factors affect ozonation efficiency in the activated sludge systems such as sludge characteristics ozone dose contact time nature and concentration of the different oxidizable organics compounds ph value 20 fall et al 2018 21 observed a wide change of the reactivity and ozone consumption rate of sludge depending on its composition furthermore the biomass inactivation rate and solid reduction for a given sludge were affected by the hindering phenomena e g scavenging reactions radicals generation at high ph and compactness of the flocs therefore it is still difficult to predict the effect of ozone dosing under different conditions based on theoretical considerations or literature data the cost of ozone operation also depends on various factors such as dosage sludge characteristics contact time intermittent or continuous mode of treatment besides there might be an augmentation of the costs due to the energy spent to ensure effluent quality e g additional aeration in the bioreactor to remove surplus cod or to nitrify the released ammonia in the ozonated sludge optimal operating conditions should be implemented in order to achieve minimization of the costs associated with ozonation meanwhile the ozone treatment could be able to decrease the sludge quantity with a consequent savings of the costs associated to treatment and disposal 3 therefore an economic evaluation would allow to determine the most suitable ozonation conditions which determine such savings that compensate the cost for ozonation for instance in 1 it is reported that increasing ozone dosage applied to an aerobic digester from 1 23 to 1 40 g o3 kg tss caused nominal decrease in the amount of sludge disposed but increased the operating costs of the system therefore low ozone dosage was preferentially implemented to compensate the cost of sludge disposal although significant progresses in the knowledge of ozone oxidation have been fulfilled over the years challenges and lacks still persist in the full scale implementation 22 therefore further investigations are strongly boosted to achieve a better understanding of all technical and economic entailments of ozone oxidation process when it is implemented under the more complex real conditions the present study belongs to a wide research activity carried out in collaboration with the management company of the wwtps of the province of latin italy aiming at investigating solutions for reducing sludge handling costs which are considered significantly high among the different alternatives it was decided to investigate the ozone oxidation since more references are available about its application at the full scale furthermore the management company intended to evaluate implementation of ozonation also for disinfecting the final effluent due to the increasing restrictions posed by the recent regulations on the use of chlorination to this purpose two locations of the ozone oxidation systems in a full scale wwtp were proposed by the supplier as the most favorable ones for the specific characteristics of the plant 1 the recirculation line of the sludge aerobic digester and 2 the ras line in location 1 the ozone oxidation was capable of determining a 58 reduction as average of the total amount of sludge finally extracted by the plant after digestion and dewatering this significant decrease determined a net saving in the sludge disposal costs in the range 235 655 d 1 the aim of the present experimental study was to evaluate the effects of the same ozone oxidation system when applied to the return activated sludge flow of the same full scale wwtp a comparison based on technical and economic evaluations was carried out for both locations considering the effects on sludge production plant treatment efficiency and costs the results obtained by the two studies provide key information on the benefits and drawbacks of ozonation when implemented at the full scale and can be used by the decision makers to choose the best location and operating conditions the main novelty of this paper with respect to most of the past investigations consists in the comparison of different locations within a full scale plant and in evaluation of all the technical and economic issues furthermore the ozone doses tested were much lower than those applied by most of the previous studies 5 14 21 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater treatment plant the present study was carried out at the full scale belsito wwtp for domestic sewage located in sabaudia latina italy and managed by acqualatina s p a the plant has a total treatment capacity of 30 000 population equivalent pe and operates through line 1 and line 2 which receive a flow rate corresponding to 10 000 pe and to 20 000 pe respectively due to the touristic nature of the urban area served by the plant the influent flow rate q widely varies throughout the year for instance the average flow rate is 4800 m3 d in the winter period whereas it reaches peaks of about 6000 m3 d during summer season to limit such a variation the influent is firstly treated through an equalization tank prior to be distributed into the two lines of the plant the average influent characteristics measured during the experimental period were 536 mg cod l 55 mg nh4 n l 4 3 mg p l each wastewater treatment line of the plant operates through the same sequence of units as shown in fig 1 1 screening and degritting as pre treatments 2 activated sludge process for denitrification nitrification and carbon oxidation 3 secondary settlement for effluent clarification and 4 disinfection through chlorination the return activated sludge ras flow rate qr is extracted from the bottom of the secondary settlement tank and transferred to the denitrification reactor to provide nitrates and mixed liquor the excess biological sludge handling units consist of aerobic digestion post thickening and dewatering the treated sludge is disposed of in a composting plant outside the wwtp prior to the experimental study the average mass of sludge from both lines sent to final disposal accounted for 20 t week 2 2 ozone oxidation the same ozone oxidation system named lyso and supplied by praxair was used in both experimental activities carried out at the full scale belsito wwtp the system includes the main following items a a wedeco o3 generator for ozone supply b lyso centrifugal pumps for sludge withdrawal and recirculation of the ozonated sludge c a venturi tube for aspiring o3 into the contact reactor d a plug flow reactor for contacting ozone with sludge e a liquid oxygen source provided by rivoira s p a f a residual ozone destructor g pipelines and controls 1 the technical parameters of the ozone oxidation system were set and maintained at the following values 9 10 kw h for 1 kg o3 produced 10 kgo2 h for 1 kgo3 produced 10 kw h and 5 kw h as energy consumption by the centrifugal pumps in the present and past study respectively 1 m3 h of cooling water for 1 kgo3 produced 1 according to the supplier features of the contact chamber optimize sludge mixing with the ozone flux the ozonation system is designed to immediately convert the residual ozone flux into oxygen in the destructor device this configuration makes it impossible to carry out a mass balance on the ozone flux therefore the amount of ozone applied to the sludge was assumed equal to the dosage supplied to the contact reactor 2 3 experimental study the ozone oxidation was always implemented in line 2 of the wwtp in the past experimental activity the treatment was performed by drawing a sludge flow rate of 70 m3 h from the aerobic digester and passing it through the sludge ozonation system the ozonated sludge was then recirculated to the digestion tank this sequential operation of withdrawal ozonation recirculation was applied in a continuous mode for all the duration of the study the ozone flow rate qo3 was varied as follows in order to determine the optimal ozonation conditions 60 500 and 670 go3 h these values were selected based on previous experiences performed by the supplier of the ozonation system the lowest dosage was the minimum one considered potentially capable of producing appreciable effects on sludge stabilization whereas the highest one corresponded to the threshold limit above which the ozonation became economically unsustainable the oxygen consumption would have been too high a third value was also selected being intermediate between the highest and lowest dosage no further values were tested in order not to affect regular operation of the full scale wwtp the corresponding specific dosages were calculated based on eq 1 to be 0 15 1 40 and 1 23 go3 kgtss0 with respect to the solid content in the digester in the present experimental activity a flow rate equal to qsludge 50 m3 h corresponding to 30 of the ras flow rate qr was continuously drawn from the ras line and subjected to ozonation in the contact reactor see fig 1 the ozonated sludge was then recirculated from the outlet of the contact reactor to the biological aerated tank this sequential process of withdrawal ozonation recirculation was applied in a continuous mode throughout the experimental activity two ozone dosages qo3 were applied for a duration of about 20 d each one the values were selected being close to the dosages applied in the first experimentation carried out at the same wwtp and based on other past experiences performed by the supplier of the ozonation system in both studies the dosages were selected below the values referred by most of the past studies 1 5 14 23 and this was considered a novelty table 1 lists the ozone dosages qo3 and the corresponding specific dosages sdo3 expressed in terms of ozone dosed per mlss of ozonated sludge mlss0 of the ras calculated as follows 1 1 sd o 3 q o 3 q sludge mlss 0 the experimental activity was conducted during winter time operation of line 2 was monitored for a long time prior to start ozonation to determine its average characteristics the monitoring activity was also continued during the study in order to highlight if recirculation of the ozonated sludge to the biological aerated reactor could produce any affect on the wwtp treatment performance instantaneous samples of the influent prior to pre treatments and effluent after settlement through automatic devices were collected and analyzed to determine concentrations of the following parameters total cod tcod soluble phosphorous sp ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n total suspended solids tss only in the effluent concentrations of mlss and mlvss in mixed liquor samples from the biological reactor were also measured at the same frequency besides the sludge volume index svi after 30 min settling time was determined on sludge samples collected from the same reactor characteristics of the return sludge in the inlet and outlet of the ozone contact reactor were also monitored by measuring concentration of the following parameters total and soluble cod tcod and scod respectively sp no2 n no3 n mlss mlvss and svi the disintegration degree dd was calculated as the difference between the soluble cod in the outlet scodout and inlet scodin of the ozone contact reactor divided by the particulate cod measured in the inlet t cod in s cod in as shown by eq 2 24 2 dd 100 s cod out s cod in t cod in s cod in fig 1 shows the sampling points referred to as follows 1 influent 2 mixed liquor of the biological reactor 3 effluent from the secondary settlement tank 4 and 5 ras sludge in the inlet and outlet of the ozone contact reactor respectively analytical determinations were carried out in duplicate on each sample and the average calculated through statistical analysis all the parameters were measured accordingly to standard methods 25 the soluble fractions were determined on liquid samples after glass fiber membrane filtration at 0 45 μm observations at the microscope of sludge samples taken from the aeration tank were also performed without and with ozone operation sludge cell disintegration results in an increase of soluble chemical oxygen demand nitrogen and phosphorous loading rates in the reactor producing indirect impacts on microorganisms during ozonation furthermore there might be direct effects of ozonation on microorganism activity and mortality rates which depend on each species and their location in the floc previous researches highlighted the potential of ozonation to transform the microbial composition with a stronger negative effect on the nitrifying bacteria activity thus impacting the overall performance of the wwtp 22 26 27 most of the past studies on the ozone oxidation treatment have focused on the optimization of operational conditions and have been conducted on pilot plants over short experimental periods 23 therefore in the present study the microscopic observations were performed with the aim to highlight any possible effect on the microbial community due to long term ozone application in the full scale plant microscopic observations of the microbial community were also performed in the past study conducted at the same plant 2 4 economic analysis in order to evaluate the real convenience of implementing the ozone oxidation system at the sabaudia wwtp a thorough economic analysis was carried out for both the experimental studies the followings specific costs provided by the ozone oxidation supplier were considered to the purpose 1 average cost for sludge disposal to composting facilities cd 140 ton 2 cost for 1 kg liquid o2 purchase o2 0 18 kgo2 3 cost of energy e 0 15 kwh as sludge disposal cost it was assumed the value paid for by the managing company of the wwtp whereas power and oxygen consumptions data were provided by praxair who supplied the lyso sludge ozonation system the economic evaluation considered only the overall sludge quantity extracted from the plant and sent to final disposal since this parameter represents the main cost item for the managing company furthermore it was taken into account that line 1 was continuously operated without ozonation and therefore the amount of sludge to be disposed of always remained the same differently the sludge produced by line 2 was reduced as a consequence of ozone application therefore the overall cost for ultimate sludge disposal was calculated as cd px1 px2 where px1 and px2 represent the amount of sludge in t week finally extracted from line 1 and line 2 respectively and transferred to composting for line 1 this amount was assumed equal to the average value measured in the absence of ozonation whereas for line 2 it was distinguished between the values measured without and those associated to ozonation based on these data it was then possible to calculate the saving obtained in the overall disposal costs with respect to the plant operation without ozonation costs of ozone operation were computed considering energy kwh and oxygen kg consumed for the o3 production per year based on the values registered during the experimental activity for the different dosages then using the specific values listed above the corresponding energy and oxygen consumption costs were calculated ce and co2 respectively other costs were due to transport service ct tank rent ctr and maintenance cm the overall cost of ozone operation at each dosage was finally obtained as follows ce co2 ct ctr cm then the net cost saving was calculated as the difference between the overall cost for final disposal and the ozone operation cost finally considering a capital cost for purchasing the ozone system equal to 83 950 sum of 74 500 for the ozone production system and 9450 for the storage tank as referred by the supplier it was possible to determine the payback time for the net cost savings associated to ozone application at the investigated dosages 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of ozonation on sludge production ozone oxidation determined a reduction by 50 about 600 ton year using the first dosage and by 75 about 300 ton year at the second dosage with respect to the average sludge production measured prior to the experimental study about 1000 ton year consequently pumps for excess sludge wasting could be operated for a lower time interval i e from 8 h d as without ozonation to 4 h d and 2 h d at the first and second ozone dosage respectively the sludge reduction is ascribed to solid disintegration with bacterial cell break down due to the strong ozone oxidation 3 indeed the solid concentration in the biological reactor decreased as highlighted by table 2 which lists mlss and mlvss concentrations measured before and during the study the mvlss mlss also decreased significantly in the presence of ozonation due to solid mineralization with the aim to exploit at the best the potentialities of the system during the last two weeks of the experimental activity the excess sludge wasting was temporarily stopped as a consequence the mlss concentration in the biological reactor increased although slightly reaching a final value of 5800 mg l therefore the value reported in table 2 for the 2nd o3 dosage can be considered as the net result of the concentration reduction due to ozone oxidation and the increase for sludge wasting suspension the solid concentration would have likely continued to lower if the sludge wasting was still maintained constantly in operation table 2 also shows the average svi values measured on sludge samples collected from the biological reactor it can be noted a reduction from 139 ml gss registered without ozonation to 116 ml gss associated to ozone application beside this decrease a lower percentage of filamentous bacteria was observed at the microscope analyses conducted on activated sludge samples after ozone application indeed it is widely reported that ozone preferably hits the bacteria filaments which extend beyond the sludge flocs as a consequence less water is retained the flocs become more compact and improve their settleability 27 furthermore a release of extracellular polymeric substances eps in the liquid phase can occur which act as bridges between the smaller size particles 28 29 the ozone addition 3 4 8 go3 kgts to the return activated sludge of a full scale plant produced an improvement of settling properties of the sludge by lowering the diluted sludge volume dsvi by 7 35 furthermore filamentous bacteria protruding from flocs showed to be more susceptible to ozone attack than bacteria residing with the flocs 28 the improved sludge settleability after ozone application was responsible of the lower volume occupied by the wasted excess sludge in the thickener of the sludge processing units therefore it was possible to extend the residence time inside this tank prior to sludge transfer to the next treatment unit consequently also the dewatering device could be operated at a less frequency and finally the amount of dried sludge to send to final disposal was reduced with respect to before ozone application solid reduction percentages reported in the literature fall in a wide range of values i e 10 80 depending on ozone dosage 15 60 mg o3 g ts feed type and sludge composition 3 in 14 a similar lay out as that of the present study was investigated although at a smaller scale ozonation was applied in the range 0 207 mgo3 gmlss to certain fractions of the sludge extracted from the settling tank of a pilot scale anaerobic anoxic aerobic treatment system the ozonated sludge was then recycled to the bioreactor the long term operation of this system provided sludge reduction efficiency in the range 48 66 furthermore a notable decrease in svi was observed in each tank indicating an improved sludge settleability in 21 the ozone treatment at dosage of 50 mgo3 gcod was able to reduce the solids quantities by around 17 in model fresh sludge fed with acetate based synthetic wastewater against 26 30 in digested sludge and sludge from the local wwtp 3 5 more was gained when the dose was doubled 100 mgo3 gcod it is noteworthy that sludge reduction percentages reported by many studies as those cited above are very close to those registered in the present study however in most of the past researches much higher dosages were required to achieve such reductions therefore in the real applications it would be useful to investigate the ozone oxidation effects starting from low dosages this also would help to control the costs for its operation 3 2 effects of ozonation on sludge characteristics observations before and after the ozone contact reactor showed an increase of soluble cod concentration scod in the ozonated sludge differently in the ras not subjected to ozonation concentration of dissolved cod remained constant ozonation can rupture the cell membrane causing death and release of intracellular materials such as soluble cod researchers report that 10 60 of cod is solubilized due to ozonation at 10 160 mgo3 gtss 3 the observed increase was significant from 150 mg l to 300 mg l soon after the application of the first dosage a further increment occurred when the dosage was brought to the higher level after about 12 d of application this trend reached a plateau accumulation of radical scavengers such as so4 2 and lactic acid generated as by products of decayed bacteria was likely responsible of this change since they compete with o3 in the oxidation of the organic matter indeed it is reported that at high dosages the oxidant can gradually lose its ability to efficiently attack the solids 15 another explanation can be that the stronger oxidant power of the higher dose might have determined the direct oxidation of the organic matter into co2 i e mineralization 21 30 the effect of soluble cod release due to ozonation is widely reported in 28 the dissolved cod increased from 81 to 288 mg l between the control and the highest ozone dose 4 8 g o3 kg tss applied to the return sludge this may appear as a large increase in soluble cod however relating the soluble cod to the total cod reveals that the soluble part of the cod only increased from 1 7 to 6 7 based on the scod concentrations measured in the sludge upstream and downstream the ozone contact reactor it was possible to calculate the value of the disintegration degree dd at the two dosages it resulted a linear increase of dd from 1 to 10 as the dosage rose from the lowest to the maximum level this finding is reported by other authors for instance a linear relationship existed in general between the dissolution degree dd and the doses in all the types of sludge investigated in the study r2 0 97 21 in 13 with an increase of o3 dose the solubilization ratio increased almost linearly till 182 mg o3 gss but somewhat slowed down thereafter at 242 mg o3 gss the solubilization ratio reached the highest value 66 6 sludge solubilization efficiency increased quickly to 35 5 as the ozone dose increased to 101 mgo3 gmlss afterwards a slow increase was observed as the ozone dose further increased to 207 mgo3 gmlss 14 the specific solubilization rate for each experimental phase was then determined as the ratio between the average released scod and the applied ozone dose this parameter resulted to be equal to 25 74 gscod go3 and 17 58 gscod go3 at the first and second dosage respectively these values demonstrate that ozone oxidation caused a higher solubilization effect when dosed at the minimum level this is in accordance with the plateau observed in the scod release process at the higher dose as reported above the decline in sludge solubilisation efficiency at high ozone dosages might be due to several factors and it has been widely observed 3 for instance fall et al 2018 21 observed dd plateauing at high o3 dose 73 mgo3 gcod regarding the other characteristics of the ozonated ras fraction soluble phosphorous concentration did not show any significant change before and after the contact reactor independently of the dosage 0 31 mg l and 0 33 mg l respectively as average concentrations of no2 n and no3 n were always found slightly higher in the ozonated sludge 0 08 mg l before and 0 27 mg l after and 5 14 mg l before and 67 70 mg l after respectively as average this slight increase was likely due to the oxidation of the ammonia released by the bacterial cell lysis this process might have been also favoured by the oxygen made available by the conversion of the residual ozone the soluble ammonia concentration remained below the detectable limit in the ozonated sludge which agrees with other studies which refer only a slight release of ammonia due to sludge ozonation 31 as an example of these studies dytczak et al 2007 using dosages far above those considered in the present activity i e in the range 0 015 0 080 mg o3 mg of initial tss found ammonia nitrogen concentration in the ozonated excess sludge always below the detection limit of 0 3 mg l 32 measurements of the solid contents in the sludge prior and after the ozone contact reactor did not highlight any significant difference it is noteworthy that the sensitivity of the analytical method used for determining solid concentration 31 is unable to highlight slight variations when the solid concentrations are notably high as in the case of the return sludge flow about 13 000 mg l mlss the behaviour observed in the ozonated ras is in accordance with the findings of other studies on ozone application however the lower dosages applied in the present experimental study limited the extent of the changes produced on the sludge characteristics indeed several papers of the specialized literature report that the oxidation with ozone produces evident effects only when applied at high dosages for instance zhao et al 2007 31 observed a solid decrease only at 40 go3 kgmlss 3 3 effects of ozonation on line 2 treatment efficiency the effect of ozonation on effluent quality is an important consideration when applying this technology in the real wastewater treatment systems several experiences in the literature reported a slight decrease in effluent quality after sludge ozonation and recirculation of ozonated sludge into the activated sludge reactor 4 therefore the efficiency of the water treatment line was continuously monitored during the ozone oxidation application in order to investigate if returning the ozonated sludge to the biological reactor could produce any effect on the treatment process performance as shown by fig 2 at the beginning of the first o3 dosage period the total cod concentration in the effluent of the secondary settlement tank increased from 31 mg l the average value measured before ozone application to 86 mg l as average reaching also a peak of 118 mg l after about 28 d correspondingly the removal efficiency decreased from 94 to 85 despite this increase the limit posed on the effluent by the plant s permit equal to 125 mg l was still always respected at the end of the first dosing phase the cod concentration turned to be close to the average measured in the absence of ozonation i e 38 mg l versus 31 mg l respectively after the application of the second dosage the cod decreased further reaching a final value below 20 mg l these changes observed during ozone application in the effluent cod are well correlated to the scod trend observed in the ras fraction subjected to ozonation see section 3 2 when the ozonation started a sudden increase of the soluble cod concentration in the ozonated sludge occurred recirculation of the ozonated sludge determined an increased cod in the influent to the bioreactor therefore the effluent concentration showed a rapid increase as a consequence of the higher load to be treated later on the removal process progressively adapted until the required level of efficiency to degrade the higher influent load was established as observed in the previous section it is also likely that the higher ozone dosage of the second phase was capable of oxidizing the organic carbon released through the bacterial cell lysis like carbohydrates to co2 thus the organic carbon load recycled with the ozonated sludge to the biological reactor did not increase directly with the ozone dosage the limited effect observed in the present study on the effluent cod is in accordance with many studies it was demonstrated that the overall cod removal efficiency was unaffected or underwent a minor decrease 5 10 this can be a consequence of the biodegradable nature of the majority of the solubilized cod released which is rapidly consumed when ozonated sludge is returned to the aerobic reactor 3 15 sludge solubilisation can also lead to the release of nitrogen species mostly in the form of inorganic nitrogen the recirculation of ozonated ras which may have high nitrogen and oxygen content can decrease nitrogen removal efficiency of the main bioreactor 14 however the fate of nitrogen is dependent on the ozonation conditions for instance increasing the amount of ozonated sludge determined higher organic carbon loading and dissolved oxygen competition between nitrifying and heterotrophic bacteria this phenomenon consequently decreased nitrification efficiency 3 naso et al 2008 26 observed that ozone destabilized nitrifying bacteria and consequently decreased the total nitrogen removal efficiency of a sequencing batch reactor sbr trend of ammonia nitrogen concentration observed in the effluent is depicted in fig 3 it can be noted a slight increase of the effluent concentration from 0 80 mg l in the absence of ozonation to 1 15 and 1 12 mg l at the first and second dosage respectively this trend agrees with the negligible release observed in the ozonated ras fraction the ammonia concentration in the effluent always remained far below the limit of 15 mg l nh4 set by the plant s permit fig 3 shows also nitrite nitrogen concentration measured in the effluent in the absence and presence of ozone oxidation it can be noted that the values always remained below the method detection limit differently ozonation strongly affected the nitrate content in the treated effluent as it is clearly shown in fig 4 no3 n increased progressively from 4 1 mg l in the absence of ozonation to above 15 mg l during the first dosage phase and to about 20 mg l at the end of the second dosage period the reason of this rapid change was found in the adopted ozonation lay out indeed recirculation of oxygen rich ozonated sludge in an anoxic aerobic system prevent facultative denitrifying bacteria from utilizing nitrate as ozone acceptor which results in reduced denitrification efficiency 22 to avoid this problem in the design phase of the ozone system it was decided to recirculate the ozonated ras fraction to the aerobic biological reactor instead of to the denitrifying reactor however this specific lay out entailed a reduction of the nitrates load subjected to denitrification furthermore an additional nitrate production although likely very low was due to the nitrification of the ammonia released in the ozonated sludge by cell lysis these processes were responsible of the progressive increase of no3 n content in the effluent although the high value reached at the end of the second phase the limit set on the effluent to 20 mg l by the plant s permit could be still respected indeed the official fiscal control of the effluent quality of the wwtp has to be carried out on the final discharge after mixing the effluents of both lines 1 and 2 therefore being the nitrate content of line 1 effluent constantly at about 5 mg l combination of the two flow rates determined a final concentration still below the limit of 20 mg l despite the high value measured in the outlet of line 2 in order to reduce the effluent nitrate concentration of line 2 the ras percentage subjected to ozonation was afterwards reduced with the consequent increase of the nitrate load sent to denitrification through the non ozonated ras this modification was capable of reducing the nitrate concentration in the effluent which at the optimal conditions reached a stable value of 8 mg l in the effluent of line 2 this lay out was then maintained permanently in the plant increases of nitrate nitrogen content in the effluent of ozonated biological systems were also reported by other authors although not investigated in details or explained through another phenomenon for instance in an ozonated anaerobic anoxic aerobic reactor it was considered that nitrate accumulation in the aerobic phase could be linked to inhibition of denitrification in the preceding anoxic phase 3 however the present study suggests the need to consider different options such as layout or ozonation conditions fig 5 shows soluble phosphorous measured in the treated effluent of line 2 in the absence and presence of ozone oxidation at the first dosage the value remained close to that measured without ozonation i e 0 68 mg l and 0 72 mg l as average respectively when the dosage was increased to the higher level concentration decreased with an average value of 0 25 mg l the observed profile resembles that above reported for total cod indeed the two components follow a similar fate under ozonation phosphates are released due to solubilization of the cell membrane constituents in this case phospholipids 31 33 released phosphorous is then recirculated with the ozonated sludge to the aerated biological reactor here both organic carbon and phosphates are used for bacterial cell synthesis with the latter being consumed proportionally to the former one the limited changes of phosphorous in the effluent with respect to the values reported by other authors can be ascribed to the low ozone dosages applied in the present study indeed when the high dosages are used the released amount becomes higher and accumulates in the bioreactor since it can be removed only by excess sludge wasting therefore the effluent concentration can rise and a further treatment might be required to keep its concentration within discharge limits 4 14 fig 6 shows the tss concentration measured in the effluent of line 2 without and with ozone application solids concentration slightly increased with ozonation i e from the average value of 8 mg l before to 11 2 mg l at the first dosage then a further increase up to 22 mg l was observed when the second dosage was applied the bacterial cell lysis due to ozone oxidation determines the release of inert solids which are then recirculated to the biological reactor through the ozonated sludge furthermore it must be remembered that towards the end of the experimental activity the solid concentration in the reactor increased to 5800 mg l due to the excess sludge waste stopping this likely affected the clarification capacity of the secondary settlement tank giving rise to the higher solid content in the effluent nonetheless the plant could always comply with the limit of 35 mg l tss set on the final effluent by the plant s permit samples of mixed liquor from the bioreactor were periodically observed at the microscope to highlight any change in the microbial composition due to ozonation figs 7 and 8 show some pictures taken before and after the application of the ozone oxidation respectively it can be noted that composition did not change significantly and remained indicative of a health state and good depuration capacity fig 7 shows the presence of a few filamentous bacteria and the sessile ciliate vorticella both representative of a sludge having good settling properties besides the sludge floc appears compact with a low fragmentation in the ozonated sludge fig 8 there is still a wide presence of sessile and mobile ciliates some rotifers and a few amoebas which are typical for activated sludge treating municipal wastewater 28 the only differences with the non ozonated sludge are represented by the reduced content of filamentous bacteria and a slight fragmentation observed at the first dosage mainly which though did not alter the settling quality the data above reported show that ozonating a fraction of ras flow rate and then recirculating it to the aerated biological reactor determined an increase in the influent load of solids nutrient and carbon to the bioreactor as a consequence a slight increase of the concentrations of the main quality parameters was observed in the treated effluent however this phenomenon lasted only for a short period of operation the plant rapidly returned to a stable efficiency the percentage of ras flow rate subjected to ozonation was properly adjusted and the effluent respected all the discharge limits the limited changes observed with respect to the greater effects reported by other authors can be considered as a consequence of the lower ozone dosages applied in the present experimentation 3 4 economic analysis implementation of any sludge reduction system implies additional costs for the wwtp due to its operation however these costs should be balanced out by the decrease obtained in sludge ultimate disposal costs in order to achieve this goal a technical economic estimation is the suitable tool to select the ozone treatment conditions which allow to produce the required sludge reduction percentage such that this balancing can be achieved in both studies performed at the sabaudia wwtp a thorough economic evaluation was carried out to this purpose considering all the major item costs for ozone production ozonation treatment and sludge disposal as highlighted in details in the materials and methods section for the present study the average amount of sludge to be disposed of after digestion and dewatering in the absence of ozonation resulted to be 14 t week for line 2 and 6 t week for line 1 based on the historical data of the plant during the ozone operation the amount of sludge to be disposed of by line 2 accounted for 7 t week and 3 5 t week at the first and second dosage respectively whereas it remained equal to 6 t week for line 1 table 3 shows the amount of sludge data for the different periods along with the corresponding overall disposal costs for the wwtp including both lines table 4 lists consumptions and costs of the ozone treatment at the different dosages based on the specific values reported in the materials and methods section table 5 shows the sludge reduction percentages achieved in line 2 and the corresponding overall savings in the disposal costs calculated as the difference between the costs in the absence of ozonation and the reduced costs associated to ozonation the same table also lists the corresponding net cost savings obtained as the difference between the total savings and the costs for ozone oxidation operation listed in table 4 table 5 highlights that with respect to the operation of the plant in the absence of ozonation a significant saving in the sludge disposal costs was obtained at both ozone dosages net of the additional costs due to ozone process operation it can be also noted that the savings increased with the dosage although the higher cost of ozonation assuming the purchase cost of the ozonation plant equal to 83 950 as referred by the supplying company of the system detailed in the materials and methods section the payback time of the investment cost resulted to be 2 years for the net cost saving obtained at the second dosage i e 40 127 y fig 9 depicts how the yearly disposal costs change as a function of the disposal cost per unit weight of sludge without and with ozonation at the second dosage the different slopes of the lines drawn in fig 9 indicate that the annual disposal costs would rise faster without ozonation due to the higher excess sludge production it can also be noted that the two lines cross at about 80 t of specific sludge disposal cost this value represents the threshold above which the ozone process becomes economically sustainable for the wwtp net of the additional operating costs this benefit increases proportionally with the specific disposal costs since the wwtp has to support a cost of 140 t for final disposal which is also increasing with time it results that the investigated ozone oxidation system with the adopted operative conditions is by far suitable as a sludge reduction system for the present plant few studies are available in the scientific literature which performed an economic evaluation of ozonation at the full scale indeed most of the past researches carried out the analysis only at a laboratory scale and included few cost items furthermore they considered very high percentages of sludge reduction even zero production which cannot be attainable under real conditions of operation since it would require very high ozone dosages and would likely produce greater negative effects on plant performance based on laboratory scale findings the cost of ozone installation and production was projected to be 3 75 per kg of o3 produced 16 this value is comparable with the cost calculated in the present study i e 4 52 and 4 09 per kg of o3 produced at the first and second dosage respectively in the same study cited above the total cost of sludge ozonation with no excess sludge production was calculated to be 538 usd t solids 480 t considering a conversion factor of 1 12 usd as assumed by the authors for ozone production and 56 usd t solids for additional aeration in the sbr to treat the soluble cod of ozonated sludge which resulted in a total cost of 594 usd t solids 16 in the present research the total cost for sludge ozonation was calculated to be 40 59 and 53 44 t at the first and second dosage respectively these values are much smaller than those reported by the cited study besides the additional cost for the soluble cod oxidation was not required due to the small amount released the wide difference might be due to the difference between the laboratory and the full scale and the sludge reduction percentages i e zero sludge production in the reference study and 50 and 75 reduction in the present study in a full scale medium sized wwtp 10 400 m3 d the actual cost of ozonation reported was 0 05 per kg of o3 produced which appears significantly lower than the projected cost reported by 16 and also calculated in the present activity this difference probably is due to variation in technical aspects such as ozone concentration and generator design with an annual production of 3276 kg o3 which was consumed to reduce sludge by 10 the total cost of the ozonation system was 6605 usd year i e 5897 y which is again much lower than the values recorded in this study 34 the different percentage reduction of sludge could be the explanation of it 3 5 comparison between the different locations of the ozone oxidation system at the end of the study a comparison was carried out between the data obtained in the present and past experimental activities conducted at the same wwtp in order to evaluate the best location of the ozone sludge reduction system application of ozonation in the recycle loop of the aerobic digestion unit of the sludge processing line determined a decrease of the overall amount of excess sludge finally withdrawn from the plant after digestion and dewatering by 60 as average with respect to the value measured in the absence of ozonation 1 fig 10 shows the same type of graph as that of fig 9 depicting how the yearly disposal costs change as a function of the disposal cost per unit weight of sludge without and with ozonation it can be noted a higher slope of the line calculated in the absence of ozonation is higher with respect to the corresponding in fig 9 furthermore the threshold value above which the ozone process becomes economically sustainable for the wwtp falls below 50 t whereas in the present study was found to be 80 t common finding to both studies was the improved settleability of the ozonated sludge due to this effect the retention time in the units downward could be appreciably extended consequently the frequency of sludge withdrawn from the plant for final disposal could be reduced with a significant overall saving of the operation costs about the other quality parameters in the ozonated sludge total cod nitrogen and phosphorus remained fairly constant a slight increase was only observed in the soluble forms mainly of n and p particularly at the highest ozone dose besides most of the ammonia released due to cell lysis was oxidized into nitrates returning the supernatant of the sludge processing line to the inlet of the wwtp determined an increased load to be treated however the final effluent quality remained at the same high level as registered before the start of ozone application therefore either locations of the ozone oxidation system had only limited effects on the sludge characteristics and plant performance table 6 compares the main results obtained through ozonation in both locations the comparison demonstrates that in the investigated wwtp the ozone oxidation is more economically convenient when implemented in the sludge processing line than in the water line it is worth noting that in both experimental studies conducted at the same wwtp the ozone dosages applied were much lower than those usually reported by other investigations 14 23 28 29 nonetheless the final effects in terms of cost savings in plant operation were considered high by the managing company 4 conclusions in a full scale wwtp ozone oxidation was applied to a fraction of the ras line at two different dosages the sludge production was reduced by 50 at 0 55 kg o3 h and 75 at 0 80 kg o3 h respectively returning the ozonated sludge to the aerated bioreactor did not produce significant effects on the removal efficiency of the plant however it was needed to properly adjust the percentage of ras subjected to ozonation which bypassed the denitrification process in order to avoid an excessive increase of nitrates in the effluent comparison with the past study conducted at the same wwtp using the ozonation system in the aerobic digestion unit showed higher advantages both technical and economic in the latter location the general conclusion which can be drawn from the overall experimental activity is the importance of performing a technical economic evaluation case by case when a sludge reduction system is to be implemented at the full scale for the selection of the more suitable operating conditions as well as the best location within the plant it would be interesting to carry out further studies using the same sludge reduction system in different wwtps to assess its suitability also under varied operating conditions furthermore a comparison at the same full scale plant with a different system could confirm if the ozone oxidation can be considered really superior financial support the study did not receive any financial support declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgments authors wish to thank dr moslem salehiziri for his support in the analytical determination activities 
13426,ozone oxidation was applied to a fraction 30 of the return activated sludge ras of a full scale wastewater treatment plant for reducing the high sludge production 20 t week the amount of sludge sent to final disposal was decreased by 50 and 75 at 0 55 kgo3 h and 0 80 kgo3 h dosage respectively when the same ozonation system was applied to the aerobic digestion 0 06 0 50 0 67 kgo3 h the reduction was 27 77 a thorough economic analysis was carried out considering the overall sludge quantity finally extracted from the plant in the presence and absence of ozonation the corresponding costs of final disposal and the ozone oxidation operation costs the net cost saving for sludge disposal was calculated to be 66 6 d and 109 9 d due to ozone in the return activated sludge at the two dosages respectively when ozonation was applied to the recycled sludge of the digestion unit the net cost saving was in the range 235 655 d depending on the reduction percentage achieved the ozone oxidation showed to become economically convenient for a sludge disposal cost lower than that sustained by the company the results obtained prove feasibility of ozonation for sludge reduction in both locations of the wwtp therefore with respect to other disintegration techniques ozonation possesses a high technical and economic advantage along with a high versatility furthermore it is also shown the feasibility of lowering the applied dosages with respect to the past experiences since effectiveness of the system is still guaranteed keywords cost analysis ozone oxidation return activated sludge sludge digestion sludge reduction 1 introduction treatment and disposal of excess sludge produced in the biological processes represent one of the main concerns in the operation of the wastewater treatment plants wwtps indeed the associated costs may account for up to 60 of the total operating costs of wwtps besides the restricted limits posed by the recent regulations on sludge quality for landfill disposal or agricultural applications increase difficulties in finding ultimate disposal solutions 1 2 it is also worth noting that a significant increase of sludge production is expected to occur in the near future due to the larger diffusion and extension of both wwtps and sewage networks as well as the higher depuration efficiency required to better protect the environment these issues will lead to further rising the costs associated to treatment post processing handling transport and disposal of excess sludge one of the best solutions to reduce these costs is represented by minimization of sludge production 3 the wide number of technologies and processes proposed to this purpose can be grouped into two main classes 1 those acting to induce a net decrease of the bacterial growth yield in the sludge generation process e g by the uncoupling metabolism 2 those promoting lysis of the new bacterial cells by means of disintegration which may involve mechanical chemical thermal or biological forces 2 4 7 most of these technologies introduces additional costs for wwtps operation besides the management complexity is increased and some negative effects on the plant treatment efficiency can occur e g higher turbidity in the final effluent more nitrogen and cod in the bioreactor to be oxidized 3 8 first experiments on ozonation started at the laboratory scale in the past century and soon proved the powerful action of ozone in reducing excess sludge production 9 12 the process was then intensively studied and demonstrated to be often superior to other techniques for its simplified operation high efficiency no secondary pollutants and being readable adaptable to existing wwtps due also to the compactness there are many reports in the scientific literature on the solution of excess sludge by ozonation 3 5 additional benefits include enhanced biodegradation or removal of emerging contaminants and destruction of pathogens 13 however with respect to economic aspects ozonation can require higher investment and operational costs as compared to other techniques for sludge reduction 4 because of the numerous advantages ozonation was also widely applied at the full scale where it was implemented either in the wastewater or sludge treatment line of the plants 4 in the former case o3 has been applied to the activated sludge taken directly from the aeration tank or more commonly to a fraction of the return activated sludge ras flow in both configurations the ozone flux facilitates solubilisation and mineralisation of sludge particles with the release of internal constituents both biodegradable and non biodegradable returning the ozonated sludge to the main bioreactor provides microorganisms with this additional substrate the biomass of the aeration tank accomplishes oxidation of both influent and additional substrate into co2 h2o and ammonia synthesis of new bacterial cells also occurs which is referred to as cryptic growth since contribution of each substrate cannot be distinguished the continuous cycle of sludge solubilisation cryptic growth results in a net reduction of the bacterial growth yield and therefore of the amount of sludge produced 3 4 during ozonation a slight deterioration of the effluent quality can be observed due to an increase of inert soluble and colloidal cod and phosphorous both released in the sludge from the ozonated cells furthermore the nitrification rate can decrease due to the direct influence of ozone on nitrifiers and floc structure although it may also be influenced by the higher soluble cod released 4 several authors reported biomass reduction due to o3 oxidation above 30 along with an improvement of the settling properties of the solids in the mixed liquors 14 ozone in the activated sludge process was referred to be economically viable with doses between 25 and 45 mgo3 gcod approximately 9 however other studies observed the need to use higher o3 quantities from 40 to 300 and rarely up to 1400 mgo3 gcod 15 intermittent oxidation of two thirds of the recycle sludge in a laboratory sequencing batch reactor at an average dose of 0 019 go3 gts allowed to accomplish a decrease of about 50 in sludge growth with respect to the control operated without ozonation as a side effect a slight deterioration of the effluent quality was observed 16 ozone oxidation is implemented in the sludge handling units as a pre treatment to the aerobic or anaerobic digestion tank to enhance sludge biodegradability and consequently stabilization efficiency along with biogas production rate in the latter case 4 17 using 0 1 go3 gts led to a sludge reduction improvement of 20 under the following aerobic or anaerobic conditions in comparison with other disintegration techniques ultrasonic and ozone treatment determined the highest increase of solid removal with the best cost reduction 6 anaerobic digestion pre treatment by ozonation at dosages below 100 mgo3 gts favoured an additional methane production of about 6 and 30 for mixed and waste activated sludge respectively furthermore the maximum ch4 production rate increased of about 21 and 33 for mixed and waste activated sludge respectively 18 during 9 months of operation of a full scale aerobic digestion total suspended solid efficiency increased up to 89 with a specific dose of 9 7 mg o3 gtss compared to the conventional treatment with air only whose efficiency was 30 as average 19 various factors affect ozonation efficiency in the activated sludge systems such as sludge characteristics ozone dose contact time nature and concentration of the different oxidizable organics compounds ph value 20 fall et al 2018 21 observed a wide change of the reactivity and ozone consumption rate of sludge depending on its composition furthermore the biomass inactivation rate and solid reduction for a given sludge were affected by the hindering phenomena e g scavenging reactions radicals generation at high ph and compactness of the flocs therefore it is still difficult to predict the effect of ozone dosing under different conditions based on theoretical considerations or literature data the cost of ozone operation also depends on various factors such as dosage sludge characteristics contact time intermittent or continuous mode of treatment besides there might be an augmentation of the costs due to the energy spent to ensure effluent quality e g additional aeration in the bioreactor to remove surplus cod or to nitrify the released ammonia in the ozonated sludge optimal operating conditions should be implemented in order to achieve minimization of the costs associated with ozonation meanwhile the ozone treatment could be able to decrease the sludge quantity with a consequent savings of the costs associated to treatment and disposal 3 therefore an economic evaluation would allow to determine the most suitable ozonation conditions which determine such savings that compensate the cost for ozonation for instance in 1 it is reported that increasing ozone dosage applied to an aerobic digester from 1 23 to 1 40 g o3 kg tss caused nominal decrease in the amount of sludge disposed but increased the operating costs of the system therefore low ozone dosage was preferentially implemented to compensate the cost of sludge disposal although significant progresses in the knowledge of ozone oxidation have been fulfilled over the years challenges and lacks still persist in the full scale implementation 22 therefore further investigations are strongly boosted to achieve a better understanding of all technical and economic entailments of ozone oxidation process when it is implemented under the more complex real conditions the present study belongs to a wide research activity carried out in collaboration with the management company of the wwtps of the province of latin italy aiming at investigating solutions for reducing sludge handling costs which are considered significantly high among the different alternatives it was decided to investigate the ozone oxidation since more references are available about its application at the full scale furthermore the management company intended to evaluate implementation of ozonation also for disinfecting the final effluent due to the increasing restrictions posed by the recent regulations on the use of chlorination to this purpose two locations of the ozone oxidation systems in a full scale wwtp were proposed by the supplier as the most favorable ones for the specific characteristics of the plant 1 the recirculation line of the sludge aerobic digester and 2 the ras line in location 1 the ozone oxidation was capable of determining a 58 reduction as average of the total amount of sludge finally extracted by the plant after digestion and dewatering this significant decrease determined a net saving in the sludge disposal costs in the range 235 655 d 1 the aim of the present experimental study was to evaluate the effects of the same ozone oxidation system when applied to the return activated sludge flow of the same full scale wwtp a comparison based on technical and economic evaluations was carried out for both locations considering the effects on sludge production plant treatment efficiency and costs the results obtained by the two studies provide key information on the benefits and drawbacks of ozonation when implemented at the full scale and can be used by the decision makers to choose the best location and operating conditions the main novelty of this paper with respect to most of the past investigations consists in the comparison of different locations within a full scale plant and in evaluation of all the technical and economic issues furthermore the ozone doses tested were much lower than those applied by most of the previous studies 5 14 21 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater treatment plant the present study was carried out at the full scale belsito wwtp for domestic sewage located in sabaudia latina italy and managed by acqualatina s p a the plant has a total treatment capacity of 30 000 population equivalent pe and operates through line 1 and line 2 which receive a flow rate corresponding to 10 000 pe and to 20 000 pe respectively due to the touristic nature of the urban area served by the plant the influent flow rate q widely varies throughout the year for instance the average flow rate is 4800 m3 d in the winter period whereas it reaches peaks of about 6000 m3 d during summer season to limit such a variation the influent is firstly treated through an equalization tank prior to be distributed into the two lines of the plant the average influent characteristics measured during the experimental period were 536 mg cod l 55 mg nh4 n l 4 3 mg p l each wastewater treatment line of the plant operates through the same sequence of units as shown in fig 1 1 screening and degritting as pre treatments 2 activated sludge process for denitrification nitrification and carbon oxidation 3 secondary settlement for effluent clarification and 4 disinfection through chlorination the return activated sludge ras flow rate qr is extracted from the bottom of the secondary settlement tank and transferred to the denitrification reactor to provide nitrates and mixed liquor the excess biological sludge handling units consist of aerobic digestion post thickening and dewatering the treated sludge is disposed of in a composting plant outside the wwtp prior to the experimental study the average mass of sludge from both lines sent to final disposal accounted for 20 t week 2 2 ozone oxidation the same ozone oxidation system named lyso and supplied by praxair was used in both experimental activities carried out at the full scale belsito wwtp the system includes the main following items a a wedeco o3 generator for ozone supply b lyso centrifugal pumps for sludge withdrawal and recirculation of the ozonated sludge c a venturi tube for aspiring o3 into the contact reactor d a plug flow reactor for contacting ozone with sludge e a liquid oxygen source provided by rivoira s p a f a residual ozone destructor g pipelines and controls 1 the technical parameters of the ozone oxidation system were set and maintained at the following values 9 10 kw h for 1 kg o3 produced 10 kgo2 h for 1 kgo3 produced 10 kw h and 5 kw h as energy consumption by the centrifugal pumps in the present and past study respectively 1 m3 h of cooling water for 1 kgo3 produced 1 according to the supplier features of the contact chamber optimize sludge mixing with the ozone flux the ozonation system is designed to immediately convert the residual ozone flux into oxygen in the destructor device this configuration makes it impossible to carry out a mass balance on the ozone flux therefore the amount of ozone applied to the sludge was assumed equal to the dosage supplied to the contact reactor 2 3 experimental study the ozone oxidation was always implemented in line 2 of the wwtp in the past experimental activity the treatment was performed by drawing a sludge flow rate of 70 m3 h from the aerobic digester and passing it through the sludge ozonation system the ozonated sludge was then recirculated to the digestion tank this sequential operation of withdrawal ozonation recirculation was applied in a continuous mode for all the duration of the study the ozone flow rate qo3 was varied as follows in order to determine the optimal ozonation conditions 60 500 and 670 go3 h these values were selected based on previous experiences performed by the supplier of the ozonation system the lowest dosage was the minimum one considered potentially capable of producing appreciable effects on sludge stabilization whereas the highest one corresponded to the threshold limit above which the ozonation became economically unsustainable the oxygen consumption would have been too high a third value was also selected being intermediate between the highest and lowest dosage no further values were tested in order not to affect regular operation of the full scale wwtp the corresponding specific dosages were calculated based on eq 1 to be 0 15 1 40 and 1 23 go3 kgtss0 with respect to the solid content in the digester in the present experimental activity a flow rate equal to qsludge 50 m3 h corresponding to 30 of the ras flow rate qr was continuously drawn from the ras line and subjected to ozonation in the contact reactor see fig 1 the ozonated sludge was then recirculated from the outlet of the contact reactor to the biological aerated tank this sequential process of withdrawal ozonation recirculation was applied in a continuous mode throughout the experimental activity two ozone dosages qo3 were applied for a duration of about 20 d each one the values were selected being close to the dosages applied in the first experimentation carried out at the same wwtp and based on other past experiences performed by the supplier of the ozonation system in both studies the dosages were selected below the values referred by most of the past studies 1 5 14 23 and this was considered a novelty table 1 lists the ozone dosages qo3 and the corresponding specific dosages sdo3 expressed in terms of ozone dosed per mlss of ozonated sludge mlss0 of the ras calculated as follows 1 1 sd o 3 q o 3 q sludge mlss 0 the experimental activity was conducted during winter time operation of line 2 was monitored for a long time prior to start ozonation to determine its average characteristics the monitoring activity was also continued during the study in order to highlight if recirculation of the ozonated sludge to the biological aerated reactor could produce any affect on the wwtp treatment performance instantaneous samples of the influent prior to pre treatments and effluent after settlement through automatic devices were collected and analyzed to determine concentrations of the following parameters total cod tcod soluble phosphorous sp ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n total suspended solids tss only in the effluent concentrations of mlss and mlvss in mixed liquor samples from the biological reactor were also measured at the same frequency besides the sludge volume index svi after 30 min settling time was determined on sludge samples collected from the same reactor characteristics of the return sludge in the inlet and outlet of the ozone contact reactor were also monitored by measuring concentration of the following parameters total and soluble cod tcod and scod respectively sp no2 n no3 n mlss mlvss and svi the disintegration degree dd was calculated as the difference between the soluble cod in the outlet scodout and inlet scodin of the ozone contact reactor divided by the particulate cod measured in the inlet t cod in s cod in as shown by eq 2 24 2 dd 100 s cod out s cod in t cod in s cod in fig 1 shows the sampling points referred to as follows 1 influent 2 mixed liquor of the biological reactor 3 effluent from the secondary settlement tank 4 and 5 ras sludge in the inlet and outlet of the ozone contact reactor respectively analytical determinations were carried out in duplicate on each sample and the average calculated through statistical analysis all the parameters were measured accordingly to standard methods 25 the soluble fractions were determined on liquid samples after glass fiber membrane filtration at 0 45 μm observations at the microscope of sludge samples taken from the aeration tank were also performed without and with ozone operation sludge cell disintegration results in an increase of soluble chemical oxygen demand nitrogen and phosphorous loading rates in the reactor producing indirect impacts on microorganisms during ozonation furthermore there might be direct effects of ozonation on microorganism activity and mortality rates which depend on each species and their location in the floc previous researches highlighted the potential of ozonation to transform the microbial composition with a stronger negative effect on the nitrifying bacteria activity thus impacting the overall performance of the wwtp 22 26 27 most of the past studies on the ozone oxidation treatment have focused on the optimization of operational conditions and have been conducted on pilot plants over short experimental periods 23 therefore in the present study the microscopic observations were performed with the aim to highlight any possible effect on the microbial community due to long term ozone application in the full scale plant microscopic observations of the microbial community were also performed in the past study conducted at the same plant 2 4 economic analysis in order to evaluate the real convenience of implementing the ozone oxidation system at the sabaudia wwtp a thorough economic analysis was carried out for both the experimental studies the followings specific costs provided by the ozone oxidation supplier were considered to the purpose 1 average cost for sludge disposal to composting facilities cd 140 ton 2 cost for 1 kg liquid o2 purchase o2 0 18 kgo2 3 cost of energy e 0 15 kwh as sludge disposal cost it was assumed the value paid for by the managing company of the wwtp whereas power and oxygen consumptions data were provided by praxair who supplied the lyso sludge ozonation system the economic evaluation considered only the overall sludge quantity extracted from the plant and sent to final disposal since this parameter represents the main cost item for the managing company furthermore it was taken into account that line 1 was continuously operated without ozonation and therefore the amount of sludge to be disposed of always remained the same differently the sludge produced by line 2 was reduced as a consequence of ozone application therefore the overall cost for ultimate sludge disposal was calculated as cd px1 px2 where px1 and px2 represent the amount of sludge in t week finally extracted from line 1 and line 2 respectively and transferred to composting for line 1 this amount was assumed equal to the average value measured in the absence of ozonation whereas for line 2 it was distinguished between the values measured without and those associated to ozonation based on these data it was then possible to calculate the saving obtained in the overall disposal costs with respect to the plant operation without ozonation costs of ozone operation were computed considering energy kwh and oxygen kg consumed for the o3 production per year based on the values registered during the experimental activity for the different dosages then using the specific values listed above the corresponding energy and oxygen consumption costs were calculated ce and co2 respectively other costs were due to transport service ct tank rent ctr and maintenance cm the overall cost of ozone operation at each dosage was finally obtained as follows ce co2 ct ctr cm then the net cost saving was calculated as the difference between the overall cost for final disposal and the ozone operation cost finally considering a capital cost for purchasing the ozone system equal to 83 950 sum of 74 500 for the ozone production system and 9450 for the storage tank as referred by the supplier it was possible to determine the payback time for the net cost savings associated to ozone application at the investigated dosages 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of ozonation on sludge production ozone oxidation determined a reduction by 50 about 600 ton year using the first dosage and by 75 about 300 ton year at the second dosage with respect to the average sludge production measured prior to the experimental study about 1000 ton year consequently pumps for excess sludge wasting could be operated for a lower time interval i e from 8 h d as without ozonation to 4 h d and 2 h d at the first and second ozone dosage respectively the sludge reduction is ascribed to solid disintegration with bacterial cell break down due to the strong ozone oxidation 3 indeed the solid concentration in the biological reactor decreased as highlighted by table 2 which lists mlss and mlvss concentrations measured before and during the study the mvlss mlss also decreased significantly in the presence of ozonation due to solid mineralization with the aim to exploit at the best the potentialities of the system during the last two weeks of the experimental activity the excess sludge wasting was temporarily stopped as a consequence the mlss concentration in the biological reactor increased although slightly reaching a final value of 5800 mg l therefore the value reported in table 2 for the 2nd o3 dosage can be considered as the net result of the concentration reduction due to ozone oxidation and the increase for sludge wasting suspension the solid concentration would have likely continued to lower if the sludge wasting was still maintained constantly in operation table 2 also shows the average svi values measured on sludge samples collected from the biological reactor it can be noted a reduction from 139 ml gss registered without ozonation to 116 ml gss associated to ozone application beside this decrease a lower percentage of filamentous bacteria was observed at the microscope analyses conducted on activated sludge samples after ozone application indeed it is widely reported that ozone preferably hits the bacteria filaments which extend beyond the sludge flocs as a consequence less water is retained the flocs become more compact and improve their settleability 27 furthermore a release of extracellular polymeric substances eps in the liquid phase can occur which act as bridges between the smaller size particles 28 29 the ozone addition 3 4 8 go3 kgts to the return activated sludge of a full scale plant produced an improvement of settling properties of the sludge by lowering the diluted sludge volume dsvi by 7 35 furthermore filamentous bacteria protruding from flocs showed to be more susceptible to ozone attack than bacteria residing with the flocs 28 the improved sludge settleability after ozone application was responsible of the lower volume occupied by the wasted excess sludge in the thickener of the sludge processing units therefore it was possible to extend the residence time inside this tank prior to sludge transfer to the next treatment unit consequently also the dewatering device could be operated at a less frequency and finally the amount of dried sludge to send to final disposal was reduced with respect to before ozone application solid reduction percentages reported in the literature fall in a wide range of values i e 10 80 depending on ozone dosage 15 60 mg o3 g ts feed type and sludge composition 3 in 14 a similar lay out as that of the present study was investigated although at a smaller scale ozonation was applied in the range 0 207 mgo3 gmlss to certain fractions of the sludge extracted from the settling tank of a pilot scale anaerobic anoxic aerobic treatment system the ozonated sludge was then recycled to the bioreactor the long term operation of this system provided sludge reduction efficiency in the range 48 66 furthermore a notable decrease in svi was observed in each tank indicating an improved sludge settleability in 21 the ozone treatment at dosage of 50 mgo3 gcod was able to reduce the solids quantities by around 17 in model fresh sludge fed with acetate based synthetic wastewater against 26 30 in digested sludge and sludge from the local wwtp 3 5 more was gained when the dose was doubled 100 mgo3 gcod it is noteworthy that sludge reduction percentages reported by many studies as those cited above are very close to those registered in the present study however in most of the past researches much higher dosages were required to achieve such reductions therefore in the real applications it would be useful to investigate the ozone oxidation effects starting from low dosages this also would help to control the costs for its operation 3 2 effects of ozonation on sludge characteristics observations before and after the ozone contact reactor showed an increase of soluble cod concentration scod in the ozonated sludge differently in the ras not subjected to ozonation concentration of dissolved cod remained constant ozonation can rupture the cell membrane causing death and release of intracellular materials such as soluble cod researchers report that 10 60 of cod is solubilized due to ozonation at 10 160 mgo3 gtss 3 the observed increase was significant from 150 mg l to 300 mg l soon after the application of the first dosage a further increment occurred when the dosage was brought to the higher level after about 12 d of application this trend reached a plateau accumulation of radical scavengers such as so4 2 and lactic acid generated as by products of decayed bacteria was likely responsible of this change since they compete with o3 in the oxidation of the organic matter indeed it is reported that at high dosages the oxidant can gradually lose its ability to efficiently attack the solids 15 another explanation can be that the stronger oxidant power of the higher dose might have determined the direct oxidation of the organic matter into co2 i e mineralization 21 30 the effect of soluble cod release due to ozonation is widely reported in 28 the dissolved cod increased from 81 to 288 mg l between the control and the highest ozone dose 4 8 g o3 kg tss applied to the return sludge this may appear as a large increase in soluble cod however relating the soluble cod to the total cod reveals that the soluble part of the cod only increased from 1 7 to 6 7 based on the scod concentrations measured in the sludge upstream and downstream the ozone contact reactor it was possible to calculate the value of the disintegration degree dd at the two dosages it resulted a linear increase of dd from 1 to 10 as the dosage rose from the lowest to the maximum level this finding is reported by other authors for instance a linear relationship existed in general between the dissolution degree dd and the doses in all the types of sludge investigated in the study r2 0 97 21 in 13 with an increase of o3 dose the solubilization ratio increased almost linearly till 182 mg o3 gss but somewhat slowed down thereafter at 242 mg o3 gss the solubilization ratio reached the highest value 66 6 sludge solubilization efficiency increased quickly to 35 5 as the ozone dose increased to 101 mgo3 gmlss afterwards a slow increase was observed as the ozone dose further increased to 207 mgo3 gmlss 14 the specific solubilization rate for each experimental phase was then determined as the ratio between the average released scod and the applied ozone dose this parameter resulted to be equal to 25 74 gscod go3 and 17 58 gscod go3 at the first and second dosage respectively these values demonstrate that ozone oxidation caused a higher solubilization effect when dosed at the minimum level this is in accordance with the plateau observed in the scod release process at the higher dose as reported above the decline in sludge solubilisation efficiency at high ozone dosages might be due to several factors and it has been widely observed 3 for instance fall et al 2018 21 observed dd plateauing at high o3 dose 73 mgo3 gcod regarding the other characteristics of the ozonated ras fraction soluble phosphorous concentration did not show any significant change before and after the contact reactor independently of the dosage 0 31 mg l and 0 33 mg l respectively as average concentrations of no2 n and no3 n were always found slightly higher in the ozonated sludge 0 08 mg l before and 0 27 mg l after and 5 14 mg l before and 67 70 mg l after respectively as average this slight increase was likely due to the oxidation of the ammonia released by the bacterial cell lysis this process might have been also favoured by the oxygen made available by the conversion of the residual ozone the soluble ammonia concentration remained below the detectable limit in the ozonated sludge which agrees with other studies which refer only a slight release of ammonia due to sludge ozonation 31 as an example of these studies dytczak et al 2007 using dosages far above those considered in the present activity i e in the range 0 015 0 080 mg o3 mg of initial tss found ammonia nitrogen concentration in the ozonated excess sludge always below the detection limit of 0 3 mg l 32 measurements of the solid contents in the sludge prior and after the ozone contact reactor did not highlight any significant difference it is noteworthy that the sensitivity of the analytical method used for determining solid concentration 31 is unable to highlight slight variations when the solid concentrations are notably high as in the case of the return sludge flow about 13 000 mg l mlss the behaviour observed in the ozonated ras is in accordance with the findings of other studies on ozone application however the lower dosages applied in the present experimental study limited the extent of the changes produced on the sludge characteristics indeed several papers of the specialized literature report that the oxidation with ozone produces evident effects only when applied at high dosages for instance zhao et al 2007 31 observed a solid decrease only at 40 go3 kgmlss 3 3 effects of ozonation on line 2 treatment efficiency the effect of ozonation on effluent quality is an important consideration when applying this technology in the real wastewater treatment systems several experiences in the literature reported a slight decrease in effluent quality after sludge ozonation and recirculation of ozonated sludge into the activated sludge reactor 4 therefore the efficiency of the water treatment line was continuously monitored during the ozone oxidation application in order to investigate if returning the ozonated sludge to the biological reactor could produce any effect on the treatment process performance as shown by fig 2 at the beginning of the first o3 dosage period the total cod concentration in the effluent of the secondary settlement tank increased from 31 mg l the average value measured before ozone application to 86 mg l as average reaching also a peak of 118 mg l after about 28 d correspondingly the removal efficiency decreased from 94 to 85 despite this increase the limit posed on the effluent by the plant s permit equal to 125 mg l was still always respected at the end of the first dosing phase the cod concentration turned to be close to the average measured in the absence of ozonation i e 38 mg l versus 31 mg l respectively after the application of the second dosage the cod decreased further reaching a final value below 20 mg l these changes observed during ozone application in the effluent cod are well correlated to the scod trend observed in the ras fraction subjected to ozonation see section 3 2 when the ozonation started a sudden increase of the soluble cod concentration in the ozonated sludge occurred recirculation of the ozonated sludge determined an increased cod in the influent to the bioreactor therefore the effluent concentration showed a rapid increase as a consequence of the higher load to be treated later on the removal process progressively adapted until the required level of efficiency to degrade the higher influent load was established as observed in the previous section it is also likely that the higher ozone dosage of the second phase was capable of oxidizing the organic carbon released through the bacterial cell lysis like carbohydrates to co2 thus the organic carbon load recycled with the ozonated sludge to the biological reactor did not increase directly with the ozone dosage the limited effect observed in the present study on the effluent cod is in accordance with many studies it was demonstrated that the overall cod removal efficiency was unaffected or underwent a minor decrease 5 10 this can be a consequence of the biodegradable nature of the majority of the solubilized cod released which is rapidly consumed when ozonated sludge is returned to the aerobic reactor 3 15 sludge solubilisation can also lead to the release of nitrogen species mostly in the form of inorganic nitrogen the recirculation of ozonated ras which may have high nitrogen and oxygen content can decrease nitrogen removal efficiency of the main bioreactor 14 however the fate of nitrogen is dependent on the ozonation conditions for instance increasing the amount of ozonated sludge determined higher organic carbon loading and dissolved oxygen competition between nitrifying and heterotrophic bacteria this phenomenon consequently decreased nitrification efficiency 3 naso et al 2008 26 observed that ozone destabilized nitrifying bacteria and consequently decreased the total nitrogen removal efficiency of a sequencing batch reactor sbr trend of ammonia nitrogen concentration observed in the effluent is depicted in fig 3 it can be noted a slight increase of the effluent concentration from 0 80 mg l in the absence of ozonation to 1 15 and 1 12 mg l at the first and second dosage respectively this trend agrees with the negligible release observed in the ozonated ras fraction the ammonia concentration in the effluent always remained far below the limit of 15 mg l nh4 set by the plant s permit fig 3 shows also nitrite nitrogen concentration measured in the effluent in the absence and presence of ozone oxidation it can be noted that the values always remained below the method detection limit differently ozonation strongly affected the nitrate content in the treated effluent as it is clearly shown in fig 4 no3 n increased progressively from 4 1 mg l in the absence of ozonation to above 15 mg l during the first dosage phase and to about 20 mg l at the end of the second dosage period the reason of this rapid change was found in the adopted ozonation lay out indeed recirculation of oxygen rich ozonated sludge in an anoxic aerobic system prevent facultative denitrifying bacteria from utilizing nitrate as ozone acceptor which results in reduced denitrification efficiency 22 to avoid this problem in the design phase of the ozone system it was decided to recirculate the ozonated ras fraction to the aerobic biological reactor instead of to the denitrifying reactor however this specific lay out entailed a reduction of the nitrates load subjected to denitrification furthermore an additional nitrate production although likely very low was due to the nitrification of the ammonia released in the ozonated sludge by cell lysis these processes were responsible of the progressive increase of no3 n content in the effluent although the high value reached at the end of the second phase the limit set on the effluent to 20 mg l by the plant s permit could be still respected indeed the official fiscal control of the effluent quality of the wwtp has to be carried out on the final discharge after mixing the effluents of both lines 1 and 2 therefore being the nitrate content of line 1 effluent constantly at about 5 mg l combination of the two flow rates determined a final concentration still below the limit of 20 mg l despite the high value measured in the outlet of line 2 in order to reduce the effluent nitrate concentration of line 2 the ras percentage subjected to ozonation was afterwards reduced with the consequent increase of the nitrate load sent to denitrification through the non ozonated ras this modification was capable of reducing the nitrate concentration in the effluent which at the optimal conditions reached a stable value of 8 mg l in the effluent of line 2 this lay out was then maintained permanently in the plant increases of nitrate nitrogen content in the effluent of ozonated biological systems were also reported by other authors although not investigated in details or explained through another phenomenon for instance in an ozonated anaerobic anoxic aerobic reactor it was considered that nitrate accumulation in the aerobic phase could be linked to inhibition of denitrification in the preceding anoxic phase 3 however the present study suggests the need to consider different options such as layout or ozonation conditions fig 5 shows soluble phosphorous measured in the treated effluent of line 2 in the absence and presence of ozone oxidation at the first dosage the value remained close to that measured without ozonation i e 0 68 mg l and 0 72 mg l as average respectively when the dosage was increased to the higher level concentration decreased with an average value of 0 25 mg l the observed profile resembles that above reported for total cod indeed the two components follow a similar fate under ozonation phosphates are released due to solubilization of the cell membrane constituents in this case phospholipids 31 33 released phosphorous is then recirculated with the ozonated sludge to the aerated biological reactor here both organic carbon and phosphates are used for bacterial cell synthesis with the latter being consumed proportionally to the former one the limited changes of phosphorous in the effluent with respect to the values reported by other authors can be ascribed to the low ozone dosages applied in the present study indeed when the high dosages are used the released amount becomes higher and accumulates in the bioreactor since it can be removed only by excess sludge wasting therefore the effluent concentration can rise and a further treatment might be required to keep its concentration within discharge limits 4 14 fig 6 shows the tss concentration measured in the effluent of line 2 without and with ozone application solids concentration slightly increased with ozonation i e from the average value of 8 mg l before to 11 2 mg l at the first dosage then a further increase up to 22 mg l was observed when the second dosage was applied the bacterial cell lysis due to ozone oxidation determines the release of inert solids which are then recirculated to the biological reactor through the ozonated sludge furthermore it must be remembered that towards the end of the experimental activity the solid concentration in the reactor increased to 5800 mg l due to the excess sludge waste stopping this likely affected the clarification capacity of the secondary settlement tank giving rise to the higher solid content in the effluent nonetheless the plant could always comply with the limit of 35 mg l tss set on the final effluent by the plant s permit samples of mixed liquor from the bioreactor were periodically observed at the microscope to highlight any change in the microbial composition due to ozonation figs 7 and 8 show some pictures taken before and after the application of the ozone oxidation respectively it can be noted that composition did not change significantly and remained indicative of a health state and good depuration capacity fig 7 shows the presence of a few filamentous bacteria and the sessile ciliate vorticella both representative of a sludge having good settling properties besides the sludge floc appears compact with a low fragmentation in the ozonated sludge fig 8 there is still a wide presence of sessile and mobile ciliates some rotifers and a few amoebas which are typical for activated sludge treating municipal wastewater 28 the only differences with the non ozonated sludge are represented by the reduced content of filamentous bacteria and a slight fragmentation observed at the first dosage mainly which though did not alter the settling quality the data above reported show that ozonating a fraction of ras flow rate and then recirculating it to the aerated biological reactor determined an increase in the influent load of solids nutrient and carbon to the bioreactor as a consequence a slight increase of the concentrations of the main quality parameters was observed in the treated effluent however this phenomenon lasted only for a short period of operation the plant rapidly returned to a stable efficiency the percentage of ras flow rate subjected to ozonation was properly adjusted and the effluent respected all the discharge limits the limited changes observed with respect to the greater effects reported by other authors can be considered as a consequence of the lower ozone dosages applied in the present experimentation 3 4 economic analysis implementation of any sludge reduction system implies additional costs for the wwtp due to its operation however these costs should be balanced out by the decrease obtained in sludge ultimate disposal costs in order to achieve this goal a technical economic estimation is the suitable tool to select the ozone treatment conditions which allow to produce the required sludge reduction percentage such that this balancing can be achieved in both studies performed at the sabaudia wwtp a thorough economic evaluation was carried out to this purpose considering all the major item costs for ozone production ozonation treatment and sludge disposal as highlighted in details in the materials and methods section for the present study the average amount of sludge to be disposed of after digestion and dewatering in the absence of ozonation resulted to be 14 t week for line 2 and 6 t week for line 1 based on the historical data of the plant during the ozone operation the amount of sludge to be disposed of by line 2 accounted for 7 t week and 3 5 t week at the first and second dosage respectively whereas it remained equal to 6 t week for line 1 table 3 shows the amount of sludge data for the different periods along with the corresponding overall disposal costs for the wwtp including both lines table 4 lists consumptions and costs of the ozone treatment at the different dosages based on the specific values reported in the materials and methods section table 5 shows the sludge reduction percentages achieved in line 2 and the corresponding overall savings in the disposal costs calculated as the difference between the costs in the absence of ozonation and the reduced costs associated to ozonation the same table also lists the corresponding net cost savings obtained as the difference between the total savings and the costs for ozone oxidation operation listed in table 4 table 5 highlights that with respect to the operation of the plant in the absence of ozonation a significant saving in the sludge disposal costs was obtained at both ozone dosages net of the additional costs due to ozone process operation it can be also noted that the savings increased with the dosage although the higher cost of ozonation assuming the purchase cost of the ozonation plant equal to 83 950 as referred by the supplying company of the system detailed in the materials and methods section the payback time of the investment cost resulted to be 2 years for the net cost saving obtained at the second dosage i e 40 127 y fig 9 depicts how the yearly disposal costs change as a function of the disposal cost per unit weight of sludge without and with ozonation at the second dosage the different slopes of the lines drawn in fig 9 indicate that the annual disposal costs would rise faster without ozonation due to the higher excess sludge production it can also be noted that the two lines cross at about 80 t of specific sludge disposal cost this value represents the threshold above which the ozone process becomes economically sustainable for the wwtp net of the additional operating costs this benefit increases proportionally with the specific disposal costs since the wwtp has to support a cost of 140 t for final disposal which is also increasing with time it results that the investigated ozone oxidation system with the adopted operative conditions is by far suitable as a sludge reduction system for the present plant few studies are available in the scientific literature which performed an economic evaluation of ozonation at the full scale indeed most of the past researches carried out the analysis only at a laboratory scale and included few cost items furthermore they considered very high percentages of sludge reduction even zero production which cannot be attainable under real conditions of operation since it would require very high ozone dosages and would likely produce greater negative effects on plant performance based on laboratory scale findings the cost of ozone installation and production was projected to be 3 75 per kg of o3 produced 16 this value is comparable with the cost calculated in the present study i e 4 52 and 4 09 per kg of o3 produced at the first and second dosage respectively in the same study cited above the total cost of sludge ozonation with no excess sludge production was calculated to be 538 usd t solids 480 t considering a conversion factor of 1 12 usd as assumed by the authors for ozone production and 56 usd t solids for additional aeration in the sbr to treat the soluble cod of ozonated sludge which resulted in a total cost of 594 usd t solids 16 in the present research the total cost for sludge ozonation was calculated to be 40 59 and 53 44 t at the first and second dosage respectively these values are much smaller than those reported by the cited study besides the additional cost for the soluble cod oxidation was not required due to the small amount released the wide difference might be due to the difference between the laboratory and the full scale and the sludge reduction percentages i e zero sludge production in the reference study and 50 and 75 reduction in the present study in a full scale medium sized wwtp 10 400 m3 d the actual cost of ozonation reported was 0 05 per kg of o3 produced which appears significantly lower than the projected cost reported by 16 and also calculated in the present activity this difference probably is due to variation in technical aspects such as ozone concentration and generator design with an annual production of 3276 kg o3 which was consumed to reduce sludge by 10 the total cost of the ozonation system was 6605 usd year i e 5897 y which is again much lower than the values recorded in this study 34 the different percentage reduction of sludge could be the explanation of it 3 5 comparison between the different locations of the ozone oxidation system at the end of the study a comparison was carried out between the data obtained in the present and past experimental activities conducted at the same wwtp in order to evaluate the best location of the ozone sludge reduction system application of ozonation in the recycle loop of the aerobic digestion unit of the sludge processing line determined a decrease of the overall amount of excess sludge finally withdrawn from the plant after digestion and dewatering by 60 as average with respect to the value measured in the absence of ozonation 1 fig 10 shows the same type of graph as that of fig 9 depicting how the yearly disposal costs change as a function of the disposal cost per unit weight of sludge without and with ozonation it can be noted a higher slope of the line calculated in the absence of ozonation is higher with respect to the corresponding in fig 9 furthermore the threshold value above which the ozone process becomes economically sustainable for the wwtp falls below 50 t whereas in the present study was found to be 80 t common finding to both studies was the improved settleability of the ozonated sludge due to this effect the retention time in the units downward could be appreciably extended consequently the frequency of sludge withdrawn from the plant for final disposal could be reduced with a significant overall saving of the operation costs about the other quality parameters in the ozonated sludge total cod nitrogen and phosphorus remained fairly constant a slight increase was only observed in the soluble forms mainly of n and p particularly at the highest ozone dose besides most of the ammonia released due to cell lysis was oxidized into nitrates returning the supernatant of the sludge processing line to the inlet of the wwtp determined an increased load to be treated however the final effluent quality remained at the same high level as registered before the start of ozone application therefore either locations of the ozone oxidation system had only limited effects on the sludge characteristics and plant performance table 6 compares the main results obtained through ozonation in both locations the comparison demonstrates that in the investigated wwtp the ozone oxidation is more economically convenient when implemented in the sludge processing line than in the water line it is worth noting that in both experimental studies conducted at the same wwtp the ozone dosages applied were much lower than those usually reported by other investigations 14 23 28 29 nonetheless the final effects in terms of cost savings in plant operation were considered high by the managing company 4 conclusions in a full scale wwtp ozone oxidation was applied to a fraction of the ras line at two different dosages the sludge production was reduced by 50 at 0 55 kg o3 h and 75 at 0 80 kg o3 h respectively returning the ozonated sludge to the aerated bioreactor did not produce significant effects on the removal efficiency of the plant however it was needed to properly adjust the percentage of ras subjected to ozonation which bypassed the denitrification process in order to avoid an excessive increase of nitrates in the effluent comparison with the past study conducted at the same wwtp using the ozonation system in the aerobic digestion unit showed higher advantages both technical and economic in the latter location the general conclusion which can be drawn from the overall experimental activity is the importance of performing a technical economic evaluation case by case when a sludge reduction system is to be implemented at the full scale for the selection of the more suitable operating conditions as well as the best location within the plant it would be interesting to carry out further studies using the same sludge reduction system in different wwtps to assess its suitability also under varied operating conditions furthermore a comparison at the same full scale plant with a different system could confirm if the ozone oxidation can be considered really superior financial support the study

column system achieved total removal percentages of 72 8 as v and 60 4 hg ii in addition to total adsorbed metals of 879 8 mg as v and 717 2 mg hg ii for 8 1 l of polluted water therefore the synthetic β cd mcm composite is of promising adsorption properties to be applied in the decontamination of as v and hg ii ions either in batch studies or fixed bed column studies keywords mcm 48 β cyclodextrin composite arsenic mercury adsorption mechanism 1 introduction the existence of several species of toxic metal ions in the freshwater resources under the continuous development of industrial metallurgical and mining activities have become critical issues for the safety of humanity 1 2 generally these elements are toxic carcinogenic and hazardous on humans animals and aquatic organisms especially with the continuous accumulation of them in the tissues of the living organisms 3 4 among the toxic metal ions arsenic as and mercury hg were categorized as highly toxic metal pollutants 5 6 the arsenic ions in their inorganic form were identified as two species trivalent form as iii and pentavalent form as v 7 the arsenic pollutants in the drinking water is a curse for about 200 million person in the world and an indicator for the dangerous in the coming future especially in the asian countries 8 the existence of the as v ions in the water supplies above acceptable levels 10 μg l has carcinogenic effect on the urinary bladder skin kidney and lungs 9 10 additionally other diseases were reported as results for as v contaminants such as cardiovascular disease vomiting abdominal pain esophageal bloody diarrhea and diabetes 1 11 there are several countries suffer from the contamination of the water by the arsenic ions at high concentrations including bangladesh nepal argentina china mexico vietnam poland india pakistan hungary and usa 8 10 also the hg ii element was categorized as one of the third most toxic elements and it has hazardous impacts on the eyes kidneys skin lungs digestive system nervous system and immune system 12 13 therefore the concentrations of hg ii in surface water and drinking water were recommended to be below 10 μg l and 1 μ l respectively 14 15 for the previously reported hazardous and toxic impacts different techniques were suggested to control the concentrations of such metals in the water supplies including biological remediation ion exchange purification membrane filtration chemical precipitation and adsorption 12 16 17 the decontamination processes based on the adsorption techniques were recommended strongly for their simplicity low cost rapid equilibrium recyclability and controlled affinity abukhadra et al 2021 the recently studied adsorbents of as v involved zno zeolite 15 co zn zif 18 multi

production cost are the essential factors that qualify the adsorbents of the wide scale applications 10 26 27 therefore the production of new types of adsorbents which are of simple synthesis techniques and significant uptake capacities is the main target of the authors in the later periods 28 30 the ordered nanoporous silica of mcm type as mcm 41 and mcm 48 were studied in the later

groups very high surface area highly oriented porous morphology and high thermal stability 32 33 the mcm 48 species was recommended strongly to be applied in the retention of the metal ions or the uptake of the other types of water contaminants 4 the amazing structure of mcm 48 that composed of continuous interwoven and branched highly porous silica is of strong effect in inducing the mass transfer kinetics of the adsorption reactions 33 the morphological and physicochemical properties of mcm 48 qualifies it to be a promising carrier for different species of biopolymers which resulted finally in motivated composites or hybrid structures of multifunctional active groups biodegradable properties ecofriendly and safe features highly reactive surface and excellent uptake capacities 4 34 β cyclodextrin is a common and promising biopolymer that was addressed in different adsorption studies for the organic as well as the inorganic water contaminants 4 35 36 structurally the β cyclodextrin polymer is of torus like units from cyclic oligosaccharide which composed of glucose subunits 7 subunits that connect with each other by α 1 4 glucose bonds 37 39 the recognized hydrophilic and lipophilic properties of the surface and cavities of β cyclodextrin respectively prompt the affinity of its polymer chains to create different chemical complexes with various species of inorganic and organic ions 38 40 the adsorption properties of the hybrid β cyclodextrin mcm 48 structure β cd mcm as potential adsorbent for effective and environmental decontamination of arsenic as v and mercury hg ii ions have not been assessed previously therefore the demonstrated study involved the synthesis of β cd mcm as an adsorbent for both as v and hg ii ions the adsorption properties were followed by the batch studies as well as the fixed bed column studies considering the common adsorption factors the performance and the dynamic properties of the β cd mcm bed were followed considering the breakthrough curves and the kinetic studies also the uptake behaviors were assessed based on the equilibrium kinetic and thermodynamic properties of the reactions 2 experimental work 2 1 materials cetyltrimethylammonium bromide surfactant ctab 99 tetraethylorthosilicate teos 97 and naoh pellets 97 were applied as a template silica precursor and alkaline environment during the synthesis of mcm 48 respectively β cyclodextrin β cd commercial polymer was used in the synthesis of the composite β cyclodextrin mcm 48 composite arsenic as v and mercury hg ii standard solutions were used to prepare the polluted aqueous solutions at controlled concentrations all the incorporated chemical compounds were delivered from sigma aldrich egypt and all of them are of analytical grades and used without further purification 2 2 synthesis of mcm 48 the synthesis procedures were performed based on the reported sol gel method by wang et al 41 the followed steps involved firstly dissolving of the surfactant 29 74 g ctab within distilled water 146 88 g after confirming the complete dissolving of the surfactant the naoh pellets 2 72 g were added to the solution to provide the alkaline media for the reactions and the total mixture stirred for an additional 15 min then 30 ml of teos was mixed with the mixture at the fixed stirring of 500 rpm for 180 min at 40 c until forming a white gel after that the produced gel was hydrothermally treated using closed systems of teflon lined stainless autoclave at 110 c after 24 h the formed solid particles were extracted from the residual solutions using a centrifuge washed carefully with distilled water as well as ethanol and dried using an electric dryer at 60 c for 8 h as a final step the mcm 48 particles were thermally treated for 6 h at 550 c to confirm the removal of the used surfactant as a template 2 3 synthesis of β cyclodextrin mcm 48 nanocomposite β cd mcm the synthesis of the composite involved two essential steps of facile mixing processes 4 firstly the produced mcm 48 particles 3 g were dispersed homogenously within distilled water 50 ml using the sonication waves for 120 min this was followed by the addition of β cyclodextrin gel 50 ml which was prepared by direct dissolving of the polymer powder within 50 ml of diluted ethanol distilled water 50 ethanol 50 the mixture was homogenized after that by stirring it at 800 rpm for 12 h under the addition effect for sonication waves 240 w finally the obtained product was filtrated from the residual solutions washed and dried for about 12 h at a constant temperature of 60 c 2 4 characterization techniques the crystalline and structural studies were completed using a panalytical x ray diffractometer empyrean to obtain the characteristic diffraction patterns of the materials at low and high angles the morphologies internal features and the integration process were followed using the sem and hrtem images of the products using a scanning electron microscope gemini zeiss ultra 55 and a transmission electron microscope jeol jem2100 respectively also the change in the characteristic chemical groups was assessed based on the ft ir spectra of the materials using an ft ir spectrometer vertex 70 2 5 adsorption studies 2 5 1 batch adsorption studies the batch uptake experiments for as v and hg ii using β cd mcm were designed

less than 5 34 for as v and 3 87 for hg ii the determination of the rest as v and hg ii metals in the treated solutions was performed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry perkin elmer after the acidification of the samples using nitric acid 2 the kinetic behaviors of β cd mcm during the uptake of as v as well as hg ii were assessed in the context of pseudo first order pf intra particle diffusion pseudo second order ps and elovich models also the isotherm properties were studied based on the commonly investigated equilibrium models of freundlich langmuir and dubinin radushkevich models the linear and nonlinear equations of the investigated kinetic and isothermal models were presented in table s1 2 5 2 fixed bed column adsorption studies the used column system to evaluate the capacity of β cd mcm as a fixed bed during the removal of both as v and hg ii composed cylinder form borosilicate 15 cm length x2 cm internal diameter and peristaltic pump to pump the contaminated solutions into the column at controlled rates the β cd mcm bed was formed by packing the composite powder between two sheets of polyethylene wool and plastic mesh as an essential step to avoid the seepage of the composite grains with the water effluents the performance of the β cd mcm bed and the efficiency of its column system were assessed by systematic detecting of the residual as

characterization 3 1 1 xrd analysis the low angle xrd patterns of both the pure phase of mcm 48 and β cd mcm composite emphasize the existence of two observable peaks these two peaks signify the characteristic 211 and 220 crystallographic planes of the mesoporous silica that is of semi crystalline properties and cubic form fig 1 a a 4 25 the reorganization of the distinguishing peaks at lower intensities and shifted diffraction positions in the obtained pattern of β cd mcm composite declared the combination between the mcm 48 and β cd polymer fig 1a b for the high angle pattern the mcm 48 as pure phase is of diffraction pattern with a broad peak around 22 5 as 2theta angle which identifies the non crystalline silica 4 fig 1b a the diffraction pattern of the integrated β cyclodextrin showed its identification peaks at 6 81 10 85 12 57 12 63 13 15 56 18 94 19 78 27 33 and 34 9 38 fig 1b b the presented pattern of β cd mcm composite showed the identification broad beak of mcm 48 silica in addition to other observable peaks related to the β cyclodextrin polymer but as shifted positions fig 1b c 3 1 2 the chemical functional groups the ft ir spectrum of mcm 48 declared the existence of silanol groups 1644 cm 1 si o si groups 796 cm 1 and 1088 cm 1 and si o bending 465 cm 1 which characterize the mesoporous silica 31 fig 2 a the spectrum of β cyclodextrin display its essential chemical groups at 3376 cm 1 oh groups 2926 cm 1 c h groups 1666 cm 1 polysaccharide cc 1636 cm 1 co bending 1158 cm 1 1482 cm 1 hyperfine c h and 1000 cm 1 1200 cm 1 co and coc stretching 38 fig 2b the ft ir spectrum of β cd mcm composite contains the identification bands of both mcm 48 and β cyclodextrin but at deviated positions for the β cyclodextrin polymer its bands in the composite were detected at 2933 cm 1 and 1636 cm 1 which signify the asymmetrical ch and co groups respectively fig 2c for mcm 48 its identification bands in the composite were detected at 1088 cm 1 801 cm 1 and 466 cm 1 that signify asymmetrical si o si symmetrical si o si and si o bending respectively fig 2c such results demonstrate the strong interaction between the functional groups of both mcm 48 and β cyclodextrin polymer fig 2c the reported disappearance for the identification bands of hyperfine c h co coc and oh demonstrate their active properties during the interaction with functional groups of mcm 48 fig 2c 3 1 3 sem and tem analyses the synthetic mcm 48 grains are of spherical to elliptical shape which commonly characterizes the mesoporous silica fig 3 a the sem of the integrated β cd mcm reflected the presence of the composite as grains of blocky and flakey shape which characterize the polymer chains of β cyclodextrin fig 3b this declared the complete coating of the mcm 48 particles with the β cyclodextrin polymer or the embedded of them completely within the matrix of the polymer chains the distinguished morphology of mcm 48 appeared clearly in the hrtem images that declared the spherical grains in well developed forms fig 3c the hrtem images emphasized the enclosing of the spherical mcm 48 grains within the matrix of the β cyclodextrin chains causing a noticeable enlargement in the particle of the composite fig 3d the enlarged particles appeared in a nearly spherical shape and of highly porous structure in different portions of them fig 3d this gives the final structure of the composite highly porous properties and multifunctional chemical groups this is of strong impact on the textural properties either on the surface area or the porosity the surface area increases slightly from 530 m2 g for mcm 48 to 544 m2 g for β cd mcm composite which might be related to the orientation of the mcm 48 grains in the spherical form of the composite the reported intersection between the β cyclodextrin chains resulted in a polymeric matrix of secondary pores which induced also the surface area the pore diameter also slightly increased from 5 36 nm for mcm 48 to and 5 52 nm for β cd mcm composite which might be related to the secondary pores of the polymer matrix 3 2 adsorption results 3 2 1 batch adsorption studies 3 2 1 1 effect of ph for the vital role of ph in directing the dominant species of the dissolved metal ions as well as the charges on the surface of the synthetic β cd mcm composite the ph effect was studied considering different values from ph 2 to ph 8 fig 4 a experimentally the controlling parameters were studied at 120 min as contact time 250 ml as the treated volume 0 1 g l of β cd mcm as dosage 20 c as temperature and metals as v and hg ii concentration of 100 mg l based on the uptake capacities the affinity of β cd mcm for the as v ions is of observable enhancement with testing the ph values from ph 2 30 8 mg g up to ph 5 62 5 mg g fig 4a for hg ii the affinity of the composite for its ions also induced by raising the ph from ph 2 21 4 mg g up to ph 6 48 4 mg g fig 4a addressing the ph effect at higher values ph 5 for as v and ph 6 for hg ii validate significant adverse effect either on the uptake of as v or hg ii ions fig 4a the previous trends for the uptake of as v as well as hg ii by β cd mcm as a function of the ph of their solutions were controlled strongly by their speciation properties and the charge of the composite for the as v it is of the neutral form h3aso4 at ph up to about ph 4 of h2aso4 form within ph range from about ph 4 to ph 7 and of haso4 2 and aso4 3 forms within ph range from ph 7 to ph 12 8 42 these speciation properties in addition to the expected increase in the surficial negative charges of β cd mcm with the continuous de protonation of its chemical groups with incrementing the values of the assessed ph explain the uptake behavior therefore ph 5 provides the satisfied numbers of the positive charges relative to the negative charges to achieve the promising electrostatic attractions with the anionic species of as v 1 beyond ph 5 the saturation of the β cd mcm with the negative charges forming strong repulsive forces between its surface and the reported species forms of as vi ions for hg ii it is of the cationic form hg 2 at the acidic environments up to ph 4 as the hydrolysis effect of its ions above ph 4 cause the formation of new species of hgoh hg oh 2 and mg oh 3 1 43 therefore the acidic environment provides competitive conditions between the hg ii ions and the hydronium ions on the surface of the protonated β cd mcm directing the ph values towards the alkaline conditions induced the formation of hgoh in addition to remaining hg 2 and the de protonation of the β cd mcm chemical groups into negatively charged sites that are of higher attractive affinity for such species of hg ii 43 this enhancement continued until ph 5 and after that the affinity of β cd mcm for hg ii ions enhanced slightly up to ph 6 and then declined significantly this related to the existence of hg ii in the hg oh 2 and hg oh 3 forms that are of weak affinities for the de protonated groups of β cd mcm 43 44 3 2 1 2 effect of contact time the influence of contact time as an essential factor to detect the equilibration intervals was studied considering different values from 30 min to 360 min fig 4b experimentally the controlling parameters were studied at ph 6 as the close value to the neutral ph 250 ml as the treated volume 0 1 g l of β cd mcm as dosage 20 c as temperature and metals as v and hg ii concentration of 100 mg l the recognized as v and hg ii adsorption curves by β cd mcm with time emphasize the presence of two different segments for two different adsorption rates fig 4b the curves started by segments of very fast and abrupt as v and hg ii uptake rates of strong changes in the value of their adoption capacities by β cd mcm fig 4b by the ending of the curves the second segments were identified as plateau portions of the curves that are of slight or neglected changes in the experimental as v and hg ii uptake rates of nearly fixed capacities and these segments categorize the equilibration intervals fig 4b for as v the first segment was detected from 30 min to 180 min and the second segment covered the experimental intervals from 180 min to 360 min fig 4b the detected equilibrium as v uptake capacity by β cd mcm after attending its equilibration interval is 67 mg g the hg ii uptake curve shows the first segment within the period from 30 min to 240 min and the second segment equilibration segment cover the experimental interval from 240 min up to 360 min fig 4b the achieved hg ii uptake capacity after the complete equilibration stage is 63 mg g such segmental features were reported widely for several adsorption systems as a common phenomenon controlled with the availability of the free β cd mcm active receptors 4 the availability of the free β cd mcm active receptors provides numerous sites for effective capturing of as v and hg ii ions causing abrupt changes in their actual uptake capacities by β cd mcm 30 the continuous occupation of these free sites with the as v and hg ii ions reduce the number of them capturing centers which resulted in slight changes in their uptake rates 3 2 1 3 effect of β cd mcm dosage promoting the as v and hg ii removal efficiency as a function of the applied β cd mcm dosage was followed for experimental dosages from 0 1 g l to 0 6 g l fig 4c and d experimentally the controlling parameters were studied at ph 6 as the close value to the neutral ph 250 ml as the treated volume 360 min as contact time 20 c as temperature and four metals as v and hg ii concentration 25 mg l 50 mg l 75 mg l and 100 mg l as can be concluded from the curves using the β cd mcm at high dosages induced the as v and hg ii removal percentages strongly until achieving the complete removal of them considering their concentrations fig 4c and d for as v the used β cd mcm can achieve complete adsorption for 25 mg l and 50 mg l using 0 3 g l and 0 5 g l of it as dosages respectively fig 4c for the studied as v concentrations of 75 mg l and 100 mg l the composite archived removal percentages of 73 4 0 5 g l and 65 9 0 5 g l respectively fig 4c regarding the removal of hg ii ions using the β cd mcm composite at dosage of 0 5 g l resulted in 100 90 4 68 7 and 60 5 for the studied concentrations of 25 mg l 50 mg l 75 mg l and 100 mg l respectively fig 4d the general trends reflected possible enhancement in the removal percentages of both as v and hg ii ions with using higher dosages of β cd mcm beyond 0 5 g l this declared the role of the high dosages in the increment in the interaction chances with the β cd mcm particles and the number of its exposed active sites on the β cd mcm which induced the capturing efficiency of as v and hg ii ions 29 3 2 1 4 effect of as v and hg ii concentrations the experimental assessment for the adsorption capacities of β cd mcm at different as v and hg ii concentrations was performed to detect its maximum capacities for these metal ions as well as the equilibrium properties 38 the influence of as v and hg ii concentrations was followed from 100 mg l to 400 mg l and the other factors were studied at ph 6 250 ml as the treated volume 360 min as contact time 20 c as temperature and 0 1 g l as β cd mcm dosage fig 4e based on the as v and hg ii uptake results the experimental capacities of β cd mcm for these metal ions induced strongly with testing higher concentrations of them this adsorption phenomenon was explained in literature as a result of the strong intensification in the as v and hg ii driving forces as dissolving ions with testing them at high concentrations 1 this is of significant impact on enhancing the interaction chances with the capturing active sites of β cd mcm which upgrade its uptake capacities this enhancement was observed within the studied concentration range from 25 mg l up to 300 mg l for both as v and hg ii ions fig 4e beyond the studied concentrations of 300 mg l for as v and hg ii the curves emphasize equilibration or saturation stage in which the β cd mcm composite achieved its maximum capacity 246 3 mg g for as v and 173 4 mg g for hg ii fig 4e 3 2 1 5 kinetic and equilibrium studies 3 2 1 5 1 kinetic studies the kinetic behavior of β cd mcm during the adsorption of as v and hg ii ions was explained based on the assumption of intra particle diffusion pseudo first order p f pseudo second order p s and elovich models el table s1 for the intra particle diffusion curves of as v and hg ii they are of segmental properties that commonly identify the adsorption system that is of different uptake mechanisms in addition to the diffusion of these ions towards the β cd mcm 30 fig 4f the observation of the first segment during the initial periods of the experiments and dominance of it as the main portion of the curve emphasized the role of the surface adsorption reactions in controlling the efficiency of β cd mcm 1 fig 4f after that a new segment was detected which appear as an intermediate stage of the assistant mechanism fig 4f the uptake mechanisms that characterize this segment are types of layered adsorption and their formation related to the complete occupation of the external sites of β cd mcm with the as v and hg ii ions 4 45 this followed by another segment of plateau shape and covers the equilibrium periods for the capturing of both as v and hg ii ions fig 4f the formation of this segment suggests the existence of the thick layers from the adsorbed as v and hg ii ions on the surface of β cd mcm which might be captured by interionic attraction processes and or types of molecular association mechanisms 45 considering the fitting degrees chi squared χ2 and the determination coefficient r2 of as v and hg ii adsorption results with the assumptions of both p f fig 4g and p s fig 4h kinetic models the uptake systems of these ions by β cd mcm is of pseudo first order kinetic behaviour table 1 fig 4g this suggested the dominance of the physical reactions during the uptake of as v as well as hg ii by β cd mcm 26 46 the detected very good agreement with the p s model suggested considerable effect from some chemical process that might be included electron exchange ion exchange process surface complexation and electron sharing 30 34 also the resulted in significant agreement with the elovich model demonstrates the energetic heterogeneous properties of β cd mcm as an adsorbent for as v and hg ii ions 34 table 1 fig 4i 3 2 1 5 2 equilibrium studies the equilibrium properties of β cd mcm during the adsorption of as v and hg ii ions were assessed by fitting their results with nonlinear equations table s1 of langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich d r as isotherm models the langmuir assumption is of significant indications to elucidate the adsorption systems that are of monolayer properties and the adsorption reaction occur homogenously by the free active sites within the adsorbent 47 chaudhry et al 2016 abukhadra and mostafa 2019 however the hypothesis of the assessed freundlich model involved heterogeneous uptake of dissolved ions by the addressed adsorbent in multilayer forms 47 48 the estimated chi squared x2 and determination coefficients r2 as the essential fitting factors declared the uptake of both as v fig 4j and hg ii fig 4k by β cd mcm according to the langmuir equilibrium behaviour table 1 therefore the capturing of the as v and hg ii occurred homogenously by active sites of β cd mcm in monolayer form 47 moreover determining the rl parameter at values lower than 1 reflects the favourable adsorption behaviours of as v and hg ii ions by β cd mcm composite table 1 the expected maximum capacities of β cd mcm as an adsorbent for as v and hg ii ions were obtained as fitting parameters for the langmuir model and the values are 265 6 mg g and 207 9 mg g respectively table 1 the fitting parameters of the dubinin radushkevich d r model especially the gaussian energies give information about the nature of the as v fig 4j and hg ii fig 4k adsorption reactions the estimated value for as v and hg ii ions are 6 45 kj mol and 3 95 kj mol respectively which are within the suggested limits for the physical reactions less than 8 kj mol 1 table 1 3 2 1 6 thermodynamic properties the thermodynamic studies were completed within an adjusted temperature range from 20 c as lower level up to 50 c as the upper level and the other factors were studied at ph 6 250 ml as the treated volume 360 min as contact time 100 mg l as concentration and 0 1 g l as β cd mcm dosage the three parameters which were used to describe the thermodynamic behavior of the as v and hg ii adsorption reactions by β cd mcm are gibbs free energy δg which was estimated from eq 7 in addition to the enthalpy δh and the entropy δs which were obtained as parameters for the performed fitting processes with the van t hof equation eq 8 fig 4l 47 7 δ g 0 r t i n k c 8 i n k c δ s o r δ h o r t calculating the δgo as negative values for the as v and hg ii uptake reactions by β cd mcm emphasizes the spontaneous and favorable properties of these reactions table 1 1 the negative signs of the appraised δh values demonstrate the exothermic properties for the uptake of both as v and hg ii ions table 1 the δs values that are of positive signs for both as v and hg ii emphasized significant augmentation in the randomness of their adsorption reactions by β cd mcm with conducting the tests at high temperature table 1 1 the values of δgo within the studied temperature range in addition to the values δh for both as v and hg ii ions related to physical adsorption reactions 3 2 1 7 effect of competitive ions the affinities of the β cd mcm composite were investigated in the existence of other anions po4 3 nitrate no3 carbonate co3 2 and sulfate so4 2 and metal ions cadmium cd ii zinc zn ii lead pb ii and cobalt co ii as competitive ions that can be detected in the wastewater fig 5 the influence of such coexisting ions was studied considering the reaction factors at ph 6 250 ml as the treated volume 360 min as contact time 20 c as temperature and 50 mg l as concentration 50 for the studied metal 50 for the coexisting ions for all the studied anions there were no strong impacts on the affinities of β cd mcm for the as v as well as the hg ii ions fig 5a however the existence of phosphate and carbonate ions appeared to be of remarkable competitive effect during the adsorption of the metals especially the as v ions by β cd mcm fig 5a this behavior was assigned to the high similarity between the phosphate ions and the as v ions in their physiochemical properties so it is of combative properties on the active adsorption sites 10 also the ability of the phosphate ions to form inner complexes with the hydroxyl groups of mcm 48 as well as the integrated β cd polymer and thereby shows strong competitive properties with the metal ions 42 for the competitive effect of carbonate co3 2 with as v ions might be related to the similarity between them in their molecular structure 42 the observed very low competitive effect for nitrate no3 and sulfate so4 2 ions might be related to their affinities to form outer sphere complexes rather than the inner sphere complex that create by the metal ion and of significant stability 42 for the addressed coexisting metal ions the pb ii and cd ii ions are of very strong negative effect on the adsorption of both as v and hg ii ions but appeared to be of higher competitive impact on the uptake of hg ii fig 5b the presence of zn ii and co ii also is of significant competitive effect during the adsorption processes but the β cd mcm still of higher affinities for the as v and the hg ii ions for the as v ions the coexisting of cd ii zn ii pb ii and co ii reduced the removal of it by β cd mcm from 100 to 47 6 76 7 36 8 and 80 4 respectively fig 5b for hg ii ions the removal percentages declined from 90 4 to 38 5 67 4 24 6 and 70 2 in the coexisting of cd ii zn ii pb ii and co ii respectively fig 5b however the existence of the previous metals is of strong adverse effect on the as v and hg ii uptake by β cd mcm the recognized removal percentages reflected promising value for the product to be used in realistic remediation processes considering the assessed concentrations 50 mg l 3 2 1 8 recyclability the recyclability and the reusing properties of β cd mcm as an adsorbent for both as v and hg ii were assessed to investigate the qualification of the product for the commercial scale applications the regeneration of the β cd mcm particles involved washing them with diluted naoh solution for about 120 min at about 50 c then the regenerated particles of β cd mcm were washed with distilled water extensively and dried at an adjusted temperature of 60 c for 10 h the regenerated particles were applied in five adsorption reusing tests for both as v and hg ii ions considering the experimental conditions at 360 min as contact time 50 mg l as concentration ph 6 250 ml as tested volume 20 c as temperature and 0 5 g l as dosage fig s1 based on the results the synthetic β cd mcm is of noticeable recyclability and promising reusability as an adsorbent for as v and hg ii ions considering the investigated five runs fig s1 for the removal of as v the obtained decontamination percentages are 100 for two reusing runs higher than 95 for four reusing runs and higher than 93 for the five reusing runs fig s1 for the recyclability of β cd mcm in the decontamination of hg ii ions its declination percentages exceed 89 for two reusing runs 83 for four reusing runs and 78 for the five reusing runs fig s1 the observable diminishing in the β cd mcm removal efficiency for as v and hg ii ions after certain reusing runs is assigned to the predicted formation of complexes between the active structural groups of β cd mcm as receptor sites and the adsorbed as v and hg ii ions which declines the availability of these free sites with repeating the runs 3 2 2 fixed bed adsorption studies 3 2 2 1 influence of the essential parameters 3 2 2 1 1 influence of bed height the controlling effect of the β cd mcm thickness as a fixed bed in continuous column system was followed from 1 cm to 5 cm considering the other factors at 5 ml min as flow rate ph 6 and 25 mg l as concentration for total flow interval of 1620 min fig 6 a and b using the β cd mcm bed at higher thickness is of significant impact in inducing the breakthrough as well as the saturation intervals of the columns during the adsorption of as v and hg i ions which enhanced greatly their lifetimes fig 6a and b table 2 for the investigated column in the removal of as v the breakthrough and saturation intervals expanded from 720 min and 1140 min using β cd mcm of 1 cm thickness to 1200 min and more than1620 min after upgrading the bed thickness to 5 cm fig 6a and b table 2 for hg ii ions the breakthrough and saturation intervals expanded from 660 min and 1140 min to 1080 min and 1620 min respectively with upgrading the bed thickness from 1 cm to 5 cm fig 6a and b table 2 additionally the performances of the columns showed significant enhancement in their performances with testing the β cd mcm bed at a high thickness from 1 cm to 5 cm during the removal of both as v and hg ii ions fig 6a and b table 2 using the β cd mcm bed at 5 cm thickness at the best thickness resulted in as v total removal percentage r of 72 8 considering the treated volume exceed 8 1 l fig 6a and b table 2 this value was achieved considering the values of the other mathematical parameters of 2835 mg m total as the total pumped as v ions in the column 2062 9 mg q total as total adsorbed as v in the bed 569 1 mg l as the equilibrium capacity of the bed cad and 171 9 mg g qeq as the maximum as v adsorption capacity of β cd mcm particles in the bed fig 6a and b table 2 at the same conditions the hg ii ions achieved total removal r of 60 4 considering for treated volume of 8 1 l also the mathematic parameters declared 2835 mg m total as the total pumped hg ii ions in the column 1712 3 mg q total as total adsorbed hg ii in the bed 515 13 mg l as the equilibrium capacity of the bed cad and 142 7 mg g qeq as the maximum as v adsorption capacity of β cd mcm particles in the bed fig 6a and b table 2 such enhancement in the lifetimes as well as the performances of the two columns for the uptake of both as v and hg ii ions related essentially to the reduction in the axial dispersion of the mass transfer that is of strong influence in prompting the diffusion rates of these as v and hg ii ions within the particles of the β cd mcm bed 49 moreover the high thickness of the β cd mcm bed provides a high residence interval for the as v and hg ii ions to be in contact with the receptors of the β cd mcm particles which enhance their uptake within the bed of the column 50 3 2 2 1 2 influence of flow rate the influence of the flow rates was studied to investigate the possibility of the β cd mcm bed to achieve promising results for higher volumes of the polluted water the influence of the flow rate was studied with experimental values from 5 ml min to 25 ml min and certain values for the other factors ph 8 1620 in as total flow time 25 mg l concentration and 5 cm as thickness for the β cd mcm bed fig 6c and d table 2 generally pumping the as v and hg ii polluted solutions at high flow rates is of adverse effect in the lifetimes as well as the performances of the used β cd mcm columns fig 6c and d table 2 the breakthrough intervals for as v declined strongly from 1200 min to 600 min and the exhausted interval declined from more than 1620 min to 1020 min with increasing the flow rates from 5 ml min to 25 ml min fig 6c and d table 2 also the recognized breakthrough time intervals for the adsorption of hg ii ions declined from 1080 min to 660 min and the exhausted time reduced also from 1620 min to 960 min with inducing the flow rate from 5 ml min to 25 ml min fig 6c and d table 2 moreover the total removal percentages declined strongly from 72 8 as v and 60 4 hg ii to 23 5 as v and 22 8 hg ii after accelerating the flow rate from 5 ml min to 25 ml min moreover the adsorption capacity of the β cd mcm bed cad declined strongly from 569 mg l to 314 mg l for as v and from 515 mg l to 310 5 mg l for hg ii ions with increasing the studied flow rates from 5 ml min to 25 ml min fig 6c and d table 2 such declination in both the lifetimes and the performances of the columns with testing the higher flow rates was assigned to the effect of the higher flow rates in reducing the required residence time to achieve the best interaction between the dissolved ions and the active sites of the β cd mcm particles 50 moreover pumping the polluted solutions at high flow rates cause a significant increase in the quantities of the delivered metal ions into the β cd mcm bed which resulted in very fast saturation of the composite particles with captured as v and hg ii ions 51 52 3 2 2 2 dynamic properties of the β cd mcm column system the dynamic properties of the designed continuous columns based on the β cd mcm bed for the adsorption of as v and hg ii ions were assessed considering the assumptions of thomas adams bohart and yoon nelson kinetic models the adam bohart as well as the yoon nelson models are effective to predict the breakthrough activities of the beds and their affinities for the as v and hg ii ions at the initial intervals of the adsorption processes 49 53 the mathematical parameters which can be delivered from these models are of strong scientific contribution in detecting the actual performances of the β cd mcm bed as a function of the saturation concentrations the capacity of β cd mcm bed and the flow interval for 50 of the breakthrough value 54 this was performed by the linear regression fitting of the obtained as v and hg ii adsorption data by the β cd mcm bed with the three models thomas eq 9 adams bohart eq 10 and yoon nelson eq 11 fig 7 9 ln c o c t 1 k t h q 0 m f k t h c o t 10 ln c t c o k a b c o t k a b n o z u o 11 ln c t c o c t k y n t τ k y n 3 2 2 2 1 thomas model according to this model the capturing of the as v and hg ii ions within the β cd mcm bed follow the second order kinetic and the langmuir equilibrium behaviour additionally the occurred reactions are of reversible properties and of no controlled effect for the dispersion axial as well as the diffusion of the dissolved as v and hg ii ions 51 55 the fitting results demonstrate strong agreement between the as v and hg ii adsorption behaviour within the β cd mcm bed and the properties of the thomas model considering the influence of both the bed thickness and the flow rate fig 7a b c and d table 3 the mathematical parameters of this model declared diminishing in the equilibrium capacities of the β cd mcm beds with upgrading their thickness from 1 cm to 5 cm either in the case of as v ions or the hg ii ions table 3 on the other hand accelerating the flow rates of the pumped influents is of strong influence in increasing the equilibrium capacities of the β cd mcm bed from 5 ml min to 25 ml min table 3 this is of strong agreement with the obtained experimental behaviours that reflected the strong effect of delivering the polluted solutions at a high rate inducing the quantities of the adsorbed ions in the bed 3 2 2 2 2 adams bohart model this kinetic assumption is of valuable contribution in describing the transport properties of the as v and hg ii ions within the studied β cd mcm beds according to the kinetic properties of this model the used β cd mcm beds are of constant uptake capacities for as v and hg ii ions and the occurred reactions are of stepping isotherm behaviours 56 the recognized as v and hg ii removal results using the β cd mcm beds emphasize significant agreement with the dynamic properties of the adams bohart model either with testing the beds at different thicknesses or with pumping the polluted influents at different flow rates fig 7e f g and h table 3 based on the fitting parameters the required concentrations of as v and hg ii ions to attend the saturation no of the β cd mcm beds are of systemic declination with upgrading the thickness of the incorporated bed and of considerable intensification with accelerating the flow rates of the polluted influents table 3 3 2 2 2 3 yoon nelson model this model is valuable in predicting the required time to recognize the saturation stages of the β cd mcm beds during the uptake of as v and hg ii ions as well as the adsorption reactions considering their concentrations as certain values abukhadra et al 2020 the breakthrough data for as v as well as hg ii ions are of highly fitting properties with the dynamic properties of the yoon nelson model fig 7i j k and l table 3 considering the theoretical parameters the β cd mcm bed can attend 50 of its saturation capacity for the as v ions after 872 7 min 986 9 min 1190 1 min 1315 5 min and 1407 5 min with testing the β cd mcm bed at an adjusted thickness of 1 cm 2 cm 3 cm 4 cm and 5 cm respectively table 3 for the hg ii ions the obtained intervals are 807 7 min 1 cm 952 9 min 2 cm 1040 2 min 3 cm 1177 9 min 4 cm and 1268 7 min 5 cm table 3 such increment in the required intervals to attend the saturation points with testing the higher thicknesses of the β cd mcm bed declared significant effect for the bed height in inducing the lifetimes of the columns the recognized values 50 saturation with accelerating the flow speed of the as v and hg ii bearing influents emphasized negative impacts on the lifetimes of the cd mcm beds during the adsorption of as v as well as hg ii ions table 3 therefore the successful adjusting of the cd mcm bed at the suitable thickness and the flow speed at the satisfy speed for promising contact between the ions and the bed can induce the decontamination efficiency for high volumes of the polluted water and for long lifetimes 3 2 3 suggested mechanism the introduced adsorbent is a heterogeneous structure from mesoporous silica mcm 48 as substrate and β cyclodextrin as integrated polymer therefore the adsorbent is of multifunctional active sites related to both organic and inorganic chemical functional groups that are of controlling effect during the adsorption of both as v and hg ii ions the used mesoporous silica mcm 48 exhibits highly active oh bearing groups especially the structural silanol groups the negative charges of these groups make them effective centers for the electrostatic attraction processes with the dissolved as v ad hg ii ions 57 additionally these groups are of effective role in forming complexes with the metal ions especially the as v ions 11 it was reported that the as v ions are of ligand exchange properties with the oh bearing groups which resulted in the formation of monodentate and or bidentate complexes 42 for the integrated β cyclodextrin polymer the role of the electrostatic attraction between its charged organic chemical groups and the studied metals also is of strong role in the uptake mechanism additionally the carboxylic groups of the polymer chains were identified as basic centers for the formation of complexes with both as v and hg ii ions by the covalent bond complexation process 58 3 2 4 comparison study the capacities of β cd mcm as an adsorbent for as v and hg ii ions were compared with recognized capacities for different synthetic adsorbents in literature and presented in table 4 the β cd mcm composite is of higher capacities for as v and hg ii ions than several metal oxide based composites modified carbon nanotubes silica based composites graphene oxide and it is modified products some bio adsorbents diatomite chitosan and modified bentonite this demonstrates the promising properties of the prepared β cd mcm as a multifunctional and eco friendly adsorbent that can achieve better results in the removal of as v and hg ii ions than several studied adsorbents considering the preparation cost and the recyclability properties of the adsorbent the prepared composite is of relatively low cost as compared to most of the presented adsorbents considering the applicability of the adsorbent to be prepared from different silica bearing solid wastes and natural resources moreover the high capacities of the composite for as v and hg ii reflects the possible incorporation of the composite at very low dosages which can save huge quantities and in turn is of strong reduction for the remedition cost 4 conclusion b cyclodextrin mcm 48 hybrid composite β cd mcm was synthesized and characterized as enhanced adsorbent for as v and hg ii ions in batch and fixed bed column studies it achieved adsorption capacities of 265 6 mg g and 207 9 mg g for as v and hg ii ions respectively which are higher than several studied adsorbents the β cd mcm composite is of considerable affinities for as v and hg ii ions even in the existence of coexisting dissolved chemical anions or heavy metal ions the uptake of as v as well as hg ii follows pseudo first order kinetic behavior and langmuir equilibrium properties the gaussian energies of as v and hg ii are 6 45 kj mol and 3 95 kj mol respectively that related to the physical reactions that are of spontaneous favorable and exothermic properties the synthetic β cd mcm as fixed bed achieved decontamination percentages of 72 8 and 60 4 for as v and hg ii respectively for 8 1 l of polluted water considering the operating conditions at 5 cm bed thickness 5 ml min flow rate 25 mg l concentration and ph 6 such results declared the promising capacities to be applied in effective remediation process for as v and hg ii ions from waste water by batch or by fixed bed column processes declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest

synthetic β cd mcm composite is of promising adsorption properties to be applied in the decontamination of as v and hg ii ions either in batch studies or fixed bed column studies keywords mcm 48 β cyclodextrin composite arsenic mercury adsorption mechanism 1 introduction the existence of several species of toxic metal ions in the freshwater resources under the continuous development of industrial metallurgical and mining activities have become critical issues for the safety of humanity 1 2 generally these elements are toxic carcinogenic and hazardous on humans animals and aquatic organisms especially with the continuous accumulation of them in the tissues of the living organisms 3 4 among the toxic metal ions arsenic as and mercury hg were categorized as highly toxic metal pollutants 5 6 the arsenic ions in their inorganic form were identified as two species trivalent form as iii and pentavalent form as v 7 the arsenic pollutants in the drinking water is a curse for about 200 million person in the world and an indicator for the dangerous in the coming future especially in the asian countries 8 the existence of the as v ions in the water supplies above acceptable levels 10 μg l has carcinogenic effect on the urinary bladder skin kidney and lungs 9 10 additionally other diseases were reported as results for as v contaminants such as cardiovascular disease vomiting abdominal pain esophageal bloody diarrhea and diabetes 1 11 there are several countries suffer from the contamination of the water by the arsenic ions at high concentrations including bangladesh nepal argentina china mexico vietnam poland india pakistan hungary and usa 8 10 also the hg ii element was categorized as one of the third most toxic elements and it has hazardous impacts on the eyes kidneys skin lungs digestive system nervous system and immune system 12 13 therefore the concentrations of hg ii in surface water and drinking water were recommended to be below 10 μg l and 1 μ l respectively 14 15 for the previously reported hazardous and toxic impacts different techniques were suggested to control the concentrations of such metals in the water supplies including biological remediation ion exchange purification membrane filtration chemical precipitation and adsorption 12 16 17 the decontamination processes based on the adsorption techniques were recommended strongly for their simplicity low cost rapid equilibrium recyclability and controlled affinity abukhadra et al 2021 the recently studied adsorbents of as v involved zno zeolite 15 co zn zif 18 multi walled carbon nanotubes 19 fe biochar 9 iron oxyhydroxide 16 goethite 20 and activated carbon 7 for the hg ii ions the recently reported adsorbents involved zns zeolite naa 14 activated coke 21 porous sulfur copolymers 22 graphene oxide nanoribbons 23 boehmite fe3o4 pla sio2 24 and bentonite composite 25 the excellent adsorption capacity fast uptake kinetics the simple synthesis methods and the low production cost are the essential factors that qualify the adsorbents of the wide scale applications 10 26 27 therefore the production of new types of adsorbents which are of simple synthesis techniques and significant uptake capacities is the main target of the authors in the later periods 28 30 the ordered nanoporous silica of mcm type as mcm 41 and mcm 48 were studied in the later periods as innovative structures of promising adsorption capacities for different pollutants 4 31 the mcm forms of porous silica are of promising reactive surface and functional silanol functional groups very high surface area highly oriented porous morphology and high thermal stability 32 33 the mcm 48 species was recommended strongly to be applied in the retention of the metal ions or the uptake of the other types of water contaminants 4 the amazing structure of mcm 48 that composed of continuous interwoven and branched highly porous silica is of strong effect in inducing the mass transfer kinetics of the adsorption reactions 33 the morphological and physicochemical properties of mcm 48 qualifies it to be a promising carrier for different species of biopolymers which resulted finally in motivated composites or hybrid structures of multifunctional active groups biodegradable properties ecofriendly and safe features highly reactive surface and excellent uptake capacities 4 34 β cyclodextrin is a common and promising biopolymer that was addressed in different adsorption studies for the organic as well as the inorganic water contaminants 4 35 36 structurally the β cyclodextrin polymer is of torus like units from cyclic oligosaccharide which composed of glucose subunits 7 subunits that connect with each other by α 1 4 glucose bonds 37 39 the recognized hydrophilic and lipophilic properties of the surface and cavities of β cyclodextrin respectively prompt the affinity of its polymer chains to create different chemical complexes with various species of inorganic and organic ions 38 40 the adsorption properties of the hybrid β cyclodextrin mcm 48 structure β cd mcm as potential adsorbent for effective and environmental decontamination of arsenic as v and mercury hg ii ions have not been assessed previously therefore the demonstrated study involved the synthesis of β cd mcm as an adsorbent for both as v and hg ii ions the adsorption properties

a white gel after that the produced gel was hydrothermally treated using closed systems of teflon lined stainless autoclave at 110 c after 24 h the formed solid particles were extracted from the residual solutions using a centrifuge washed carefully with distilled water as well as ethanol and dried using an electric dryer at 60 c for 8 h as a final step the mcm 48 particles were thermally treated for 6 h at 550 c to confirm the removal of the used surfactant as a template 2 3 synthesis of β cyclodextrin mcm 48 nanocomposite β cd mcm the synthesis of the composite involved two essential

intensities and shifted diffraction positions in the obtained pattern of β cd mcm composite declared the combination between the mcm 48 and β cd polymer fig 1a b for the high angle pattern the mcm 48 as pure phase is of diffraction pattern with a broad peak around 22 5 as 2theta angle which identifies the non crystalline silica 4 fig 1b a the diffraction pattern of the integrated β cyclodextrin showed its identification peaks at 6 81 10 85 12 57 12 63 13 15 56 18 94 19 78 27 33 and 34 9 38 fig 1b b the presented pattern of β cd mcm composite showed the identification broad beak of mcm 48 silica in addition to other observable peaks related to the β cyclodextrin polymer but as shifted positions fig 1b c 3 1 2 the chemical functional groups the ft ir spectrum of mcm 48 declared the existence of silanol groups 1644 cm 1 si o si groups 796 cm 1 and 1088 cm 1 and si o bending 465 cm 1 which characterize the mesoporous silica 31 fig 2 a the spectrum of β cyclodextrin display its essential chemical groups at 3376 cm 1 oh groups 2926 cm 1 c h groups 1666 cm 1 polysaccharide cc 1636 cm 1 co bending 1158 cm 1 1482 cm 1 hyperfine c h and 1000 cm 1 1200 cm 1 co and coc stretching 38 fig 2b the ft ir spectrum of β cd mcm composite contains the identification bands of both mcm 48 and β cyclodextrin but at deviated positions for the β cyclodextrin polymer its bands in the composite were detected at 2933 cm 1 and 1636 cm 1 which signify the asymmetrical ch and co groups respectively fig 2c for mcm 48 its identification bands in the composite were detected at 1088 cm 1 801 cm 1 and 466 cm 1 that signify asymmetrical si o si symmetrical si o si and si o bending respectively fig 2c such results demonstrate the strong interaction between the functional groups of both mcm 48 and β cyclodextrin polymer fig 2c the reported disappearance for the identification bands of hyperfine c h co coc and oh demonstrate their active properties during the interaction with functional groups of mcm 48 fig 2c 3 1 3 sem and tem analyses the synthetic mcm 48 grains are of spherical to elliptical shape which commonly characterizes the mesoporous silica fig 3 a the sem of the integrated β cd mcm reflected the presence of the composite as grains of blocky and flakey shape which characterize the polymer chains of β cyclodextrin fig 3b this declared the complete coating of the mcm 48 particles with the β cyclodextrin polymer or the embedded of them completely within the matrix of the polymer chains the distinguished morphology of mcm 48 appeared clearly in the hrtem images that declared the spherical grains in well developed forms fig 3c the hrtem images emphasized the enclosing of the spherical mcm 48 grains within the matrix of the β cyclodextrin chains causing a noticeable enlargement in the particle of the composite fig 3d the enlarged particles appeared in a nearly spherical shape and of highly porous structure in different portions of them fig 3d this gives the final structure of the composite highly porous properties and multifunctional chemical groups this is of strong impact on the textural properties either on the surface area or the porosity the surface area increases slightly from 530 m2 g for mcm 48 to 544 m2 g for β cd mcm composite which might be related to the orientation of the mcm 48 grains in the spherical form of the composite the reported intersection between the β cyclodextrin chains resulted in a polymeric matrix of secondary pores which induced also the surface area the pore diameter also slightly increased from 5 36 nm for mcm 48 to and 5 52 nm for β cd mcm composite which might be related to the secondary pores of the polymer matrix 3 2 adsorption results 3 2 1 batch adsorption studies 3 2 1 1 effect of ph for the vital role of ph in directing the dominant species of the dissolved metal ions as well as the charges on the surface of the synthetic β cd mcm composite the ph effect was studied considering different values from ph 2 to ph 8 fig 4 a experimentally the controlling parameters were studied at 120 min as contact time 250 ml as the treated volume 0 1 g l of β cd mcm as dosage 20 c as temperature and metals as v and hg ii concentration of 100 mg l based on the uptake capacities the affinity of β cd mcm for the as v ions is of observable enhancement with testing the ph values from ph 2 30 8 mg g up to ph 5 62 5 mg g fig 4a for hg ii the affinity of the composite for its ions also induced by raising the ph from ph 2 21 4 mg g up to ph 6 48 4 mg g fig 4a addressing the ph effect at higher values ph 5 for as v and ph 6 for hg ii validate significant adverse effect either on the uptake of as v or hg ii ions fig 4a the previous trends for the uptake of as v as well as hg ii by β cd mcm as a function of the ph of their solutions were controlled strongly by their speciation properties and the charge of the composite for the as v it is of the neutral form h3aso4 at ph up to about ph 4 of h2aso4 form within ph range from about ph 4 to ph 7 and of haso4 2 and aso4 3 forms within ph range from ph 7 to ph 12 8 42 these speciation properties in addition to the expected increase in the surficial negative charges of β cd mcm with the continuous de protonation of its chemical groups with incrementing the values of the assessed ph explain the uptake behavior therefore ph 5 provides the satisfied numbers of the positive charges relative to the negative charges to achieve the promising electrostatic attractions with the anionic species of as v 1 beyond ph 5 the saturation of the β cd mcm with the negative charges forming strong repulsive forces between its surface and the reported species forms of as vi ions for hg ii it is of the cationic form hg 2 at the acidic environments up to ph 4 as the hydrolysis effect of its ions above ph 4 cause the formation of new species of hgoh hg oh 2 and mg oh 3 1 43 therefore the acidic environment provides competitive conditions between the hg ii ions and the hydronium ions on the surface of the protonated β cd mcm directing the ph values towards the alkaline conditions induced the formation of hgoh in addition to remaining hg 2 and the de protonation of the β cd mcm chemical groups into negatively charged sites that are of higher attractive affinity for such species of hg ii 43 this enhancement continued until ph 5 and after that the affinity of β cd mcm for hg ii ions enhanced slightly up to ph 6 and then declined significantly this related to the existence of hg ii in the hg oh 2 and hg oh 3 forms that are of weak affinities for the de protonated groups of β cd mcm 43 44 3 2 1 2 effect of contact time the influence of contact time as an essential factor to detect the equilibration intervals was studied considering different values from 30 min to 360 min fig 4b experimentally the controlling parameters were studied at ph 6 as the close value to the neutral ph 250 ml as the treated volume 0 1 g l of β cd mcm as dosage 20 c as temperature and metals as v and hg ii concentration of 100 mg l the recognized as v and hg ii adsorption curves by β cd mcm with time emphasize the presence of two different segments for two different adsorption rates fig 4b the curves started by segments of very fast and abrupt as v and hg ii uptake rates of strong changes in the value of their adoption capacities by β cd mcm fig 4b by the ending of the curves the second segments were identified as plateau portions of the curves that are of slight or neglected changes in the experimental as v and hg ii uptake rates of nearly fixed capacities and these segments categorize the equilibration intervals fig 4b for as v the first segment was detected from 30 min to 180 min and the second segment covered the experimental intervals from 180 min to 360 min fig 4b the detected equilibrium as v uptake capacity by β cd mcm after attending its equilibration interval is 67 mg g the hg ii uptake curve shows the first segment within the period from 30 min to 240 min and the second segment equilibration segment cover the experimental interval from 240 min up to 360 min fig 4b the achieved hg ii uptake capacity after the complete equilibration stage is 63 mg g such segmental features were reported widely for several adsorption systems as a common phenomenon controlled with the availability of the free β cd mcm active receptors 4 the availability of the free β cd mcm active receptors provides numerous sites for effective capturing of as v and hg ii ions causing abrupt changes in their actual uptake capacities by β cd mcm 30 the continuous occupation of these free sites with the as v and hg ii ions reduce the number of them capturing centers which resulted in slight changes in their uptake rates 3 2 1 3 effect of β cd mcm dosage promoting the as v and hg ii removal efficiency as a function of the applied β cd mcm dosage was followed for experimental dosages from 0 1 g l to 0 6 g l fig 4c and d experimentally the controlling parameters were studied at ph 6 as the close value to the neutral ph 250 ml as the treated volume 360 min as contact time 20 c as temperature and four metals as v and hg ii concentration 25 mg l 50 mg l 75 mg l and 100 mg l as can be concluded from the curves using the β cd mcm at high dosages induced the as v and hg ii removal percentages strongly until achieving the complete removal of them considering their concentrations fig 4c and d for as v the used β cd mcm can achieve complete adsorption for 25 mg l and 50 mg l using 0 3 g l and 0 5 g l of it as dosages respectively fig 4c for the studied as v concentrations of 75 mg l and 100 mg l the composite archived removal percentages of 73 4 0 5 g l and 65 9 0 5 g l respectively fig 4c regarding the removal of hg ii ions using the β cd mcm composite at dosage of 0 5 g l resulted in 100 90 4 68 7 and 60 5 for the studied concentrations of 25 mg l 50 mg l 75 mg l and 100 mg l respectively fig 4d the general trends reflected possible enhancement in the removal percentages of both as v and hg ii ions with using higher dosages of β cd mcm beyond 0 5 g l this declared the role of the high dosages in the increment in the interaction chances with the β cd mcm particles and the number of its exposed active sites on the β cd mcm which induced the capturing efficiency of as v and hg ii ions 29 3 2 1 4 effect of as v and hg ii concentrations the experimental assessment for the adsorption capacities of β cd mcm at different as v and hg ii concentrations was performed to detect its maximum capacities for these metal ions as well as the equilibrium properties 38 the influence of as v and hg ii concentrations was followed from 100 mg l to 400 mg l and the other factors were studied at ph 6 250 ml as the treated volume 360 min as contact time 20 c as temperature and 0 1 g l as β cd mcm dosage fig 4e based on the as v and hg ii uptake results the experimental capacities of β cd mcm for these metal ions induced strongly with testing higher concentrations of them this adsorption phenomenon was explained in literature as a result of the strong intensification in the as v and hg ii driving forces as dissolving ions with testing them at high concentrations 1 this is of significant impact on enhancing the interaction chances with the capturing active sites of β cd mcm which upgrade its uptake capacities this enhancement was observed within the studied concentration range from 25 mg l up to 300 mg l for both as v and hg ii ions fig 4e beyond the studied concentrations of 300 mg l for as v and hg ii the curves emphasize equilibration or saturation stage in which the β cd mcm composite achieved its maximum capacity 246 3 mg g for as v and 173 4 mg g for hg ii fig 4e 3 2 1 5 kinetic and equilibrium studies 3 2 1 5 1 kinetic studies the kinetic behavior of β cd mcm during the adsorption of as v and hg ii ions was explained based on the assumption of intra particle diffusion pseudo first order p f pseudo second order p s and elovich models el table s1 for the intra particle diffusion curves of as v and hg ii they are of segmental properties that commonly identify the adsorption system that is of different uptake mechanisms in addition to the diffusion of these ions towards the β cd mcm 30 fig 4f the observation of the first segment during the initial periods of the experiments and dominance of it as the main portion of the curve emphasized the role of the surface adsorption reactions in controlling the efficiency of β cd mcm 1 fig 4f after that a new segment was detected which appear as an intermediate stage of the assistant mechanism fig 4f the uptake mechanisms that characterize this segment are types of layered adsorption and their formation related to the complete occupation of the external sites of β cd mcm with the as v and hg ii ions 4 45 this followed by another segment of plateau shape and covers the equilibrium periods for the capturing of both as v and hg ii ions fig 4f the formation of this segment suggests the existence of the thick layers from the adsorbed as v and hg ii ions on the surface of β cd mcm which might be captured by interionic attraction processes and or types of molecular association mechanisms 45 considering the fitting degrees chi squared χ2 and the determination coefficient r2 of as v and hg ii adsorption results with the assumptions of both p f fig 4g and p s fig 4h kinetic models the uptake systems of these ions by β cd mcm is of pseudo first order kinetic behaviour table 1 fig 4g this suggested the dominance of the physical reactions during the uptake of as v as well as hg ii by β cd mcm 26 46 the detected very good agreement with the p s model suggested considerable effect from some chemical process that might be included electron exchange ion exchange process surface complexation and electron sharing 30 34 also the resulted in significant agreement with the elovich model demonstrates the energetic heterogeneous properties of β cd mcm as an adsorbent for as v and hg ii ions 34 table 1 fig 4i 3 2 1 5 2 equilibrium studies the equilibrium properties of β cd mcm during the adsorption of as v and hg ii ions were assessed by fitting their results with nonlinear equations table s1 of langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich d r as isotherm models the langmuir assumption is of significant indications to elucidate the adsorption systems that are of monolayer properties and the adsorption reaction occur homogenously by the free active sites within the adsorbent 47 chaudhry et al 2016 abukhadra and mostafa 2019 however the hypothesis of the assessed freundlich model involved heterogeneous uptake of dissolved ions by the addressed adsorbent in multilayer forms 47 48 the estimated chi squared x2 and determination coefficients r2 as the essential fitting factors declared the uptake of both as v fig 4j and hg ii fig 4k by β cd mcm according to the langmuir equilibrium behaviour table 1 therefore the capturing of the as v and hg ii occurred homogenously by active sites of β cd mcm in monolayer form 47 moreover determining the rl parameter at values lower than 1 reflects the favourable adsorption behaviours of as v and hg ii ions by β cd mcm composite table 1 the expected maximum capacities of β cd mcm as an adsorbent for as v and hg ii ions were obtained as fitting parameters for the langmuir model and the values are 265 6 mg g and 207 9 mg g respectively table 1 the fitting parameters of the dubinin radushkevich d r model especially the gaussian energies give information about the nature of the as v fig 4j and hg ii fig 4k adsorption reactions the estimated value for as v and hg ii ions are 6 45 kj mol and 3 95 kj mol respectively which are within the suggested limits for the physical reactions less than 8 kj mol 1 table 1 3 2 1 6 thermodynamic properties the thermodynamic studies were completed within an adjusted temperature range from 20 c as lower level up to 50 c as the upper level and the other factors were studied at ph 6 250 ml as the treated volume 360 min as contact time 100 mg l as concentration and 0 1 g l as β cd mcm dosage the three parameters which were used to describe the thermodynamic behavior of the as v and hg ii adsorption reactions by β cd mcm are gibbs free energy δg which was estimated from eq 7 in addition to the enthalpy δh and the entropy δs which were obtained as parameters for the performed fitting processes with the van t hof equation eq 8 fig 4l 47 7 δ g 0 r t i n k c 8 i n k c δ s o r δ h o r t calculating the δgo as negative values for the as v and hg ii uptake reactions by β cd mcm emphasizes the spontaneous and favorable properties of these reactions table 1 1 the negative signs of the appraised δh values demonstrate the exothermic properties for the uptake of both as v and hg ii ions table 1 the δs values that are of positive signs for both as v and hg ii emphasized significant augmentation in the randomness of their adsorption reactions by β cd mcm with conducting the tests at high temperature table 1 1 the values of δgo within the studied temperature range in addition to the values δh for both as v and hg ii ions related to physical adsorption reactions 3 2 1 7 effect of competitive ions the affinities of the β cd mcm composite were investigated in the existence of other anions po4 3 nitrate no3 carbonate co3 2 and sulfate so4 2 and metal ions cadmium cd ii zinc zn ii lead pb ii and cobalt co ii as competitive ions that can be detected in the wastewater fig 5 the influence of such coexisting ions was studied considering the reaction factors at ph 6 250 ml as the treated volume 360 min as contact time 20 c as temperature and 50 mg l as concentration 50 for the studied metal 50 for the coexisting ions for all the studied anions there were no strong impacts on the affinities of β cd mcm for the as v as well as the hg ii ions fig 5a however the existence of phosphate and carbonate ions appeared to be of remarkable competitive effect during the adsorption of the metals especially the as v ions by β cd mcm fig 5a this behavior was assigned to the high similarity between the phosphate ions and the as v ions in their physiochemical properties so it is of combative properties on the active adsorption sites 10 also the ability of the phosphate ions to form inner complexes with the hydroxyl groups of mcm 48 as well as the integrated β cd polymer and thereby shows strong competitive properties with the metal ions 42 for the competitive effect of carbonate co3 2 with as v ions might be related to the similarity between them in their molecular structure 42 the observed very low competitive effect for nitrate no3 and sulfate so4 2 ions might be related to their affinities to form outer sphere complexes rather than the inner sphere complex that create by the metal ion and of significant stability 42 for the addressed coexisting metal ions the pb ii and cd ii ions are of very strong negative effect on the adsorption of both as v and hg ii ions but appeared to be of higher competitive impact on the uptake of hg ii fig 5b the presence of zn ii and co ii also is of significant competitive effect during the adsorption processes but the β cd mcm still of higher affinities for the as v and the hg ii ions for the as v ions the coexisting of cd ii zn ii pb ii and co ii reduced the removal of it by β cd mcm from 100 to 47 6 76 7 36 8 and 80 4 respectively fig 5b for hg ii ions the removal percentages declined from 90 4 to 38 5 67 4 24 6 and 70 2 in the coexisting of cd ii zn ii pb ii and co ii respectively fig 5b however the existence of the previous metals is of strong adverse effect on the as v and hg ii uptake by β cd mcm the recognized removal percentages reflected promising value for the product to be used in realistic remediation processes considering the assessed concentrations 50 mg l 3 2 1 8 recyclability the recyclability and the reusing properties of β cd mcm as an adsorbent for both as v and hg ii were assessed to investigate the qualification of the product for the commercial scale applications the regeneration of the β cd mcm particles involved washing them with diluted naoh solution for about 120 min at about 50 c then the regenerated particles of β cd mcm were washed with distilled water extensively and dried at an adjusted temperature of 60 c for 10 h the regenerated particles were applied in five adsorption reusing tests for both as v and hg ii ions considering the experimental conditions at 360 min as contact time 50 mg l as concentration ph 6 250 ml as tested volume 20 c as temperature and 0 5 g l as dosage fig s1 based on the results the synthetic β cd mcm is of noticeable recyclability and promising reusability as an adsorbent for as v and hg ii ions considering the investigated five runs fig s1 for the removal of as v the obtained decontamination percentages are 100 for two reusing runs higher than 95 for four reusing runs and higher than 93 for the five reusing runs fig s1 for the recyclability of β cd mcm in the decontamination of hg ii ions its declination percentages exceed 89 for two reusing runs 83 for four reusing runs and 78 for the five reusing runs fig s1 the observable diminishing in the β cd mcm removal efficiency for as v and hg ii ions after certain reusing runs is assigned to the predicted formation of complexes between the active structural groups of β cd mcm as receptor sites and the adsorbed as v and hg ii ions which declines the availability of these free sites with repeating the runs 3 2 2 fixed bed adsorption studies 3 2 2 1 influence of the essential parameters 3 2 2 1 1 influence of bed height the controlling effect of the β cd mcm thickness as a fixed bed in continuous column system was followed from 1 cm to 5 cm considering the other factors at 5 ml min as flow rate ph 6 and 25 mg l as concentration for total flow interval of 1620 min fig 6 a and b using the β cd mcm bed at higher thickness is of significant impact in inducing the breakthrough as well as the saturation intervals of the columns during the adsorption of as v and hg i ions which enhanced greatly their lifetimes fig 6a and b table 2 for the investigated column in the removal of as v the breakthrough and saturation intervals expanded from 720 min and 1140 min using β cd mcm of 1 cm thickness to 1200 min and more than1620 min after upgrading the bed thickness to 5 cm fig 6a and b table 2 for hg ii ions the breakthrough and saturation intervals expanded from 660 min and 1140 min to 1080 min and 1620 min respectively with upgrading the bed thickness from 1 cm to 5 cm fig 6a and b table 2 additionally the performances of the columns showed significant enhancement in their performances with testing the β cd mcm bed at a high thickness from 1 cm to 5 cm during the removal of both as v and hg ii ions fig 6a and b table 2 using the β cd mcm bed at 5 cm thickness at the best thickness resulted in as v total removal percentage r of 72 8 considering the treated volume exceed 8 1 l fig 6a and b table 2 this value was achieved considering the values of the other mathematical parameters of 2835 mg m total as the total pumped as v ions in the column 2062 9 mg q total as total adsorbed as v in the bed 569 1 mg l as the equilibrium capacity of the bed cad and 171 9 mg g qeq as the maximum as v adsorption capacity of β cd mcm particles in the bed fig 6a and b table 2 at the same conditions the hg ii ions achieved total removal r of 60 4 considering for treated volume of 8 1 l also the mathematic parameters declared 2835 mg m total as the total pumped hg ii ions in the column 1712 3 mg q total as total adsorbed hg ii in the bed 515 13 mg l as the equilibrium capacity of the bed cad and 142 7 mg g qeq as the maximum as v adsorption capacity of β cd mcm particles in the bed fig 6a and b table 2 such enhancement in the lifetimes as well as the performances of the two columns for the uptake of both as v and hg ii ions related essentially to the reduction in the axial dispersion of the mass transfer that is of strong influence in prompting the diffusion rates of these as v and hg ii ions within the particles of the β cd mcm bed 49 moreover the high thickness of the β cd mcm bed provides a high residence interval for the as v and hg ii ions to be in contact with the receptors of the β cd mcm particles which enhance their uptake within the bed of the column 50 3 2 2 1 2 influence of flow rate the influence of the flow rates was studied to investigate the possibility of the β cd mcm bed to achieve promising results for higher volumes of the polluted water the influence of the flow rate was studied with experimental values from 5 ml min to 25 ml min and certain values for the other factors ph 8 1620 in as total flow time 25 mg l concentration and 5 cm as thickness for the β cd mcm bed fig 6c and d table 2 generally pumping the as v and hg ii polluted solutions at high flow rates is of adverse effect in the lifetimes as well as the performances of the used β cd mcm columns fig 6c and d table 2 the breakthrough intervals for as v declined strongly from 1200 min to 600 min and the exhausted interval declined from more than 1620 min to 1020 min with increasing the flow rates from 5 ml min to 25 ml min fig 6c and d table 2 also the recognized breakthrough time intervals for the adsorption of hg ii ions declined from 1080 min to 660 min and the exhausted time reduced also from 1620 min to 960 min with inducing the flow rate from 5 ml min to 25 ml min fig 6c and d table 2 moreover the total removal percentages declined strongly from 72 8 as v and 60 4 hg ii to 23 5 as v and 22 8 hg ii after accelerating the flow rate from 5 ml min to 25 ml min moreover the adsorption capacity of the β cd mcm bed cad declined strongly from 569 mg l to 314 mg l for as v and from 515 mg l to 310 5 mg l for hg ii ions with increasing the studied flow rates from 5 ml min to 25 ml min fig 6c and d table 2 such declination in both the lifetimes and the performances of the columns with testing the higher flow rates was assigned to the effect of the higher flow rates in reducing the required residence time to achieve the best interaction between the dissolved ions and the active sites of the β cd mcm particles 50 moreover pumping the polluted solutions at high flow rates cause a significant increase in the quantities of the delivered metal ions into the β cd mcm bed which resulted in very fast saturation of the composite particles with captured as v and hg ii ions 51 52 3 2 2 2 dynamic properties of the β cd mcm column system the dynamic properties of the designed continuous columns based on the β cd mcm bed for the adsorption of as v and hg ii ions were assessed considering the assumptions of thomas adams bohart and yoon nelson kinetic models the adam bohart as well as the yoon nelson models are effective to predict the breakthrough activities of the beds and their affinities for the as v and hg ii ions at the initial intervals of the adsorption processes 49 53 the mathematical parameters which can be delivered from these models are of strong scientific contribution in detecting the actual performances of the β cd mcm bed as a function of the saturation concentrations the capacity of β cd mcm bed and the flow interval for 50 of the breakthrough value 54 this was performed by the linear regression fitting of the obtained as v and hg ii adsorption data by the β cd mcm bed with the three models thomas eq 9 adams bohart eq 10 and yoon nelson eq 11 fig 7 9 ln c o c t 1 k t h q 0 m f k t h c o t 10 ln c t c o k a b c o t k a b n o z u o 11 ln c t c o c t k y n t τ k y n 3 2 2 2 1 thomas model according to this model the capturing of the as v and hg ii ions within the β cd mcm bed follow the second order kinetic and the langmuir equilibrium behaviour additionally the occurred reactions are of reversible properties and of no controlled effect for the dispersion axial as well as the diffusion of the dissolved as v and hg ii ions 51 55 the fitting results demonstrate strong agreement between the as v and hg ii adsorption behaviour within the β cd mcm bed and the properties of the thomas model considering the influence of both the bed thickness and the flow rate fig 7a b c and d table 3 the mathematical parameters of this model declared diminishing in the equilibrium capacities of the β cd mcm beds with upgrading their thickness from 1 cm to 5 cm either in the case of as v ions or the hg ii ions table 3 on the other hand accelerating the flow rates of the pumped influents is of strong influence in increasing the equilibrium capacities of the β cd mcm bed from 5 ml min to 25 ml min table 3 this is of strong agreement with the obtained experimental behaviours that reflected the strong effect of delivering the polluted solutions at a high rate inducing the quantities of the adsorbed ions in the bed 3 2 2 2 2 adams bohart model this kinetic assumption is of valuable contribution in describing the transport properties of the as v and hg ii ions within the studied β cd mcm beds according to the kinetic properties of this model the used β cd mcm beds are of constant uptake capacities for as v and hg ii ions and the occurred reactions are of stepping isotherm behaviours 56 the recognized as v and hg ii removal results using the β cd mcm beds emphasize significant agreement with the dynamic properties of the adams bohart model either with testing the beds at different thicknesses or with pumping the polluted influents at different flow rates fig 7e f g and h table 3 based on the fitting parameters the required concentrations of as v and hg ii ions to attend the saturation no of the β cd mcm beds are of systemic declination with upgrading the thickness of the incorporated bed and of considerable intensification with accelerating the flow rates of the polluted influents table 3 3 2 2 2 3 yoon nelson model this model is valuable in predicting the required time to recognize the saturation stages of the β cd mcm beds during the uptake of as v and hg ii ions as well as the adsorption reactions considering their concentrations as certain values abukhadra et al 2020 the breakthrough data for as v as well as hg ii ions are of highly fitting properties with the dynamic properties of the yoon nelson model fig 7i j k and l table 3 considering the theoretical parameters the β cd mcm bed can attend 50 of its saturation capacity for the as v ions after 872 7 min 986 9 min 1190 1 min 1315 5 min and 1407 5 min with testing the β cd mcm bed at an adjusted thickness of 1 cm 2 cm 3 cm 4 cm and 5 cm respectively table 3 for the hg ii ions the obtained intervals are 807 7 min 1 cm 952 9 min 2 cm 1040 2 min 3 cm 1177 9 min 4 cm and 1268 7 min 5 cm table 3 such increment in the required intervals to attend the saturation points with testing the higher thicknesses of the β cd mcm bed declared significant effect for the bed height in inducing the lifetimes of the columns the recognized values 50 saturation with accelerating the flow speed of the as v and hg ii bearing influents emphasized negative impacts on the lifetimes of the cd mcm beds during the adsorption of as v as well as hg ii ions table 3 therefore the successful adjusting of the cd mcm bed at the suitable thickness and the flow speed at the satisfy speed for promising contact between the ions and the bed can induce the decontamination efficiency for high volumes of the polluted water and for long lifetimes 3 2 3 suggested mechanism the introduced adsorbent is a heterogeneous structure from mesoporous silica mcm 48 as substrate and β cyclodextrin as integrated polymer therefore the adsorbent is of multifunctional active sites related to both organic and inorganic chemical functional groups that are of controlling effect during the adsorption of both as v and hg ii ions the used mesoporous silica mcm 48 exhibits highly active oh bearing groups especially the structural silanol groups the negative charges of these groups make them effective centers for the electrostatic attraction processes with the dissolved as v ad hg ii ions 57 additionally these groups are of effective role in forming complexes with the metal ions especially the as v ions 11 it was reported that the as v ions are of ligand exchange properties with the oh bearing groups which resulted in the formation of monodentate and or bidentate complexes 42 for the integrated β cyclodextrin polymer the role of the electrostatic attraction between its charged organic chemical groups and the studied metals also is of strong role in the uptake mechanism additionally the carboxylic groups of the polymer chains were identified as basic centers for the formation of complexes with both as v and hg ii ions by the covalent bond complexation process 58 3 2 4 comparison study the capacities of β cd mcm as an adsorbent for as v and hg ii ions were compared with recognized capacities for different synthetic adsorbents in literature and presented in table 4 the β cd mcm composite is of higher capacities for as v and hg ii ions than several metal oxide based composites modified carbon nanotubes silica based composites graphene oxide and it is modified products some bio adsorbents diatomite chitosan and modified bentonite this demonstrates the promising properties of the prepared β cd mcm as a multifunctional and

period meanwhile the removal rate of nh4 n was up to 33 3 the dominant populations of comamonas and zoogloea were critical for maintaining the removal performance ortho cleavage and meta cleavage pathways were responsible for degrading aniline our work presented that the microbial consortium could effectively treat aniline and provided a potential alternative for eliminating aniline keywords aniline degrading consortium nh4 n removal microbial diversity 1 introduction aniline is one of the most toxic organic compounds and is widely utilized as an industrial chemical for example textile which has seriously threatened human health 1 2 29 therefore it is essential to cleanse wastewater containing aniline before discharging physical chemical technologies have been employed to remove aniline from wastewater but there are several disadvantages such as secondary pollution 3 5 the biological method is valued because of its low energy consumption and less secondary pollution 6 7 pure cultures have been used to treat aniline at various conditions including ph range 6 8 temperature 30 37 c and nacl concentration 1 30 g l 3 8 9 yet there are still several shortcomings with long processing time and low treatment efficiency which hampered their industrial applications 10 11 it is well known treatment systems with mixed cultures are more effective to degrade aniline than pure cultures 6 11 this is because the synergistic effects of microorganisms can improve degradation efficiency therefore enrichment and acclimatization of aniline degrading bacteria are extremely vital however the studies on the aniline degrading bacteria with wide adaptability to various conditions were rare it was reported that aniline concentrations higher than 200 mg l are detrimental to the aniline degrading aerobic granular sludge 12 thus it is crucial to ascertain the influences of environmental factors on the aniline removal of the microbial consortium as well as the stability of community composition and function in this work a microbial consortium with strong adaptability for degrading aniline was enriched and domesticated the microbial community succession was investigated by high throughput sequencing the objectives of our study were to understand i the progressive change of the community structure under aerobic conditions and how this change affects aniline degradation ii would changes in environmental factors significantly affect the removal ability of the microbial consortium 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthetic aniline wastewater the synthetic aniline wastewater consisted of per liter aniline 200 mg kh2po4 1000 mg k2hpo4 1000 mg nacl 1000 mg trace element solution 10 ml 13 the trace elements included the following mg l mgso4 7h2o 500 mnso4

activated sludge was obtained from an aerobic tank of the textile dye wastewater plant located in dongguan china the sludge was brownish and loose the amount of sludge added to the bioreactor was 250

bioreactor the supernatant was removed and the sludge was mixed with synthetic aniline wastewater the mixture was cultivated for 48 h and continued to feed with synthetic aniline wastewater the volume of the bioreactor was 1 l with a porous aerator and both inlets for air and influent were installed at the bottom fig s1 the effluent overflowed through the reactor outlet at the top the hydraulic retention time hrt was guaranteed at 24 0 5 h by controlling the flow rate of the peristaltic pump dissolved oxygen do concentration was maintained at 6 0 7 0 mg l by adjusting the airflow of the air pump the temperature was controlled by a thermostatic magnetic stirring water bath zncl gs china 2 3 effects of environmental factors on aniline degradation the aerobic bioreactor was operated for 30 days to obtain stable aniline degrading microbial consortium the sequencing batch shake flask experiment was used to explore the degradation characteristics of the consortium on aniline at environmental factors including initial aniline concentration 200 1000 mg l ph 3 10 nacl concentration 1 30 g l and temperature 20 45 c five milliliters of concentrated consortium suspension were added into an erlenmeyer flask containing 50 ml of synthetic aniline wastewater then cultivated in a shaker with rotation speed at 180 r min each experiment had three parallel groups to ensure the reproducibility of the results aniline chemical oxygen demand cod and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n were determined to evaluate their treatment effect and characteristics 2 4 high throughput sequencing and

japan according to the methods described by a previous study 12 including washing fixation freeze drying and spray gold the particle sizes of the activated sludge were determined by a laser particle size analysis system mastersizer 2000 ver 5 40 malvern instruments ltd malvern uk 3 results and discussion 3 1 fate of aniline cod and nitrogen in the system the aniline and cod concentrations were monitored to estimate the removal performance during enrichment and domestication as shown in fig 1 a the aniline removal rates were only 44 1 and 61 2 on day 1 and day 2 however the effluent aniline concentration has been as low as 5 9 mg l with a removal efficiency of 97 4 on day 5 correspondingly the residual cod concentration has been to 33 2 mg l with a removal efficiency of 92 5 fig 1b the results indicated that the microbial consortium could quickly adapt to the toxic stress of aniline from day 5 to day 30 the system could remove more than 99 8 of aniline and 93 6 of cod which suggested that we obtained an effective aniline degrading microbial consortium 12 these data demonstrated that the microbial consortium enriched in this study was capable of keeping a high biological activity during aerobic biodegradation of aniline what s more the system adapted to the environment with aniline as the sole organic carbon source and maintained a stable removal performance in the operation stage under the aerobic condition aniline could be oxidized to catechol along with releasing nh4 n by aniline dioxygenase 17 which will lead to the accumulation of nh4 n in the system 11 that s why the effluent ph was generally higher than that of the influent fig 1c from day 1 to day 5 as the degradation efficiency of aniline continually increased the average nh4 n concentration also increased from 7 0 mg l to 23 2 mg l fig 1d however the theoretical amount of nh4 n calculated from the aniline content was about 30 mg l 3 this was caused by nitrifying bacteria that the 33 3 of nh4 n was transformed into other forms in the aerobic bioreactor 13 18 19 it also can be confirmed by the fact that the average concentration of nh4 n no3 n and no2 n was 22 1 mg l 2 4 mg l and 0 4 mg l during the stabilization period of domestication fig 2 d the results revealed that the microbial consortium could remove aniline cod and nh4 n simultaneously which is based on the assistance of various microorganisms 3 2 properties of the sludge after inoculation of activated sludge the bioreactor was operated under high aeration intensity do 6 0 7 0 mg l we measured the particle size of sludge depending on the change of biomass morphology fig 2a the fresh sludge was brown black irregular and loose in the structure on day 1 the proportions of sludge with particle diameters smaller than 100 μm 100 300 μm and 300 500 μm were 47 2 48 1 and 4 6 respectively and there were almost no particles with a diameter larger than 500 μm after 7 days the sludge turned yellow brown and a large number of flocs appeared indicating the microorganisms self aggregated in the bioreactor 20 the proportion of particle size smaller than 100 μm was reduced to 25 9 while the proportion of particle size among 300 500 μm significantly increased to16 2 what s more the sludge of particle size over 500 μm was generated on day 7 these results illustrated that microorganisms and extracellular secretions tended to be clustered together in the system coupled with the scanning electron micrograph of sludge after stabilization fig 2b we could observe that the stabilized sludge surface had many irregular protrusions the sludge structure was viscous and dense which could closely link the functional microorganisms together the extracellular polymeric substances eps secreted by the microorganisms promoted the adhesion of sludge surface and the formation of matrix structure which might help cells to resist the harsh external environmental conditions 12 interestingly the scanning electron microscopy sem also observed plentiful cavities of different sizes these cavities were produced by the accumulation of microorganisms which could improve the transport efficiency of substrate and oxygen into the inner cores of sludge particles 12 overall rapid enrichment and acclimatization with the aerobic bioreactor resulted in a microbial consortium that could treat aniline effectively and the structural properties of the sludge remained stable 3 3 characterization of microbial communities the changes of microbial community during domestication were investigated on days 1 7 15 and 30 abbreviated as d1 d7 d15 and d30 a total of 245 484 high quality sequences were obtained after filtering out chimeras with an average of 61 371 2984 sequences per sample these sequences were clustered into 2106 otus at 97 similarity and the average otus were 526 126 in every sample the good s coverage for the observed otus was over 0 99 and the rank abundance curves showed clear asymptotes table s2 and fig s3 indicating that the sequencing depth of all samples was enough to cover the entire diversity the alpha indices were calculated to evaluate community richness and evenness 12 d1 had the highest shannon value suggesting that the initial community owned the highest diversity the community richness decreased during domestication which might be caused by the toxicity of aniline and some loss of flocculated sludge 12 21 to gain further insight into the overall succession of the microbial community we analyzed the composition of dominant populations at the phylum and genus levels as shown in fig 3 a the dominant phyla were proteobacteria and bacteroidota from day 1 to day 30 compared with the community structure on day 1 proteobacteria accounted for 42 5 bacteroidota accounted for 9 2 their proportions on day 30 increased to 65 1 and 20 2 respectively these results were consistent with previous studies where proteobacteria and bacteroidota also dominated aniline degrading communities and could survive in unfavorable environments 12 22 the stable removal efficiency of aniline from day 7 to day 15 was due to the enrichment of proteobacteria and bacteroidota however the proportions of chloroflexi and actinobacteriota were reduced remarkably from 25 2 d1 to 2 5 d30 and from 8 6 to 3 9 respectively the aniline toxicity might be harmful to the growth of chloroflexi and actinobacteriota which resulted in their loss in the system the microbial community had significant variation at the genus level after enrichment and domestication fig 3b the percentage of comamonas sharply increased from 1 35 d1 to 34 2 d30 combining with fig 3a we could see that the relatively high abundance of proteobacteria was mainly caused by the accumulation of comamonas and zoogloea these two genera could treat wastewater containing aromatic compounds and nh4 n which were the dominant compounds in various dyeing wastewater more importantly there was also a significant increase of zoogloea on day 15 from 0 42 on d1 to 15 38 on d15 a previous study had proved that zoogloea could produce eps to help clean wastewater in the biological treatment system 23 besides zoogloea were the typically activated sludge bacteria responsible for the formation of activated sludge flocs 24 this finding is in accord with the variation of sludge properties as shown in section 3 2 furthermore some low abundance genera including pseudomonas delftia stenotrophomonas and mesorhizobium helped to remove aniline and nh4 n 20 as shown in table s2 the abundance of enzymes related to aniline metabolism increased significantly from day 1 to day 30 k00446 and k03381 the aerobic bacteria could degrade aniline to catechol at the first step and then catechol was metabolized via ortho cleavage or meta cleavage pathway by catechol 1 2 dioxygenase or catechol 2 3 dioxygenase 25 these two pathways accelerated cracking of the benzene ring and then entered the tricarboxylic acid cycle through a series of catalytic reactions fig s3 showed the proposed pathway of aniline degradation by the microbial consortium the metabolic pathway of protocatechuate k00448 and k00449 was also critical for the degradation of aniline 6 all samples contained pathways related to nh4 n metabolism k00260 k00265 and k00274 hence the system could remove aniline and nh4 n simultaneously 3 4 effects of environmental factors on aniline degradation fig 4 showed the aniline degradation characteristics of the microbial consortium at different environmental factors the consortium always exhibited superior elimination when aniline concentration increased from 200 to 1000 mg l fig 4a when the initial concentration of aniline was 1000 mg l the remaining aniline concentration was 332 mg l at 24 h this might be due to the metabolism of functional microorganisms was inhibited by the toxicity of aniline 5 the microbial consortium had an excellent aniline removal performance when ph ranged from 5 to 9 fig 4b previous studies have revealed that several pure isolates and microbial consortia had great degradation rates only under neutral conditions which indicated that the consortium had obvious advantages 22 the aniline removal efficiency decreased significantly with the increase of nacl concentration fig 4c compared with the low salinity the aniline removal rate was relatively weaker with the salinity of 30 g l after culturing for 24 h however the aniline removal efficiency increased to 62 0 within 72 h these results demonstrated that the microbial consortium had better tolerance and adaptability to salinity which was also supported by observations in previous studies 11 26 fig 4d displayed that the experimental group at 30 c and 35 c had nearly 100 of aniline removal efficiency at 24 h the inhibitory effect of low temperature 20 c and 25 c was because low temperature reduced the fluidity of cell membranes and impacted the function of the transport system 27 when the temperature was 45 c it still contained a large amount of aniline 86 1 mg l within 72 h data not shown in fig 4d the temperature is too high to cause denaturation and inactivation of the enzyme protein 28 therefore we inferred that the low removal efficiency at 45 c has been caused by the one time temperature increase mode to verify our inference stepwise increase mode was adopted in our follow up study and proved to be successful in the cultivation of a thermophilic aniline degradation consortium in short the results confirmed that the microbial consortium had broad adaptability to different environmental stresses 4 conclusion a microbial consortium of removing aniline was rapidly obtained by enrichment and acclimation comamonas and zoogloea were dominant genera which could resist the harsh environment and treat aniline wastewater ortho cleavage and meta cleavage pathways existed simultaneously for degrading aniline the consortium had stable removal performances at different environmental factors therefore it is feasible to use aniline as the only source of organic carbon to acquire an aniline degrading microbial consortium in the future a broader experiment of biological enhancement and illuminate community assembly mechanisms will be warranted funding this work was supported by the open funding project of national key laboratory of human factors

also critical for the degradation of aniline 6 all samples contained pathways related to nh4 n metabolism k00260 k00265 and k00274 hence the system could remove aniline and nh4 n simultaneously 3 4 effects of environmental factors on aniline degradation fig 4 showed the aniline degradation characteristics of the microbial consortium at different environmental factors the consortium always exhibited superior elimination when aniline concentration increased from 200 to 1000 mg l fig 4a when the initial concentration of aniline was 1000 mg l the remaining aniline concentration was 332 mg l at 24 h this might be due to the metabolism of functional microorganisms was inhibited by the toxicity of aniline 5 the microbial consortium had an excellent aniline removal performance when ph ranged from 5 to 9 fig 4b previous studies have revealed that several pure isolates and microbial consortia had great degradation rates only under neutral conditions which indicated that the consortium had obvious advantages 22 the aniline removal efficiency decreased significantly with the increase of nacl concentration fig 4c compared with the low salinity the aniline removal rate was relatively weaker with the salinity of 30 g l after culturing for 24 h however the aniline removal efficiency increased to 62 0 within 72 h these results demonstrated that the microbial consortium had better tolerance and adaptability to salinity which was also supported by observations in previous studies 11 26 fig 4d displayed that the experimental group at 30 c and 35 c had nearly 100 of aniline removal efficiency at 24 h the inhibitory effect of low temperature 20 c and 25 c was because low temperature reduced the fluidity of cell membranes and impacted the function of the transport system 27 when the temperature was 45 c it still contained a large amount of aniline 86 1 mg l within 72 h data not shown in fig 4d the temperature is too high to cause denaturation and inactivation of the enzyme protein 28 therefore we inferred that the low removal efficiency at 45 c has been caused by the one time temperature increase mode to verify our inference stepwise increase mode was adopted in our follow up study and proved to be successful in the cultivation of a thermophilic aniline degradation consortium in short the results confirmed that the microbial consortium had broad adaptability to different environmental stresses 4 conclusion a microbial consortium of removing aniline was rapidly obtained by enrichment and acclimation comamonas and zoogloea were dominant genera which could resist the harsh environment and treat aniline wastewater ortho cleavage and meta cleavage pathways existed simultaneously for degrading aniline the consortium had stable removal performances at different environmental factors therefore it is feasible to use aniline as the only source of organic carbon to acquire an aniline degrading microbial consortium in the future a broader experiment of

13429,in this study a micro channel excited dbd plasma water treatment system is proposed to enhance the discharge and gas liquid mass transfer processes simultaneously as the core of the reactor the micro channel plays a crucial role in the process intensification on the one hand the micro channel can reduce the initial discharge voltage and enhances the discharge intensity because of the increased space charge density initiated by the transverse electric field formed by the charges accumulated on the micro channel wall as a result the generation efficiency of active particles can be improved on the other hand the micro channel can also reduce the air pressure resistance and enhance the bubbling process due to the exciting effect of micro channel discharge on air flow and plasma water interaction as a result the utilization efficiency of active particles can be improved tetrabromobisphenol s tbbps is used as the target pollutant with the initial condition of 500 ml 0 2 mmol l the maximum removal is over 98 after a 30 min treatment under an applied voltage of 18 4 kv applied voltage air flow rate and water flow rate are the key parameters affecting the treatment efficiency it can be concluded from the results of this study that the micro channel excited dbd plasma is of significance favorable for the treatment of wastewater keywords plasma water treatment process enhancement micro channel discharge dielectric barrier discharge tetrabromobisphenol s tbbps 1 introduction with the development of chemical industry more and more refractory organic pollutants are synthesized as a widely used brominated flame retardant tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa has attracted much attention in the field of environment because of its persistent biological toxicity 1 as a substitute for tbbpa tetrabromobisphenol s tbbps is more stable but its toxicity is controversial 2 5 in recent years these brominated flame retardants have been widely detected in the environment 5 8 and cause great health risks so there is an urgent need to remove them advanced oxidation process aops are still major technologies to remove organic pollutants efficiently like uv h2o2 9 photocatalysis 10 11 photo fenton 12 catalytic ozonation 13 electrochemical oxidation 14 and plasma oxidation 15 recently plasma based oxidation technologies have attracted more and more attention in the field of water environment because the high energy active particles produced in the electric discharge process are very effective and non selective for the removal of refractory organic pollutants as a kind of plasma technology dielectric barrier discharge dbd can stably generate streamer discharge at atmospheric pressure to establish a dbd reactor with superior water treatment performance there are two key elements one is the shape of electrode and dielectric barrier which would greatly affect electric discharge characteristics and the other is the arrangement of gas liquid interface which highly related to mass transfer many scholars have done a lot of research in the development of dbd water treatment reactors mercado et al 16 improved the electrode shape of the coaxial falling film dbd reactor the inner electrode surface has a screw structure to increase the contact area of water and plasma thus the phenol removal rate is higher than that with the smooth electrode pan et al 17 put out a coaxial dbd reactor to treat paracetamol solution which is characterized by the use of air atomization nozzles to convert the solution into small droplets to improve the treatment efficiency however there are higher requirements for pretreatment and the ratio of water treatment capacity to unit volume is unsatisfactory wright et al 18 19 proposed a dbd reactor with aeration structure in which the upper solution chamber and the lower gas chamber are separated by a microporous metal film the electric discharge is ignited between the needle electrode and the metal film after that the plasma flow through the microporous metal film and as fine bubbles into the upper solution meanwhile the bubbling can also produce water flow vortex in the upper solution so that the solution can be well mixed however the structure of the reactor is relatively complex meanwhile the needle electrode and metal film direct contact with plasma may easily be corroded so that the stability still needs to be verified vanraes et al 20 filled activated carbon textile in the ordinary falling film dbd reactor to enhance the adsorption of pollutant at the same time the ozone produced by discharge is used for secondary bubbling the combination of multi method enhanced the overall treatment effect through the summary of the structure characteristic of dbd water treatment reactors in recent years it can be found that their way to improve the treatment efficiency is mainly focused on two aspects one is the enhancement of electric discharge by modifying the electrode structure to reduce the discharge ignition and maintenance voltage as well as increase the discharge intensity so that the production efficiency of active particles is increased such as deploying a tip structure on the electrode 16 21 or directly using a needle electrode 18 however those electrode structures are very special if the electrode is corroded during electric discharge it is easy to lose the original discharge characteristic the other is the improvement of mass transfer which is mainly reflected on the increasing of the contact area between liquid and plasma such as using fine bubbles 18 22 or atomizing the liquid to be transformed into small droplets 17 23 in general electrode discharge combined with microbubble is a promising direction to improve the dbd water treatment efficiency in traditional plasma bubbling reactors the generation of microbubbles requires additional devices or microstructures which will increase the gas pressure resistance dramatically high pressure resistance is going against the passage of active particles as well as aggravate the consumption of active particles especially for short lived radicals to attenuate the adverse effects the introducing of electric discharge into the micro channel is a reasonable and scientific method firstly pressure resistance may be reduced because of the physical effect of discharge on gas flow such as electric wind 24 25 the exciting effect of discharge on air flow in the micro channel can reduce the adverse effect of high air resistance on mass transfer meanwhile the electric discharge in the micro channel may improve the bubbling conduction because of the plasma water interaction which will also enhance the gas liquid mass transfer in addition the discharge in the micro channel is similar with micro hollow cathode discharge or capillary discharge which is characterized by a cathode in the form of a cavity 26 27 the hollow cathode and capillary can enhance the discharge by increasing the local charge density 28 so the discharge in the micro channel may also reduce the dbd initiation voltage and increase the discharge intensity which lead to an enhancement of the production of active particles therefore it is necessary to study the performance of micro channel dbd water treatment system in many aspects in this study a new type of dbd water treatment reactor is designed there are two dielectric plates between the electrodes one of which has a penetrating micro channel the reactor is characterized by integrating the discharge and mass transfer into the micro channel which can produce uniform discharge in the micro channel and dbd space for a long time and make the plasma activated gas through the micro channel into the solution in the form of microbubbles in order to evaluate the performance of the reactor the following aspects are studied firstly the effects of micro channel on electric discharge and the effects of some parameters on the discharge pattern are put out secondly influence of micro channel discharge on bubbling and air flow are verified the change of air pressure and the electric wind flow rate are measured finally the tbbps removal performance of the reactor under different conditions is evaluated in summary the physical and chemical effects of micro channel discharge can be used to strengthen the plasma water treatment process which can supply new ideas for the development of plasma water treatment 2 experimental method 2 1 materials tetrabromobisphenol s tbbps are purchased from damas beta purity grade 96 and used as received sodium hydroxide naoh are purchased from chongqing chuandong chemical co ltd analytical grade tbbps simulated polluted wastewater is prepared by dissolving 0 2 mmol tbbps into 1 l 0 5 mmol l naoh solution naoh dissolves in deionized water all other reagents are of analytical grade 2 2 designing and fabrication the dbd water treatment system is shown in fig 1 the core of this system is a laboratory made linear micro channel lmc dbd bubbling reactor the reactor consists of a water treatment chamber upper and a discharge chamber lower in the discharge chamber a 3 mm thick quartz glass plate covering the high voltage electrode is used as the dielectric barrier another 3 mm thick quartz glass which has a penetrating lmc is used to separate the water treatment chamber from discharge chamber the lmc with a width of 200 μm and a length of 14 mm is used to initiate the discharge and generate bubbles the grounding electrode is located in the water treatment chamber three related systems connecting to the reactor are established the first one is the electrical system which contains a power supply nanjing suman ctp 2000 k china as the source of energy for discharge the second one is the gas system which contains an air cylinder as the source of gas and a mass flow controller senlod sld mfc china for air flow control and adjustment the last one is the water system which contains a laboratory made water tank and a peristaltic pump lianzhong technology lhzw002 china the key dimensions of the experimental reactor in this paper are marked in fig 1 the reactor and water tank shell are mainly made of plexiglass 5 mm thick plexiglass powder mix with dichloromethane 1 3 v v is used as adhesive in order to get a clearer observation the front shell is made of quartz glass 3 mm thick quartz glass dielectric including that with micro channel are customized by quartz glass manufacturers and bonded to the reactor with epoxy resin adhesive 2 3 working principle the water treatment system is started in the following order firstly using the peristaltic pump to inject 500 ml solution into the water tank then turning on the air cylinder and keeping the air pressure is about 2 kpa and the air flow rate is above 0 01 l min next switching the peristaltic pump to make the solution enter the reactor from the water tank finally when the solution circulating steadily between the reactor and the water tank turning on the high voltage power to ignite discharge the water tank is used to be not only the container of the solution but also the separator of gas and water from the outlet of the reactor the discharge area is between two dielectric plates in the reactor meanwhile some streamers reach the gas liquid interface via the lmc plasma activated air generated in the discharge chamber is injected into the water treatment chamber as bubbles via the lmc 2 4 analytical methods measurement and analysis of the water treatment systems are divided into four categories the first one is the electrical parameters which contains an oscilloscope tektronix tds 2014c usa with a high voltage probe tektronix p6015a usa and a current probe tektronix a622 usa to

mik r9600 china to record the data with a frequency of 1 datum per second and a fiber spectrometer ocean optics qepro usa with a 100 mm optical path cuvette to analyze the components of exhaust gas

min the detection wavelength is set at 227 nm in addition by using a 10 mm optical path cuvette the fiber spectrometer can also be used to analyze the substance composition in water the last is the measurement of other parameters the discharge photographs are recorded by a slr camera canon eos 70d japan with a zoom lens canon ef s 18 135 mm f 3 5 5 6 is stm japan the temperature is recorded by an infrared thermal imager fluke vt04a usa at the condition of 25 room temperature the discharge power is calculated by using lissajous graphic method 29 the transmitted charge is measured indirectly by the sampling capacitor which connected in series with the discharge reactor the basic calculating principle is shown in formula 1 where p is the discharge power v is the discharge voltage i is the discharge current f is the discharge frequency t is the discharge cycle cm is the sampling capacitor and vm is the voltage of the series capacitor a is integral area of lissajous diagram in a single

removed 2 e e 50 0 5 m 0 p t 50 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of the lmc on dbd compared with the typical dbd water treatment reactor the lmc may promote the electric discharge and then improve the active particles generation in order to further clarify this suppose the effect of lmc on discharge is investigated in this section in terms of the discharge process the air flow rate and applied voltage should be paid more attention in this section unless otherwise specified the solution in the tank is tap water the applied voltage is 17 2 kv at a frequency of 9 5 khz the air flow rate is 0 5 l min and the water flow rate is 300 ml min 3 1 1 influence of air flow rate on lmc dbd fig 2 a illustrates two different simplified streamer paths during discharge and the streamer passing through the lmc is obviously brighter than that in the dbd space in the experiment discharge pictures are shown in fig 2 b and c which demonstrates the evolution of discharge at different air flow rates and applied voltages photographs in fig 2 b are taken from the direction parallel to the long side of the lmc while the photographs are taken from the direction parallel to the short edge of the lmc in fig 2 c the purple columnar filaments in the middle are streamers through the lmc and the bright zone around is composed of streamers in dbd space what needs to be stated is that the discharge photographs in fig 2 c are partly covered by bubbles especially at a high air flow rate some regularity of the lmc discharge can be obtained from fig 2 b and c firstly the discharge intensity increases along with the increase of applied voltage and the electric discharge priority is different for the streamer passing through the lmc and streamer in the dbd space under the influence of lmc taking air flow of 0 1 l min as an example the discharge is ignited when the applied voltage reaches to 16 0 kv the intensity of the discharge passing through the lmc is inconsistent but much brighter at the ends of the channel rather than other space the discharge intensity increases with the further increase of the applied voltage and tends to spread to the dbd space from lmc when the applied voltage reaches to 18 4 kv both the discharge intensity and uniformity in the dbd space are improved secondly with the increase of air flow the overall discharge intensity decreases slightly but the variation of discharge intensity in different regions is not the same this is similar to the previous study 30 of porous micro channels taking 18 4 kv as an example when increasing the air flow rate from 0 1 l min to 0 9 l min the discharge became slightly darker however the effect of air flow rate on the dbd space is different from that on the lmc discharge specifically the discharge is weakened in the lmc but enhanced in the dbd space meanwhile the discharge dispersion in the dbd space is improved another important phenomenon can be found that under any conditions the discharge passing through lmc takes precedence over other locations with the increase of applied voltage the discharge first occurs in the lmc and gradually spreads to the surrounding dbd space and the discharge intensity in the lmc is significantly stronger than that in the dbd space this phenomenon shows that the lmc can promote the whole discharge by introducing the pilot discharge into the lmc as showing in fig 3 a a closed curve is drawn between the v and vm measured by the oscilloscope the area a can be calculated by integrating the curve the t is 2 375 2 5 ms and substituting cm is 0 47 μf the power results are shown in fig 3 b which can be found that with the increase of air flow rate the discharge power decreases slightly 3 1 2 mechanism of the exciting effect of lmc on dbd section 3 1 1 demonstrated that the lmc have an exciting effect on dbd similar to other studies on the dbd spherical packed bed 31 33 which have micro channel composed by spherical dielectric the electric field strength and electron density in the lmc have been enhanced some scholars 34 test the effect of the channel size on the chemical effect by changing the size of the filling ball and the results showed that in the diameter range of 268 1230 μm the smaller the channel size the higher the energy density therefore the lmc structure in this study can also reduce the initial discharge voltage 35 which makes the discharge be easier ignited and maintained streamer is easy to diffuse into the porous structure and form micro discharge 36 the diffusion and enhancement of electric field are observed in some pore channel structures this principle is similar to the lmc structure in this study the electrons deposited on the wall of the lmc and form a strong induced electric field which leads to the further enhancement of ionization in the lmc there are three inner walls at both ends of the lmc this is why the electric discharge is always prone to the ends of the lmc when the discharge is ignited in the lmc the generated space charge will drift to the dbd space which will increase the seed charge density and reduce the electric field demand to ignite discharge combined with the phenomena in figs 2 and 3 with the increase in air flow rate the discharge has a tendency to spread from the micro channel to the surrounding dbd space and the fluctuation of the lissajous figure curve increases at the same time the fluctuation of the lissajous figure curve at high air flow illustrates that the discharge stability in the lmc has decreased since the voltage on the sampling capacitor is proportional to the transmitted charge this reveals that the increase of air flow has a negative effect on the lmc discharge in the experimental range the air flow rate affects the lmc discharge from multiple aspects on the one hand a larger air flow will take more ionized particles out of the channel which will directly reduce the ionization degree in the discharge area 37 on the other hand as the air flow is pulsatile because of the blocking effect of water the influence of air flow on discharge is also pulsatile however the dispersion of streamer on dbd space will be enhanced with the air flow rate because of the improved charge uniformity caused by air flow 38 3 2 enhancement of lmc discharge on bubbling and air flow like other microstructures that produce microbubbles the flow across space in the lmc is narrow and the gas velocity is much higher than that in the dbd space the viscous resistance of the gas in the inner wall of the micro channel causes the reverse pressure gradient in the flow boundary layer which would produce countercurrent at the outlet and increase the flow resistance as well as reduce the transport efficiency of active particles however when discharge occurs near the solid wall numerous electrons and ions are generated and accelerated by the electric field and the kinetic energy is transferred to the gas in the boundary layer by collision so as to overcome the reverse pressure gradient and wall resistance delay or even prevent the boundary layer separation 39 40 thus may reduce the air flow resistance non thermal plasma technology is very promising on air flow control 41 dbd actuator 42 with various structures have been widely studied in many application fields such as wind resistance reduction 43 lift force enhance 44 de icing of aircraft wings 45 shock absorption of aircraft landing gear resistance reduction of wind turbine blades 42 43 etc the lmc structure in this study is different from the typical dbd actuator but similar to capillary or micro hollow cathode discharges which resulted an excitation streamer mainly in the lmc rather than near the plate electrode there are two main effects of plasma on air flow the first is the dynamic effect which also known as electric wind electrons and ions move directionally in the electric field collide with neutral particles and transfer their momentum and energy to the surrounding air which makes the nearby air move directionally and form an induced airflow thus changing the structure and shape of the flow field 46 the second is the thermal effect when part of the air in the air flow is ionized and accelerated the local temperature and pressure rise are produced which disturbs the air flow locally and changes the structure and shape of the flow field in order to verify whether the above theory is applicable on lmc dbd the effect of lmc discharge on bubbling and air flow is investigated referring to other researches on plasma actuator and gas liquid discharge the main parameters needing attention are applied voltage air flow rate water flow rate liquid electrode conductivity and applied voltage frequency therefore those parameters are studied in the following parts in this section unless otherwise specified the liquid in the treatment chamber is tap water the applied voltage is 18 4 kv at a frequency of 9 5 khz the air flow rate is 0 5 l min and the water flow rate is 200 ml min the dotted line in the figure represents the time node at which the discharge ignited or extinguish 3 2 1 enhancement of bubbling and reduction of pressure resistance in the lmc the effect of electric discharge on air flow is resulted by a series of comprehensive effects bubbling state would be a good reflection on air flow the macro phenomenon of the pressure resistance reduction in the lmc can be seen in fig 4 as showing in fig 4 a by adjusting the air pressure the resistance in the lmc is balanced and no bubble is produced in the absence of electric discharge upper once the discharge is ignited the pressure equilibrium is broken immediately and the air enters the water to produce continuous bubbles lower as showing in fig 4 b when adjusting the air flow rate to 0 1 l min due to the relatively small air flow rate bubbles are generated only on the right side of the channel upper however the bubbling range diffuses to almost the whole lmc in the stage of electric discharge lower this result indicates that the discharge occurs in the lmc can provide kinetic energy to the air and reduce the pressure resistance according to bernoulli s principle the sum of kinetic energy gravitational potential energy and pressure potential energy is constant because the electric discharge increases the kinetic energy of the air flow the pressure resistance of the lmc would decrease during the discharge fig 5 a shows the change of air pressure resistance during discharge at different applied voltages it can be seen that when the applied voltage is 14 8 kv the voltage is not enough to initiate the discharge and then no obvious pressure resistance change exists however when increasing the applied voltage to 16 0 kv the discharge in the lmc is ignited and the average air pressure resistance is reduced by 8 pa during the discharge time the reduction of the average air pressure resistance increases with the increase of applied voltage when the applied voltage is 20 4 kv the average pressure resistance reduction is 25 pa fig 5 b shows the change of relative air pressure resistance during electric discharge at different air flow rates because the initial pressure resistance is distinctly at different air flows so the relative pressure resistance is conducive to comparison it can be seen that when the airflow changes from 0 3 to 0 5 l min the average air pressure resistance reduces about 20 pa during the electric discharge time however when the air flow is increased to over 0 7 l min the average air pressure resistance decreases 13 pa during the discharge from the effect of air flow rate on electric discharge summarized in section 3 1 1 the increase in air flow rate can weaken the discharge in lmc which will decrease the reduction of air pressure resistance in addition with the increase in air flow rate the fluctuation amplitude of pressure resistance increases fig 6 a shows the change of pressure resistance during electric discharge at different water flow rates in the range of 0 300 ml min adjusting the water flow has no obvious effect on the pressure resistance however when water flow reaches to 400 ml min the water level floods the outlet as showing in fig 6 b the bubbles through the outlet directly so that the pressure resistance curve becomes different the water flow also causes a disturbance to the bubbling fig 6 c shows the effect of water flow rate on bubble rising path without electric discharge at the constant air flow rate of 0 9 l min it can be seen that when the water flow rate is 0 ml min the rising path of bubbles is vertical upward when increasing the water flow rate the rising path of bubbles begins to rotate and offset in the opposite direction from the water inlet when the water flow rate is higher than 400 ml min the rising path of bubbles would not only develop into a spiral but also shift sharply to the right the increase of water flow rate may promote the attached bubbles leaving the lmc and increase the gas liquid mass transfer this suppose will be further verified in a later section when the liquid is used as the cathode its electrical conductivities often has an important influence on the electric discharge process fig 7 a shows the pressure resistance change at different water conductivities it can be seen from the figure that the effect of liquid conductivity on pressure is not obvious this may be resulted by the minor influence of discharge impedance from the water conductivity change compared with the air gap fig 7 b shows the effect of electric discharge frequency on air pressure the average air pressure resistance reduction increases with the discharge frequency when increasing the discharge frequency the decay time of the charges accumulated on the dielectric surface between the two discharges is shortened which can enhance the discharge intensity in the next half cycle as a result the effect of electric discharge on air flow is enhanced 3 2 2 the mechanism of pressure resistance change fig 8 a shows the schematic of air pressure measurement in the dbd chamber similar to the previous section the only difference is to connect the low pressure end of the pressure transmitter to the atmosphere the temperature of the lmc is measured by a non contact infrared thermometer it can be seen from the fig 8 b that when the applied voltage is 14 8 kv the discharge cannot be ignited in the micro channel there is no obvious change of the measured pressure besides the fluctuation caused by bubbling when the applied voltage is raised to 16 0 kv the discharge can be ignited in the micro channel the air pressure still has no obvious change but the fluctuation became relatively stable during the electric discharge until applied voltage rising to 18 4 kv the phenomenon is similar when the applied voltage is further increased to over 19 4 kv the situation becomes a little different that the air pressure decreases slightly and the greater discharge voltage causes the larger reduction amplitude at higher applied voltage the pressure drops slightly the rise of temperature plays a key role in this process with the extension of electric discharge time the temperature gradually reaches the maximum and the pressure is reduced to the minimum once extinguish the electric discharge the temperature decreases and the air pressure recovers gradually the change of air pressure is not synchronous with the application time of electric discharge because of the delay of temperature change from the above results the air pressure in the dbd chamber is relatively stable this is the reason why this study focusses on the relative pressure difference but not the absolute pressure in fact on the effect of continuous bubbling and water circulation the heat generated during electric discharge is quickly removed from the system which can maintain the temperature at a low level therefore from the overall results the air pressure and temperature in the dbd gap is relatively stable during the discharge especially at low voltages so the pressure resistance reduction mentioned in the former section is mainly caused by the dynamic effect of the lmc electric discharge when there is no airflow the temperature of the discharge area increases gradually with the discharge duration time and the average surface temperature seems to increase linearly with the increase of frequency and square with the increase of voltage amplitude however after the existence of air flow the heat dissipation makes the thermal effect weaken 47 in the experimental system of this paper due to the cooling effect of air flow and water flow on the reactor the thermal effect can be considered very weak when the voltage is lower than 18 4 kv operation at lower temperature is beneficial to reduce the annihilation of free radicals thus improve the treatment performance fig 9 shows the schematic of electric wind flow measuring system the gas inlet pipe is not connected to the gas cylinder but to atmospheric the water ground electrode is replaced by a series of stainless steel meshes with different mesh numbers fig 10 a shows the electric wind flow rate measured by the gas mass flowmeter at the applied voltage of 17 2 kv with the increase of mesh number the air flow rate first increases and reaches to the maximum at a mesh number of 60 then decreases when the mesh becoming more and more dense the discharge becomes uniform and the streamers become smaller but more numerous which will contribute to the increase of electric wind flow however denser metal mesh will produce a larger resistance which will decrease the air flow rate therefore after further increasing the mesh number the electric wind flow presents a downward trend fig 10 b shows the electric wind flow rate with a 60 mesh stainless steel mesh cathode at different applied voltages with the increase of applied voltage the air flow rate increases at first but then decreases when the applied voltage is 16 0 kv due to the low voltage the discharge is not stable thus the wind flow rate has a large fluctuation when the voltage continues to increase the discharge becomes stable and the wind flow rate increase however when the applied voltage is up to 18 4 kv the wind flow rate does not increase as expected but decreases because of the change of discharge pattern fig 10 c show the discharge pictures at two different applied voltages 17 2 kv upper and 18 4 kv lower respectively when the applied voltage is 17 2 kv abundant of streamers are produced and spread uniformly however when the applied voltage is 18 4 kv the plasma streamers in the lmc converge together and tend to develop towards spark it can be inferred from the experimental results that the small and uniform streamer has strong ability to induce electric wind compared with spark like streamer besides combined with the previous section water electrode is easier to get uniform streamer than metal mesh electrode from the experimental results discussed above it is proved that the lmc dbd can generate electric wind thus reduce the air flow resistance and enhance the bubbling process in addition due to the good heat exchange ability of the reactor the macro temperature can be maintained in a low range this will provide appropriate conditions for the production and mass transfer of active particles the effect of lmc electric discharge on air flow has a positive effect on the treatment efficiency on the one hand the formation of bubbles at the gas liquid interface has improved while discharge is ignited the volume of a single bubble become smaller and the total bubble number increase this increases the area of the gas liquid interface and enhances the mass transfer efficiency on the other hand after discharge occurs the air flow is induced and the bubble dispersion is improved which is also conducive to mass transfer for the production of active particles the electric wind causes the charged particles to drift near the liquid surface which makes the production area of the active particles is closer to the gas liquid interface it is beneficial for the utilization of active particles especially for short time radicals 3 3 removal of tbbps by the lmc dbd bubbling reactor in the previous section some characteristics of the reactor have been verified there would be excellent pollutant treatment performance in theory therefore in this section we use tbbps as the simulation pollutant to verify the removal performance of the reactor fig 11 shows the tbbps uv vis spectrum evolution with electric discharge treatment time compared with studies of tbbpa 48 49 tbbps has larger absorption in the range of 250 330 nm in which sulfur carbon bond plays a key role the characteristic peaks of tbbps showed a downward trend with the discharge treatment time as a result tbbps is removed according to the working principle of this water treatment system the most important factors affecting the treatment efficiency are discharge voltage air flow and water flow therefore those parameters are studied in the following parts in this section unless otherwise specified the treatment solution is 500 ml the initial tbbps concentration is 0 2 mmol l the applied voltage is 17 2 kv at a frequency of 9 5 khz the air flow rate is 0 5 l min and the water flow rate is 300 ml min 3 3 1 effect of applied voltage on tbbps removal fig 12 a shows the effect of applied voltage on tbbps removal with the increase of applied voltage the removal rate increases at first and reaches the maximum at 18 4 kv after that it begins to decline in the low voltage stage the energy density increases with the increase of the applied voltage thus more active particles are produced and the degradation efficiency increases however when the applied voltage increasing continually the discharge pattern begins to change from streamer to spark like discharge and results a larger temperature rise the energy is consumed more by the physical effects like heat optical emission ionization etc in addition the high temperature would increase the speed and ratio of active particle decomposition which resulting in a declined pollutant removal efficiency fig 12 b shows the result of outlet gas uv vis spectrum at different discharge voltage the absorption peak at 254 7 mm is ozone molecule some of the active particles produced by discharge exist for a very short time while ozone exists longer thus can be gauged easily so the gas phase ozone measurement is used to demonstrate the change of active particle production with applied voltage the result is consistent with the tbbps removal and verifies the effect of applied voltage it should be noted that combined with the results in fig 5 a when the applied voltage is too high although the lower pressure resistance may improve the mass transfer it does not compensate for the negative effect of the decline in the production of active substances and the overall removal efficiency drops sharply there is a good correlation between ozone yield and removal ratio which indicate that ozone is an important active substance in the removal of tbbps in addition according to the research of other scholars on dbd reactor 50 51 hydroxyl free radical oh and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 also play an important role in the degradation of organic pollutants at the gas liquid interface the collision between electrons and water molecules is easy to produce oh and further reorganized into h2o2 52 the details are described by eqs 3 and 4 in addition tbbps is added to the sodium hydroxide solution as simulated polluted wastewater because of this alkaline condition is conducive to the dissolution of tbbps and more favorable for ozone to play a key role in tbbps removal under alkaline conditions ozone is more easily to dissolve for the air to the solution and converted to oh 53 the details are described by eqs 5 and 6 3 h 2 o e o h h e 4 o h o h h 2 o 2 5 o 3 o h h o 2 o 2 6 o 3 h o 2 o h o 2 o 2 effect of air flow rate on tbbps removal fig 13 shows the effect of air flow rate on tbbps degradation in the range of low air flow rate the removal of tbbps rises with the increase in air flow rate however through the contrast between the removal rates under 0 5 l min and 1 1 l min it is found that the improvement of the degradation rate is relatively limited even if the air flow rate has over doubled this is on account of the change of electric discharge situation which can be referred from section 3 1 1 3 3 2 effect of water flow rate on tbbps removal fig 14 shows the effect of water flow rate on tbbps removal with the increase of water flow rate the degradation efficiency within 15 min is significantly improved the experimental results are consistent with the suppose in section 3 2 1 this phenomenon is on account of the water flow vortex in the water treatment chamber which making the mixing more uniformly this effect becomes stronger with the increase of water flow rate at the same time when the water flow rate is lower than 200 ml min the degradation curve is slightly s shaped which is due to the formation of a certain concentration difference between the reactor and the water tank in the first few minutes 3 3 3 energy efficiency of tbbps removal by lmc excited dbd in other sections of this study to better understanding the characteristics of lmc only single one is used as for practical engineering applications in order to improve pollutant treatment capacity and increase energy efficiency it is often necessary to use multiple groups of lmc in order to compare the treatment capacity of a multi number lmcs as showing in fig 15 a three and six channels are arranged to treat the tbbps solution respectively except for the air flow rate is 1 l min the other initial conditions are the same as those listed in 3 3 fig 15 b reveals the treatment results and it can be seen that with the increase in the number of lmcs the treatment capacity has been improved meanwhile energy efficiency is also an important index for the reactor energy efficiency is calculated by substituting the parameters in fig 15 b the results are shown in table 1 which shows that multi number lmcs significantly improves energy efficiency compared with the study of tbbpa 50 which ee50 is about 16 67 g kwh multi number lmcs may have better energy efficiency in addition the air flow is also a crucial parameter according to the study in the previous section the increase of air flow can hinder the electric discharge while the increase of ventilation area by multi number lmcs actually reduces the hindrance so that the reactor can run under a larger flow efficiently under the condition of 1 l min air flow rate the treatment capacity and energy efficiency of 3 channels are approximately to 6 channels but it is predictable that the reactor with 6 channel has better potential under larger air flow rate 4 conclusion in this study a linear micro channel excited dbd bubbling water treatment reactor is proposed the electric discharge characteristics and treatment effect of the reactor are verified and most significant results can be summarized as follows in the initial stage of electric discharge the discharge in the lmc is always prior to the dbd space and the discharge intensity in the lmc is larger than that in the dbd space with the increase in air flow rate the discharge in the lmc is weakened and the overall discharge power decreases the electric discharge improves the bubbling process and induces air flow in the lmc through the measurement of the pressure resistance of the lmc it is found that the pressure resistance decreases during the electric discharge which is positively related to the applied voltage and discharge frequency and inversely related to the air flow rate and is nearly no affected by the water flow rate and solution conductivity in addition electric wind may be an important reason for air flow induced by micro channel discharge through the measurement of the electric wind in the lmc it is found that the intensity of the electric wind produced by uniform streamers is greater than that of bright spark like streamers a good removal efficiency has been achieved in the simulated wastewater with tbbps as the target pollutant when 500 ml 2 mmol l tbbps is treated at the applied voltage of 18 4 kv in 30 min the removal rate reached to 98 applied voltage air flow and water flow are the key parameters that affect the removal efficiency especially the appropriate voltage can produce active substances most effectively thus can have an excellent removal performance in addition the use of multiple lmcs can conspicuously improve the removal performance and energy efficiency author contributions xiaoping wang conceptualization methodology writing review

13429,in this study a micro channel excited dbd plasma water treatment system is proposed to enhance the discharge and gas liquid mass transfer processes simultaneously as the core of the reactor the micro channel plays a crucial role in the process intensification on the one hand the micro channel can reduce the initial discharge voltage and enhances the discharge intensity because of the increased space charge density initiated by the transverse electric field formed by the charges accumulated on the micro channel wall as a result the generation efficiency of active particles can be improved on the other hand the micro channel can also reduce the air pressure resistance and enhance the bubbling process due to the exciting effect of micro channel discharge on air flow and plasma water interaction as a result the utilization efficiency of active particles can be improved tetrabromobisphenol s tbbps is used as the target pollutant with the initial condition of 500 ml 0 2 mmol l the maximum removal is over 98 after a 30 min treatment under an applied voltage of 18 4 kv applied voltage air flow rate and water flow rate are the key parameters affecting the treatment efficiency it can be concluded from the results of this study that the micro channel excited dbd plasma is of significance favorable for the treatment of wastewater keywords plasma water treatment process enhancement micro channel discharge dielectric barrier discharge tetrabromobisphenol s tbbps 1 introduction with the development of chemical industry more and more refractory organic pollutants are synthesized as a widely used brominated flame retardant tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa has attracted much attention in the field of environment because of its persistent biological toxicity 1 as a substitute for tbbpa tetrabromobisphenol s tbbps is more stable but its toxicity is controversial 2 5 in recent years these brominated flame retardants have been widely detected in the environment 5 8 and cause great health risks so there is an urgent need to remove them advanced oxidation process aops are still major technologies to remove organic pollutants efficiently like uv h2o2 9 photocatalysis 10 11 photo fenton 12 catalytic ozonation 13 electrochemical oxidation 14 and plasma oxidation 15 recently plasma based oxidation technologies have attracted more and more attention in the field of water environment because the high energy active particles produced in the electric discharge process are very effective and non selective for the removal of refractory organic pollutants as a kind of plasma technology dielectric barrier discharge dbd can stably generate streamer discharge at atmospheric pressure to establish a dbd reactor with superior water treatment performance there are two key elements one is the shape of electrode and dielectric barrier which would greatly affect electric discharge characteristics and the other is the arrangement of gas liquid interface which highly related to mass transfer many scholars have done a lot of research in the development of dbd water treatment reactors mercado et al 16 improved the electrode shape of the coaxial falling film dbd reactor the inner electrode surface has a screw structure to increase the contact area of water and plasma thus the phenol removal rate is higher than that with the smooth electrode pan et al 17 put out a coaxial dbd reactor to treat paracetamol solution which is characterized by the use of air atomization nozzles to convert the solution into small droplets to improve the treatment efficiency however there are higher requirements for pretreatment and the ratio of water treatment capacity to unit volume is unsatisfactory wright et al 18 19 proposed a dbd reactor with aeration structure in which the upper solution chamber and the lower gas chamber are separated by a microporous metal film the electric discharge is ignited between the needle electrode and the metal film after that the plasma flow through the microporous metal film and as fine bubbles into the upper solution meanwhile the bubbling can also produce water flow vortex in the upper solution so that the solution can be well mixed however the structure of the reactor is relatively complex meanwhile the needle electrode and metal film direct contact with plasma may easily be corroded so that the stability still needs to be verified vanraes et al 20 filled activated carbon textile in the ordinary falling film dbd reactor to enhance the adsorption of pollutant at the same time the ozone produced by discharge is used for secondary bubbling the combination of multi method enhanced the overall treatment effect through the summary of the structure characteristic of dbd water treatment reactors in recent years it can be found that their way to improve the treatment efficiency is mainly focused on two aspects one is the enhancement of electric discharge by modifying the electrode structure to reduce the discharge ignition and maintenance voltage as well as increase the discharge intensity so that the production efficiency of active particles is increased such as deploying a tip structure on the electrode 16 21 or directly using a needle electrode 18 however those electrode structures are very special if the electrode is corroded during electric discharge it is easy to lose the original discharge characteristic the other is the improvement of mass transfer which is mainly reflected on the increasing of the contact area between liquid and plasma such as using fine bubbles 18 22 or atomizing the liquid to be transformed into small droplets 17 23 in general electrode discharge combined with microbubble is a promising direction to improve the dbd water treatment efficiency in traditional plasma bubbling reactors the generation of microbubbles requires additional devices or microstructures which will increase the gas pressure resistance dramatically high pressure resistance is going against the passage of active particles as well as aggravate the consumption of active particles especially for short lived radicals to attenuate the adverse effects the introducing of electric discharge into the micro channel is a reasonable and scientific method firstly pressure resistance may be reduced because of the physical effect of discharge on gas flow such as electric wind 24 25 the exciting effect of discharge on air flow in the micro channel can reduce the adverse effect of high air resistance on mass transfer meanwhile the electric discharge in the micro channel may improve the bubbling conduction because of the plasma water interaction which will also enhance the gas liquid mass transfer in addition the discharge in the micro channel is similar with micro hollow cathode discharge or capillary discharge which is characterized by a cathode in the form of a cavity 26 27 the hollow cathode and capillary can enhance the discharge by increasing the local charge density 28 so the discharge in the micro channel may also reduce the dbd initiation voltage and increase the discharge intensity which lead to an enhancement of the production of active particles therefore it is necessary to study the performance of micro channel dbd water treatment system in many aspects in this study a new type of dbd water treatment reactor is designed there are two dielectric plates between the electrodes one of which has a penetrating micro channel the reactor is characterized by integrating the discharge and mass transfer into the micro channel which can produce uniform discharge in the micro channel and dbd space for a long time and make the plasma activated gas through the micro channel into the solution in the form of microbubbles in order to evaluate the performance of the reactor the following aspects are studied firstly the effects of micro channel on electric discharge and the effects of some parameters on the discharge pattern are put out secondly influence of micro channel discharge on bubbling and air flow are verified the change of air pressure and the electric wind flow rate are measured finally the tbbps removal performance of the reactor under different conditions is evaluated in summary the physical and chemical effects of micro channel discharge can be used to strengthen the plasma water treatment process which can supply new ideas for the development of plasma water treatment 2 experimental method 2 1 materials tetrabromobisphenol s tbbps are purchased from damas beta purity grade 96 and used

l naoh solution naoh dissolves in deionized water all other reagents are of analytical grade 2 2 designing and fabrication the dbd water treatment system is shown in fig 1 the core of this system is a laboratory made linear micro channel lmc dbd bubbling reactor the reactor consists of a water treatment chamber upper and a discharge chamber lower in the discharge chamber a 3 mm thick quartz glass plate covering the high voltage electrode is used as the dielectric barrier another 3 mm thick quartz glass which has a penetrating lmc is used to separate the water treatment chamber from discharge chamber the lmc with a width of 200 μm and a length of 14 mm is used to initiate the discharge and generate bubbles the grounding electrode is located in the water treatment chamber three related systems connecting to the reactor are established the first one is the electrical system which contains a power supply nanjing suman ctp 2000 k china as the source of energy for discharge the second one is the gas system which contains an air cylinder as the source of gas and a mass flow controller senlod sld mfc china for air flow control and adjustment the last one is the water system which contains a laboratory made water tank and a peristaltic pump lianzhong technology lhzw002 china the key dimensions of the experimental reactor in this paper are marked in fig 1 the reactor and water tank shell are mainly made of plexiglass 5 mm thick plexiglass powder mix with dichloromethane 1 3 v v is used as adhesive in order to get a clearer observation the front shell is made of quartz glass 3 mm thick quartz glass dielectric including that with micro channel are customized by quartz glass manufacturers and bonded to the reactor with epoxy resin adhesive 2 3 working principle the water treatment system is started in the following order firstly using the peristaltic pump to inject 500 ml solution into the water tank then turning on the air cylinder and keeping the air pressure is about 2 kpa and the air flow rate is above 0 01 l min next switching the peristaltic pump to make the solution enter the reactor from the water tank finally when the solution circulating steadily between the reactor and the water tank turning on the high voltage power to ignite discharge the water tank is used to be not only the container of the solution but also the separator of gas and water from the outlet of the reactor the discharge area is between two dielectric plates in the reactor meanwhile some streamers reach the gas liquid interface via the lmc plasma activated air generated in the discharge chamber is injected into the water treatment chamber as bubbles via the lmc 2 4 analytical methods measurement and analysis of the water treatment systems are divided into four categories the first one is the electrical parameters which contains an oscilloscope tektronix tds 2014c usa with a high voltage probe tektronix p6015a usa and a current probe tektronix a622 usa to

mik r9600 china to record the data with a frequency of 1 datum per second and a fiber spectrometer ocean optics qepro usa with a 100 mm optical path cuvette to analyze the components of exhaust gas

6 150 mm 5 μm the eluent composition consisted of acetonitrile 0 1 potassium dihydrogen phosphate solution saturated phosphoric acid solution 600 400 1 v v v and the flow rate of the elution is 1 0 ml min the detection wavelength is set at 227 nm in addition by using a 10 mm optical path cuvette the fiber spectrometer can also be used to analyze the substance composition in water the last is the measurement of other parameters the discharge photographs are recorded by a slr camera canon eos 70d japan with a zoom lens canon ef s 18 135 mm f 3 5 5 6 is stm japan the temperature is recorded by an infrared thermal imager fluke vt04a usa at the condition of 25 room temperature the discharge power is calculated by using lissajous graphic method 29 the transmitted charge is measured indirectly by the sampling capacitor which connected in series with the discharge reactor the basic calculating principle is shown in formula 1 where p is the discharge power v is the discharge voltage i is the discharge current f is the discharge frequency t is the discharge cycle cm is the sampling capacitor and vm is the voltage of the series capacitor a is integral area of lissajous diagram in a single

removed 2 e e 50 0 5 m 0 p t 50 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of the lmc on dbd compared with the typical dbd water treatment reactor the lmc may promote the electric discharge and then improve the active particles generation in order to further clarify this suppose the effect of lmc on discharge is investigated in this section in terms of the discharge process the air flow rate and applied voltage should be paid more attention in this section unless otherwise specified the solution in the tank is tap water the applied voltage is 17 2 kv at a frequency of 9 5 khz the air flow rate is 0 5 l min and the water flow rate is 300 ml min 3 1 1 influence of air flow rate on lmc dbd fig 2 a illustrates two different simplified streamer paths during discharge and the streamer passing through the lmc is obviously brighter than that in the dbd space in the experiment discharge pictures are shown in fig 2 b and c which demonstrates the evolution of discharge at different air flow rates and applied voltages photographs in fig 2 b are taken from the direction parallel to the long side of the lmc while the photographs are taken from the direction parallel to the short edge of the lmc in fig 2 c the purple columnar filaments in the middle are streamers through the lmc and the bright zone around is composed of streamers in dbd space what needs to be stated is that the discharge photographs in fig 2 c are partly covered by bubbles especially at a high air flow rate some regularity of the lmc discharge can be obtained from fig 2 b and c firstly the discharge intensity increases along with the increase of applied voltage and the electric discharge priority is different for the streamer passing through the lmc and streamer in the dbd space under the influence of lmc taking air flow of 0 1 l min as an example the discharge is ignited when the applied voltage reaches to 16 0 kv the intensity of the discharge passing through the lmc is inconsistent but much brighter at the ends of the channel rather than other space the discharge intensity increases with the further increase of the applied voltage and tends to spread to the dbd space from lmc when the applied voltage reaches to 18 4 kv both the discharge intensity and uniformity in the dbd space are improved secondly with the increase of air flow the overall discharge intensity decreases slightly but the variation of discharge intensity in different regions is not the same this is similar to the previous study 30 of porous micro channels taking 18 4 kv as an example when increasing the air flow rate from 0 1 l min to 0 9 l min the discharge became slightly darker however the effect of air flow rate on the dbd space is different from that on the lmc discharge specifically the discharge is weakened in the lmc but enhanced in the dbd space meanwhile the discharge dispersion in the dbd space is improved another important phenomenon can be found that under any conditions the discharge passing through lmc takes precedence over other locations with the increase of applied voltage the discharge first occurs in the lmc and gradually spreads to the surrounding dbd space and the discharge intensity in the lmc is significantly stronger than that in the dbd space this phenomenon shows that the lmc can promote the whole discharge by introducing the pilot discharge into the lmc as showing in fig 3 a a closed curve is drawn between the v and vm measured by the oscilloscope the area a can be calculated by integrating the curve the t is 2 375 2 5 ms and substituting cm is 0 47 μf the power results are shown in fig 3 b which can be found that with the increase of air flow rate the discharge power decreases slightly 3 1 2 mechanism of the exciting effect of lmc on dbd section 3 1 1 demonstrated that the lmc have an exciting effect on dbd similar to other studies on the dbd spherical packed bed 31 33 which have micro channel composed by spherical dielectric the electric field strength and electron density in the lmc have been enhanced some scholars 34 test the effect of the channel size on the chemical effect by changing the size of the filling ball and the results showed that in the diameter range of 268 1230 μm the smaller the channel size the higher the energy density therefore the lmc structure in this study can also reduce the initial discharge voltage 35 which makes the discharge be easier ignited and maintained streamer is easy to diffuse into the porous structure and form micro discharge 36 the diffusion and enhancement of electric field are observed in some pore channel structures this principle is similar to the lmc structure in this study the electrons deposited on the wall of the lmc and form a strong induced electric field which leads to the further enhancement of ionization in the lmc there are three inner walls at both ends of the lmc this is why the electric discharge is always prone to the ends of the lmc when the discharge is ignited in the lmc the generated space charge will drift to the dbd space which will increase the seed charge density and reduce the electric field demand to ignite discharge combined with the phenomena in figs 2 and 3 with the increase in air flow rate the discharge has a tendency to spread from the micro channel to the surrounding dbd space and the fluctuation of the lissajous figure curve increases at the same time the fluctuation of the lissajous figure curve at high air flow illustrates that the discharge stability in the lmc has decreased since the voltage on the sampling capacitor is proportional to the transmitted charge this reveals that the increase of air flow has a negative effect on the lmc discharge in the experimental range the air flow rate affects the lmc discharge from multiple aspects on the one hand a larger air flow will take more ionized particles out of the channel which will directly reduce the ionization degree in the discharge area 37 on the other hand as the air flow is pulsatile because of the blocking effect of water the influence of air flow on discharge is also pulsatile however the dispersion of streamer on dbd space will be enhanced with the air flow rate because of the improved charge uniformity caused by air flow 38 3 2 enhancement of lmc discharge on bubbling and air flow like other microstructures that produce microbubbles the flow across space in the lmc is narrow and the gas velocity is much higher than that in the dbd space the viscous resistance of the gas in the inner wall of the micro channel causes the reverse pressure gradient in the flow boundary layer which would produce countercurrent at the outlet and increase the flow resistance as well as reduce the transport efficiency of active particles however when discharge occurs near the solid wall numerous electrons and ions are generated and accelerated by the electric field and the kinetic energy is transferred to the gas in the boundary layer by collision so as to overcome the reverse pressure gradient and wall resistance delay or even prevent the boundary layer separation 39 40 thus may reduce the air flow resistance non thermal plasma technology is very promising on air flow control 41 dbd actuator 42 with various structures have been widely studied in many application fields such as wind resistance reduction 43 lift force enhance 44 de icing of aircraft wings 45 shock absorption of aircraft landing gear resistance reduction of wind turbine blades 42 43 etc the lmc structure in this study is different from the typical dbd actuator but similar to capillary or micro hollow cathode discharges which resulted an excitation streamer mainly in the lmc rather than near the plate electrode there are two main effects of plasma on air flow the first is the dynamic effect which also known as electric wind electrons and ions move directionally in the electric field collide with neutral particles and transfer their momentum and energy to the surrounding air which makes the nearby air move directionally and form an induced airflow thus changing the structure and shape of the flow field 46 the second is the thermal effect when part of the air in the air flow is ionized and accelerated the local temperature and pressure rise are produced which disturbs the air flow locally and changes the structure and shape of the flow field in order to verify whether the above theory is applicable on lmc dbd the effect of lmc discharge on bubbling and air flow is investigated referring to other researches on plasma actuator and gas liquid discharge the main parameters needing attention are applied voltage air flow rate water flow rate liquid electrode conductivity and applied voltage frequency therefore those parameters are studied in the following parts in this section unless otherwise specified the liquid in the treatment chamber is tap water the applied voltage is 18 4 kv at a frequency of 9 5 khz the air flow rate is 0 5 l min and the water flow rate is 200 ml min the dotted line in the figure represents the time node at which the discharge ignited or extinguish 3 2 1 enhancement of bubbling and reduction of pressure resistance in the lmc the effect of electric discharge on air flow is resulted by a series of comprehensive effects bubbling state would be a good reflection on air flow the macro phenomenon of the pressure resistance reduction in the lmc can be seen in fig 4 as showing in fig 4 a by adjusting the air pressure the resistance in the lmc is balanced and no bubble is produced in the absence of electric discharge upper once the discharge is ignited the pressure equilibrium is broken immediately and the air enters the water to produce continuous bubbles lower as showing in fig 4 b when adjusting the air flow rate to 0 1 l min due to the relatively small air flow rate bubbles are generated only on the right side of the channel upper however the bubbling range diffuses to almost the whole lmc in the stage of electric discharge lower this result indicates that the discharge occurs in the lmc can provide kinetic energy to the air and reduce the pressure resistance according to bernoulli s principle the sum of kinetic energy gravitational potential energy and pressure potential energy is constant because the electric discharge increases the kinetic energy of the air flow the pressure resistance of the lmc would decrease during the discharge fig 5 a shows the change of air pressure resistance during discharge at different applied voltages it can be seen that when the applied voltage is 14 8 kv the voltage is not enough to initiate the discharge and then no obvious pressure resistance change exists however when increasing the applied voltage to 16 0 kv the discharge in the lmc is ignited and the average air pressure resistance is reduced by 8 pa during the discharge time the reduction of the average air pressure resistance increases with the increase of applied voltage when the applied voltage is 20 4 kv the average pressure resistance reduction is 25 pa fig 5 b shows the change of relative air pressure resistance during electric discharge at different air flow rates because the initial pressure resistance is distinctly at different air flows so the relative pressure resistance is conducive to comparison it can be seen that when the airflow changes from 0 3 to 0 5 l min the average air pressure resistance reduces about 20 pa during the electric discharge time however when the air flow is increased to over 0 7 l min the average air pressure resistance decreases 13 pa during the discharge from the effect of air flow rate on electric discharge summarized in section 3 1 1 the increase in air flow rate can weaken the discharge in lmc which will decrease the reduction of air pressure resistance in addition with the increase in air flow rate the fluctuation amplitude of pressure resistance increases fig 6 a shows the change of pressure resistance during electric discharge at different water flow rates in the range of 0 300 ml min adjusting the water flow has no obvious effect on the pressure resistance however when water flow reaches to 400 ml min the water level floods the outlet as showing in fig 6 b the bubbles through the outlet directly so that the pressure resistance curve becomes different the water flow also causes a disturbance to the bubbling fig 6 c shows the effect of water flow rate on bubble rising path without electric discharge at the constant air flow rate of 0 9 l min it can be seen that when the water flow rate is 0 ml min the rising path of bubbles is vertical upward when increasing the water flow rate the rising path of bubbles begins to rotate and offset in the opposite direction from the water inlet when the water flow rate is higher than 400 ml min the rising path of bubbles would not only develop into a spiral but also shift sharply to the right the increase of water flow rate may promote the attached bubbles leaving the lmc and increase the gas liquid mass transfer this suppose will be further verified in a later section when the liquid is used as the cathode its electrical conductivities often has an important influence on the electric discharge process fig 7 a shows the pressure resistance change at different water conductivities it can be seen from the figure that the effect of liquid conductivity on pressure is not obvious this may be resulted by the minor influence of discharge impedance from the water conductivity change compared with the air gap fig 7 b shows the effect of electric discharge frequency on air pressure the average air pressure resistance reduction increases with the discharge frequency when increasing the discharge frequency the decay time of the charges accumulated on the dielectric surface between the two discharges is shortened which can enhance the discharge intensity in the next half cycle as a result the effect of electric discharge on air flow is enhanced 3 2 2 the mechanism of pressure resistance change fig 8 a shows the schematic of air pressure measurement in the dbd chamber similar to the previous section the only difference is to connect the low pressure end of the pressure transmitter to the atmosphere the temperature of the lmc is measured by a non contact infrared thermometer it can be seen from the fig 8 b that when the applied voltage is 14 8 kv the discharge cannot be ignited in the micro channel there is no obvious change of the measured pressure besides the fluctuation caused by bubbling when the applied voltage is raised to 16 0 kv the discharge can be ignited in the micro channel the air pressure still has no obvious change but the fluctuation became relatively stable during the electric discharge until applied voltage rising to 18 4 kv the phenomenon is similar when the applied voltage is further increased to over 19 4 kv the situation becomes a little different that the air pressure decreases slightly and the greater discharge voltage causes the larger reduction amplitude at higher applied voltage the pressure drops slightly the rise of temperature plays a key role in this process with the extension of electric discharge time the temperature gradually reaches the maximum and the pressure is reduced to the minimum once extinguish the electric discharge the temperature decreases and the air pressure recovers gradually the change of air pressure is not synchronous with the application time of electric discharge because of the delay of temperature change from the above results the air pressure in the dbd chamber is relatively stable this is the reason why this study focusses on the relative pressure difference but not the absolute pressure in fact on the effect of continuous bubbling and water circulation the heat generated during electric discharge is quickly removed from the system which can maintain the temperature at a low level therefore from the overall results the air pressure and temperature in the dbd gap is relatively stable during the discharge especially at low voltages so the pressure resistance reduction mentioned in the former section is mainly caused by the dynamic effect of the lmc electric discharge when there is no airflow the temperature of the discharge area increases gradually with the discharge duration time and the average surface temperature seems to increase linearly with the increase of frequency and square with the increase of voltage amplitude however after the existence of air flow the heat dissipation makes the thermal effect weaken 47 in the experimental system of this paper due to the cooling effect of air flow and water flow on the reactor the thermal effect can be considered very weak when the voltage is lower than 18 4 kv operation at lower temperature is beneficial to reduce the annihilation of free radicals thus improve the treatment performance fig 9 shows the schematic of electric wind flow measuring system the gas inlet pipe is not connected to the gas cylinder but to atmospheric the water ground electrode is replaced by a series of stainless steel meshes with different mesh numbers fig 10 a shows the electric wind flow rate measured by the gas mass flowmeter at the applied voltage of 17 2 kv with the increase of mesh number the air flow rate first increases and reaches to the maximum at a mesh number of 60 then decreases when the mesh becoming more and more dense the discharge becomes uniform and the streamers become smaller but more numerous which will contribute to the increase of electric wind flow however denser metal mesh will produce a larger resistance which will decrease the air flow rate therefore after further increasing the mesh number the electric wind flow presents a downward trend fig 10 b shows the electric wind flow rate with a 60 mesh stainless steel mesh cathode at different applied voltages with the increase of applied voltage the air flow rate increases at first but then decreases when the applied voltage is 16 0 kv due to the low voltage the discharge is not stable thus the wind flow rate has a large fluctuation when the voltage continues to increase the discharge becomes stable and the wind flow rate increase however when the applied voltage is up to 18 4 kv the wind flow rate does not increase as expected but decreases because of the change of discharge pattern fig 10 c show the discharge pictures at two different applied voltages 17 2 kv upper and 18 4 kv lower respectively when the applied voltage is 17 2 kv abundant of streamers are produced and spread uniformly however when the applied voltage is 18 4 kv the plasma streamers in the lmc converge together and tend to develop towards spark it can be inferred from the experimental results that the small and uniform streamer has strong ability to induce electric wind compared with spark like streamer besides combined with the previous section water electrode is easier to get uniform streamer than metal mesh electrode from the experimental results discussed above it is proved that the lmc dbd can generate electric wind thus reduce the air flow resistance and enhance the bubbling process in addition due to the good heat exchange ability of the reactor the macro temperature can be maintained in a low range this will provide appropriate conditions for the production and mass transfer of active particles the effect of lmc electric discharge on air flow has a positive effect on the treatment efficiency on the one hand the formation of bubbles at the gas liquid interface has improved while discharge is ignited the volume of a single bubble become smaller and the total bubble number increase this increases the area of the gas liquid interface and enhances the mass transfer efficiency on the other hand after discharge occurs the air flow is induced and the bubble dispersion is improved which is also conducive to mass transfer for the production of active particles the electric wind causes the charged particles to drift near the liquid surface which makes the production area of the active particles is closer to the gas liquid interface it is beneficial for the utilization of active particles especially for short time radicals 3 3 removal of tbbps by the lmc dbd bubbling reactor in the previous section some characteristics of the reactor have been verified there would be excellent pollutant treatment performance in theory therefore in this section we use tbbps as the simulation pollutant to verify the removal performance of the reactor fig 11 shows the tbbps uv vis spectrum evolution with electric discharge treatment time compared with studies of tbbpa 48 49 tbbps has larger absorption in the range of 250 330 nm in which sulfur carbon bond plays a key role the characteristic peaks of tbbps showed a downward trend with the discharge treatment time as a result tbbps is removed according to the working principle of this water treatment system the most important factors affecting the treatment efficiency are discharge voltage air flow and water flow therefore those parameters are studied in the following parts in this section unless otherwise specified the treatment solution is 500 ml the initial tbbps concentration is 0 2 mmol l the applied voltage is 17 2 kv at a frequency of 9 5 khz the air flow rate is 0 5 l min and the water flow rate is 300 ml min 3 3 1 effect of applied voltage on tbbps removal fig 12 a shows the effect of applied voltage on tbbps removal with the increase of applied voltage the removal rate increases at first and reaches the maximum at 18 4 kv after that it begins to decline in the low voltage stage the energy density increases with the increase of the applied voltage thus more active particles are produced and the degradation efficiency increases however when the applied voltage increasing continually the discharge pattern begins to change from streamer to spark like discharge and results a larger temperature rise the energy is consumed more by the physical effects like heat optical emission ionization etc in addition the high temperature would increase the speed and ratio of active particle decomposition which resulting in a declined pollutant removal efficiency fig 12 b shows the result of outlet gas uv vis spectrum at different discharge voltage the absorption peak at 254 7 mm is ozone molecule some of the active particles produced by discharge exist for a very short time while ozone exists longer thus can be gauged easily so the gas phase ozone measurement is used to demonstrate the change of active particle production with applied voltage the result is consistent with the tbbps removal and verifies the effect of applied voltage it should be noted that combined with the results in fig 5 a when the applied voltage is too high although the lower pressure resistance may improve the mass transfer it does not compensate for the negative effect of the decline in the production of active substances and the overall removal efficiency drops sharply there is a good correlation between ozone yield and removal ratio which indicate that ozone is an important active substance in the removal of tbbps in addition according to the research of other scholars on dbd reactor 50 51 hydroxyl free radical oh and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 also play an important role in the degradation of organic pollutants at the gas liquid interface the collision between electrons and water molecules is easy to produce oh and further reorganized into h2o2 52 the details are described by eqs 3 and 4 in addition tbbps is added to the sodium hydroxide solution as simulated polluted wastewater because of this alkaline condition is conducive to the dissolution of tbbps and more favorable for ozone to play a key role in tbbps removal under alkaline conditions ozone is more easily to dissolve for the air to the solution and converted to oh 53 the details are described by eqs 5 and 6 3 h 2 o e o h h e 4 o h o h h 2 o 2 5 o 3 o h h o 2 o 2 6 o 3 h o 2 o h o 2 o 2 effect of air flow rate on tbbps removal fig 13 shows the effect of air flow rate on tbbps degradation in the range of low air flow rate the removal of tbbps rises with the increase in air flow rate however through the contrast between the removal rates under 0 5 l min and 1 1 l min it is found that the improvement of the degradation rate is relatively limited even if the air flow rate has over doubled this is on account of the change of electric discharge situation which can be referred from section 3 1 1 3 3 2 effect of water flow rate on tbbps removal fig 14 shows the effect of water flow rate on tbbps removal with the increase of water flow rate the degradation efficiency within 15 min is significantly improved the experimental results are consistent with the suppose in section 3 2 1 this phenomenon is on account of the water flow vortex in the water treatment chamber which making the mixing more uniformly this effect becomes stronger with the increase of water flow rate at the same time when the water flow rate is lower than 200 ml min the degradation curve is slightly s shaped which is due to the formation of a certain concentration difference between the reactor and the water tank in the first few minutes 3 3 3 energy efficiency of tbbps removal by lmc excited dbd in other sections of this study to better understanding the characteristics of lmc only single one is used as for practical engineering applications in order to improve pollutant treatment capacity and increase energy efficiency it is often necessary to use multiple groups of lmc in order to compare the treatment capacity of a multi number lmcs as showing in fig 15 a three and six channels are arranged to treat the tbbps solution respectively except for the air flow rate is 1 l min the other initial conditions are the same as those listed in 3 3 fig 15 b reveals the treatment results and it can be seen that with the increase in the number of lmcs the treatment capacity has been improved meanwhile energy efficiency is also an important index for the reactor energy efficiency is calculated by substituting the parameters in fig 15 b the results are shown in table 1 which shows that multi number lmcs significantly improves energy efficiency compared with the study of tbbpa 50 which ee50 is about 16 67 g kwh multi number lmcs may have better energy efficiency in addition the air flow is also a crucial parameter according to the study in the previous section the increase of air flow can hinder the electric discharge while the increase of ventilation area by multi number lmcs actually reduces the hindrance so that the reactor can run under a larger flow efficiently under the condition of 1 l min air flow rate the treatment capacity and energy efficiency of 3 channels are approximately to 6 channels but it is predictable that the reactor with 6 channel has better potential under larger air flow rate 4 conclusion in this study a linear micro channel excited dbd bubbling water treatment reactor is proposed the electric discharge characteristics and treatment effect of the reactor are verified and most significant results can be summarized as follows in the initial stage of electric discharge the discharge in the lmc is always prior to the dbd space and the discharge intensity in the lmc is larger than that in the dbd space with the increase in air flow rate the discharge in the lmc is weakened and the overall discharge power decreases the electric discharge improves the bubbling process and induces air flow in the lmc through the measurement of the pressure resistance of the lmc it is found that the pressure resistance decreases during the electric discharge which is positively related to the applied voltage and discharge frequency and inversely related to the air flow rate and is nearly no affected by the water flow rate and solution conductivity in addition electric wind may be an important reason for air flow induced by micro channel discharge through the measurement of the electric wind in the lmc it is found that the intensity of the electric wind produced by uniform streamers is greater than that of bright spark like streamers a good removal efficiency has been achieved in the simulated wastewater with tbbps as the target pollutant when 500 ml 2 mmol l tbbps is treated at the applied voltage of 18 4 kv in 30 min the removal rate reached to 98 applied voltage air flow and water flow are the key parameters that affect the removal efficiency especially the appropriate voltage can produce active substances most effectively thus can have an excellent removal performance in addition the use of multiple lmcs can conspicuously improve the removal performance and energy efficiency author contributions xiaoping wang conceptualization methodology writing review
