introduction the adequate supply of water is a fundamental requirement for all life on earth and reservoirs are an effective method of storing and managing water for agriculture domestic use power generation and flood management renwick 2001 yang et al 2012 wu and chen 2013 qi et al 2016 thushara de silva and hornberger 2019 however the deposition of sediment poses significant problems due to the concentration of watershed flow and the insufficient ability of the sluice gates to release water morris and fan 2010 wisser et al 2013 kondolf et al 2014 in taiwan major typhoon events have caused sedimentation issues for reservoirs including typhoon aere in 2004 shihmen reservoir typhoon sinlaku in 2008 wushe reservoir and typhoon morakot in 2009 tzengwei reservoir chang et al 2008 chien and kuo 2011 huang et al 2018 historical data show that the aforementioned three extreme events resulted in almost 130 million cubic meters of sedimentation which represents a deposition of approximately 4 8 of the entire reservoir storage capacity in taiwan currently deposition in taiwanese reservoirs stands at 0 9 billion cubic meters and continues to rise huang et al 2019c therefore it is critical to identify a method of estimating the inflow of suspended sediment concentrations sscs wass et al 1997 dang et al 2010 warrick et al 2015 stryker et al 2018 kellner and hubbart 2019 soler et al 2020 to reduce deposition in reservoirs hwang 1985 chen and tsai 2017 generally reservoir desilting strategies adopt a dual approach in accordance with seasonal variations during the dry season marginal increases in the current storage capacity can be achieved by dredging existing sediment from the reservoir however both cost and environmental issues limit dredging on a large scale additionally dredging is inefficient as it is difficult to remove more material than is deposited by annual inflows fan and morris 1992 wang and wang 2010 wang et al 2018 therefore the most effective removal of sediment may be achieved during flood events by hydraulic sluicing from a technical perspective the release of sediment from existing sluice gates depends on a secure understanding of appropriate timing consequently the frequently occurring sediment flow pattern of density currents has been a highly discussed research topic over the past few decades the density current is a stratification phenomenon observed between two fluids of different densities and it has been studied using various approaches including physical models parker et al 1987 garcia 1994 hsu et al 2008 numerical models toniolo et al 2007 huang et al 2008 and observational data feng et al 1999 chung and lin 2011 chung et al 2013 these approaches are helpful in understanding the physical phenomena of density currents however a significant shortcoming of these approaches is their inability to rapidly predict density currents in the field moreover as the frequency of short duration heavy rainfall events continues to increase sedimentation disasters are destined to become more severe ovando et al 2016 steeb et al 2017 the latest trend in water and sediment management is to create an early warning system to provide the benefits of real time projections accuracy and reliability thus an interdisciplinary combination of traditional methods ml and mechanistic models seems to be a feasible approach mechanistic models have the advantages of mature technology and simple algorithms however obtaining accurate forecasts with these models requires a priori knowledge and high quality data ml models are characterized in the field of intelligent learning artificial intelligence ai and differ from mechanistic models by being purely data driven zhang et al 2020 mls have an excellent capacity for modeling nonlinear processes and has been successfully applied in hydrology and sediment transport over the last two decades yadav et al 2018 used genetic algorithm based ai models to estimate the suspended sediment yield in the mahanadi river basin india lu et al 2019 constructed quick simulation models using artificial neural networks and support vector machines svms with five sensitive parameters to simulate heavy metal concentrations both models performed well and demonstrated a coefficient of efficiency ce of 0 8 huang et al 2019a adopted multi objective genetic algorithms mogas and svms to forecast half hourly sscs and the results confirmed that the forecasting model also yielded reasonably acceptable forecasts chang et al 2020 integrated a self organizing map an svm and an autoregressive method to improve the poor representation of outflow sediment concentration extremes kaveh et al 2020 predicted the daily ssc in the schuylkill river in the united states using long short term memory lstm however as most studies have used just one or two ml approaches in sediment transportation modeling and have largely neglected the evaluation of the forecasting abilities of different ml models therefore a practical ai based model is developed in this study to forecast the temporal variations of sscs at bottom outlets in on site reservoirs instead of using a single ml based model different mls are adopted to develop multiple ml based ssc forecasting models to increase the ml training and testing data in addition to using measured ssc data simulated ssc data from a validated physical based density current simulation model are used moreover a switched forecasting sf strategy is developed to optimally integrate the forecasts from multiple ml based models to sum up this study makes two key novel achievements in providing more accurate ssc forecasts during flood events the first is the development of multiple ml based ssc forecasting models and the second is the optimal integration of their results the proposed forecasting model is applied to different typhoons to provide accurate 1 to 3 h ahead ssc forecasts for a reservoir s main outlets by combining multiple ml models and the sf strategy the proposed model is expected to provide efficient and accurate ssc forecasts that can be used as a reference for reservoir sedimentation and storage capacity management that will be useful in increasing the availability of water resources and solving the predicted water crisis hughes 2019 the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the proposed switched ml based prediction approach section 3 introduces an actual application of the proposed approach and the corresponding results are discussed in section 4 finally conclusions are provided at the end of the paper 2 switched ml based approach a switched ml based approach is proposed to provide accurate forecasts of reservoir sscs the dual step approach comprises an ml and sf step and is presented in fig 1 in the first ml step different ml techniques are adopted to develop multiple ml based forecasting models thus the construction of each ssc forecasting model is based on a single special ml technique the second step develops an sf strategy which involves switching forecasts between different ml based models to combine the forecasts provided in the ml step i e the first ml step builds an ensemble ml based forecasting system and the second sf step optimally integrates the forecasts from multiple ml based models to yield the most accurate outcome that is this study s proposed approach uses the optimal results from multiple ml approaches in the sf step rather than simply using the results from a single ml based model therefore it is expected that the proposed approach will be useful for constructing an effective and accurate reservoir ssc forecasting model sections 2 2 and 2 3 introduce both sf and ml steps respectively 2 1 sf step based on studies by lian et al 2015 and wu and lin 2017 the sf step is developed in this study s proposed approach in the sf step switching between the best performing ml algorithms provides more accurate forecasts fig 2 presents the structure of the sf step as fig 2 shows multiple ml models are combined based on their performance during the past time current time two parameters must be determined during the sf step the number of hours that have passed n and the number of ml models used m on the basis of the forecasting performance during the n of each ml model the best m ml models are identified the simple average of these m ml models is calculated and adopted as the best forecasting result for the subsequent future time period the values of n and m may vary for different lead times the members of the m ml models will also be different for different lead times for example at a certain current time the m mls may be ml 1 ml 3 and ml 4 if m 3 due to the recent superior performance of these models however at the following time t 1 the three best ml models may be switched for others such as ml 2 ml 4 and ml 6 the root mean square error rmse is used to evaluate the forecasting performance of each ml model the sf step can be expressed by the following equations in eq 1 r m s e i means the rmse value of the i th ml model ml i and f and o are the forecast and observation respectively additionally f t a i t a j means the forecast of ml i at an earlier time t a j and the ml model is built for forecasting with a lead time of a hours the rmse value is calculated on the basis of the forecast and observation during the recent time period i e from a to a n hours ago 1 r m s e i 1 n j 0 n f t a i t a j o t a t a j 2 then the best m ml models are detected by sorting the r m s e i values on the basis of the use of these m ml models the optimal forecasting results are obtained using eq 2 in which f t a i t a means the forecast at time t a superscript from ml i subscript which is built for forecasting with a lead time of a h subscript 2 f t a t a 1 m i 1 m f t a i t a the aforementioned processes are performed for different forecast lead times to obtain the corresponding optimal results 2 2 ml step in the ml step multiple ml approaches are used to build multiple forecasting models ml uses computer algorithms to construct a mathematical model for making predictions or decisions based on amounts of training data after training an ml model can learn the complex relationship between input and output data thus new input data that are obtained in the future can be processed through the trained ml model to yield desired outcomes deb et al 2017 the seven main ml algorithms used herein multilayer perceptron mlp random forest rf svm deep neural network dnn recurrent neural network rnn lstm network and gated recurrent unit gru are described briefly in the following paragraphs mlp is a forward transfer like neural network that was first proposed in 1986 rumelhart et al 1986 mlps are the most common type of neural network and have already been widely applied in hydrological research rf is an example of an ensemble ml method breiman 2001 as rf learning can be simplified and provides better prediction performance than traditional methods without significantly increasing computational complexity it has been widely applied over recent years svm is a special supervised ml method that was first developed by vapnik 1995 to solve the problem of statistical classification because svm is based on the use of structured risk minimization and efficiency cristianini and shawe taylor 2000 it has been widely applied in various fields over recent years where it has achieved quite good results in classification and forecasting please see rumelhart et al 1986 breiman 2001 and vapnik 1995 for further details on mlp rf and svm dnns are mlps with multiple layers between the input and output layers and were first proposed in 2006 hinton and salakhutdinov 2006 the multiple hidden layers function as mathematical manipulations providing dnns with powerful capabilities of modeling complex nonlinear relationships however this type of learning involves the common issues of overfitting and lengthy computation time to solve these problems dnns adopt the rectified linear unit as the activation function along with the restricted boltzmann machine thus dnns typically provide state of the art results across various fields please refer to hinton and salakhutdinov 2006 for further information on dnns standard rnns elman 1990 lstms hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 and grus cho et al 2014 have all achieved good results in securing long term temporal dependency the original rnn prototype was first proposed in 1990 by the addition of a recursive item into a conventional mlp neural network although rnns are suitable for forecasting time series related problems they are very time consuming lstms differ from traditional rnns because of the internal chain structures of the hidden layer in lstms the neurons in the hidden layer are changed to a set of recurrently connected subnets as memory cells each block contains self connected neurons and three gates the input output and forget gates the main structure of a gru is similar to that of an lstm however in a gru the three gates are changed into two gates by combining the input and forget gates into one update gate thus both lstms and grus avoid the problem of long term dependence in design and have a good effect on identification even with a lengthy intermediate timing moreover as grus have fewer parameters than lstms this results in shorter computational times for mathematical details on rnn lstm and gru algorithms please see e g cho et al 2014 khan and sarfaraz 2019 3 actual application 3 1 shihmen reservoir the shihmen reservoir is the first multi objective reservoir in taiwan and provides agricultural irrigation domestic water supply power generation and flood management with a designed storage capacity of 309 million m3 the reservoir is ranked the second largest in taiwan however several major flood events since 1963 have caused sedimentation problems which are ongoing consequently as the deposition rate has reached 35 the reservoir s remaining storage capacity has been reduced to 201 million m3 furthermore because of the increase in annual inflow of sediment following damage to the watershed landform by the 1999 chichi earthquake the lifespan of the shihmen reservoir might have been overestimated therefore it is critical to decrease the deposition rate and to maintain both storage capacity and water supply functions fig 3 shows the location of the shihmen reservoir in northern taiwan the major sluice gates of the reservoir are located at the front of the dam the designed discharge of the spillways diversion tunnel shihmen main canal and power plant intake are 11 400 2 400 18 4 and 137 2 m3 s respectively two main outlets shihmen main canal smc and power plant intake ppi are used as the study targets the elevations of the ppi and smc outlets are 173 and 192 5 m a s l respectively on the basis of historical hydrograph data typhoon aere caused major damage to the shihmen reservoir in 2004 and resulted in a permanent reduction in storage capacity of 8 the monitoring data have become critical and were collected at each sluice gate since typhoon sinlaku in 2008 the water resources agency expended monitoring and began to measure the ssc data along the shihmen reservoir at section nos 24 20 15 12 and 7 after the year 2012 please refer to fig 3 s24 section no 24 consequently the shihmen reservoir now has more ssc dataset compared to the other reservoirs in taiwan currently one measuring point in the lofu s32 and five measuring platforms which including six vertical measuring points in s24 and eight points in s20 s15 s12 and s07 are installed along the shoreline of the reservoir fig 3 also contains the locations of the aforementioned measuring sites and the measured elevations at the platforms 3 2 historical typhoons during the period from 2017 to 2019 there were no major typhoon events in taiwan therefore inflow and outflow discharge data and sediment data for the shihmen reservoir were collected between 2008 and 2016 the study uses ten typhoons including the fongwong sinlaku and jangmi typhoons in 2008 typhoon morakot in 2009 typhoon saola in 2012 the soulik and trami typhoons in 2013 the soudelor and dujuan typhoons in 2015 and typhoon megi in 2016 table 1 shows the total volumes of inflow outflow discharge sediment and ssc data of the ten typhoons used in this study measured ssc data are available for the five recent typhoons because the ssc data are measured since 2013 for the five typhoons without measured ssc data a density current model i e srh 2d is used to generate the simulated ssc data srh 2d was developed on the basis of the reservoir sedimentation mechanism and the sensitive parameter was pre calibrated using the physical model lai et al 2015 after careful validation srh 2d is helpful to provide accurate density current flow patterns and the variation of ssc during typhoons huang et al 2019b in this study three typhoons in 2015 and 2016 soudelor dujuan and megi are used to validate the applicability of srh 2d table 2 presents the validation result which is a comparison between the measured and simulated density current concentrations at the bottom outlets the measured and simulated density current concentration are 6 49 and 7 86 typhoon soudelor 8 87 and 5 25 typhoon dujuan and 5 29 and 6 47 typhoon megi respectively the maximum and minimum absolute errors are 3 62 and 1 16 respectively and the difference in the total density current concentration is 1 07 consequently srh 2d is validated for application to different typhoons to obtain accurate ssc outcomes thus the model is applied to the five typhoons that occurred between 2008 and 2012 table 1 to generate ssc data for ml models additionally srh 2d is used to fill in the missing measured data from the last five typhoon events finally ten typhoons are divided into training and testing events at a ratio of 2 1 with three typhoons sinlaku saola and dujuan for ml testing and the remaining for ml training 3 3 model construction based on the use of the proposed switched ml based approach the construction of practical ai based ssc forecasting models is shown in fig 4 first the measured and simulated ssc at different sites are collected second seven ml approaches are used to build the ml based ssc forecasting models with different lead time for example a total of six svm based models are built respectively for 0 5 1 1 5 2 2 5 and 3 h ahead forecasts on the basis of the performance during the past n the best m mls are identified although the member of the best m mls may differ for different times finally the optimal results are obtained by switching using the forecasts from the best m mls in model construction it is critical to choose appropriate parameters in this study these include the length of time that has passed hours n the number of ml approaches used m and the inputs and parameters of each method all parameters are determined by the grid search method using training data for each parameter the search range is set by the upper limit u 1 and the lower limit l 1 the search step size is set by the number of grids if the number of grids is set to p1 the distance between the two grids is δ p 1 u 1 l 1 p 1 by calculating the performance measures corresponding to all grids the best performing parameter combination can be determined in this study the use of mls is based on the keras and scikit learn libraries in the python programming language scikit learn is the basis for mlp svm and rf algorithms https scikit learn org stable whereas dnn rnn lstm and gru are based on keras https www tensorflow org api docs python tf keras 3 4 performance measures to evaluate the differences between observations and forecasts four measures are used rmse ce coefficient correlation cc and critical success index csi wilks 2011 rmse is a common measure representing the errors between observations and forecasts lower rmse values indicate smaller errors ce and cc are commonly employed to evaluate the forecasting ability of models higher cc and ce values indicate a better agreement between the observations and forecasts the ce and cc calculations are then given as follows 3a c e 1 i 1 n o i f i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 3b c c i 1 n o i o f i f i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n f i f 2 where o i and f i are the observation and forecast at time i respectively n is the number of data and o and f are the averages of the observations and forecasts respectively csi is also used to evaluate the accuracy and is expressed in percentage form the calculation of csi is given as 4 c s i c ˆ h c ˆ h c ˆ m 100 where c ˆ h and c ˆ m are the number of hits and misses respectively a hit indicates that the difference between the forecasts and observations is less than 10 whereas a miss means that the difference is greater than 10 a perfect forecast is obtained when the value of rmse is 0 the value of cc or ce is 1 and the value of csi is 100 4 results and discussions 4 1 the optimal inputs and parameters used for ml based models in this study measured and simulated ssc data at 10 measuring sites s32 s24 s20r s20 l s15 s12r s12 l s07 smc and ppi as shown in fig 3 are used as potential model inputs the ssc data at the current and previous time are involved by the grid search method the final optimal inputs used to forecast the sscs at the ppi and smc outlets are determined and presented in table 3 for example the optimal inputs for one step ahead forecasting at the ppi outlet are the previous ssc data at s20r nine and eight steps behind s15 seven and six steps behind s12 l six and five steps behind s12r six and five steps behind s07 four and three steps behind and ppi six five four three two and one step behind and the present step it is discovered that s32 s24 and s20 l are not selected as final inputs it is also observed that the further a section is from the target outlet the more steps behind the previous data are adopted in addition as to different forecast lead times the maximum time gap between the inputs and output is approximately ten steps 5 h for instance six step ahead forecasts at the ppi outlet employ data that are four steps behind the ssc outlet at s20r in conclusion data at sites far away from the outlets and at times behind 5 h are not selected as inputs of mls the optimal ml parameters are also determined via the grid search method the parameters which have a significant influence on modeling performance are investigated herein taking mlp as an example five main parameters number of neurons in the hidden layer activation function initial learning rate solver and batch are optimized the optimal results of main parameters of seven ml algorithms are presented in table 4 additionally table 5 contains the number of hours that have passed n and the number of ml models used m in the sf step which are critical parameters in building the proposed reservoir ssc forecasting model the data during n are used as inputs and the best performing ml models m are used to calculate the ensemble mean results given in tables 3 5 are determined using the grid search method based on the use of training data and fixed during the testing phase 4 2 comparison between each ml based model forecasting performance of each ml based model is evaluated by four measures rmse ce cc and csi rmse and ce are the most commonly used to obtain consistent conclusions and they feature in the following discussions the results of the other two measures are included in the supplementary materials to this paper thus in table 6 the rmse and ce values of each ml based model during the training and testing phases are given additionally fig 5 ppi outlet and fig 6 smc outlet contain the comparisons of the forecasted sscs resulting from each ml based model as well as the observations from the testing phase generally each ml based model exhibits a decrease in performance as the forecast lead time increases at the ppi outlet the svm has the best training and testing performance for one step ahead forecasts i e a lead time of 0 5 h when forecasting with a longer lead time dnn performs best for 1 h ahead time and lstm performs best for 1 5 2 2 5 and 3 h lead time some models overestimate the peak values i e typhoon sinlaku fig 5 and rf forecasts differ most from the observations at the smc outlet svm always has the best testing performance for one to six step ahead forecasts the lead times of 0 5 3 h although the model with the best training performance varies along with other values most models capture the peak values i e typhoon dujuan fig 6 however consistent with the results in fig 5 a time lag error is evident and increases according to the forecast lead time among the models rf forecasts still have the greatest difference between forecasts and observations compared to other ml models therefore the aforementioned results confirm that it is difficult to develop a comprehensive forecasting using one specific type of mls thus the use of ensemble mls is therefore recommended to obtain more accurate results sharghi et al 2018 in addition the overall testing performance for the smc outlet is better than that of the ppi outlet this is because the ppi outlet is at a lower elevation than the smc outlet so the ssc data values at the ppi outlet are higher and more complicated as shown in figs 5 and 6 the superior performance of the shallow ml approaches svm during the testing phase at the smc outlet may also be a contributing factor generally for forecasting more complicated ssc data at the ppi outlet deep ml approaches dnn and lstm outperform shallow ones especially for long lead times 4 3 performance of the proposed switched ml based approach the model built by the proposed switched ml based approach is referred to as switched ml hereafter the single ml based model with the best performance in the training phase i e the lowest training rmse values is hereafter used as the benchmark and referred to as best train it should be noted that for different outlets or forecast lead times the best train model could be any of the ml based models the simple average of all seven ml based models is also used for comparison and is termed conventional hereafter comparisons of the ssc results from switched ml conventional and best train models during testing are presented in fig 7 results confirm satisfactory performance of all three models the forecasts with shorter lead times 0 5 1 0 h and longer lead times 1 5 3 0 h agree well with the observations for the three models although there is an increase in the time lag error as the forecast lead time increases corresponding rmse values are listed in table 7 the switched ml model performs the best for different forecast lead times with the exception of the lead time of 0 5 h when the lead time is 0 5 h the best train model has the best performance with the switched ml model in second place this could be explained by the fact that one step ahead forecasting does not require the use of a complex approach therefore a single ml based model is sufficient with a lead time of 0 5 h the switched ml model always performs the best whereas the conventional and the best train models exchange leads for example using the switched ml model instead of the conventional model decreases the rmse values from 1 87 to 1 39 103ppm at the smc and from 6 62 to 6 17 103ppm at the ppi outlet respectively for a lead time of 1 h a lead time of 3 h generates a decrease in rmse values from 3 49 to 2 68 103ppm at the smc and from 10 92 to 9 48 103ppm at the ppi outlet respectively this translates to average improvements of 16 and 18 for lead times of 1 and 3 h respectively additional details for the improvements rmse using the switched ml model instead of the conventional model for different forecast lead times are presented in fig 8 similarly the switched ml model outperforms the best train model on average using the switched ml model instead of the best train model provides rmse improvements of 18 and 4 respectively for lead times of 1 and 3 h in summary the switched ml model generally improves the performance of reservoir ssc forecasting more accurate ssc forecasts are obtained using the switched ml model instead of either the conventional or single ml based model particularly when forecasting 1 and 3 h ahead using the proposed approach high performing ml models are selected to yield more accurate forecasts this selection process can also be seen as a simple weighted averaging method if m ml models that perform better are selected from seven ml models the weight for the selected m ml models is 1 m for the remaining ml models the weight is 0 using the proposed approach the optimal integration of the forecasts from some high performing ml models will be obtained to increase the accuracy of the results however the final forecasting performance will still depend on the performance of the used ml models if all ml models yield inaccurate results the improvement will be only slight or even non existent future research could use different weights for the selected ml models when more study data have been collected 5 conclusions this study proposed a switched ml based approach to increase the accuracy of reservoir ssc forecasts the proposed approach comprises an ml step and sf step first a total of seven different mls were used individually to build ml based models then the forecasts from multiple ml based models were optimally integrated in real time to provide the best results the study made two fundamental achievements the development of the multiple ml based ssc forecasting models and the optimal integration of the results from these models by switching between different high performing ml based models and eliminating the worst results forecasting accuracy is increased the effectiveness of the proposed approach was tested by applying it to an actual scenario the results indicate that both svm and lstm outperform than the other single ml based models when compared with each single ml based model and the conventional model i e the simple average of multiple ml based models the switched ml model i e the optimal integration of multiple ml based models demonstrated the best performance especially when forecasting 1 and 3 h ahead in conclusion the proposed switched ml based approach facilitates the production of more accurate ssc forecasts these can be a helpful reference in the management of sedimentation for efficient reservoir operation the proposed approach can be seen as a simple weighted averaging method that is applicable in different fields the approach will enable more accurate results to be obtained by optimally integrating the forecasts from some better performing ml models however the final forecasting performance depends on the performance of individual ml models if all models yield inaccurate results only a negligible improvement will be made if at all future research could use different weights for the selected ml models when more study data have been collected besides errors in the simulated ssc data may reduce the performance of the ssc forecasting model in the future real time monitoring data can be used to produce more accurate flood inundation forecast maps in the meantime the combination of a novel numerical model and ml may well improve the proposed model s performance author contributions cheng chia huang conceptualization data curation methodology formal analysis software writing original draft writing review editing ming jui chang

introduction the adequate supply of water is a fundamental requirement for all life on earth and reservoirs are an effective method of storing and managing water for agriculture domestic use power generation and flood management renwick 2001 yang et al 2012 wu and chen 2013 qi et al 2016 thushara de silva and hornberger 2019 however the deposition of sediment poses significant problems due to the concentration of watershed flow and the insufficient ability of the sluice gates to release water morris and fan 2010 wisser et al 2013 kondolf et al 2014 in taiwan major typhoon events have caused sedimentation issues for reservoirs including typhoon aere in 2004 shihmen reservoir typhoon sinlaku in 2008 wushe reservoir and typhoon morakot in 2009 tzengwei reservoir chang et al 2008 chien and kuo 2011 huang et al 2018 historical data show that the aforementioned three extreme events resulted in almost 130 million cubic meters of sedimentation which represents a deposition of approximately 4 8 of the entire reservoir storage capacity in taiwan currently deposition in taiwanese reservoirs stands at 0 9 billion cubic meters and continues to rise huang et al 2019c therefore

season marginal increases in the current storage capacity can be achieved by dredging existing sediment from the reservoir however both cost and environmental issues limit dredging on a large scale additionally dredging is inefficient as it is difficult to remove more material than is deposited by annual inflows fan and morris 1992 wang and wang 2010 wang et al 2018 therefore the most effective removal of sediment may be achieved during flood events by hydraulic sluicing from a technical perspective the release of sediment from existing sluice gates depends on a secure understanding of appropriate timing consequently the frequently occurring sediment flow pattern of density currents has been a highly discussed research topic over the past few decades the density current is a stratification phenomenon observed between two fluids of different densities and it has been studied using various approaches including physical models parker et al 1987 garcia 1994 hsu et al 2008 numerical models toniolo et al 2007 huang et al 2008 and observational data feng et al 1999 chung and lin 2011 chung et al 2013 these approaches are helpful in understanding the physical phenomena of density currents however a significant shortcoming of these approaches is their inability to rapidly predict density currents in the field moreover as the frequency of short duration heavy rainfall events continues to increase sedimentation disasters are destined to become more severe ovando et al 2016 steeb et al 2017 the latest trend in water and sediment management is to create an early warning system to provide the benefits of real time projections accuracy and reliability thus an interdisciplinary combination of traditional methods ml and mechanistic models seems to be a feasible approach mechanistic models have the advantages of mature technology and simple algorithms however obtaining accurate forecasts with these models requires a priori knowledge and high quality data ml models are characterized in the field of intelligent learning artificial intelligence ai and differ from mechanistic models by being purely data driven zhang et al 2020 mls have an excellent capacity for modeling nonlinear processes and has been successfully applied in hydrology and sediment transport over the last two decades yadav et al 2018 used genetic algorithm based ai models to estimate the suspended sediment yield in the mahanadi river basin india lu et al 2019 constructed quick simulation models using artificial neural networks and support vector machines svms with five sensitive parameters to simulate heavy metal concentrations both models performed well and demonstrated a coefficient of efficiency ce of 0 8 huang et al 2019a adopted multi objective genetic algorithms mogas and svms to forecast half hourly sscs and the results confirmed that the forecasting model also yielded reasonably acceptable forecasts chang et al 2020 integrated a self organizing map an svm and an autoregressive method to improve the poor representation of outflow sediment concentration extremes kaveh et al 2020 predicted the daily ssc in the schuylkill river in the united states using long short term memory lstm however as most studies have used just one or two ml approaches in sediment transportation modeling and have largely neglected the evaluation of the forecasting abilities of different ml models therefore a practical ai based model is developed in this study to forecast the temporal variations of sscs at bottom outlets in on site reservoirs instead of using a single ml based model different mls are adopted to develop multiple ml based ssc forecasting models to increase the ml training and testing data in addition to using measured ssc data simulated ssc data from a validated physical based density current simulation model are used moreover a switched forecasting sf strategy is developed to optimally integrate the forecasts from multiple ml based models to sum up this study makes two key novel achievements in providing more accurate ssc forecasts during flood events the first is the development of multiple ml based ssc forecasting models and the second is the optimal integration of their results the proposed forecasting model is applied to different typhoons to provide accurate 1 to 3 h ahead ssc forecasts for a reservoir s main outlets by combining multiple ml models and the sf strategy the proposed model is expected to provide efficient and accurate ssc forecasts that can be used as a reference for reservoir sedimentation and storage capacity management that will be useful in increasing the availability of water resources and solving the predicted water crisis hughes 2019 the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the proposed switched ml based prediction approach section 3 introduces an actual application of the proposed approach and the corresponding results are discussed in section 4 finally conclusions are provided at the end of the paper 2 switched ml based approach a switched ml based approach is proposed to provide accurate forecasts of reservoir sscs the dual step approach comprises an ml and sf step and is presented in fig 1 in the first ml step different ml techniques are adopted to develop multiple ml based forecasting models thus the construction of each ssc forecasting model is based on a single special ml technique the second step develops an sf strategy which involves switching forecasts between different ml based models to combine the forecasts provided in the ml step i e the first ml step builds an ensemble ml based forecasting system and the second sf step optimally integrates the forecasts from multiple ml based models to yield the most accurate outcome that is this study s proposed approach uses the optimal results from multiple ml approaches in the sf step rather than simply using the results from a single ml based model therefore it is expected that the proposed approach will be useful for constructing an effective and accurate reservoir ssc forecasting model sections 2 2 and 2 3 introduce both sf and ml steps respectively 2 1 sf step based on studies by lian et al 2015 and wu and lin 2017 the sf step is developed in this study s proposed approach in the sf step switching between the best performing ml algorithms provides more accurate forecasts fig 2 presents the structure of the sf step as fig 2 shows multiple ml models are combined based on their performance during the past time current time two parameters must be determined during the sf step the number of hours that have passed n and the number of ml models used m on the basis of the forecasting performance during the n of each ml model the best m ml models are identified the simple average of these m ml models is calculated and adopted as the best forecasting result for the subsequent future time period the values of n and m may vary for different lead times the members of the m ml models will also be different for different lead times for example at a certain current time the m mls may be ml 1 ml 3 and ml 4 if m 3 due to the recent superior performance of these models however at the following time t 1 the three best ml models may be switched for others such as ml 2 ml 4 and ml 6 the root mean square error rmse is used to evaluate the forecasting performance of each ml model the sf step can be expressed by the following equations in eq 1 r m s e i means the rmse value of the i th ml model ml i and f and o are the forecast and observation respectively additionally f t a i t a j means the forecast of ml i at an earlier time t a j and the ml model is built for forecasting with a lead time of a hours the rmse value is calculated on the basis of the forecast and observation during the recent time period i e from a to a n hours ago 1 r m s e i 1 n j 0 n f t a i t a j o t a t a j 2 then the best m ml models are detected by sorting the r m s e i values on the basis of the use of these m ml models the optimal forecasting results are obtained using eq 2 in which f t a i t a means the forecast at time t a superscript from ml i subscript which is built for forecasting with a lead time of a h subscript 2 f t a t a 1 m i 1 m f t a i t a the aforementioned processes are performed for different forecast lead times to obtain the corresponding optimal results 2 2 ml step in the ml step multiple ml approaches are used to build multiple forecasting models ml uses computer algorithms to construct a mathematical model for making predictions or decisions based on amounts of training data after training an ml model can learn the complex relationship between input and output data thus new input data that are obtained in the future can be processed through the trained ml model to yield desired outcomes deb et al 2017 the seven main ml algorithms used herein multilayer perceptron mlp random forest rf svm deep neural network dnn recurrent neural network rnn lstm network and gated recurrent unit gru are described briefly in the following paragraphs mlp is a forward transfer like neural network that was first proposed in 1986 rumelhart et al 1986 mlps are the most common type of neural network and have already been widely applied in hydrological research rf is an example of an ensemble ml method breiman 2001 as rf learning can be simplified and provides better prediction performance than traditional methods without significantly increasing computational complexity it has been widely applied over recent years svm is a special supervised ml method that was first developed by vapnik 1995 to solve the problem of statistical classification because svm is based on the use of structured risk minimization and efficiency cristianini and shawe taylor 2000 it has been widely applied in various fields over recent years where it has achieved quite good results in classification and forecasting please see rumelhart et al 1986 breiman 2001 and vapnik 1995 for further details on mlp rf and svm dnns are mlps with multiple layers between the input and output layers and were first proposed in 2006 hinton and salakhutdinov 2006 the multiple hidden layers function as mathematical manipulations providing dnns with powerful capabilities of modeling complex nonlinear relationships however this type of learning involves the common issues of overfitting and lengthy computation time to solve these problems dnns adopt the rectified linear unit as the activation function along with the restricted boltzmann machine thus dnns typically provide state of the art results across various fields please refer to hinton and salakhutdinov 2006 for further information on dnns standard rnns elman 1990 lstms hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 and grus cho et al 2014 have all achieved good results in securing long term temporal dependency the original rnn prototype was first proposed in 1990 by the addition of a recursive item into a conventional mlp neural network although rnns are suitable for forecasting time series related problems they are very time consuming lstms differ from traditional rnns because of the internal chain structures of the hidden layer in lstms the neurons in the hidden layer are changed to a set of recurrently connected subnets as memory cells each block contains self connected neurons and three gates the input output and forget gates the main structure of a gru is similar to that of an lstm however in a gru the three gates are changed into two gates by combining the input and forget gates into one update gate thus both lstms and grus avoid the problem of long term dependence in design and have a good effect on identification even with a lengthy intermediate timing moreover as grus have fewer parameters than lstms this results in shorter computational times for mathematical details on rnn lstm and gru algorithms please see e g cho et al 2014 khan and sarfaraz 2019 3 actual application 3 1 shihmen reservoir the shihmen reservoir is the first multi objective reservoir in taiwan and provides agricultural irrigation domestic water supply power generation and flood management with a designed storage capacity of 309 million m3 the reservoir is ranked the second largest in taiwan however several major flood events since 1963 have caused sedimentation problems which are ongoing consequently as the deposition rate has reached 35 the reservoir s remaining storage capacity has been reduced to 201 million m3 furthermore because of the increase in annual inflow of sediment following damage to the watershed landform by the 1999 chichi earthquake the lifespan of the shihmen reservoir might have been overestimated therefore it is critical to decrease the deposition rate and to maintain both storage capacity and water supply functions fig 3 shows the location of the shihmen reservoir in northern taiwan the major sluice gates of the reservoir are located at the front of the dam the designed discharge of the spillways diversion tunnel shihmen main canal and power plant intake are 11 400 2 400 18 4 and 137 2 m3 s respectively two main outlets shihmen main canal smc and power plant intake ppi are used as the study targets the elevations of the ppi and smc outlets are 173 and 192 5 m a s l respectively on the basis of historical hydrograph data typhoon aere caused major damage to the shihmen reservoir in 2004 and resulted in a permanent reduction in storage capacity of 8 the monitoring data have become critical and were collected at each sluice gate since typhoon sinlaku in 2008 the water resources agency expended monitoring and began to measure the ssc data along the shihmen reservoir at section nos 24 20 15 12 and 7 after the year 2012 please refer to fig 3 s24 section no 24 consequently the shihmen reservoir now has more ssc dataset compared to the other reservoirs in taiwan currently one measuring point in the lofu s32 and five measuring platforms which including six vertical measuring points in s24 and eight points in s20 s15 s12 and s07 are installed along the shoreline of the reservoir fig 3 also contains the locations of the aforementioned measuring sites and the measured elevations at the platforms 3 2 historical typhoons during the period from 2017 to 2019 there were no major typhoon events in taiwan therefore inflow and outflow discharge data and sediment data for the shihmen reservoir were collected between 2008 and 2016 the study uses ten typhoons including the fongwong sinlaku and jangmi typhoons in 2008 typhoon morakot in 2009 typhoon saola in 2012 the soulik and trami typhoons in 2013 the soudelor and dujuan typhoons in 2015 and typhoon megi in 2016 table 1 shows the total volumes of inflow outflow discharge sediment and ssc data of the ten typhoons used in this study measured ssc data are available for the five recent typhoons because the ssc data are measured since 2013 for the five typhoons without measured ssc data a density current model i e srh 2d is used to generate the simulated ssc data srh 2d was developed on the basis of the reservoir sedimentation mechanism and the sensitive parameter was pre calibrated using the physical model lai et al 2015 after careful validation srh 2d is helpful to provide accurate density current flow patterns and the variation of ssc during typhoons huang et al 2019b in this study three typhoons in 2015 and 2016 soudelor dujuan and megi are used to validate the applicability of srh 2d table 2 presents the validation result which is a comparison between the measured and simulated density current concentrations at the bottom outlets the measured and simulated density current concentration are 6 49 and 7 86 typhoon soudelor 8 87 and 5 25 typhoon dujuan and 5 29 and 6 47 typhoon megi respectively the maximum and minimum absolute errors are 3 62 and 1 16 respectively and the difference in the total density current concentration is 1 07 consequently srh 2d is validated for application to different typhoons to obtain accurate ssc outcomes thus the model is applied to the five typhoons that occurred between 2008 and 2012 table 1 to generate ssc data for ml models additionally srh 2d is used to fill in the missing measured data from the last five typhoon events finally ten typhoons are divided into training and testing events at a ratio of 2 1 with three typhoons sinlaku saola and dujuan for ml testing and the remaining for ml training 3 3 model construction based on the use of the proposed switched ml based approach the construction of practical ai based ssc forecasting models is shown in fig 4 first the measured and simulated ssc at different sites are collected second seven ml approaches are used to build the ml based ssc forecasting models with different lead time for example a total of six svm based models are built respectively for 0 5 1 1 5 2 2 5 and 3 h ahead forecasts on the basis of the performance during the past n the best m mls are identified although the member of the best m mls may differ for different times finally the optimal results are obtained by switching using the forecasts from the best m mls in model construction it is critical to choose appropriate parameters in this study these include the length of time that has passed hours n the number of ml approaches used m and the inputs and parameters of each method all parameters are determined by the grid search method using training data for each parameter the search range is set by the upper limit u 1 and the lower limit l 1 the search step size is set by the number of grids if the number of grids is set to p1 the distance between the two grids is δ p 1 u 1 l 1 p 1 by calculating the performance measures corresponding to all grids the best performing parameter combination can be determined in this study the use of mls is based on the keras and scikit learn libraries in the python programming language scikit learn is the basis for mlp svm and rf algorithms https scikit learn org stable whereas dnn rnn lstm and gru are based on keras https www tensorflow org api docs python tf keras 3 4 performance measures to evaluate the differences between observations and forecasts four measures are used rmse ce coefficient correlation cc and critical success index csi wilks 2011 rmse is a common measure representing the errors between observations and forecasts lower rmse values indicate smaller errors ce and cc are commonly employed to evaluate the forecasting ability of models higher cc and ce values indicate a better agreement between the observations and forecasts the ce and cc calculations are then given as follows 3a c e 1 i 1 n o i f i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 3b c c i 1 n o i o f i f i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n f i f 2 where o i and f i are the observation and forecast at time i respectively n is the number of data and o and f are the averages of the observations and forecasts respectively csi is also used to evaluate the accuracy and is expressed in percentage form the calculation of csi is given as 4 c s i c ˆ h c ˆ h c ˆ m 100 where c ˆ h and c ˆ m are the number of hits and misses respectively a hit indicates that the difference between the forecasts and observations is less than 10 whereas a miss means that the difference is greater than 10 a perfect forecast is obtained when the value of rmse is 0 the value of cc or ce is 1 and the value of csi is 100 4 results and discussions 4 1 the optimal inputs and parameters used for ml based models in this study measured and simulated ssc data at 10 measuring sites s32 s24 s20r s20 l s15 s12r s12 l s07 smc and ppi as shown in fig 3 are used as potential model inputs the ssc data at the current and previous time are involved by the grid search method the final optimal inputs used to forecast the sscs at the ppi and smc outlets are determined and presented in table 3 for example the optimal inputs for one step ahead forecasting at the ppi outlet are the previous ssc data at s20r nine and eight steps behind s15 seven and six steps behind s12 l six and five steps behind s12r six and five steps behind s07 four and three steps behind and ppi six five four three two and one step behind and the present step it is discovered that s32 s24 and s20 l are not selected as final inputs it is also observed that the further a section is from the target outlet the more steps behind the previous data are adopted in addition as to different forecast lead times the maximum time gap between the inputs and output is approximately ten steps 5 h for instance six step ahead forecasts at the ppi outlet employ data that are four steps behind the ssc outlet at s20r in conclusion data at sites far away from the outlets and at times behind 5 h are not selected as inputs of mls the optimal ml parameters are also determined via the grid search method the parameters which have a significant influence on modeling performance are investigated herein taking mlp as an example five main parameters number of neurons in the hidden layer activation function initial learning rate solver and batch are optimized the optimal results of main parameters of seven ml algorithms are presented in table 4 additionally table 5 contains the number of hours that have passed n and the number of ml models used m in the sf step which are critical parameters in building the proposed reservoir ssc forecasting model the data during n are used as inputs and the best performing ml models m are used to calculate the ensemble mean results given in tables 3 5 are determined using the grid search method based on the use of training data and fixed during the testing phase 4 2 comparison between each ml based model forecasting performance of each ml based model is evaluated by four measures rmse ce cc and csi rmse and ce are the most commonly used to obtain consistent conclusions and they feature in the following discussions the results of the other two measures are included in the supplementary materials to this paper thus in table 6 the rmse and ce values of each ml based model during the training and testing phases are given additionally fig 5 ppi outlet and fig 6 smc outlet contain the comparisons of the forecasted sscs resulting from each ml based model as well as the observations from the testing phase generally each ml based model exhibits a decrease in performance as the forecast lead time increases at the ppi outlet the svm has the best training and testing performance for one step ahead forecasts i e a lead time of 0 5 h when forecasting with a longer lead time dnn performs best for 1 h ahead time and lstm performs best for 1 5 2 2 5 and 3 h lead time some models overestimate the peak values i e typhoon sinlaku fig 5 and rf forecasts differ most from the observations at the smc outlet svm always has the best testing performance for one to six step ahead forecasts the lead times of 0 5 3 h although the model with the best training performance varies along with other values most models capture the peak values i e typhoon dujuan fig 6 however consistent with the results in fig 5 a time lag error is evident and increases according to the forecast lead time among the models rf forecasts still have the greatest difference between forecasts and observations compared to other ml models therefore the aforementioned results confirm that it is difficult to develop a comprehensive forecasting using one specific type of mls thus the use of ensemble mls is therefore recommended to obtain more accurate results sharghi et al 2018 in addition the overall testing performance for the smc outlet is better than that of the ppi outlet this is because the ppi outlet is at a lower elevation than the smc outlet so the ssc data values at the ppi outlet are higher and more complicated as shown in figs 5 and 6 the superior performance of the shallow ml approaches svm during the testing phase at the smc outlet may also be a contributing factor generally for forecasting more complicated ssc data at the ppi outlet deep ml approaches dnn and lstm outperform shallow ones especially for long lead times 4 3 performance of the proposed switched ml based approach the model built by the proposed switched ml based approach is referred to as switched ml hereafter the single ml based model with the best performance in the training phase i e the lowest training rmse values is hereafter used as the benchmark and referred to as best train it should be noted that for different outlets or forecast lead times the best train model could be any of the ml based models the simple average of all seven ml based models is also used for comparison and is termed conventional hereafter comparisons of the ssc results from switched ml conventional and best train models during testing are presented in fig 7 results confirm satisfactory performance of all three models the forecasts with shorter lead times 0 5 1 0 h and longer lead times 1 5 3 0 h agree well with the observations for the three models although there is an increase in the time lag error as the forecast lead time increases corresponding rmse values are listed in table 7 the switched ml model performs the best for different forecast lead times with the exception of the lead time of 0 5 h when the lead time is 0 5 h the best train model has the best performance with the switched ml model in second place this could be explained by the fact that one step ahead forecasting does not require the use of a complex approach therefore a single ml based model is sufficient with a lead time of 0 5 h the switched ml model always performs the best whereas the conventional and the best train models exchange leads for example using the switched ml model instead of the conventional model decreases the rmse values from 1 87 to 1 39 103ppm at the smc and from 6 62 to 6 17 103ppm at the ppi outlet respectively for a lead time of 1 h a lead time of 3 h generates a decrease in rmse values from 3 49 to 2 68 103ppm at the smc and from 10 92 to 9 48 103ppm at the ppi outlet respectively this translates to average improvements of 16 and 18 for lead times of 1 and 3 h respectively additional details for the improvements rmse using the switched ml model instead of the conventional model for different forecast lead times are presented in fig 8 similarly the switched ml model outperforms the best train model on average using the switched ml model instead of the best train model provides rmse improvements of 18 and 4 respectively for lead times of 1 and 3 h in summary the switched ml model generally improves the performance of reservoir ssc forecasting more accurate ssc forecasts are obtained using the switched ml model instead of either the conventional or single ml based model particularly when forecasting 1 and 3 h ahead using the proposed approach high performing ml models are selected to yield more accurate forecasts this selection process can also be seen as a simple weighted averaging method if m ml models that perform better are selected from seven ml models the weight for the selected m ml models is 1 m for the remaining ml models the weight is 0 using the proposed approach the optimal integration of the forecasts from some high performing ml models will be obtained to increase the accuracy of the results however the final forecasting performance will still depend on the performance of the used ml models if all ml models yield inaccurate results the improvement will be only slight or even non existent future research could use different weights for the selected ml models when more study data have been collected 5 conclusions this study proposed a switched ml based approach to increase the accuracy of reservoir ssc forecasts the proposed approach comprises an ml step and sf step first a total of seven different mls were used individually to build ml based models then the forecasts from multiple ml based models were optimally integrated in real time to provide the best results the study made two fundamental achievements the development of the multiple ml based ssc forecasting models and the optimal integration of the results from these models by switching between different high performing ml based models and eliminating the worst results forecasting accuracy is increased the effectiveness of the proposed approach was tested by applying it to an actual scenario the results indicate that both svm and lstm outperform than the other single ml based models when compared with each single ml based model and the conventional model i e the simple average of multiple ml based models the switched ml model i e the optimal integration of multiple ml based models demonstrated the best performance especially when forecasting 1 and 3 h ahead in conclusion the proposed switched ml based approach facilitates the production of more accurate ssc forecasts these can be a helpful reference in the management of sedimentation for efficient reservoir operation the proposed approach can be seen as a simple weighted averaging method that is applicable in different fields the approach will enable more accurate results to be obtained by optimally integrating the forecasts from some better performing ml models however the final forecasting performance depends on the performance of individual ml models if all models yield inaccurate results only a negligible improvement will be made if at all future research could use different weights for the selected ml models when more study data have been collected besides errors in the simulated ssc data may reduce the performance of the ssc forecasting model in the future real time monitoring data can be used to produce more accurate flood inundation forecast maps in the meantime the combination of a novel numerical model and ml may well improve the proposed model s performance author contributions cheng chia huang conceptualization data curation methodology formal analysis software writing original draft writing review editing ming jui chang

8276,study region the nagqu river watershed nrw on the qinghai tibet plateau qtp study focus precipitation snowmelt streamflow and groundwater samples were collected in the nrw and used to analyze the contribution of different water sources to streamflow during different freeze thaw periods stable isotopes of hydrogen d and oxygen 18o and water chemistry were analyzed for the period ranging from 2016 to 2019 and tritium t and carbon 14 14c isotopes were analyzed for 2019 new hydrological insights for the region rain and snowmelt were found to reflect the chemical characteristics of precipitation and the primary ions in both water types were ca2 and so4 2 the δd and δ18o isotope values of rain and snowmelt were relatively low during the entire thaw period from june to october and relatively high in the entire frozen period from november to may the results of the optimum multiparameter and mass balance analyses showed that groundwater and snowmelt accounted for approximately 39 8 and 32 2 to the nagqu river water flow respectively whereas precipitation accounted for approximately 28 0 the groundwater in clastic rock fissures around the northern cuona lake and permafrost and ground ice in the bedrock layer were identified as older water types with relatively low infiltration rates and bedrock fissures in the southeastern and southwestern areas contained younger water with better recoverability keywords stable isotope precipitation streamflow snowmelt groundwater hydrologic pathway 1 introduction the qinghai tibet plateau qtp is an alpine region with complex geomorphology and water sources as well as an intricate water circulation system cao and qin 2006 wang et al 2009 streamflow is directly supplied by various types of precipitation snow and ice meltwater lake water and groundwater hydrologic processes on the plateau are mainly controlled by precipitation and air temperature which also influence snow cover mass balance of glaciers and the depth and spatial extent of groundwater he et al 2019 to identify and quantify the river water sources on the qtp it is important to study riverine water and the relationships between rain snowmelt streamflow and groundwater as the sources of streamflow reflect the distribution of water resources understanding them is necessary for the development of multitargeted water resource regulations and management strategies jasechko et al 2016 skøien et al 2003 weng et al 2020 however streamflow sources and the evolution of different geographical units exhibit multiscale spatiotemporal characteristics under the influences of climate change and human activities yang et al 2020b 2020c climate change is accelerating the rate of atmospheric circulation the hydrological cycle and ice and snow melt in alpine regions precipitation patterns are also being affected and the sources of streamflow are thus changing which is affecting the evolution of regional water resources sun et al 2016 the sources of streamflow can be used to reflect the distribution of water resources which must be identified to allow for the development of multitargeted water resource regulations and management strategies jasechko et al 2016 skøien et al 2003 weng et al 2020 the sources and mechanisms of riverine recharge are mainly determined using three approaches hydrological modeling guggenmos et al 2011 li et al 2020 geophysical methods butler et al 2004 and stable isotope tracing techniques wang et al 2018 stable isotopes reflect local environmental conditions and are sensitive to associated changes the hydrogen d and oxygen 18o compositions vary among water from different sources because of the mixing and evaporation of different water sources during migration and transformation gibson et al 2020 kirkels et al 2020 in addition during the water cycle process the d and 18o compositions of various water sources are controlled by isotope fractionation and they therefore exhibit wide temporal and spatial heterogeneity longinelli and selmo 2003 schulte et al 2011 d and 18o are considered to be conservative and stable in the hydrological cycle and they are not influenced by high temperature water rock interactions or strong evaporation conditions they can therefore be analyzed to understand the formation migration and the relative contributions of water from different sources such analyses can also provide information about the mixing of water from these water sources cole et al 2011 gonfiantini 1978 wang et al 2019 the sources of riverine recharge and their corresponding contributions the nagqu river watershed nrw is situated in the middle of the qtp within a semi humid climate zone and a sub frigid monsoon region characterized by monsoonal conditions you et al 2007 it maintains the ecological security of nagqu city and serves as an ecological barrier between monsoon and non monsoon regions dong et al 2018 observations have shown that precipitation and runoff in the nrw have increased in the past 50 years which has caused changes in vegetation succession and water cycle processes zhang et al 2019 although regional hydrological processes and ecological balances are changing due to global climate change and human activities zheng et al 2019 little is understood about the regional hydrological cycle of the nrw and changes associated with climate change the stable isotopic approach has been extensively applied in studies of water circulation within the nrw in this respect liu et al 2010 discussed the correlations between the stable isotopes of precipitation and the nrw temperature and precipitation dong et al 2018 reported that stable isotopes in the nrw are spatially heterogeneous and vary as a function of the regional underlying subsurface and climatic conditions yang et al 2020b 2020c distinguished and discussed the contributions of climate change and human activities to streamflow changes in the nagqu river over the past 50 years however as the geographical location and climate conditions of the qtp have hindered data collection and scientific research yang et al 2020b 2020c precipitation and streamflow water samples have mainly been used for isotopic analysis in experiments relating to streamflow sources therefore it is necessary to study the regional hydrological cycle and stable isotope compositions of precipitation surface water groundwater and snowmelt and hydraulic relationships to inform water protection policies and management strategies for headwaters as a typical watershed within the qtp the nrw plays an important role in ecological protection and glaciers snowmelt ecological succession and other issues have attracted widespread attention however the water cycle in this area and the corresponding mechanisms remain unclear therefore this study was conducted to obtain information about the hydrologic connections between multiple water bodies in the nrw by 1 analyzing the spatiotemporal changes in the stable isotopic compositions and water chemistry of precipitation streamflow snowmelt and groundwater 2 determining the relative contributions of precipitation snowmelt water and groundwater to rivers and 3 identifying the recharge sources for nrw and describing the regional water circulation process 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the nrw is located in the upper reaches of the nu river fig 1 a the watershed covers an area of 16 967 km2 and extends 460 km from the watershed mouth to its upper reaches fig 1b the average gradient is 2 man et al 2019 the groundwater types in the nrw include permafrost and ground ice in bedrock water in bedrock fissures water associated with carbonate caves porewater in clastic rocks water in the fissures of layered sedimentary rocks permafrost and ground ice in unconsolidated sediments and pore water in unconsolidated sediments fig 1c streamflow in the nrw is mainly derived from snowmelt groundwater and precipitation yang et al 2020b 2020c from 1979 2019 the average annual air temperature was 0 6 c and maximum and minimum observed air temperatures during this period were 14 5 c and 30 c respectively the average annual precipitation was 477 8 mm and the maximum and minimum annual precipitation were 610 5 mm 2001 and 317 4 mm 1986 respectively the average annual precipitation from may to september accounts for 81 9 of the total annual precipitation based on the sources of water vapor seasonal variations in the climate can be divided into two phases an entirely frozen period efp from november to may and an entirely thawed period etp from june to october dong et al 2018 the nrw data used in this study are listed in table s1 these data include meteorological data obtained from 1970 to 2019 by 12 meteorological stations groundwater resources from 2004 to 2018 and streamflow data obtained by nagqu hydrological station from 1983 to 2014 2 2 sample collection and processing water samples were collected from surface water rainfall hail snowmelt and groundwater fig 1 sampling sites 1 19 were used to obtain samples for d 18o and water chemistry analyses sites 2 5 6 8 14 16 18 and 19 were used

august september 2018 and june september 2019 precipitation samples were collected using a simple precipitation collection device with a table tennis ball to limit evaporation loss dong et al 2018 surface water samples were collected from the middle part of the river to ensure that the streamflow was fully mixed and to avoid the effects of evaporation on the surface water and its isotopic composition yu et al 2015 lake water samples were obtained from the center of the lake weng et al 2020 groundwater samples were collected from public wells industrial wells and springs with sampling depths ranging from 5 to 120 m a self recording water level gauge was placed in the wells to dynamically record changes in groundwater level hobo u20 001 03 usa all water samples were filtered using a 0 45 μm hydrophilic polycarbonate membrane millipore usa yang et al 2020a to compare the infiltration capacity of the topsoil in the watershed we used a double ring infiltration meter to measure the stable soil infiltration rate fig s1 nlhs 09 china the samples used to analyze stable isotopes d and 18o were collected and sealed in 10 ml high density polyethylene bottles those used for the analyses of the physical and chemical properties in 0 5 l sterile sampling bags and those for the tritium t analyses in a 1 l glass bottle the samples used for the analyses of the carbon 14 isotope 14c and chemical composition of the water were collected and sealed in 0 8 l sterile sampling bags all water samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4 c in addition ph air and river water temperatures dissolved oxygen electrical conductivity and oxidation reduction potential were measured during sampling in the field hach sl 1000 usa a total of 468 samples were used to conduct d and 18o stable isotope analyses using an l2130 i water vapor isotope analyzer picarro usa during the etp 127 143 69 and 59 samples of precipitation streamflow groundwater and snowmelt were obtained respectively whereas 9 11 27 and 23 samples of precipitation streamflow groundwater and snowmelt were collected respectively during efp the stable isotope ratios were expressed using the per mil notation relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow ngochera and bootsma 2011 wang et al 2019 and analytical errors for δ18o and δd were calculated to be 0 025 and 0 1 respectively t and 14c

studied using an ion chromatograph eco ic switzerland cic d120 china furthermore the total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp concentrations were analyzed using an ultraviolet uv visible spectrophotometer sp 752 china tu 1901 china 2 3 determination of water transport pathways to determine the sources of water vapor in precipitation the trajectory of water vapor during different freeze thaw periods in the nrw in 2018 was simulated using the backward trajectory method and the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit model developed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa song et al 2017 stein et al 2015 2 4 stable isotope analysis method as d and 18o are strongly correlated and the correlation between 18o and d excess was low the selection of 18o and d excess to calculate the streamflow sources was considered to be plausible tomczak and large 1989 boral and sen 2020 a multivariate analysis was combined with optimum multiparameter analysis ompa to estimate the average contribution of streamflow sources in the nrw the ompa is a type of linear regression whose core method is weighted least squares tomczak and large 1989 boral et al 2019 the model assumes that the isotopic composition of the streamflow is determined by the mixing of water from different sources with 18o and d excess stable isotopic compositions therefore isotopic data from the targeted water sources together with water from the undetermined sample were used as model inputs to determine the relative contributions of each source based on mass conservation relative contributions were calculated using an iterative method that adjusted the relative amount of water from each source so that the isotopic composition of the mixture from all water sources was consistent with that of the unknown sample a detailed description of the ompa is provided by boral et al 2019 the main sources of streamflow considered in the analyses were atmospheric precipitation groundwater and snowmelt mathematically the model can be expressed as follows 1 δ 18 o r f p δ 18 o p f s δ 18 o s f g δ 18 o g d excess r f p d excess p f s d excess s f g d excess g 1 f p f s f g where fp fs and fg are the proportions of precipitation snowmelt and groundwater in the streamflow respectively δ18op δ18os δ18og and δ18or are the δ18o values of precipitation snowmelt groundwater and streamflow respectively and d excessp d excesss d excessg and d excessr are the d excess values of precipitation snowmelt groundwater and streamflow respectively to reduce the uncertainty of the results we used the values specific to the δ18o and d excess end members in the mixed model table s4 the ranges assigned to precipitation were averaged δ18o 2 5 and averaged d excess 10 10 whereas the ranges assigned to meltwater and groundwater were averaged δ18o 2 5 and averaged d excess 5 boral and sen 2020 considering the parameters that control the isotope variation of the final member composition the selected range was considered to be the best estimate of seasonality and the specific watershed composition in this study multivariate analysis was combined with the ompa to estimate the average contribution of the water sources to the nagqu river these analyses were conducted along different sections of the river for different periods which allowed for the assessment of the spatiotemporal variations in the water source contributions within the nrw the main streamflow sources considered in the analyses were atmospheric precipitation groundwater and snowmelt by solving the relevant equations the fractions of snowmelt fs precipitation fp and groundwater fg were obtained the δ18o and d excess of the water sources were randomly sampled from the allocated ranges as the frequency distributions of the δ18o and d excess of the studied watershed were evenly distributed within the allocated ranges random sampling was performed on δ18op δ18os and δ18og and d excessp d excesss and d excessg using the monte carlo framework to run the ompa model for each river water sample the mean standard deviation 5th 25th 75th and 95th percentiles of 10 000 iterations were calculated 2 5 additional data sources the snow thickness data were obtained from the china snow depth long time series dataset resolution 0 25 provided by the cold and arid region scientific data center table 1 and raw data were derived from the daily passive microwave brightness data provided by the u s national snow and ice data center smmr 1979 1987 ssm i 1987 2007 ssmi s 2008 today 3 results 3 1 changes in the isotopic composition and chemistry of precipitation as there is significantly less precipitation in the nrw during the efp than during the etp fewer samples were collected for stable isotope analyses during the efp than during the etp isotopic data from the nrw show that the δ18o and δd values of precipitation δ18op and δdp ranged from 28 64 to 7 17 and from 215 71 to 42 07 respectively from 2016 to 2019 for comparison variations in δ18op and δdp range from 50 00 10 00 and 350 00 50 00 respectively in china tian et al 2007 therefore the nrw values are within the range of chinese atmospheric precipitation however the isotopic values of the efp and etp differed during the efp δ18op ranged between 22 07 and 7 17 with an average of 15 56 and δdp ranged from 162 12 to 42 07 with an average of 122 14 but during the etp the δ18op ranged between 28 64 and 8 89 with an average of 18 50 and δdp ranged from 215 71 to 56 29 with a mean value of 139 66 fig 2 a among the rainfall and hail samples collected at the same locations the δ18o value of hail 23 82 was significantly more positive than that of rainfall 17 78 because hail frozen water undergoes less evaporation and fractionation salamalikis et al 2016 in general as the temperature decreases the degree of water vapor condensation increases and the isotopic content of precipitation decreases fig 3 a shows the slope of the local meteoric water line lmwl of precipitation which reflects the relationship between δ18op and δdp the results indicate high evaporation levels at the nagqu river which is a common phenomenon in semi arid environments song et al 2017 as δ18op and δdp values in precipitation are strongly affected by the evaporation process those measured during the etp were more positive than those measured during the efp in addition deviation of the lmwl in monsoonal regions from the global meteoric water line gmwl indicates that the compositions of convective and stratiform rain differ aggarwal et al 2016 craig 1961 during the sampling period precipitation was dominated by low mg2 ca2 ratios which are often associated with the incorporation of dissolved gypsum fig 4 a the total dissolved solid tds content of rainfall in the nrw ranged from 7 44 100 70 mg l with an average of 55 70 mg l ca2 was predominant in the dissolved cations accounting for 63 of the total cation concentration and s o 4 2 was the predominant anion accounting for 65 of the total anion concentration the main contents of precipitation water in the nrw were ca na mg so4 fig 4b 3 2 changes in the isotopic composition and chemistry of snowmelt snowmelt is subjected to rainfall during the etp solid precipitation falls at higher elevations on mountains covered by snow and this type of precipitation is regarded as part of the snowmelt in this study the δ18o values of snowmelt δ18os during the efp and etp ranged from 15 03 to 4 15 and from 22 96 to 12 05 respectively with average values of 10 19 and 16 40 respectively the δd values of snowmelt δds ranged between 103 37 and 4 53 during the efp and from 166 73 to 81 93 during the etp with average values of 84 51 and 118 22 respectively fig 2b snowmelt had the same chemical characteristics as precipitation primary ions of ca2 and so4 2 and the main water type of snowmelt in the nrw was ca na so4 fig 4b of the four water sources snowmelt has the lowest ion content with an average tds concentration of 27 15 mg l fan et al 2015 wright and novakowski 2019 these results indicate that the ice snow meltwater is likely related to the dissolution of evaporites e g gypsum 3 3 changes in the isotopic composition and chemistry of groundwater during the efp and etp in the nrw the δ18o values of groundwater δ18og ranged between 16 12 and 11 14 and between 18 80 and 10 04 respectively and the average δ18og values during the efp and etp were 15 10 and 15 36 respectively the δd values of groundwater δdg ranged from 125 02 to 92 81 and from 135 99 to 85 56 during the efp and etp respectively with average values of 116 02 and 120 69 respectively fig 2d the slope of the δ18og δdg groundwater line gwl was the lowest of the four analyzed water sources fig 3d these results show that groundwater is closely related to streamflow and groundwater reacts with oxygen bearing minerals in the salt rock resulting in the continuous enrichment of groundwater with δ18og t decays and has a short lifespan and its presence indicates that the groundwater is affected by recent recharge the t was distributed to a depth of approximately 100 m in the nrw below this depth t was absent except in a few individual locations based on the planar distribution of t in the groundwater the aquifers in the northern part of the nrw contained older water than those in the south fig 5 a this is because the infiltration rate in the south of the nrw is greater than that in the north which results in the faster regeneration of shallow groundwater fig 5b at sampling site 14 water was obtained from a depth of approximately 60 m this sampling site contained modern water with a 14c content of 94 2 pmc in contrast water with a 14c content of 84 9 pmc was obtained from a depth of 120 m at sampling site 19 the age of the groundwater at the site was approximately 1 4 ka and was therefore older than that at site 14 the results obtained for shallow and deep groundwater sources show that the exchange between the groundwater and surface water in the north of the nrw is weak and the groundwater is older whereas that between the groundwater and surface water in the south is strong and the groundwater is younger the tds content of the groundwater varied more than that of the other analyzed water types and ranged from 27 5 2774 3 mg l with an average tds concentration of 516 1 mg l the tds content was found to gradually increase from upstream to downstream and this is consistent with the hydrogeochemical characteristics of other plateau mountainous areas hao et al 2019 the na concentration in groundwater was the highest followed by ca2 and the main anion was s o 4 2 the main water type of streamflow in the nrw is na ca mg so4 fig 4d 3 4 changes in the isotopic composition and chemistry of streamflow the δ18o values of the streamflow samples δ18or collected during the efp in the nrw ranged from 19 77 to 11 88 with an average of 15 36 and the δd values δdr ranged from 141 09 to 97 00 with an average of 117 04 during the etp the δ18or of the streamflow ranged between 18 46 and 8 96 with an average of 14 96 and the δdr ranged from 146 29 to 60 41 with an average value of 110 99 fig 2c the seasonal variations in the stable dr and 18or isotopes were small because they were derived from multiple sources and the isotopic values were regionally averaged weng et al 2020 among the collected surface water samples the sample from cuona lake sampling site 17 was the most affected by evaporation and it was enriched which resulted in a more positive δ18or value 9 13 dong et al 2018 as shown in fig 3c the δdr and δ18or data collected during the sampling period resulted in the slope and intercept of the streamflow water line rwl being steeper during the etp than during the efp this is likely related to the transition between initial source water and increasing groundwater replenishment during the efp the tds concentrations of the streamflow samples ranged from 46 6 576 8 mg l during the observation period with an average value of 166 85 mg l generally the tds contents of streamflow were higher upstream than downstream the main water type of the streamflow in the nrw was found to be mg ca na so4 fig 4c with ca2 and na being the dominant cations accounting for 36 and 37 of the total cation concentration respectively and so4 2 the dominant anion accounting for 78 of the total anion concentration these data indicate that the hydrochemistry of the rivers in the nrw is dominated by gypsum and halite weathering berghuijs and kirchner 2017 zhao et al 2004 the results showed that groundwater and snowmelt were the main sources of water recharge to rivers accounting for approximately 39 8 and 32 2 of the streamflow respectively atmospheric precipitation contributed to approximately 28 0 of the streamflow table s3 the watershed was dry during the efp therefore groundwater and ice and snow meltwater were the main river water sources accounting for 56 4 and 34 0 respectively during the etp precipitation was affected by the indian ocean monsoon and the contribution from precipitation to the river increased significantly accounting for 46 5 fig 7 whereas that of groundwater was the lowest accounting for 23 2 4 discussion 4 1 changes in the precipitation and water vapor sources the complex and variable circulation and the water vapor transport structure result in a complex distribution of precipitation in the qtp hao et al 2019 however the qtp is warm and humid and affected by climate change and precipitation amounts are gradually increasing immerzeel et al 2010 precipitation data were obtained from 12 meteorological stations in the nrw fig 6 a and linear fitting showed that amounts of precipitation increased by 9 8 mm 10a which mainly occurs during the etp the stable isotopes of precipitation in the nrw are mainly affected by different seasonal circulation patterns he and richards 2015 and the potential water vapor transport pathways differ significantly between different freeze thaw periods dreybrodt and deininger 2014 salamalikis et al 2016 zhu et al 2016 the backward trajectory of daily rainfall after five days of monthly rainfall was simulated for 2018 fig 7 during the etp the δdp and δ18op values of precipitation were found to be relatively low in our study with averages of 139 66 and 18 50 respectively during the summer monsoon some of the water vapor in the nrw originates from inland areas and local water vapor sources account for a small proportion fig 7 liu et al 2018 yan et al 2017 compared with the efp less fractionation occurs when the water vapor crosses the qtp from the arabian peninsula with an average of 122 14 δdp and 15 56 δ18op respectively dong et al 2018 he and richards 2015 tian et al 2001 during the efp water vapor mainly originates from local water vapor within the arabian peninsula indian subcontinent and hengduan mountains fig 7 tian et al 2001 owing to climate change and the changes in the water vapor sources the precipitation and d and 18o values in the qtp are expected to change creating uncertainty in the ecological security of the plateau 4 2 effects of snowmelt changes on stable isotopes as solid reservoirs snow and glaciers play important roles in controlling the storage of fresh water and the associated ecological environment in the qtp fang et al 2011 observed seasonal differences reflect factors such as the water content of the snow and the number of phase changes from solid to liquid and then to vapor liu et al 2008 salamalikis et al 2016 snowmelt may undergo multiple freeze thaw cycles phase changes leading to the acquisition of more positive values than those obtained for rainfall zhu et al 2016 however the solid reservoirs fail to reach the water balance in the nrw based on the first and second glacier inventory datasets of china the glacial area of the tibetan plateau covered 48859 18 km2 in the 1970s guo et al 2015 but the area covered by glaciers at the beginning of the current century was 44438 4 km2 this shows that the area covered by glaciers has decreased by 4420 78 km2 over the past 30 years representing an average annual decrease of 147 36 km2 and the total reduction rate has reached 9 05 similar to other regions of the qtp recent snowfall in the nrw has increased at a rate of 2 3 mm 10 a fig 6b however due to the rising air temperature the snow depth in the nrw has decreased at a rate of 1 65 mm 10 a thus providing significant water resources for the nrw and increasing the area covered by rivers and lakes this is expected to lead to changes in the d and 18o values of the snowmelt in the nrw in future 4 3 age and composition of groundwater although the use of fewer sampling sites may lead to greater uncertainties in the results the average and representative distribution of the sampling sites selected in the study are considered to reduce emerging uncertainties the groundwater level is affected by topography geological structures groundwater recharge conditions and drainage conditions wu and liu 2004 wang et al 2018 zhao et al 2004 furthermore groundwater resources in the nrw are gradually decreasing at a rate of 42 8 mm 10 a fig 6d based on the topography and landforms the nagqu river originates from the north flows through the foothills and finally collects at the outlet of the watershed the groundwater flow path is affected by the topography its confluence center is located in the southern part of the watershed and the flow path is almost identical during the efp and etp fig 8 a and b the age of groundwater represents the exchange capacity between groundwater and surface water hao et al 2019 porewater in clastic rock fissures and permafrost and ground ice in bedrock around cuona lake in the north are the oldest as water moves slowly in this region and recoverability is poor in contrast water in bedrock fissures in the southeast and southwest is the youngest and exhibits more optimized renewability and recoverability although groundwater and surface water have undergone different evaporative processes the slope of the gwl 5 54 is lower than that of the rwl 6 23 which indicates an interaction between them the hydrological exchange between groundwater and surface water is mainly affected by the following three factors 1 a discrepancy between river water level and the adjacent groundwater table 2 the hydraulic conductivity of the river channel and sediments in the alluvial plain and 3 the geometry and location of the river channel in the alluvial plain the rivers in the nrw have relatively high flow rates and the riverbed sediments are mainly comprised of coarse sand and gravel therefore the bed of the nagqu river maintains high permeability and a good connection with the surrounding aquifers when the river water level decreases shallow groundwater can be transported into the river under etp conditions the streamflow and precipitation gradually increase leading to increased river infiltration and soil water and groundwater replenishment in contrast under efp conditions the streamflow is mainly supplemented by baseflow water samples collected from the three sampling areas show a d and 18o enrichment sequence from the groundwater to the river water to the lake water this isotope enrichment also reflects the replenishment relationships between different hydrological cycle components 4 4 changes in streamflow and composition surface water is recharged by atmospheric precipitation and undergoes varying degrees of evaporation and fractionation therefore the slope of the rwl is gentler than the slope and intercept of the gmwl chen et al 2015 dreybrodt and deininger 2014 this phenomenon often occurs in arid and semi arid regions where the stable isotopic composition of the streamflow is subject to significant fractionation by evaporation zhu et al 2016 the nagqu river is the main water source for residents and changes in surface water resources thus directly affect their survival liu et al 2010 there is a gradual increase in the supply of water to the river downstream groundwater is the main source of water during winter whereas the main sources of water during summer streamflow include glacial snow and rainfall weng et al 2020 streamflow changes are a comprehensive reflection of changes in precipitation snowmelt and groundwater precipitation is a direct factor affecting streamflow changes and groundwater recharge is a stable source of streamflow recharge zhang et al 2019 from 1983 2014 the annual average streamflow according to data collected at nagqu hydrological station exhibited an overall upward trend with a change rate of 0 09 m3 s fig 6c stable isotopes also exhibit strong seasonal variability and their values exhibit a potential downward trend isotope values measured in the nrw from 2017 to 2019 were higher than those previously measured in the area he and richards 2015 wang et al 2017 the isotope enrichment may be attributable to a variety of factors including the amount effect dansgaard 1964 which leads to higher δd and δ18o values under low precipitation and lower isotope values under high precipitation amount effects may prevent part of the precipitation isotopes from returning to the background value under the condition of increasing precipitation and deplete the isotopes thereby affecting the local river water and groundwater under drought conditions the river water receives reduced precipitation and groundwater replenishment which causes the isotope value to rebound to a higher background condition in addition to drought conditions the dynamic changes in snow cover within each snowmelt season may also play a role in the isotope measurements of river water when snowmelt occurs and the overburden remains frozen replenishment may occur in areas where the overburden is thin or the bedrock is exposed therefore with respect to climate warming snow melting events will increase in the watershed in the coming years and this may contribute to more significant isotope reactions 5 conclusions there are seasonal variations in the δ18o and δd values of precipitation in the nrw between the efp and etp as a result of changes in atmospheric circulation patterns that transport water vapor into the watershed during the efp water vapor is predominantly derived from local water sources in the arabian peninsula indian subcontinent and hengduan mountains during the etp which is characterized by the summer monsoon a certain proportion of the water vapor in the nrw is derived from inland areas and local water vapor sources account for only a small proportion of the total water vapor the main sources of streamflow in the nrw include atmospheric precipitation groundwater and snowmelt however groundwater and snowmelt are the main sources of streamflow and they account for approximately 72 0 of the total flow whereas atmospheric precipitation accounts for approximately 28 0 of the river recharge ice and snow meltwater are the largest contributors to river water during the etp and the contribution rate of groundwater during the efp and etp is relatively constant an average of approximately 32 2 porewater in clastic rock fissures and permafrost and ground ice in the bedrock layers around cuona lake in the north are the oldest water types in these areas the groundwater circulation is slow and recoverability is poor however water in bedrock fissures in the southeastern and southwestern regions is the youngest and exhibits more optimized renewability and recoverability author statement the contributions of the manuscript are as follows

8276,study region the nagqu river watershed nrw on the qinghai tibet plateau qtp study focus precipitation snowmelt streamflow and groundwater samples were collected in the nrw and used to analyze the contribution of different water sources to streamflow during different freeze thaw periods stable isotopes of hydrogen d and oxygen 18o and water chemistry were analyzed for the period ranging from 2016 to 2019 and tritium t and carbon 14 14c isotopes were analyzed for 2019 new hydrological insights for the region rain and snowmelt were found to reflect the chemical characteristics of precipitation and the primary ions in both water types were ca2 and so4 2 the δd and δ18o isotope values of rain and snowmelt were relatively low during the entire thaw period from june to october and relatively high in the entire frozen period from november to may the results of the optimum multiparameter and mass balance analyses showed that groundwater and snowmelt accounted for approximately 39 8 and 32 2 to the nagqu river water flow respectively whereas precipitation accounted for approximately 28 0 the groundwater in clastic rock fissures around the northern cuona lake and permafrost and ground ice in the bedrock layer were identified as older water types with relatively low infiltration rates and bedrock fissures in the southeastern and southwestern areas contained younger water with better recoverability keywords stable isotope precipitation streamflow snowmelt groundwater hydrologic pathway 1 introduction the qinghai tibet plateau qtp is an alpine region with complex geomorphology and water sources as well as an intricate water circulation system cao and qin 2006 wang et al 2009 streamflow is directly supplied by various types of precipitation snow and ice meltwater lake water and groundwater hydrologic processes on the plateau are mainly controlled by precipitation and air temperature which also influence snow cover mass balance of glaciers and the depth and spatial extent of groundwater he et al 2019 to identify and quantify the river water sources on the qtp it is important to study riverine water and the relationships between rain snowmelt streamflow and groundwater as the sources of streamflow reflect the distribution of water resources understanding them is necessary for the development of multitargeted water resource regulations and management strategies jasechko et al 2016 skøien et al 2003 weng et al 2020 however streamflow sources and the evolution of different geographical units exhibit multiscale spatiotemporal characteristics under the influences of climate change and human activities yang et al 2020b 2020c climate change is accelerating the rate of atmospheric circulation the hydrological cycle and ice and snow melt in alpine regions precipitation patterns are also being affected and the sources of streamflow are thus changing which is affecting the evolution of regional water resources sun et al 2016 the sources of streamflow can be used to reflect the distribution of water resources which must be identified to allow for the development of multitargeted water resource regulations and management strategies jasechko et al 2016 skøien et al 2003 weng et al 2020 the sources and mechanisms of riverine recharge are mainly determined using three approaches hydrological modeling guggenmos et al 2011 li et al 2020 geophysical methods butler et al 2004 and stable isotope tracing techniques wang et al 2018 stable isotopes reflect local environmental conditions and are sensitive to associated changes the hydrogen d and oxygen 18o compositions vary among water from different sources because of the mixing and evaporation of different water sources during migration and transformation gibson et al 2020 kirkels et al 2020 in addition during the water cycle process the d and 18o compositions of various water sources are controlled by isotope fractionation and they therefore exhibit wide temporal and spatial heterogeneity longinelli and selmo 2003 schulte et al 2011 d and 18o are considered to be conservative and stable in the hydrological cycle and they are not influenced by high temperature water rock interactions or strong evaporation conditions they can therefore be analyzed to understand the formation migration and the relative contributions of water from different sources such analyses can also provide information about the mixing of water from these water sources cole et al 2011 gonfiantini 1978 wang et al 2019 the sources of riverine recharge and their corresponding contributions the nagqu river watershed nrw is situated in the middle of the qtp within a semi humid climate zone and a sub frigid monsoon region characterized by monsoonal conditions you et al 2007 it maintains the ecological security of nagqu city and serves as an ecological barrier between monsoon and non monsoon regions dong et al 2018 observations have shown that precipitation and runoff in the nrw have increased in the past 50 years which has caused changes in vegetation succession and water cycle processes zhang et al 2019 although regional hydrological processes and ecological balances are changing due to global climate change and human activities zheng et al 2019 little is understood about the regional hydrological cycle of the nrw and changes associated with climate change the stable isotopic approach has been extensively applied in studies of water circulation within the nrw in this respect liu et al 2010 discussed the correlations between the stable isotopes of precipitation and the nrw temperature and precipitation dong et al 2018 reported that stable isotopes in the nrw are spatially heterogeneous and vary as a function of the regional underlying subsurface and climatic conditions yang et al 2020b 2020c distinguished and discussed the contributions of climate change and human activities to streamflow changes in the nagqu river over the past 50 years however as the geographical location and climate conditions of the qtp have hindered data collection and scientific research yang et al 2020b 2020c precipitation and streamflow water samples have mainly been used for isotopic analysis in experiments relating to streamflow sources therefore it is necessary to study the regional hydrological cycle and stable isotope compositions of precipitation surface water groundwater and snowmelt and hydraulic relationships to inform water protection policies and management strategies for headwaters as a typical watershed within the qtp the nrw plays an important role in ecological protection and glaciers snowmelt ecological succession and other issues have attracted widespread attention however the water cycle in this area and the corresponding mechanisms remain unclear therefore this study was conducted to obtain information about the hydrologic connections between multiple water bodies in the nrw by 1 analyzing the spatiotemporal changes in the stable isotopic compositions and water chemistry of precipitation streamflow snowmelt and groundwater 2 determining the relative contributions of precipitation snowmelt water and groundwater to rivers and 3 identifying the recharge sources for nrw and describing the regional water circulation process 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the nrw is located in the upper reaches of the nu river fig 1 a the watershed covers an area of 16 967 km2 and extends 460 km from the watershed mouth to its upper reaches fig 1b the average gradient is 2 man et al 2019 the groundwater types in the nrw include permafrost and ground ice in bedrock water in bedrock fissures water associated with carbonate caves porewater in clastic rocks water in the fissures of layered sedimentary rocks permafrost and ground ice in unconsolidated sediments and pore water in unconsolidated sediments fig 1c streamflow in the nrw is mainly derived from snowmelt groundwater and precipitation yang et al 2020b 2020c from 1979 2019 the average annual air temperature was 0 6 c and maximum and minimum observed air temperatures during this period were 14 5 c and 30 c respectively the average annual precipitation was 477 8 mm and the maximum and minimum annual precipitation were 610 5 mm 2001 and 317 4 mm 1986 respectively the average annual precipitation from may to september accounts for 81 9 of the total annual precipitation based on the sources of water vapor seasonal variations in the climate can be divided into two phases an entirely frozen period efp from november to may and an entirely thawed period etp from june to october dong et al 2018 the nrw data used in this study are listed in table s1 these data include meteorological data obtained from 1970 to 2019 by 12 meteorological stations groundwater resources from 2004 to 2018 and streamflow data obtained by nagqu hydrological station from 1983 to 2014 2 2 sample collection and processing water samples were collected from surface water rainfall hail snowmelt and groundwater fig 1 sampling sites 1 19 were used to obtain samples for d 18o and water chemistry analyses sites 2 5 6 8 14 16 18 and 19 were used

august september 2018 and june september 2019 precipitation samples were collected using a simple precipitation collection device with a table tennis ball to limit evaporation loss dong et al 2018 surface water samples were collected from the middle part of the river to ensure that the streamflow was fully mixed and to avoid the effects of evaporation on the surface water and its isotopic composition yu et al 2015 lake water samples were obtained from the center of the lake weng et al 2020 groundwater samples were collected from public wells industrial wells and springs with sampling depths ranging from 5 to 120 m a self recording water level gauge was placed in the wells to dynamically record changes in groundwater level hobo u20 001 03 usa all water samples were filtered using a 0 45 μm hydrophilic polycarbonate membrane millipore usa yang et al 2020a to compare the infiltration capacity of the topsoil in the watershed we used a double ring infiltration meter to measure the stable soil infiltration rate fig s1 nlhs 09 china the samples used to analyze stable isotopes d and 18o were collected and sealed in 10 ml high density polyethylene bottles those used for the analyses of the physical and chemical properties in 0 5 l sterile sampling bags and those for the tritium t analyses in a 1 l glass bottle the samples used for the analyses of the carbon 14 isotope 14c and chemical composition of the water were collected and sealed in 0 8 l sterile sampling bags all water samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4 c in addition ph air and river water temperatures dissolved oxygen electrical conductivity and oxidation reduction potential were measured during sampling in the field hach sl 1000 usa a total of 468 samples were used to conduct d and 18o stable isotope analyses using an l2130 i water vapor isotope analyzer picarro usa during the etp 127 143 69 and 59 samples of precipitation streamflow groundwater and snowmelt were obtained respectively whereas 9 11 27 and 23 samples of precipitation streamflow groundwater and snowmelt were collected respectively during efp the stable isotope ratios were expressed using the per mil notation relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow ngochera and bootsma 2011 wang et al 2019 and analytical errors for δ18o and δd were calculated to be 0 025 and 0 1 respectively t and 14c

studied using an ion chromatograph eco ic switzerland cic d120 china furthermore the total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp concentrations were analyzed using an ultraviolet uv visible spectrophotometer sp 752 china tu 1901 china 2 3 determination of water transport pathways to determine the sources of water vapor in precipitation the trajectory of water vapor during different freeze thaw periods in the nrw in 2018 was simulated using the backward trajectory method and the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit model developed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa song et al 2017 stein et al 2015 2 4 stable isotope analysis method as d and 18o are strongly correlated and the correlation between 18o and d excess was low the selection of 18o and d excess to calculate the streamflow sources was considered to be plausible tomczak and large 1989 boral and sen 2020 a multivariate analysis was combined with optimum multiparameter analysis ompa to estimate the average contribution of streamflow sources in the nrw the ompa is a type of linear regression whose core method is weighted least squares tomczak and large 1989 boral et al 2019 the model assumes that the isotopic composition of the streamflow is determined by the mixing of water from different sources with 18o and d excess stable isotopic compositions therefore isotopic data from the targeted water sources together with water from the undetermined sample were used as model inputs to determine the relative contributions of each source based on mass conservation relative contributions were calculated using an iterative method that adjusted the relative amount of water from each source so that the isotopic composition of the mixture from all water sources was consistent with that of the unknown sample a detailed description of the ompa is provided by boral et al 2019 the main sources of streamflow considered in the analyses were atmospheric precipitation groundwater and snowmelt mathematically the model can be expressed as follows 1 δ 18 o r f p δ 18 o p f s δ 18 o s f g δ 18 o g d excess r f p d excess p f s d excess s f g d excess g 1 f p f s f g where fp fs and fg are the proportions of precipitation snowmelt and groundwater in the streamflow respectively δ18op δ18os δ18og and δ18or are the δ18o values of precipitation snowmelt groundwater and streamflow respectively and d excessp d excesss d excessg and d excessr are the d excess values of precipitation snowmelt groundwater and streamflow respectively to reduce the uncertainty of the results we used the values specific to the δ18o and d excess end members in the mixed model table s4 the ranges assigned to precipitation were averaged δ18o 2 5 and averaged d excess 10 10 whereas the ranges assigned to meltwater and groundwater were averaged δ18o 2 5 and averaged d excess 5 boral and sen 2020 considering the parameters that control the isotope variation of the final member composition the selected range was considered to be the best estimate of seasonality and the specific watershed composition in this study multivariate analysis was combined with the ompa to estimate the average contribution of the water sources to the nagqu river these analyses were conducted along different sections of the river for different periods which allowed for the assessment of the spatiotemporal variations in the water source contributions within the nrw the main streamflow sources considered in the analyses were atmospheric precipitation groundwater and snowmelt by solving the relevant equations the fractions of snowmelt fs precipitation fp and groundwater fg were obtained the δ18o and d excess of the water sources were randomly sampled from the allocated ranges as the frequency distributions of the δ18o and d excess of the studied watershed were evenly distributed within the allocated ranges random sampling was performed on δ18op δ18os and δ18og and d excessp d excesss and d excessg using the monte carlo framework to run the ompa model for each river water sample the mean standard deviation 5th 25th 75th and 95th percentiles of 10 000 iterations were calculated 2 5 additional data sources the snow thickness data were obtained from the china snow depth long time series dataset resolution 0 25 provided by the cold and arid region scientific data center table 1 and raw data were derived from the daily passive microwave brightness data provided by the u s national snow and ice data center smmr 1979 1987 ssm i 1987 2007 ssmi s 2008 today 3 results 3 1 changes in the isotopic composition and chemistry of precipitation as there is significantly less precipitation in the nrw during the efp than during the etp fewer samples were collected for stable isotope analyses during the efp than during the etp isotopic data from the nrw show that the δ18o and δd values of precipitation δ18op and δdp ranged from 28 64 to 7 17 and from 215 71 to 42 07 respectively from 2016 to 2019 for comparison variations in δ18op and δdp range from 50 00 10 00 and 350 00 50 00 respectively in china tian et al 2007 therefore the nrw values are within the range of chinese atmospheric precipitation however the isotopic values of the efp and etp differed during the efp δ18op ranged between 22 07 and 7 17 with an average of 15 56 and δdp ranged from 162 12 to 42 07 with an average of 122 14 but during the etp the δ18op ranged between 28 64 and 8 89 with an average of 18 50 and δdp ranged from 215 71 to 56 29 with a mean value of 139 66 fig 2 a among the rainfall and hail samples collected at the same locations the δ18o value of hail 23 82 was significantly more positive than that of rainfall 17 78 because hail frozen water undergoes less evaporation and fractionation salamalikis et al 2016 in general as the temperature decreases the degree of water vapor condensation increases and the isotopic content of precipitation decreases fig 3 a shows the slope of the local meteoric water line lmwl of precipitation which reflects the relationship between δ18op and δdp the results indicate high evaporation levels at the nagqu river which is a common phenomenon in semi arid environments song et al 2017 as δ18op and δdp values in precipitation are strongly affected by the evaporation process those measured during the etp were more positive than those measured during the efp in addition deviation of the lmwl in monsoonal regions from the global meteoric water line gmwl indicates that the compositions of convective and stratiform rain differ aggarwal et al 2016 craig 1961 during the sampling period precipitation was dominated by low mg2 ca2 ratios which are often associated with the incorporation of dissolved gypsum fig 4 a the total dissolved solid tds content of rainfall in the nrw ranged from 7 44 100 70 mg l with an average of 55 70 mg l ca2 was predominant in the dissolved cations accounting for 63 of the total cation concentration and s o 4 2 was the predominant anion accounting for 65 of the total anion concentration the main contents of precipitation water in the nrw were ca na mg so4 fig 4b 3 2 changes in the isotopic composition and chemistry of snowmelt snowmelt is subjected to rainfall during the etp solid precipitation falls at higher elevations on mountains covered by snow and this type of precipitation is regarded as part of the snowmelt in this study the δ18o values of snowmelt δ18os during the efp and etp ranged from 15 03 to 4 15 and from 22 96 to 12 05 respectively with average values of 10 19 and 16 40 respectively the δd values of snowmelt δds ranged between 103 37 and 4 53 during the efp and from 166 73 to 81 93 during the etp with average values of 84 51 and 118 22 respectively fig 2b snowmelt had the same chemical characteristics as precipitation primary ions of ca2 and so4 2 and the main water type of snowmelt in the nrw was ca na so4 fig 4b of the four water sources snowmelt has the lowest ion content with an average tds concentration of 27 15 mg l fan et al 2015 wright and novakowski 2019 these results indicate that the ice snow meltwater is likely related to the dissolution of evaporites e g gypsum 3 3 changes in the isotopic composition and chemistry of groundwater during the efp and etp in the nrw the δ18o values of groundwater δ18og ranged between 16 12 and 11 14 and between 18 80 and 10 04 respectively and the average δ18og values during the efp and etp were 15 10 and 15 36 respectively the δd values of groundwater δdg ranged from 125 02 to 92 81 and from 135 99 to 85 56 during the efp and etp respectively with average values of 116 02 and 120 69 respectively fig 2d the slope of the δ18og δdg groundwater line gwl was the lowest of the four analyzed water sources fig 3d these results show that groundwater is closely related to streamflow and groundwater reacts with oxygen bearing minerals in the salt rock resulting in the continuous enrichment of groundwater with δ18og t decays and has a short lifespan and its presence indicates that the groundwater is affected by recent recharge the t was distributed to a depth of approximately 100 m in the nrw below this depth t was absent except in a few individual locations based on the planar distribution of t in the groundwater the aquifers in the northern part of the nrw contained older water than those in the south fig 5 a this is because the infiltration rate in the south of the nrw is greater than that in the north which results in the faster regeneration of shallow groundwater fig 5b at sampling site 14 water was obtained from a depth of approximately 60 m this sampling site contained modern water with a 14c content of 94 2 pmc in contrast water with a 14c content of 84 9 pmc was obtained from a depth of 120 m at sampling site 19 the age of the groundwater at the site was approximately 1 4 ka and was therefore older than that at site 14 the results obtained for shallow and deep groundwater sources show that the exchange between the groundwater and surface water in the north of the nrw is weak and the groundwater is older whereas that between the groundwater and surface water in the south is strong and the groundwater is younger the tds content of the groundwater varied more than that of the other analyzed water types and ranged from 27 5 2774 3 mg l with an average tds concentration of 516 1 mg l the tds content was found to gradually increase from upstream to downstream and this is consistent with the hydrogeochemical characteristics of other plateau mountainous areas hao et al 2019 the na concentration in groundwater was the highest followed by ca2 and the main anion was s o 4 2 the main water type of streamflow in the nrw is na ca mg so4 fig 4d 3 4 changes in the isotopic composition and chemistry of streamflow the δ18o values of the streamflow samples δ18or collected during the efp in the nrw ranged from 19 77 to 11 88 with an average of 15 36 and the δd values δdr ranged from 141 09 to 97 00 with an average of 117 04 during the etp the δ18or of the streamflow ranged between 18 46 and 8 96 with an average of 14 96 and the δdr ranged from 146 29 to 60 41 with an average value of 110 99 fig 2c the seasonal variations in the stable dr and 18or isotopes were small because they were derived from multiple sources and the isotopic values were regionally averaged weng et al 2020 among the collected surface water samples the sample from cuona lake sampling site 17 was the most affected by evaporation and it was enriched which resulted in a more positive δ18or value 9 13 dong et al 2018 as shown in fig 3c the δdr and δ18or data collected during the sampling period resulted in the slope and intercept of the streamflow water line rwl being steeper during the etp than during the efp this is likely related to the transition between initial source water and increasing groundwater replenishment during the efp the tds concentrations of the streamflow samples ranged from 46 6 576 8 mg l during the observation period with an average value of 166 85 mg l generally the tds contents of streamflow were higher upstream than downstream the main water type of the streamflow in the nrw was found to be mg ca na so4 fig 4c with ca2 and na being the dominant cations accounting for 36 and 37 of the total cation concentration respectively and so4 2 the dominant anion accounting for 78 of the total anion concentration these data indicate that the hydrochemistry of the rivers in the nrw is dominated by gypsum and halite weathering berghuijs and kirchner 2017 zhao et al 2004 the results showed that groundwater and snowmelt were the main sources of water recharge to rivers accounting for approximately 39 8 and 32 2 of the streamflow respectively atmospheric precipitation contributed to approximately 28 0 of the streamflow table s3 the watershed was dry during the efp therefore groundwater and ice and snow meltwater were the main river water sources accounting for 56 4 and 34 0 respectively during the etp precipitation was affected by the indian ocean monsoon and the contribution from precipitation to the river increased significantly accounting for 46 5 fig 7 whereas that of groundwater was the lowest accounting for 23 2 4 discussion 4 1 changes in the precipitation and water vapor sources the complex and variable circulation and the water vapor transport structure result in a complex distribution of precipitation in the qtp hao et al 2019 however the qtp is warm and humid and affected by climate change and precipitation amounts are gradually increasing immerzeel et al 2010 precipitation data were obtained from 12 meteorological stations in the nrw fig 6 a and linear fitting showed that amounts of precipitation increased by 9 8 mm 10a which mainly occurs during the etp the stable isotopes of precipitation in the nrw are mainly affected by different seasonal circulation patterns he and richards 2015 and the potential water vapor transport pathways differ significantly between different freeze thaw periods dreybrodt and deininger 2014 salamalikis et al 2016 zhu et al 2016 the backward trajectory of daily rainfall after five days of monthly rainfall was simulated for 2018 fig 7 during the etp the δdp and δ18op values of precipitation were found to be relatively low in our study with averages of 139 66 and 18 50 respectively during the summer monsoon some of the water vapor in the nrw originates from inland areas and local water vapor sources account for a small proportion fig 7 liu et al 2018 yan et al 2017 compared with the efp less fractionation occurs when the water vapor crosses the qtp from the arabian peninsula with an average of 122 14 δdp and 15 56 δ18op respectively dong et al 2018 he and richards 2015 tian et al 2001 during the efp water vapor mainly originates from local water vapor within the arabian peninsula indian subcontinent and hengduan mountains fig 7 tian et al 2001 owing to climate change and the changes in the water vapor sources the precipitation and d and 18o values in the qtp are expected to change creating uncertainty in the ecological security of the plateau 4 2 effects of snowmelt changes on stable isotopes as solid reservoirs snow and glaciers play important roles in controlling the storage of fresh water and the associated ecological environment in the qtp fang et al 2011 observed seasonal differences reflect factors such as the water content of the snow and the number of phase changes from solid to liquid and then to vapor liu et al 2008 salamalikis et al 2016 snowmelt may undergo multiple freeze thaw cycles phase changes leading to the acquisition of more positive values than those obtained for rainfall zhu et al 2016 however the solid reservoirs fail to reach the water balance in the nrw based on the first and second glacier inventory datasets of china the glacial area of the tibetan plateau covered 48859 18 km2 in the 1970s guo et al 2015 but the area covered by glaciers at the beginning of the current century was 44438 4 km2 this shows that the area covered by glaciers has decreased by 4420 78 km2 over the past 30 years representing an average annual decrease of 147 36 km2 and the total reduction rate has reached 9 05 similar to other regions of the qtp recent snowfall in the nrw has increased at a rate of 2 3 mm 10 a fig 6b however due to the rising air temperature the snow depth in the nrw has decreased at a rate of 1 65 mm 10 a thus providing significant water resources for the nrw and increasing the area covered by rivers and lakes this is expected to lead to changes in the d and 18o values of the snowmelt in the nrw in future 4 3 age and composition of groundwater although the use of fewer sampling sites may lead to greater uncertainties in the results the average and representative distribution of the sampling sites selected in the study are considered to reduce emerging uncertainties the groundwater level is affected by topography geological structures groundwater recharge conditions and drainage conditions wu and liu 2004 wang et al 2018 zhao et al 2004 furthermore groundwater resources in the nrw are gradually decreasing at a rate of 42 8 mm 10 a fig 6d based on the topography and landforms the nagqu river originates from the north flows through the foothills and finally collects at the outlet of the watershed the groundwater flow path is affected by the topography its confluence center is located in the southern part of the watershed and the flow path is almost identical during the efp and etp fig 8 a and b the age of groundwater represents the exchange capacity between groundwater and surface water hao et al 2019 porewater in clastic rock fissures and permafrost and ground ice in bedrock around cuona lake in the north are the oldest as water moves slowly in this region and recoverability is poor in contrast water in bedrock fissures in the southeast and southwest is the youngest and exhibits more optimized renewability and recoverability although groundwater and surface water have undergone different evaporative processes the slope of the gwl 5 54 is lower than that of the rwl 6 23 which indicates an interaction between them the hydrological exchange between groundwater and surface water is mainly affected by the following three factors 1 a discrepancy between river water level and the adjacent groundwater table 2 the hydraulic conductivity of the river channel and sediments in the alluvial plain and 3 the geometry and location of the river channel in the alluvial plain the rivers in the nrw have relatively high flow rates and the riverbed sediments are mainly comprised of coarse sand and gravel therefore the bed of the nagqu river maintains high permeability and a good connection with the surrounding aquifers when the river water level decreases shallow groundwater can be transported into the river under etp conditions the streamflow and precipitation gradually increase leading to increased river infiltration and soil water and groundwater replenishment in contrast under efp conditions the streamflow is mainly supplemented by baseflow water samples collected from the three sampling areas show a d and 18o enrichment sequence from the groundwater to the river water to the lake water this isotope enrichment also reflects the replenishment relationships between different hydrological cycle components 4 4 changes in streamflow and composition surface water is recharged by atmospheric precipitation and undergoes varying degrees of evaporation and fractionation therefore the slope of the rwl is gentler than the slope and intercept of the gmwl chen et al 2015 dreybrodt and deininger 2014 this phenomenon often occurs in arid and semi arid regions where the stable isotopic composition of the streamflow is subject to significant fractionation by evaporation zhu et al 2016 the nagqu river is the main water source for residents and changes in surface water resources thus directly affect their survival liu et al 2010 there is a gradual increase in the supply of water to the river downstream groundwater is the main source of water during winter whereas the main sources of water during summer streamflow include glacial snow and rainfall weng et al 2020 streamflow changes are a comprehensive reflection of changes in precipitation snowmelt and groundwater precipitation is a direct factor affecting streamflow changes and groundwater recharge is a stable source of streamflow recharge zhang et al 2019 from 1983 2014 the annual average streamflow according to data collected at nagqu hydrological station exhibited an overall upward trend with a change rate of 0 09 m3 s fig 6c stable isotopes also exhibit strong seasonal variability and their values exhibit a potential downward trend isotope values measured in the nrw from 2017 to 2019 were higher than those previously measured in the area he and richards 2015 wang et al 2017 the isotope enrichment may be attributable to a variety of factors including the amount effect dansgaard 1964 which leads to higher δd and δ18o values under low precipitation and lower isotope values under high precipitation amount effects may prevent part of the precipitation isotopes from returning to the background value under the condition of increasing precipitation and deplete the isotopes thereby affecting the local river water and groundwater under drought conditions the river water receives reduced precipitation and groundwater replenishment which causes the isotope value to rebound to a higher background condition in addition to drought conditions the dynamic changes in snow cover within each snowmelt season may also play a role in the isotope measurements of river water when snowmelt occurs and the overburden remains frozen replenishment may occur in areas where the overburden is thin or the bedrock is exposed therefore with respect to climate warming snow melting events will increase in the watershed in the coming years and this may contribute to more significant isotope reactions 5 conclusions there are seasonal variations in the δ18o and δd values of precipitation in the nrw between the efp and etp as a result of changes in atmospheric circulation patterns that transport water vapor into the watershed during the efp water vapor is predominantly derived from local water sources in the arabian peninsula indian subcontinent and hengduan mountains during the etp which is characterized by the summer monsoon a certain proportion of the water vapor in the nrw is derived from inland areas and local water vapor sources account for only a small proportion of the total water vapor the main sources of streamflow in the nrw include atmospheric precipitation groundwater and snowmelt however groundwater and snowmelt are the main sources of streamflow and they account for approximately 72 0 of the total flow whereas atmospheric precipitation accounts for approximately 28 0 of the river recharge ice and snow meltwater are the largest contributors to river water during the etp and the contribution rate of groundwater during the efp and etp is relatively constant an average of approximately 32 2 porewater in clastic rock fissures and permafrost and ground ice in the bedrock layers around cuona lake in the north are the oldest water types in these areas the groundwater circulation is slow and recoverability is poor however water in bedrock fissures in the southeastern and southwestern regions is the youngest and exhibits more optimized renewability and recoverability author statement the contributions of the manuscript are as follows

used to simulate the river discharge we then analysed precipitation elasticity as a first kind of such study in nepalese river basin by scaling the precipitation input in both positive and negative

2017 zhang et al 2016 and among several climatic variables precipitation is one of the key components of the energy water cycle kidd et al 2017 which directly governs the basin hydrology reliable

hydrology is often achieved through hydrologic models with precipitation being a major driving variable meanwhile the application of hydrologic models for water resources assessment and management necessitates the adequately distributed precipitation information for reliable prediction cole and moore 2008 sanchez moreno et al 2014 but the use of hydrologic model to any river basin is often hindered due to the scantly available information on precipitation within a basin berg et al 2016 the precipitation information is generally derived from the ground based rain gauges meteorological radars and satellite based estimates the accuracy of gauge data is usually greater in comparison to other estimates berg et al 2016 brocca et al 2019 however their spatial density is limited in many regions kidd et al 2017 especially in developing countries like nepal behrangi et al 2011 montanari et al 2015 thapa et al 2016 kumar et al 2017 maidment et al 2017 which is further characterized by wide topographic variation alazzy et al 2017 in particular ranging from over 8000 m to as low as 60 m above sea level asl across nepal in addition such country either does not possess meteorological radars or has installed recently primarily due to economic and technological constraints under such a scenario satellite based precipitation estimates spes have the potential to overcome the limitations rendered by the low spatial density of ground based rain gauge stations bui et al 2019 dembélé et al 2020 siddique e akbor et al 2014 spes in general can complement the gauged data particularly where the observations are scarce tang et al 2009 with the advancement in satellite technology different countries are successfully operating several missions for the observation of climatic variables oecd 2008 furthermore spes have been available across the globe for more than four decades now the proliferation of satellite based products in the recent times has given a greater access to different climatic data than ever before levizzani and cattani 2019 sun et al 2018 at the same time the availability of such multiple spes may also likely puzzle the water resources practitioners and decision makers about the choice of any products therefore the assessment of the accuracy and performances evaluation are prerequisites for any spes before using them for any water resources planning or decision making maggioni et al 2016 wehbe et al 2017 the use of multiple sensors for the estimation of precipitation has indicated promising results recently brocca et al 2019 it is well understood that blending of satellite station and reanalysis data could augment our understanding of the spatial characteristics of precipitation particularly in data scarce region beck et al 2017 ning et al 2017 we need to understand that any spes might contain systematic and random biases a performance test of spes is necessary before applying to any hydrologic models in general performances of spes are strongly location dependent in this context this study used daily precipitation data of gauge and three spes 1 climate hazards group infrared precipitation chirp with stations chirps 0 05 spatial resolution 2 precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks cloud classification system persiann ccs 0 04 spatial resolution and 3 integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg final version hereinafter imerg 0 1 spatial resolution the selected three spes have higher spatial resolutions 0 1 10 km compared to other available products other promising products such as persiann climate data record persiann cdr and tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa both available at 0 25 grid were not included in this study due to their coarser resolution hydrologic models are regarded as one of the indispensable tools for better understanding the hydrologic characteristics of a basin which are imperative for making decisions on water resources management and planning singh 2018 at the same time the application of these models can also be crucial in performing various scenario and sensitivity analysis like land use or climate change impact analysis abbaspour et al 2009 dwarakish and ganasri 2015 qiu et al 2019 due to high spatio temporal variability of spes drawing a prior conclusion on their accuracy is not straightforward particularly when the corresponding observed data are limited zandler et al 2019 among different hydrologic components river discharge at a particular location could be of prime interest for the design of dams hydropower projects flood management or other water resources schemes johnston and smakhtin 2014 masaki et al 2017 in this regard hydrologic model can be employed for predicting river discharge with different input spes and compared against the observed discharge for the performance evaluation tarek et al 2020 yang et al 2014 similar to the rain gauge stations the number of hydrologic stations is highly limited and these stations may contain various sources of errors tarek et al 2020 however for this study we assumed the river discharge data are best available estimates it is equally labor time and cost intensive for maintaining hydrologic stations at different river reaches therefore hydrologic models are commonly used to simulate various hydrologic processes at different spatial scales various hydrologic models are available depending on the nature size and characteristics of the study area objective of the research and applications soil and water assessment tool swat is chosen in this study mainly for its extended applicability to simulate long term basin scale hydrologic processes and perform different scenario analysis among others swat is one of the widely acknowledged hydrologic tools for watershed modeling as evident from wang et al 2019 who reported more than 3000 leading journal papers related to swat application globally science citation index expanded sci e from 2008 to 2019 as retrieved on jan 2019 numerous swat related applications have been performed in different nepalese river basins by both national and international researchers to simulate basin scale hydrology climate change impacts land use change impacts etc aryal et al 2019 bharati et al 2016 bhatta et al 2019 dahal et al 2016 mishra et al 2018 pandey et al 2019 thapa et al 2017 2016 there are several adjacent watersheds that either do not possess any meteorological stations or have an insufficient number of meteorological stations furthermore such watersheds do not have long term river discharge data which hinders the planning of water related schemes the results of this study especially watershed parameters and correction factors of spes could be transferred to adjacent watersheds to simulate hydrologic processes and evaluate precipitation elasticity based on different spes a sound understanding of watershed response to precipitation is essential pandey et al 2020b for introducing any water resources related developmental or disaster mitigation plans including hydropower irrigation or river training works we selected west rapti river wrr basin as the study area because of the availability of a comparatively denser network of hydro meteorological stations and as a representative of watersheds of western region of nepal which are quite less explored on nonetheless we believe that the methodology adopted in this study can be applied even to any data scarce watersheds or watershed having a sparse gauge network the key objectives of this study are i to assess the performance of spes ii to fed them in hydrologic model swat to simulate river discharge and iii to finally evaluate precipitation elasticity of the watershed using both ground and satellite based precipitation data 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area wrr basin is located in the southern parts of western nepal shown in fig 1 geographically the study area extends from 27 40 to 28 35 north latitudes and 81 40 to 83 10 east longitudes fig 1a and b show land use land cover lulc and soil data of the study area the lulc map for the year 2010 adopted in this study was produced by the international centre for integrated mountain development icimod 2013 at a spatial resolution of 30 m and details on lulc data are available in uddin et al 2015 agriculture and forest comprising 33 and 60 of the study area respectively are the two dominant land cover types in the basin talchabhadel et al 2020b the soil data was obtained from soil and terrain database soter spatial resolution 1 1 000 000 the topographical data used in this study is advanced space borne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster global digital elevation model version gdem version 3 the elevation ranges from about 100 m to over 3600 m asl within a small latitude extent depicted in fig 1c a network of hydro meteorological station is presented in fig 1c the upper region of the study area is characterized by temperate climate whereas the lower regions experience a tropical climate karki et al 2016 the length of main river channel from its origin to indo nepal border is about 250 km the precipitation is dominated by monsoonal system where approximately 80 of annual precipitation occurs in monsoon period which extends through june to september talchabhadel et al 2018 more precisely july alone contributes about 28 ranging from 23 to 32 4 at different stations of the annual precipitation in contrast november and december contribute less than 1 of the annual precipitation varying from 0 1 to 1 2 for november and 0 2 1 7 for december at different stations talchabhadel et al 2020a overall the amount and the duration of direct runoff are meagre in non monsoon period the wrr originates from the middle mountains of the country enters the lowlands and finally drains to ganges in india it is joined by several tributaries like jhimruk mari arun lungri sit danduwa sotiya and gadheli talchabhadel and sharma 2014 from the downstream of the confluence of mari and jhimruk rivers the river is named the wrr in this study three hydrologic stations were used namely mari at upstream tributary hereinafter upstream bagasoti after the confluence of upstream tributaries hereinafter midstream and jakundi at downstream station hereinafter downstream the catchment areas at the upstream midstream and the downstream are 1980 km2 3380 km2 and 5082 km2 respectively 2 2 hydro meteorological data this study used daily precipitation data from 18 precipitation stations temperature data from 8 climate stations and mean daily discharge mdd data from 3 hydrologic stations locations are shown in fig 1c and meta data available in table s1 in the supplement section maintained by the department of hydrology and meteorology dhm government of nepal gon for the period of 1981 2015 weather radar and satellite are the two other data sources that can provide a viable alternative to gauge data since weather radar is not available this study attempts to assess the appraisal of spes this study used three spes based on multiple satellite based products 1 chirps 1981 2015 2 persiann ccs 2003 2015 and 3 imerg 2000 2015 chirps available from 1981 onwards is a quasi global precipitation data set that blends satellite and gauge precipitation data at first infrared precipitation pentad 5 day estimates are created from satellite data using information of cloud temperature and are calibrated with respect to wrt the tmpa pentads these pentads are divided by its long term 1981 2013 normal values and the fractions multiplied against the corresponding climate hazards precipitation funk et al 2015b provide chirp estimates finally pentad chirp values are redistributed to daily precipitation estimates based on daily noaa cfs national oceanic and atmospheric administration climate forecast system chirp data is finally blended with stations data to generate chirps product please follow funk et al 2015a for the detailed information of algorithm chirps station data merging geostationary satellites are capable of providing images every 15 30 min in multiple spectral bands of the cloud patterns and evolution over time ashouri et al 2015 persiann system employs neural network methods to estimate precipitation using the information of the infrared brightness temperature image provided by these geostationary satellites persiann ccs is a real time global high resolution satellite product that enables the categorization of cloud patch features based on cloud height areal extent and variability of texture estimated from satellite imagery the detailed description of persiann family is discussed in nguyen et al 2018 persiann ccs data is available 2003 onwards thapa et al 2016 used persiann ccs in mountainous regions of bagmati river basin in nepal to simulate the river discharge using the swat model imerg estimates precipitation from the various passive microwave pmw sensors comprising the gpm global precipitation measurement constellation precipitation estimates are computed employing goddard profiling algorithm gprof2017 please follow huffman et al 2019 for the detailed information we used 06b version final products of imerg herein after imerg which is available after 3 5 months of observation time after the concluding calibration based on monthly gpcc global precipitation climatology centre gauge based dataset table 1 shows a summary of data used in this study 2 3 evaluation of satellite based precipitation estimates inter comparisons of different spes with daily gauge data were conducted at 18 precipitation stations for the aforementioned time period this study employed 4 precipitation event detection indices 1 probability of detection pod 2 critical success index csi 3 false alarm ratio far and 4 frequency bias index fbi the calculation procedure is shown in table 2 pod csi and far range from 0 to 1 a higher value represents an ideal condition for pod and csi whereas lower value represents the ideal condition for far the ideal value of fbi is 1 fbi ranges from 0 to pod indicates the proportion of correctly detected precipitation events to the total number of gauge based precipitation events similarly csi indicates an overall proportion of correctly detected precipitation events to the total number of precipitation events either detected by satellite or gauge in contrast fbi denotes the proportion of false status to the total number of precipitation events detected by satellite fbi represents a simple bias between satellite detected precipitation events to the gauge based precipitation events fbi values 1 represents over estimation of precipitation event detection and 1 represent under estimation of precipitation event detection we computed quantitative evaluation of different spes using root mean square error rmse and percentage bias pbias wrt gauge data 1 r m s e 1 n s p e i g a u g e i 2 2 p b i a s s p e i g a u g e i g a u g e i 100 here negative value of pbias represents underestimation positive value represents overestimation and perfect zero represents ideal i e without any volume bias for spes wrt gauge data a lower value is best for rmse a linear scaling method of bias correction was used to correct biases of spes monthly correction factors c f g a u g e s p e s were computed by comparing basin averaged precipitation based on gauge and spes on a mean monthly scale computed monthly correction factors were then multiplied to the raw daily precipitation data at every station on corresponding months it is to be taken care that if the data quality of gauge precipitation data is poor it might lead to unrealistic representation of spes in particular there are high chances of low data quality in remote stations across the mountainous terrain in case of selected study area there were negligible data gaps and the selected study area is one of the basins of nepal having high quality observed data the computed correction factors could be transferred to nearby ungauged basins 2 4 swat model swat model is a continuous time semi distributed physically based river basin scale model operated at daily or hourly time steps the model has widely been applied to different river basins gauged or ungauged across the globe major model components include weather hydrology soil plant growth sediments nutrients and land management arnold et al 2012b all the equations incorporated in the model are described in the very comprehensive theoretical documentation manual neitsch et al 2011 among different available swat modules and resources like qswat swat grass and different modified swat models arcswat olivera et al 2006 is one of the popular and user friendly modules for setting up the model and modifying input parameters the watershed modeling in this study is based on arcswat 2012 in swat a watershed is discretized into multiple sub basins each sub basin is further divided into multiple hydrologic response units hrus smallest units consisting of homogenous soil characteristics land use and topographical settings neitsch et al 2011 in this study wrr basin was delineated into 30 sub basins which was further divided into 488 hrus runoff from all hrus within a sub basin are summed and enter the main reach of the sub basin and they are routed through the channel network to the outlet of the watershed the water balance expression used in the swat model is 5 s w t s w 0 i 1 t r d a y q s u r f e a w s e e p q g w where s w t and s w 0 are the final and early stage water contents of the soil respectively t is time in days r d a y is the daily precipitation q s u r f is the daily surface runoff e a is the daily evapotranspiration w s e e p is the daily percolation and q g w is the daily return flow all units are in mm surface runoff is most commonly simulated using the scs curve number scs cn method in the swat the scs cn method is a rainfall runoff model that computes excess runoff king et al 1999 which assumes an initial abstraction could be defined as a percentage of potential maximum retention after runoff begins that is related to the curve number neitsch et al 2011 2 5 swat calibration and validation accurate calibration of any hydrologic models including swat followed by the validation is a routine yet a key step during the water balance flood or similar hydrologic modeling swat being a physically based model requires the input parameters be held within a realistic uncertainty range sensitivity analysis which determines the most sensitive parameters of the basin precedes the model calibration and validation processes this study employed a global sensitivity analysis by allowing all parameter values to change arnold et al 2012b once the sensitive parameters are identified model calibration is performed next model calibration involves a careful allocation of values for the selected input parameters within their respective uncertainty range such that model estimations simulated output and observed gauge data are in a close agreement with each other finally in the validation step the model is simulated for a separate time period not included in the calibration keeping the same parameters obtained from the calibration in this study the period of five years from 1981 to 1985 was considered as the warm up period while 1986 2005 20 years and 2006 2015 10 years were used as the calibration and validation periods respectively for the river discharge this study used gauge precipitation data for calibration validation process and later forced different spes to the calibrated model to represent the spatial heterogeneity of the basin three discharge gauging stations namely mari at upstream bagasoti at midstream and jalkundi at downstream were used for multi site calibration and validation process a sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 abbaspour et al 2004 a semi automated approach was employed using the swat cup swat calibration uncertainty procedure swat cup is the most widely used tool for performing parameterization sensitivity and uncertainty analysis calibration and validation of input parameters 500 simulations were performed in first iteration for fine tuning of 36 selected input parameters shown in table s2 in supplement section the parameters were selected by referring literatures arnold et al 2012a and published studies dhami et al 2018 bhatta et al 2019 pandey et al 2019 2020 across nepal finally two iterations of 500 simulations each meaning 1000 simulations were performed with revised ranges of most sensitive parameters p 0 1 for the study area nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 was chosen as an objective function because of its wide application nse is a normalized index that tells the magnitude of residual variance compared to observed variance in addition percentage bias pbias and coefficient of determination r2 between simulated and observed river discharge were also checked please see krause et al 2005 and moriasi et al 2007 for a detailed information on these indices here negative values of pbias represent underestimation and positive values represent overestimation of simulate river discharge wrt observed ones we also performed manual calibration of few parameters related to baseflow after auto calibration based on knowledge of the basin finally the calibrated and validated model was then fed with raw and bias corrected spes 2 6 precipitation elasticity estimation the sensitivity of the total river discharge estimated by swat to the precipitation was evaluated by scaling the gauge precipitation data running the calibrated model and then comparing with simulated river discharge using the original data the daily precipitation time series was scaled by 20 10 10 and 20 the precipitation elasticity of river discharge was evaluated using following expression 6 δ q ε p δ p where δ q is change in simulated mean annual river discharge and δ p is change in annual rainfall and ε p is precipitation elasticity of river discharge apart from simulation there exists other different methods to estimate precipitation elasticity pandey et al 2020b assessed climate elasticity including precipitation elasticity using different methods based on water balance models for an extended east rapti watershed adjacent to current study area in this study we used a simple and popular non parametric estimator sankarasubramanian et al 2001 s approach to estimate precipitation elasticity of river discharge which is the proportional change in river discharge divided by the proportional change in precipitation it can be expressed as 7 ε p n p m e d i a n q i q p p i p q where ε p n p is the precipitation elasticity of river discharge based on the non parametric estimator p and q are mean annual precipitation and river discharge respectively for the study period p i and q i are annual precipitation and river discharge respectively for the i th year precipitation elasticity of river discharge provides a measure of the sensitivity of river discharge to precipitation a value 1 indicates that a 1 change in precipitation can cause 1 change in river discharge in this study ε p n p was determined for three different cases 1 observed river discharge 2 gauge based simulated river discharge and 3 spes based simulated discharge this method has a numerical problem when p i approaches p causing ε p tends to for that i th year 3 results and discussions 3 1 evaluation of selected precipitation products most of the stations cover a complete span of length except a few stations 407 kusum 502 shera gaun 515 ghorai and 631 bhing githe it should be noted that the 515 ghorai and the 631 bhin githe are new weather stations installed recently talchabhadel et al 2020b there are some stations where data were missing for few days in a year the data gaps for the missing period were filled using information from the nearest spatial locations data gaps were significant in the year 2003 2009 2010 and 2013 fig 2 illustrates the temporal variation of annual precipitation derived from the gauge and three spes data for the study period spreads of all three spes in particular imerg and chirps are narrower compared to the spread of gauge data though these spes have high spatial resolution 10 km these products are generally calibrated using coarse spatial resolution products 25 km spatial variations may not be well captured across hilly topography more detailed comparative analysis considering the dependency on the elevation factor might be required for further rectification this study attempts to evaluate the applicability of using these spes employing simple technique for hydrologic assessment we found that persiann ccs values were almost half of the gauge data in general chirps and imerg showed a similar pattern with gauge data however noticeable fluctuations were visible for instance chirps during 90 s during the 90 s chirps data indicated significantly reduced values of precipitation however before and after 90 s chirps data were largely congruous with the gauge data importantly the tendency of inter annual variability is well captured by all three spes indicating a proper systematic bias could be detected and the bias could be reduced fig 3 depicts performance of different spes according to detection based indices pod csi far and fbi and magnitude based indices rmse and pbias chirps and persiann ccs revealed lower pod values compared to imerg however persiann ccs was found to be slightly better than chirps in terms of pod a similar pattern is observed for csi values in general all spes showed noteworthy false alarms the far values ranged from 0 4 to 0 8 for chirps and persiann ccs and from 0 3 to 0 8 for imerg imerg performed slightly better than the remaining two spes in terms of far fbi values are almost similar for all three cases however imerg showed a greater number of stations revealing overestimations of detections of precipitation whereas persiann ccs showed greater number of stations revealing underestimation of detections of precipitation persiann ccs clearly revealed substantial underestimated magnitudes in all stations across the study area in contrast chirps and imerg displayed a mixed pattern of under and over estimated magnitudes at different stations across the study area but when we closely look into rmse the rmse values ranged from 10 to 20 mm day for all selected spes indicating that all three spes have positive or negative daily biases overall based on detection and magnitude based indices imerg showed comparatively better performance the subsequent sections offer discussion on results after feeding the raw and corrected spes and gauge data into hydrologic model 3 2 performance of swat model we calibrated and validated the swat model at three hydrologic stations at upstream midstream and downstream table 3 shows the most sensitive parameters p 0 1 out of 36 selected parameters shown in table s2 in the supplement section alpha bnk lat ttime and cn2 were among the most sensitive parameters in the study area a few parameters which are meaningfully sensitive to the river discharge including baseflow are alpha bnk sol awc and canmx alpha bnk baseflow alpha factor for bank storage in days characterizes the bank storage recession curve most of the sensitive parameters are congruent with other swat models bhatta et al 2020 dhami et al 2018 pandey et al 2020a calibrated across western nepal higher the alpha bnk values flatter the recession lat time lateral flow travel time in days describes the lateral flow in the basin and cn2 initial scs curve number for moisture condition ii is a function of the soil s permeability land use and antecedent soil water conditions new sets of lower and upper bound for different parameters were set after sensitivity analysis and after another 1000 simulation runs the best simulation was selected fig 4 shows the model performance during both the calibration and validation periods at three hydrologic stations at upstream midstream and downstream of the study area on a daily scale overall the values are acceptable moriasi et al 2007 for a daily simulation nse and r2 values 0 7 were observed during calibration and validation period in upstream and midstream locations and these values 0 7 were observed at the downstream pbias 10 at downstream in both calibration and validation periods indicates an overestimation at the downstream location of the study area the pbias values at upstream and midstream stations are comparatively better our results indicated that the parameters in lower sub basins and hrus might need a further fine tuning if specific analyses are desired in lower regions of the study area excluding some extremes high and low flows the model reproduced the river discharge in an acceptable range throughout the simulation period from 1986 to 2015 the probability of exceedance poe informs the percentage of the time the flow is equalled or exceeded the poe for extremely high flow is very small as it is obvious that such an extreme discharge occurs for only a few numbers of time in a year and for some cases the return period might even cross 50 or 100 years in general the swat model currently has a limitation to simulate such extreme cases bhatta et al 2020 dhami et al 2018 pandey et al 2019 2020 in addition a continuous time marching in swat limits its application for detailed event based flood simulation bhatta et al 2020 for the analyses of different zones of river discharges based on poes we categorized the river discharge into four ranges i extremely high poe 0 1 ii high poe 1 10 iii average poe 10 60 and iv low poe 60 100 fig 5 exhibits flow duration curve fdc at four different ranges based on poe for the calibration and the validation period at three stations at upstream midstream and downstream of the study area for the extremely high flow the simulated discharge showed substantial underestimation which indicates that the swat model could not mimic the timing intensity and magnitude of peak flood poe 1 similar results were also reported by the previous studies dhami et al 2018 pandey et al 2020a 2019 for the high flow range the model underestimated at the upstream station however the model began to overestimate in midstream and downstream locations at poe 5 10 for the average flow the simulated discharge showed a slight overestimation whereas low flows were underestimated low flows with poe 80 are vital for water resources projects relying on dependable low flows like water supply irrigation agriculture and other environmental projects during dry periods while poe 10 i e high flows are crucial for flood disaster management for a specific focus on these extremes a careful selection of parameters their sensitivity analyses appropriate calibration validation and accordingly coupling with specific models are suggested for instance the swat model could be coupled with groundwater model for low flow analysis ahn et al 2018 or with hydraulic models for high flow analysis schmalz et al 2012 based on the above mentioned reliability the current model is acceptable for a water balance analysis and could be used for any intervention analysis most of the water resources projects rely on the water at average flow for instance run off river ror hydropower projects rely on poe 30 50 the model was then fed with different spes fig 6 shows the monthly variation of river discharge for different representative years based on observed and simulated data fed with gauge and different spes data chirps simulated discharge occasionally showed peak value during the month of june whereas simulated and observed discharge showed the peak during either july or august figures s1 s2 and s3 in supplement section are for all years at upstream midstream and downstream stations respectively most of the year the tendency of intra annual variability is well captured by all spes in general persiann ccs showed underestimated river discharge predominantly due to significant underestimated precipitation input wrt gauge data the underestimation of chirps precipitation during 90 s wrt gauge data resulted in a noticeable underestimation though expected of the river discharge overall imerg demonstrated an improved congruity with gauge simulated and observed river discharge most of the time fig 7 shows intra annual variation of simulated river discharge based on gauged and different spes data at different representative sub basins including three hydrologic stations use of hydrologic model allows us to explore how different sub basins from upstream to downstream responded to different precipitation data sets and propagated the most downstream sub basin presents river discharge at nepal india border though the location is ungauged calibrated hydrologic model informs likely river discharge during different time periods by forcing the model different interventions could be simulated at all selected sub basins imerg and chirps showed similar response as that of gauge data in the case of persiann ccs though the tendency is similar the magnitude is smaller we applied a linear scaling of bias correction to reduce the biases of different spes 3 3 bias correction of spes and their application for a specific study correction factors could be determined on a daily monthly or annual scale at every station or at a spatially averaged case for the spatially varying correction factors the correction factors would be local and their application to adjacent watershed demands site specific gauge data the rationale behind our study is not only to apply the correction factors for the selected catchment with a better precision but to apply the methodology and correction factors to either any data scarce adjacent watersheds or the study area with similar catchment properties table 4 shows mean monthly precipitation and monthly correction factors for different spes to correct the daily precipitation data in the study area the mean monthly correction factors ranged from 0 9 to 1 2 for chirps 1 0 1 3 for imerg and 1 5 2 7 for persiann ccs for chirps and imerg comparatively higher correction factors were observed during the non monsoon period in contrast higher correction factors were observed during monsoon period for persiann ccs table s3 in the supplement section shows station wise mean annual precipitation and the annual correction factor for different spes in the study area the annual correction factor for chirps and imerg was found to be 1 1 while it was 1 9 for persiann ccs figure s4 in the supplement section shows intra annual variations at different sub basins similar to fig 7 but for bias corrected spes after introducing bias correction at different levels all spes showed improved results and they were nearly congruous with gauge based simulation these evidence support the implementation of bias correction though simple and spatially uniform however the use of persiann ccs should be limited when other products do much better job with lower level of bias correction fig 8 shows performance evaluation of swat model based on nse r2 and pbias values for the simulations i based on gauge calibration and validation periods and ii different spes in raw and corrected forms at three stations in upstream midstream and downstream of the study area the figure well summarizes the improvement in model performance based on all three indices nse r2 and pbias values after the implementation of bias correction improvement for imerg and chirps was negligible compared to persiann ccs because the level of bias correction was substantial for persiann ccs nse improved from 0 15 to 0 40 pbias improved from 60 to 20 and r2 improved from 0 4 to 0 45 for persiann ccs fig 9 illustrates a similar disaggregated fdcs as in fig 5 but for the simulations based on bias corrected spes the corrected spes displayed nearly congruous pattern at all the four different ranges of poes extremely high high average and low however there exists some noticeable discrepancies persiann ccs even after the implementation of bias correction showed noticeable underestimation in extremely high poe 0 1 and high poe 1 10 zones and slight underestimation in average poe 10 60 zone of poes at the upstream station the results indicate that spatially uniform correction factor throughout the study area might not replicate a realistic bias reduction at upstream region of the study area one of the possible reasons is elevation heterogeneity since the upstream region is a hilly topography with a maximum elevation of 3618 m asl whereas lower region is almost flat we might need to consider an elevation dependencies karki et al 2016 during the computation of bias correction the graphical as well as statistical analyses clearly depict the potential of using spes for watershed scale rainfall runoff analysis we believe spes could be used in data scarce basins or to fill the data gap in gauge data for an effective water resource planning and management hereinafter spes simply means corrected spes our next analysis involved the estimation of the precipitation elasticity of the basin using both spes and gauge data 3 4 precipitation elasticity fig 10 shows the inter annual variation of precipitation elasticity for gauge and spes at three stations in upstream midstream and downstream of the study area the precipitation elasticity ranged from 1 3 to 1 6 in upstream and midstream meaning upper wrr basin whereas it ranged from 1 4 to 1 7 in downstream meaning lower wrr basin imerg showed slightly greater values of precipitation elasticity for most of the years in general persiann ccs showed slightly lower values of precipitation elasticity compared to gauge based chirps showed almost similar values of precipitation elasticity compared to gauge based at downstream station but slightly smaller values at upstream and midstream stations we found an average tendency of change in river discharge is 1 5 times the change in precipitation for a simulation based assessment precipitation elasticity could be combined with other climatic variables elasticity including potential evapotranspiration temperature or others chiew 2006 for an assessment of combined climate variables elasticity a non parametric estimator showed the larger value of precipitation elasticity compared to that of simulation based on scaling the precipitation table 5 shows a detail of precipitation elasticity computed using both methods simulated fed with scaled precipitation and non parametric estimator from different data sources based on gauge based simulation and observed data non parametric precipitation elasticity was found to be 2 for the upstream station and 1 7 for midstream and downstream stations imerg based simulation showed that nearly congruous value of non parametric precipitation elasticity wrt gauge based simulation and remaining two spes showed slight lower values in general by implementing different techniques we found the precipitation elasticity of the basin is 1 5 the relationship between precipitation elasticity and various catchment characteristics based on the soils vegetation and land use data sets are crucial for planning of water resources and water induced disasters in addition practitioners and water resource managers are concerned about an anticipated change of precipitation elasticity under climate change and future land use our study as the first kind of such study in nepal provides an understanding of precipitation elasticity of the study area using physically based hydrologic model we believe similar studies in other watersheds could provide a broader vision of catchment response under changing climate variables and finally our study supports the application of selected spes for hydrologic modelling in similar regions of the country 4 conclusion and outlook this study firstly evaluated the performance of three selected spes both the detection based and magnitude based evaluation indices showed that the imerg was superior and in contrast persiann ccs showed a significant underestimation however all spes showed significant false alarms the far values ranged from 0 4 to 0 8 for chirps and persiann ccs and from 0 3 to 0 8 for imerg importantly the tendency of intra annual variability is well captured by all three spes indicating the applicability of the spes however a proper systematic biases should be evaluated to reduce the contaminated biases after the implementation of bias correction of those spes at different levels all products revealed improved results and the simulated river discharges were nearly congruous to observed data in general intra annual variability of precipitation and river discharge was well represented by all three spes we found imerg to be superior among selected spes the annual correction factor for chirps and imerg was found to be 1 1 while it was 1 9 for persiann ccs selected spes could be used in data scarce basins or to fill the data gap in gauge data for an effective water resource planning and management for the analyses of different zones of river discharges based on poes this study categorized the flows into four ranges i extremely high poe 0 1 ii high poe 1 10 iii average poe 10 60 and iv low poe 60 100 for the extremely high flow the simulated discharge revealed significant underestimation indicating the limitations of the swat model to effectively mimic the timing intensity and magnitude of peak flood poe 1 the current study evaluated precipitation elasticity by two methods i a non parametric estimator and ii by scaling the gauge precipitation and spes data in both positive and negative directions ranging from 20 to 20 a non parametric estimator showed the larger value of precipitation elasticity compared to that of simulation based on scaling the precipitation in general by implementing different techniques we found the precipitation elasticity of the basin is 1 5 credit authorship contribution statement rocky

8277,study region west rapti river wrr basin western nepal study focus hydrologic modeling requires an accurate precipitation data at a high spatial resolution which is often limited in many regions of the globe as a complement to the ground gauge precipitation data satellite based precipitation estimates spes appear useful at first this study evaluated performance of three different spes namely i chirps ii persiann ccs and iii imerg with respect to gauge data using different event detection and quantification indices soil water assessment tool swat a semi distributed hydrologic model was used to simulate the river discharge we then analysed precipitation elasticity as a first kind of such study in nepalese river basin by scaling the precipitation input in both positive and negative directions ranging from 20 to 20 in order to explore basin response on likely alteration of precipitation a non parametric precipitation elasticity was finally computed for three different cases 1 observed river discharge 2 gauge based simulated river discharge and 3 spes based simulated river discharge new hydrologic insights for the region imerg proved to be superior among three spes all spes showed improved results after implementation of different levels of bias correction where daily precipitation data were corrected using linear correction factors computed at a mean monthly scale computed correction factors are replicable to nearby basins precipitation elasticity of the study area ranged from 1 3 to 2 0 approximately 1 5 which indicates that a 1 0 change in precipitation will result in 1 5 change in river discharge keywords hydrologic model precipitation elasticity satellite based precipitation estimate spe soil and water assessment tool swat 1 introduction climate precipitation temperature humidity etc and anthropogenic land use and land cover change urban heat islands etc factors largely attribute to the hydrologic characteristics of a river basin xue et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 and among several climatic variables precipitation is one of the key components of the energy water cycle kidd et al 2017 which directly governs the basin hydrology reliable representation of the spatio temporal variability of the catchment processes is a key challenge in hydrologic modeling dembélé et al 2020 on the other hand understanding of the sensitivity of river discharge to precipitation i e simply precipitation elasticity is vital for the effective management of water resources pandey et al 2020b vano et al 2012 to this end characterization of a basin hydrology is often achieved through hydrologic models with precipitation being a major driving variable meanwhile the application of hydrologic models for water resources assessment and management necessitates the adequately distributed precipitation information for reliable prediction cole and moore 2008 sanchez moreno et al 2014 but the use of hydrologic model to any river basin is often hindered due to the scantly available information on precipitation within a basin berg et al 2016 the precipitation information is generally derived from the ground based rain gauges meteorological radars and satellite based estimates the accuracy of gauge data is usually greater in comparison to other estimates berg et al 2016 brocca et al 2019 however their spatial density is limited in many regions kidd et al 2017 especially in developing countries like nepal behrangi et al 2011 montanari et al 2015 thapa et al 2016 kumar et al 2017 maidment et al 2017 which is further characterized by wide topographic variation alazzy et al 2017 in particular ranging from over 8000 m to as low as 60 m above sea level asl across nepal in addition such country either does not possess meteorological radars or has installed recently primarily due to economic and technological constraints under such a scenario satellite based precipitation estimates spes have the potential to overcome the limitations rendered by the low spatial density of ground based rain gauge stations bui et al 2019 dembélé et al 2020 siddique e akbor et al 2014 spes in general can complement the gauged data particularly where the observations are scarce tang et al 2009 with the advancement in satellite technology different countries are successfully operating several missions for the observation of climatic variables oecd 2008 furthermore spes have been available across the globe for more than four decades now the proliferation of satellite based products in the recent times has given a greater access to different climatic data than ever before levizzani and cattani 2019 sun et al 2018 at the same time the availability of such multiple spes may also likely puzzle the water resources practitioners and decision makers about the choice of any products therefore the assessment of the accuracy and performances evaluation are prerequisites for any spes before using them for any water resources planning or decision making maggioni et al 2016 wehbe et al 2017 the use of multiple sensors for the estimation of precipitation has indicated promising results recently brocca et al 2019 it is well understood that blending of satellite station and reanalysis data could augment our understanding of the spatial characteristics of precipitation particularly in data scarce region beck et al 2017 ning et al 2017 we need to understand that any spes might contain systematic and random biases a performance test of spes is necessary before applying to any hydrologic models in general performances of spes are strongly location dependent in this context this study used daily precipitation data of gauge and three spes 1 climate hazards group infrared precipitation chirp with stations chirps 0 05 spatial resolution 2 precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks cloud classification system persiann ccs 0 04 spatial resolution and 3 integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg final version hereinafter imerg 0 1 spatial resolution the selected three spes have higher spatial resolutions 0 1 10 km compared to other available products other promising products such as persiann climate data record persiann cdr and tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa both available at 0 25 grid were not included in this study due to their coarser resolution hydrologic models are regarded as one of the indispensable tools for better understanding the hydrologic characteristics of a basin which are imperative for making decisions on water resources management and planning singh 2018 at the same time the application of these models can also be crucial in performing various scenario and sensitivity analysis like land use or climate change impact analysis abbaspour et al 2009 dwarakish and ganasri 2015 qiu et al 2019 due to high spatio temporal variability of spes drawing a prior conclusion on their accuracy is not straightforward particularly when the corresponding observed data are limited zandler et al 2019 among different hydrologic components river discharge at a particular location could be of prime interest for the design of dams hydropower projects flood management or other water resources schemes johnston and smakhtin 2014 masaki et al 2017 in this regard hydrologic model can be employed for predicting river discharge with different input spes and compared against the observed discharge for the performance evaluation tarek et al 2020 yang et al 2014 similar to the rain gauge stations the number of hydrologic stations is highly limited and these stations may contain various sources of errors tarek et al 2020 however for this study we assumed the river discharge data are best available estimates it is equally labor time and cost intensive for maintaining hydrologic stations at different river reaches therefore hydrologic models are commonly used to simulate various hydrologic processes at different spatial scales various hydrologic models are available depending on the nature size and characteristics of the study area objective of the research and applications soil and water assessment tool swat is chosen in this study mainly for its extended applicability to simulate long term basin scale hydrologic processes and perform different scenario analysis among others swat is one of the widely acknowledged hydrologic tools for watershed modeling as evident from wang et al 2019 who reported more than 3000 leading journal papers related to swat application globally science citation index expanded sci e from 2008 to 2019 as retrieved on jan 2019 numerous swat related applications have been performed in different nepalese river basins by both national and international researchers to simulate basin scale hydrology climate change impacts land use change impacts etc aryal et al 2019 bharati et al 2016 bhatta et al 2019 dahal et al 2016 mishra et al 2018 pandey et al 2019 thapa et al 2017 2016 there are several adjacent watersheds that either do not possess any meteorological stations or have an insufficient number of meteorological stations furthermore such watersheds do not have long term river discharge data which hinders the planning of water related schemes the results of this study especially watershed parameters and correction factors of spes could be transferred to adjacent watersheds to simulate hydrologic processes and evaluate precipitation elasticity based on different spes a sound understanding of watershed response to precipitation is essential pandey et al 2020b for introducing any water resources related developmental or disaster mitigation plans including hydropower irrigation or river training works we selected west rapti river wrr basin as the study area because of the availability of a comparatively denser network of hydro meteorological stations and as a representative of watersheds of western region of nepal which are quite less explored on nonetheless we believe that the methodology adopted in this study can be applied even to any data scarce watersheds or watershed having a sparse gauge network the key objectives of this study are i to assess the performance of spes ii to fed them in hydrologic model swat to simulate river discharge and iii to finally evaluate precipitation elasticity of the watershed using both ground and satellite based precipitation data 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area wrr basin is located in the southern parts of western nepal shown in fig 1 geographically the study area extends from 27 40 to 28 35 north latitudes and 81 40 to 83 10 east longitudes fig 1a and b show land use land cover lulc and soil data of the study area the lulc map for the year 2010 adopted in this study was produced by the international centre for integrated mountain development icimod 2013 at a spatial resolution of 30 m and details on lulc data are available in uddin et al 2015 agriculture and forest comprising 33 and 60 of the study area respectively are the two dominant land cover types in the basin talchabhadel et al 2020b the soil data was obtained from soil and terrain database soter spatial resolution 1 1 000 000 the topographical data used in this study is advanced space borne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster global digital elevation model version gdem version 3 the elevation ranges from about 100 m to over 3600 m asl within a small latitude extent depicted in fig 1c a network of hydro meteorological station is presented in fig 1c the upper region of the study area is characterized by temperate climate whereas the lower regions experience a tropical climate karki et al 2016 the length of main river channel from its origin to indo nepal border is about 250 km the precipitation is dominated by monsoonal system where approximately 80 of annual precipitation occurs in monsoon period which extends through june to september talchabhadel et al 2018 more precisely july alone contributes about 28 ranging from 23 to 32 4 at different stations of the annual precipitation in contrast november and december contribute less than 1 of the annual precipitation varying from 0 1 to 1 2 for november and 0 2 1 7 for december at different stations talchabhadel et al 2020a overall the amount and the duration of direct runoff are meagre in non monsoon period the wrr originates from the middle mountains of the country enters the lowlands and finally drains to ganges in india it is joined by several tributaries like jhimruk mari arun lungri sit danduwa sotiya and gadheli talchabhadel and sharma 2014 from the downstream of the confluence of mari and jhimruk rivers the river is named the wrr in this study three hydrologic stations were used namely mari at upstream tributary hereinafter upstream bagasoti after the confluence of upstream tributaries hereinafter midstream and jakundi at downstream station hereinafter downstream the catchment areas at the upstream midstream and the downstream are 1980 km2 3380 km2 and 5082 km2 respectively 2 2 hydro meteorological data this study used daily precipitation data from 18 precipitation stations temperature data from 8 climate stations and mean daily discharge mdd data from 3 hydrologic stations locations are shown in fig 1c and meta data available in table s1 in the supplement section maintained by the department of hydrology and meteorology dhm government of nepal gon for the period of 1981 2015 weather radar and satellite are the two other data sources that can provide a viable alternative to gauge data since weather radar is not available this study attempts to assess the appraisal of spes this study used three spes based on multiple satellite based products 1 chirps 1981 2015 2 persiann ccs 2003 2015 and 3 imerg 2000 2015 chirps available from 1981 onwards is a quasi global precipitation data set that blends satellite and gauge precipitation data at first infrared precipitation pentad 5 day estimates are created from satellite data using information of cloud temperature and are calibrated with respect to wrt the tmpa pentads these pentads are divided by its long term 1981 2013 normal values and the fractions multiplied against the corresponding climate hazards precipitation funk et al 2015b provide chirp estimates finally pentad chirp values are redistributed to daily precipitation estimates based on daily noaa cfs national oceanic and atmospheric administration climate forecast system chirp data is finally blended with stations data to generate chirps product please follow funk et al 2015a for the detailed information of algorithm chirps station data merging geostationary satellites are capable of providing images every 15 30 min in multiple spectral bands of the cloud patterns and evolution over time ashouri et al 2015 persiann system employs neural network methods to estimate precipitation using the information of the infrared brightness temperature image provided by these geostationary satellites persiann ccs is a real time global high resolution satellite product that enables the categorization of cloud patch features based on cloud height areal extent and variability of texture estimated from satellite imagery the detailed description of persiann family is discussed in nguyen et al 2018 persiann ccs data is available 2003 onwards thapa et al 2016 used persiann ccs in mountainous regions of bagmati river basin in nepal to simulate the river discharge using the swat model imerg estimates precipitation from the various passive microwave pmw sensors comprising the gpm global precipitation measurement constellation precipitation estimates are computed employing goddard profiling algorithm gprof2017 please follow huffman et al 2019 for the detailed information we used 06b version final products of imerg herein after imerg which is available after 3 5 months of observation time after the concluding calibration based on monthly gpcc global precipitation climatology centre gauge based dataset table 1 shows a summary of data used in this study 2 3 evaluation of satellite based precipitation estimates inter comparisons of different spes with daily gauge data were conducted at 18 precipitation stations for the aforementioned time period this study employed 4 precipitation event detection indices 1 probability of detection pod 2 critical success index csi 3 false alarm ratio far and 4 frequency bias index fbi the calculation procedure is shown in table 2 pod csi and far range from 0 to 1 a higher value represents an ideal condition for pod and csi whereas lower value represents the ideal condition for far the ideal value of fbi is 1 fbi ranges from 0 to pod indicates the proportion of correctly detected precipitation events to the total number of gauge based precipitation events similarly csi indicates an overall proportion of correctly detected precipitation events to the total number of precipitation events either detected by satellite or gauge in contrast fbi denotes the proportion of false status to the total number of precipitation events detected by satellite fbi represents a simple bias between satellite detected precipitation events to the gauge based precipitation events fbi values 1 represents over estimation of precipitation event detection and 1 represent under estimation of precipitation event detection we computed quantitative evaluation of different spes using root mean square error rmse and percentage bias pbias wrt gauge data 1 r m s e 1 n s p e i g a u g e i 2 2 p b i a s s p e i g a u g e i g a u g e i 100 here negative value of pbias represents underestimation positive value represents overestimation and perfect zero represents ideal i e without any volume bias for spes wrt gauge data a lower value is best for rmse a linear scaling method of bias correction was used to correct biases of spes monthly correction factors c f g a u g e s p e s were computed by comparing basin averaged precipitation based on gauge and spes on a mean monthly scale computed monthly correction factors were then multiplied to the raw daily precipitation data at every station on corresponding months it is to be taken care that if the data quality of gauge precipitation data is poor it might lead to unrealistic representation of spes in particular there are high chances of low data quality in remote stations across the mountainous terrain in case of selected study area there were negligible data gaps and the selected study area is one of the basins of nepal having high quality observed data the computed correction factors could be transferred to nearby ungauged basins 2 4 swat model swat model is a continuous time semi distributed physically based river basin scale model operated at daily or hourly time steps the model has widely been applied to different river basins gauged or ungauged across the globe major model components include weather hydrology soil plant growth sediments nutrients and land management arnold et al 2012b all the equations incorporated in the model are described in the very comprehensive theoretical documentation manual neitsch et al 2011 among different available swat modules and resources like qswat swat grass and different modified swat models arcswat olivera et al 2006 is one of the popular and user friendly modules for setting up the model and modifying input parameters the watershed modeling in this study is based on arcswat 2012 in swat a watershed is discretized into multiple sub basins each sub basin is further divided into multiple hydrologic response units hrus smallest units consisting of homogenous soil characteristics land use and topographical settings neitsch et al 2011 in this study wrr basin was delineated into 30 sub basins which was further divided into 488 hrus runoff from all hrus within a sub basin are summed and enter the main reach of the sub basin and they are routed through the channel network to the outlet of the watershed the water balance expression used in the swat model is 5 s w t s w 0 i 1 t r d a y q s u r f e a w s e e p q g w where s w t and s w 0 are the final and early stage water contents of the soil respectively t is time in days r d a y is the daily precipitation q s u r f is the daily surface runoff e a is the daily evapotranspiration w s e e p is the daily percolation and q g w is the daily return flow all units are in mm surface runoff is most commonly simulated using the scs curve number scs cn method in the swat the scs cn method is a rainfall runoff model that computes excess runoff king et al 1999 which assumes an initial abstraction could be defined as a percentage of potential maximum retention after runoff begins that is related to the curve number neitsch et al 2011 2 5 swat calibration and validation accurate calibration of any hydrologic models including swat followed by the validation is a routine yet a key step during the water balance flood or similar hydrologic modeling swat being a physically based model requires the input parameters be held within a realistic uncertainty range sensitivity analysis which determines the most sensitive parameters of the basin precedes the model calibration and validation processes this study employed a global sensitivity analysis by allowing all parameter values to change arnold et al 2012b once the sensitive parameters are identified model calibration is performed next model calibration involves a careful allocation of values for the selected input parameters within their respective uncertainty range such that model estimations simulated output and observed gauge data are in a close agreement with each other finally in the validation step the model is simulated for a separate time period not included in the calibration keeping the same parameters obtained from the calibration in this study the period of five years from 1981 to 1985 was considered as the warm up period while 1986 2005 20 years and 2006 2015 10 years were used as the calibration and validation periods respectively for the river discharge this study used gauge precipitation data for calibration validation process and later forced different spes to the calibrated model to represent the spatial heterogeneity of the basin three discharge gauging stations namely mari at upstream bagasoti at midstream and jalkundi at downstream were used for multi site calibration and validation process a sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 abbaspour et al 2004 a semi automated approach was employed using the swat cup swat calibration uncertainty procedure swat cup is the most widely used tool for performing parameterization sensitivity and uncertainty analysis calibration and validation of input parameters 500 simulations were performed in first iteration for fine tuning of 36 selected input parameters shown in table s2 in supplement section the parameters were selected by referring literatures arnold et al 2012a and published studies dhami et al 2018 bhatta et al 2019 pandey et al 2019 2020 across nepal finally two iterations of 500 simulations each meaning 1000 simulations were performed with revised ranges of most sensitive parameters p 0 1 for the study area nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 was chosen as an objective function because of its wide application nse is a normalized index that tells the magnitude of residual variance compared to observed variance in addition percentage bias pbias and coefficient of determination r2 between simulated and observed river discharge were also checked please see krause et al 2005 and moriasi et al 2007 for a detailed information on these indices here negative values of pbias represent underestimation and positive values represent overestimation of simulate river discharge wrt observed ones we also performed manual calibration of few parameters related to baseflow after auto calibration based on knowledge of the basin finally the calibrated and validated model was then fed with raw and bias corrected spes 2 6 precipitation elasticity estimation the sensitivity of the total river discharge estimated by swat to the precipitation was evaluated by scaling the gauge precipitation data running the calibrated model and then comparing with simulated river discharge using the original data the daily precipitation time series was scaled by 20 10 10 and 20 the precipitation elasticity of river discharge was evaluated using following expression 6 δ q ε p δ p where δ q is change in simulated mean annual river discharge and δ p is change in annual rainfall and ε p is precipitation elasticity of river discharge apart from simulation there exists other different methods to estimate precipitation elasticity pandey et al 2020b assessed climate elasticity including precipitation elasticity using different methods based on water balance models for an extended east rapti watershed adjacent to current study area in this study we used a simple and popular non parametric estimator sankarasubramanian et al 2001 s approach to estimate precipitation elasticity of river discharge which is the proportional change in river discharge divided by the proportional change in precipitation it can be expressed as 7 ε p n p m e d i a n q i q p p i p q where ε p n p is the precipitation elasticity of river discharge based on the non parametric estimator p and q are mean annual precipitation and river discharge respectively for the study period p i and q i are annual precipitation and river discharge respectively for the i th year precipitation elasticity of river discharge provides a measure of the sensitivity of river discharge to precipitation a value 1 indicates that a 1 change in precipitation can cause 1 change in river discharge in this study ε p n p was determined for three different cases 1 observed river discharge 2 gauge based simulated river discharge and 3 spes based simulated discharge this method has a numerical problem when p i approaches p causing ε p tends to for that i th year 3 results and discussions 3 1 evaluation of selected precipitation products most of the stations cover a complete span of length except a few stations 407 kusum 502 shera gaun 515 ghorai and 631 bhing githe it should be noted that the 515 ghorai and the 631 bhin githe are new weather stations installed recently talchabhadel et al 2020b there are some stations where data were missing for few days in a year the data gaps for the missing period were filled using information from the nearest spatial locations data gaps were significant in the year 2003 2009 2010 and 2013 fig 2 illustrates the temporal variation of annual precipitation derived from the gauge and three spes data for the study period spreads of all three spes in particular imerg and chirps are narrower compared to the spread of gauge data though these spes have high spatial resolution 10 km these products are generally calibrated using coarse spatial resolution products 25 km spatial variations may not be well captured across hilly topography more detailed comparative analysis considering the dependency on the elevation factor might be required for further rectification this study attempts to evaluate the applicability of using these spes employing simple technique for hydrologic assessment we found that persiann ccs values were almost half of the gauge data in general chirps and imerg showed a similar pattern with gauge data however noticeable fluctuations were visible for instance chirps during 90 s during the 90 s chirps data indicated significantly reduced values of precipitation however before and after 90 s chirps data were largely congruous with the gauge data importantly the tendency of inter annual variability is well captured by all three spes indicating a proper systematic bias could be detected and the bias could be reduced fig 3 depicts performance of different spes according to detection based indices pod csi far and fbi and magnitude based indices rmse and pbias chirps and persiann ccs revealed lower pod values compared to imerg however persiann ccs was found to be slightly better than chirps in terms of pod a similar pattern is observed for csi values in general all spes showed noteworthy false alarms the far values ranged from 0 4 to 0 8 for chirps and persiann ccs and from 0 3 to 0 8 for imerg imerg performed slightly better than the remaining two spes in terms of far fbi values are almost similar for all three cases however imerg showed a greater number of stations revealing overestimations of detections of precipitation whereas persiann ccs showed greater number of stations revealing underestimation of detections of precipitation persiann ccs clearly revealed substantial underestimated magnitudes in all stations across the study area in contrast chirps and imerg displayed a mixed pattern of under and over estimated magnitudes at different stations across the study area but when we closely look into rmse the rmse values ranged from 10 to 20 mm day for all selected spes indicating that all three spes have positive or negative daily biases overall based on detection and magnitude based indices imerg showed comparatively better performance the subsequent sections offer discussion on results after feeding the raw and corrected spes and gauge data into hydrologic model 3 2 performance of swat model we calibrated and validated the swat model at three hydrologic stations at upstream midstream and downstream table 3 shows the most sensitive parameters p 0 1 out of 36 selected parameters shown in table s2 in the supplement section alpha bnk lat ttime and cn2 were among the most sensitive parameters in the study area a few parameters which are meaningfully sensitive to the river discharge including baseflow are alpha bnk sol awc and canmx alpha bnk baseflow alpha factor for bank storage in days characterizes the bank storage recession curve most of the sensitive parameters are congruent with other swat models bhatta et al 2020 dhami et al 2018 pandey et al 2020a calibrated across western nepal higher the alpha bnk values flatter the recession lat time lateral flow travel time in days describes the lateral flow in the basin and cn2 initial scs curve number for moisture condition ii is a function of the soil s permeability land use and antecedent soil water conditions new sets of lower and upper bound for different parameters were set after sensitivity analysis and after another 1000 simulation runs the best simulation was selected fig 4 shows the model performance during both the calibration and validation periods at three hydrologic stations at upstream midstream and downstream of the study area on a daily scale overall the values are acceptable moriasi et al 2007 for a daily simulation nse and r2 values 0 7 were observed during calibration and validation period in upstream and midstream locations and these values 0 7 were observed at the downstream pbias 10 at downstream in both calibration and validation periods indicates an overestimation at the downstream location of the study area the pbias values at upstream and midstream stations are comparatively better our results indicated that the parameters in lower sub basins and hrus might need a further fine tuning if specific analyses are desired in lower regions of the study area excluding some extremes high and low flows the model reproduced the river discharge in an acceptable range throughout the simulation period from 1986 to 2015 the probability of exceedance poe informs the percentage of the time the flow is equalled or exceeded the poe for extremely high flow is very small as it is obvious that such an extreme discharge occurs for only a few numbers of time in a year and for some cases the return period might even cross 50 or 100 years in general the swat model currently has a limitation to simulate such extreme cases bhatta et al 2020 dhami et al 2018 pandey et al 2019 2020 in addition a continuous time marching in swat limits its application for detailed event based flood simulation bhatta et al 2020 for the analyses of different zones of river discharges based on poes we categorized the river discharge into four ranges i extremely high poe 0 1 ii high poe 1 10 iii average poe 10 60 and iv low poe 60 100 fig 5 exhibits flow duration curve fdc at four different ranges based on poe for the calibration and the validation period at three stations at upstream midstream and downstream of the study area for the extremely high flow the simulated discharge showed substantial underestimation which indicates that the swat model could not mimic the timing intensity and magnitude of peak flood poe 1 similar results were also reported by the previous studies dhami et al 2018 pandey et al 2020a 2019 for the high flow range the model underestimated at the upstream station however the model began to overestimate in midstream and downstream locations at poe 5 10 for the average flow the simulated discharge showed a slight overestimation whereas low flows were underestimated low flows with poe 80 are vital for water resources projects relying on dependable low flows like water supply irrigation agriculture and other environmental projects during dry periods while poe 10 i e high flows are crucial for flood disaster management for a specific focus on these extremes a careful selection of parameters their sensitivity analyses appropriate calibration validation and accordingly coupling with specific models are suggested for instance the swat model could be coupled with groundwater model for low flow analysis ahn et al 2018 or with hydraulic models for high flow analysis schmalz et al 2012 based on the above mentioned reliability the current model is acceptable for a water balance analysis and could be used for any intervention analysis most of the water resources projects rely on the water at average flow for instance run off river ror hydropower projects rely on poe 30 50 the model was then fed with different spes fig 6 shows the monthly variation of river discharge for different representative years based on observed and simulated data fed with gauge and different spes data chirps simulated discharge occasionally showed peak value during the month of june whereas simulated and observed discharge showed the peak during either july or august figures s1 s2 and s3 in supplement section are for all years at upstream midstream and downstream stations respectively most of the year the tendency of intra annual variability is well captured by all spes in general persiann ccs showed underestimated river discharge predominantly due to significant underestimated precipitation input wrt gauge data the underestimation of chirps precipitation during 90 s wrt gauge data resulted in a noticeable underestimation though expected of the river discharge overall imerg demonstrated an improved congruity with gauge simulated and observed river discharge most of the time fig 7 shows intra annual variation of simulated river discharge based on gauged and different spes data at different representative sub basins including three hydrologic stations use of hydrologic model allows us to explore how different sub basins from upstream to downstream responded to different precipitation data sets and propagated the most downstream sub basin presents river discharge at nepal india border though the location is ungauged calibrated hydrologic model informs likely river discharge during different time periods by forcing the model different interventions could be simulated at all selected sub basins imerg and chirps showed similar response as that of gauge data in the case of persiann ccs though the tendency is similar the magnitude is smaller we applied a linear scaling of bias correction to reduce the biases of different spes 3 3 bias correction of spes and their application for a specific study correction factors could be determined on a daily monthly or annual scale at every station or at a spatially averaged case for the spatially varying correction factors the correction factors would be local and their application to adjacent watershed demands site specific gauge data the rationale behind our study is not only to apply the correction factors for the selected catchment with a better precision but to apply the methodology and correction factors to either any data scarce adjacent watersheds or the study area with similar catchment properties table 4 shows mean monthly precipitation and monthly correction factors for different spes to correct the daily precipitation data in the study area the mean monthly correction factors ranged from 0 9 to 1 2 for chirps 1 0 1 3 for imerg and 1 5 2 7 for persiann ccs for chirps and imerg comparatively higher correction factors were observed during the non monsoon period in contrast higher correction factors were observed during monsoon period for persiann ccs table s3 in the supplement section shows station wise mean annual precipitation and the annual correction factor for different spes in the study area the annual correction factor for chirps and imerg was found to be 1 1 while it was 1 9 for persiann ccs figure s4 in the supplement section shows intra annual variations at different sub basins similar to fig 7 but for bias corrected spes after introducing bias correction at different levels all spes showed improved results and they were nearly congruous with gauge based simulation these evidence support the implementation of bias correction though simple and spatially uniform however the use of persiann ccs should be limited when other products do much better job with lower level of bias correction fig 8 shows performance evaluation of swat model based on nse r2 and pbias values for the simulations i based on gauge calibration and validation periods and ii different spes in raw and corrected forms at three stations in upstream midstream and downstream of the study area the figure well summarizes the improvement in model performance based on all three indices nse r2 and pbias values after the implementation of bias correction improvement for imerg and chirps was negligible compared to persiann ccs because the level of bias correction was substantial for persiann ccs nse improved from 0 15 to 0 40 pbias improved from 60 to 20 and r2 improved from 0 4 to 0 45 for persiann ccs fig 9 illustrates a similar disaggregated fdcs as in fig 5 but for the simulations based on bias corrected spes the corrected spes displayed nearly congruous pattern at all the four different ranges of poes extremely high high average and low however there exists some noticeable discrepancies persiann ccs even after the implementation of bias correction showed noticeable underestimation in extremely high poe 0 1 and high poe 1 10 zones and slight underestimation in average poe 10 60 zone of poes at the upstream station the results indicate that spatially uniform correction factor throughout the study area might not replicate a realistic bias reduction at upstream region of the study area one of the possible reasons is elevation heterogeneity since the upstream region is a hilly topography with a maximum elevation of 3618 m asl whereas lower region is almost flat we might need to consider an elevation dependencies karki et al 2016 during the computation of bias correction the graphical as well as statistical analyses clearly depict the potential of using spes for watershed scale rainfall runoff analysis we believe spes could be used in data scarce basins or to fill the data gap in gauge data for an effective water resource planning and management hereinafter spes simply means corrected spes our next analysis involved the estimation of the precipitation elasticity of the basin using both spes and gauge data 3 4 precipitation elasticity fig 10 shows the inter annual variation of precipitation elasticity for gauge and spes at three stations in upstream midstream and downstream of the study area the precipitation elasticity ranged from 1 3 to 1 6 in upstream and midstream meaning upper wrr basin whereas it ranged from 1 4 to 1 7 in downstream meaning lower wrr basin imerg showed slightly greater values of precipitation elasticity for most of the years in general persiann ccs showed slightly lower values of precipitation elasticity compared to gauge based chirps showed almost similar values of precipitation elasticity compared to gauge based at downstream station but slightly smaller values at upstream and midstream stations we found an average tendency of change in river discharge is 1 5 times the change in precipitation for a simulation based assessment precipitation elasticity could be combined with other climatic variables elasticity including potential evapotranspiration temperature or others chiew 2006 for an assessment of combined climate variables elasticity a non parametric estimator showed the larger value of precipitation elasticity compared to that of simulation based on scaling the precipitation table 5 shows a detail of precipitation elasticity computed using both methods simulated fed with scaled precipitation and non parametric estimator from different data sources based on gauge based simulation and observed data non parametric precipitation elasticity was found to be 2 for the upstream station and 1 7 for midstream and downstream stations imerg based simulation showed that nearly congruous value of non parametric precipitation elasticity wrt gauge based simulation and remaining two spes showed slight lower values in general by implementing different techniques we found the precipitation elasticity of the basin is 1 5 the relationship between precipitation elasticity and various catchment characteristics based on the soils vegetation and land use data sets are crucial for planning of water resources and water induced disasters in addition practitioners and water resource managers are concerned about an anticipated change of precipitation elasticity under climate change and future land use our study as the first kind of such study in nepal provides an understanding of precipitation elasticity of the study area using physically based hydrologic model we believe similar studies in other watersheds could provide a broader vision of catchment response under changing climate variables and finally our study supports the application of selected spes for hydrologic modelling in similar regions of the country 4 conclusion and outlook this study firstly evaluated the performance of three selected spes both the detection based and magnitude based evaluation indices showed that the imerg was superior and in contrast persiann ccs showed a significant underestimation however all spes showed significant false alarms the far values ranged from 0 4 to 0 8 for chirps and persiann ccs and from 0 3 to 0 8 for imerg importantly the tendency of intra annual variability is well captured by all three spes indicating the applicability of the spes however a proper systematic biases should be evaluated to reduce the contaminated biases after the implementation of bias correction of those spes at different levels all products revealed improved results and the simulated river discharges were nearly congruous to observed data in general intra annual variability of precipitation and river discharge was well represented by all three spes we found imerg to be superior among selected spes the annual correction factor for chirps and imerg was found to be 1 1 while it was 1 9 for persiann ccs selected spes could be used in data scarce basins or to fill the data gap in gauge data for an effective water resource planning and management for the analyses of different zones of river discharges based on poes this study categorized the flows into four ranges i extremely high poe 0 1 ii high poe 1 10 iii average poe 10 60 and iv low poe 60 100 for the extremely high flow the simulated discharge revealed significant underestimation indicating the limitations of the swat model to effectively mimic the timing intensity and magnitude of peak flood poe 1 the current study evaluated precipitation elasticity by two methods i a non parametric estimator and ii by scaling the gauge precipitation and spes data in both positive and negative directions ranging from 20 to 20 a non parametric estimator showed the larger value of precipitation elasticity compared to that of simulation based on scaling the precipitation in general by implementing different techniques we found the precipitation elasticity of the basin is 1 5 credit authorship contribution statement rocky

8278,study region vietnamese mekong delta study focus this study investigates the trends of groundwater levels gwls the memory effect of alluvial aquifers and the response times between surface water and groundwater across the vietnamese mekong delta vmd trend analysis auto and cross correlation and time series decomposition were applied within a moving window approach to examine non stationary behavior new hydrological insights our study revealed an effective connection between the shallowest aquifer unit holocene and surface water and a high potential for shallow groundwater recharge however low permeable aquicludes separating the aquifers behave as low pass filters that reduce the high frequency signals in the gwl variations and limit the recharge to the deep groundwater declining gwls 0 01 0 55 m year were detected for all aquifers throughout the 22 years of observation indicating that the groundwater abstraction exceeds groundwater recharge stronger declining trends were detected for deeper groundwater the dynamic trend analysis indicates that the decrease of gwls accelerated continuously the groundwater memory effect varied according to the geographical location being shorter in shallow aquifers and flood prone areas and longer in deep aquifers and coastal areas variation of the response time between the river and alluvial aquifers was controlled by groundwater depth and season the response time was shorter during the flood season indicating that the bulk of groundwater recharge occurred in the late flood season particularly in the deep aquifers keywords groundwater statistics time series analysis moving window groundwater surface water interactions alluvial aquifers 1 introduction alluvial aquifers play an important role in sustaining agricultural activities and the livelihood of the population in river deltas in areas where rainfall is not uniformly distributed throughout the year e g tropical or arid regions they are primary sources for good quality freshwater as they are less vulnerable to contamination or climate variability than surface water bodies however accurate estimates of groundwater recharge and the response between surface water and alluvial aquifers can be difficult to obtain and significant uncertainties exist in groundwater storage in alluvial settings under impacts of climate change and human activities syvitski et al 2009 vörösmarty et al 2009 hirabayashi et al 2013 which challenge national to global food security kummu et al 2012 understanding the mechanisms of alluvial aquifers is fundamental the vietnamese mekong delta vmd an alluvial delta forming the southern tip of vietnam is home to 18 million people and plays a vital role in the country s food security and economy renaud and kuenzer 2012 groundwater resources management is one of the prerequisites for living and livelihood in the vmd the extensive hydrological manipulation of the delta has a direct impact on groundwater resources mainly through the disruption of natural flood regimes groundwater exploitation and artificial groundwater recharge and salt intrusion in the alluvial aquifers renaud and kuenzer

correlation analysis auto correlation and cross correlation can be used aquifers can act as filters to transform input signals into output signals by transfer functions labat et al 2000 which can be interpreted to gain insight into the function and structure of aquifers delbart et al 2014 following the methodology of mangin 1984 numerous studies have reported the memory effect and response of groundwater in karst systems e g larocque et al 1998 massei et al 2006 mayaud et al 2014 delbart et al 2016 in alluvial systems however these concepts have found limited application and need further testing imagawa et al 2013 duvert et al 2015 in this study groundwater flow processes in the alluvial aquifers of the vmd are investigated by trend and correlation analysis as well as time series decomposition all these analyses are incorporated into a moving window approach to identify non stationary responses we investigate 1 trends in groundwater levels 2 the memory effect of alluvial aquifers and 3 the time variant response between surface water and groundwater throughout the vmd the results are essential for groundwater resource management and livelihoods in the region and highlight the general mechanisms of sub surface water transport in alluvial settings 2 study area the study area is the vmd covering an area of 4 million hectares between 8 5 11 5 n and 104 5 106 8 e fig 1 the delta has an extremely low mean elevation 0 8 m above sea level minderhoud et al 2019 during the flood season july november 35 50 of the delta is flooded mainly by river discharge exceeding bank level the resulting inundation reaches depths of up to 4 0 m for 3 6 months toan 2014 constituting inundation areas that recharge water to alluvial aquifers in this study the inundation areas were adapted from triet et al 2017 these areas cover a territory of approximately 2 0 million hectares in the northern part of the vmd fig 1 according to danh and khai 2015 groundwater in the vmd is typically accessed via private tube wells more than 1 million shallow tube wells across the delta at depths of 80 120 m and groundwater abstraction wells of water supply plants reaching depths of 200 450 m the total groundwater abstraction was estimated at approximately 2 5 million m3 per day in 2015 minderhoud et al 2017 the multi layered aquifer system in the vmd has an alluvial basin structure the deepest area of the basement is located below the mekong and bassac rivers and rises to the northeast north and northwest borders anderson 1978 wagner et al 2012 sediments were deposited during transgression and regression events around 6000 5000 yr bp lap nguyen et al 2000 resulting in a highly complex stratigraphy the subsurface structure and hydrogeological units in the vmd are classified according to geological formations holocene pleistocene pliocene and miocene aquifer systems wagner et al 2012 these aquifers are located below ground level around 0 49 m 31 193 m 153 381 m and 275 550 m respectively cf table 1s in the supplement these age units can be sub divided into eight hydrogeological aquifer systems holocene qh upper pleistocene qp3 middle pleistocene qp2 3 lower pleistocene qp1 middle pliocene n2 2 lower pliocene n2 1 upper miocene n1 3 and middle miocene n1 2 3 generally each unit consists of two layers i a low permeable aquitard layer composed of silt and clay and ii a high permeable aquifer layer composed of fine to coarse sand and gravel the horizontal hydraulic conductivities of the aquitards and aquifers are in the range of 3 40 10 8 m s and 1 20 10 4 m s respectively the hydrogeological characterization of these semi confined aquifers is given in wagner et al 2012 and their lithological nature and hydraulic properties are described in minderhoud et al 2017 and summarised in hung van et al 2019 in this study the middle miocene n1 2 3 was not considered due to a lack of data 3 methods 3 1 datasets groundwater levels gwl in the vmd have been recorded starting from the mid 1990s at multiple temporal resolutions from daily to monthly and with different monitoring duration 8 22 years we collected gwl time series between 1996 and 2017 from 88 boreholes table s1 in the supplement at 27 distributed well nests fig 1 from these data sets the borehole data series with temporal resolutions higher than weekly and monitoring durations longer than ten years were selected the datasets were supported by the project research on improvement for the efficiency of water resources monitoring system for early warning of depletion and saline intrusion in the mekong delta plain no đtđl cn 46 18 which is funded by ministry of science and technology most an hourly discharge time series from 1996 to 2017 at chau doc was also collected to represent the variability of surface water in the vmd in the analysis the discharge data was provided by the southern institute of water resources research siwrr for consistency all collected data were aggregated to weekly mean values 3 2 time series decomposition we applied a nonparametric time series decomposition approach known as stl seasonal trend decomposition procedure based on loess cleveland et al 1990 the stl method uses locally weighted regression loess operations with different moving window lengths to separate a time series into three distinct components eq 1 shows the additive decomposition of the trend t t seasonal s t and remainder r t components from the original signal y t 1 y t t t s t r t typically each component can be related to different processes acting during the generation of the time series in the case of gwl time series the role of each component was classified by lafare et al 2016 as follows t t represents the long term processes operating over the period of the entire time series s t represents a cyclical process e g the annual cycles resulting from recharge periods r t represents local processes that cause variability between cycles and can thus be attributed to shorter term events or impacts e g the local recharge and or abstraction on the groundwater system there is no unique choice for selecting the smoothing parameter e g the length of the moving window within the stl algorithm in many applications the decision should be based on the goals of the analysis and the knowledge about the mechanisms generating the time series cleveland et al 1990 while a large value can result in similar components in all years a small value can track the observations more closely shamsudduha et al 2009 in this study we selected a 10 years window for the trend component and 1 year window for the seasonal component in this way we were able to highlight decadal trends and annual cycles 3 3 identification of gwl variability we calculated the ratio between the variance of decomposed components and the original signal eq 2 to measure the relative importance of the variance associated with each component in comparison to the original signal graphical comparison of these ratios lafare et al 2016 and the boxplot of seasonal variation of normalized time series were used to characterize the relative variability of gwl in the vmd 2a ratiotrend variance t t variance y t 2b ratioseasonal variance s t variance y t 2c ratioremainder variance r t variance y t 3 4 trend analysis we applied the mann kendall mk nonparametric trend test mann 1945 kendall 1948 with sen s slope sen 1968 to investigate recent changes 1996 2017 of the groundwater system in the vmd the trend magnitude was reported as sen s slope considering a significance level of 95 trends were calculated by a moving window approach 10 year window with 1 year increment of the original groundwater level time series to investigate the time variations of trends spatial patterns of sen s slope were mapped at the regional scale using gis built in interpolation models and geostatistical kriging techniques in arcgis version 10 4 time series were analyzed using matlab r2019b with the statistics toolbox version 11 6 3 5 auto correlation auto correlation analysis was used to identify the memory effect mangin 1984 massei et al 2006 duvert et al 2015 of alluvial aquifers in the vmd we applied the auto correlation to the remainder component r t because it represents the local effects and short term events lafare et al 2016 while the trend and seasonal components are by definition significantly auto correlated the auto correlation of a time series x is defined as box et al 2015 3 r x k n 1 i 1 n k x i x x i k x σ x 2 where r x k is the autocorrelation coefficient at lag k and x is the arithmetic mean of the time series with n observations σ x is the standard deviation of the time series the value of k was selected smaller than the cutting point n 3 to avoid stability problems the memory effect of the signal was defined as the time lag when r x k reached a value of 0 2 as frequently applied in gwl studies mangin 1984 the value was termed as the de correlation time lag k 0 2 here alternatively the memory effect was also characterized by the overall shape and magnitude of the auto correlogram massei et al 2006 we quantified the slope of the auto correlogram by logarithmic fits following massei et al 2006 duvert et al 2015 4 r x k α log k β where α week 1 and β dimensionless are slope and intercept of the logarithmic function respectively typically α describes the rate at which the correlation decreases during the study period and β corresponds to the loss of correlation for a unit lag k 3 6 cross correlation cross correlation represented by a cross correlogram identifies the relationship between two signals the cross correlation between two time series x and y with n observations is defined as box et al 2015 5 r x y k n 1 i 1 n k x i x y i k y σ x σ y where r x y k is the cross correlation coefficient at lag time k x and y are the arithmetic means of the two time series and σ x and σ y are the standard deviations the cross correlation analysis was applied in a moving window approach 1 year window with 1 week increment to highlight the inter annual variability of the response time of groundwater levels to changes in discharge for each window the cross correlogram function between input and output was calculated and the response time τ the lag time k corresponding to the maximum correlation was identified following delbart et al 2014 and duvert et al 2015 only a cross correlation coefficient higher than the standard error of 2 n 0 5 corresponding to 95 confidence level was accepted n is the number of observations in the moving window diggle 1990 readers are referred to delbart et al 2014 for a graphical example of the sliding cross correlation method the response time evaluated by the cross correlation analysis alone can be less accurate if the autocorrelation of the input signal is high e g close to 1 bailly comte et al 2011 in order to reduce this effect the autocorrelation of the input can be removed by prefiltering the input signal e g removing all serial dependencies such as trend seasonal and autoregressive components by this pre whitening procedure white noise residuals are obtained watts and jenkins 1968 the analyses of time series decomposition undertaken in this study see section 3 2 can be considered as an appropriate approach to prefilter the input signal therefore we used the remainder component of river discharge at chau doc as an input signal in the cross correlation analysis we assumed that the selected input signal represents random un correlated processes in surface water e g unaffected by the trend seasonal and autoregressive components the output signal was the remainder component of the gwl time series it is noted that groundwater recharge in the vmd is considered to stem mainly from surface water wagner et al 2012 we assumed that the precipitation ponding on the ground is mixed with preexisting surface water e g river water and or floodwater before infiltrating to the groundwater this means that all types of recharge sources were summed up in the surface water component in this context the time series of τ gives information about the impulse response that transfers surface water into the aquifers of the vmd 4 results 4 1 variability of gwl time series fig 2 shows an example of the decomposition of weekly discharge at chau doc and the gwl time series at borehole no 14 using the stl algorithm the plot highlights both seasonality and long term trends in gwls the results of the time series decomposition analysis showed that the relative magnitude of each component varies considerably across the delta therefore the relative variability of the gwl was assessed based on the variances of the trend seasonal and remainder components along with the variance of the original time series this relative variability represented by the variance ratios defined by eq 2 is plotted in fig 3 the decomposition of the time series revealed a higher variability of the seasonal component in the shallow aquifers e g holocene and the dominant variability of the trend component in the deep aquifers e g pliocene and miocene for example the trend component represented more than 90 and less than 55 of the variance of the original time series for deep and shallow aquifers respectively fig 3 for the pleistocene aquifer the gwl time series were separated into two distinct clusters dominated by the seasonal cluster 1 and trend components cluster 2 in fig 3 however there was no apparent relationship between the borehole depth and the variance of components in the pleistocene aquifers as indicated by the wide scatter without any grouping of the pleistocene symbols in fig 3 to highlight the seasonal variation each time series was normalized to values between 0 and 1 by subtracting the minimum value and dividing by the total range fig 4 is a boxplot of the normalized time series of gwls and river discharge higher gwls were observed in the flood season the amplitude of the seasonal variation of gwls decreased with increasing borehole depth from substantial seasonal variation in the holocene aquifer to no seasonal variation in the pliocene and miocene aquifers comparing between flood and coastal areas for shallow groundwater a similar seasonal pattern was observed for the holocene aquifer in contrast the gwls in flood prone areas varied slightly more than those in coastal areas for the pleistocene aquifers 4 2 trend of groundwater levels fig 5 shows the results for recent 1996 2017 trends of gwls across the vmd the gwl in all aquifers showed various magnitudes of decreasing trends from 0 01 0 55 m year all significant at the 95 level the strongest negative trends were observed mainly in areas around major cities and major industrial areas e g tan an cao lanh long xuyen can tho and ca mau moreover stronger declining trends were detected in deeper aquifers with the highest decrease 0 30 0 55 m year in the pliocene and miocene aquifers the weakest declining trends 0 01 0 11 m year were observed in the holocene aquifer the medium depth pleistocene aquifers showed decreasing trends in between the trends of the deep and shallow aquifers with values of 0 05 0 28 m year and 0 22 0 41 m year for boreholes located at flood and coastal areas respectively an increasing trend was not found for any of the investigated boreholes a comprehensive analysis of the time variant trends 10 year periods with 1 year increments is presented in fig 6 similar to the previous analysis we observed declining trends in gwls at all aquifers with higher magnitudes in deeper aquifers however no significant trends were detected for some short term periods for the holocene aquifer for other aquifers e g pleistocene pliocene and miocene all declining trend patterns are significant at the 95 level except for the holocene aquifer the magnitude of the declining trend for almost all boreholes was considerably higher in later periods e g after 2007 than in early periods for example the declining trend before 2006 was around 0 1 0 35 m year but increased up to 0 6 0 75 m year after 2007 fig 6 hence the decrease of gwl accelerated over the last two decades the strongest declining time variant trends were observed in the pliocene aquifer particularly close to big cities such as ca mau borehole no 22 can tho borehole no 40 dong thap borehole no 36 and long an borehole no 65 in line with the overall trends fig 5 the gwls in coastal areas decreased more strongly than in flood prone areas for the pleistocene aquifers for the holocene and miocene aquifers the magnitude of the declining gwl trends was not significantly different between flood prone and coastal areas 4 3 memory effect of alluvial aquifers from the remainder component of each gwl time series an auto correlation function was derived distinct behaviors were observed among the 88 auto correlograms with various degrees of groundwater memory effect fig 7 shows the rate of decrease of the auto correlation function α together with the de correlation time lag k 0 2 when the auto correlation coefficient r x of 0 2 was reached both methods logarithmic fit and de correlation time lag highlighted similar results typically a stronger memory effect was detected for deeper aquifers as depicted by more negative α and higher k 0 2 fig 7 stronger memory effects were also identified for boreholes located in coastal areas compared to those in flood prone areas this behavior was however not apparent for holocene aquifers the de correlation time lag of the holocene aquifer was between 5 and 17 weeks the time lag of the pleistocene aquifer was between 6 and 26 weeks showing two distinct groups of flood prone and coastal areas the range of the time lag of pliocene and miocene aquifers was 11 27 weeks and 13 33 weeks respectively 4 4 response time analysis the moving window cross correlation analysis was performed between the remainder component of discharge at chau doc gauging station and of gwls at 88 boreholes depending on the length of each gwl time series 523 to 1098 moving windows were obtained applying a window length of one year and moving in one week increments for example a borehole with 10 year monitoring gwl will result in a sequence of 523 one year moving windows consequently we obtained 88 time series of response time τ with different time lengths e g 523 1 098 values per time series of τ depending on the number of moving windows detected for each borehole each time series of τ was then averaged by calculating the arithmetic means of the τ values falling in the month of the year this analysis is meant to highlight seasonal differences in water level response it is noted that the shape of the cross correlogram varied considerably between boreholes only cross correlation coefficients higher than the standard error of 0 28 corresponding to the 95 confidence level were accepted the variability of the response time was reported for every month in fig 8 showing the seasonal variation of the time required for the pulse of surface water to reach the alluvial aquifers generally we observed high variability in response time in the alluvial multi aquifer system shorter response time was observed for shallow groundwater compared to deep groundwater fig 8 the response time range increased from the holocene 1 9 7 3 weeks to the pleistocene 3 7 18 9 weeks the pliocene 7 5 22 5 weeks and the miocene aquifers 9 1 23 8 weeks except for the holocene aquifer apparent seasonal variation of response time was observed for all aquifers and the response times in the flood prone areas were shorter compared to those in the coastal areas the variability of response time in both flood and dry seasons for the holocene aquifer was insignificant for other aquifers response time varied seasonally with lower values during the flood season the shortest response time was detected mainly in the peak flood period e g september or october with the longest response time at the end of the dry season e g may most likely this was caused by the higher hydraulic head in the surface water during the flood season notably due to a low number of monitoring boreholes in the pliocene and miocene aquifers 3 4 boreholes in each aquifer cf fig 7 the identification of response time variations in these aquifers in the flood prone areas might be impaired long term changes of the response time within the individual boreholes were analysed by the mann kendall nonparametric trend test applied on the moving time windows results of sen s slope considering a significance level of 95 are reported for 88 boreholes in fig 9 long term changes in response time were found to be negligible only 20 boreholes showed minor significant changes in sen s slope of less than 0 3 weeks per year no significant long term change was observed for all other wells 5 discussion 5 1 potential of groundwater recharge and role of alluvial aquifers in the vmd the decreasing magnitude of seasonal variation from shallow to deep groundwater fig 4 suggests that the alluvial aquifers act as low pass filters during the transformation of input signals e g river discharge or water levels into output signals e g groundwater water levels resulting in increasing memory effects fig 7 and response times fig 8 with aquifer depth in the vmd the role of aquifers as a low pass filter in the frequency domain has also been reported in other alluvial settings e g imagawa et al 2013 duvert et al 2015 regarding shallow aquifers the dominance of the seasonal variability fig 3 and similar patterns of seasonal fluctuations between gwls and surface water fig 4 suggest a good hydraulic connection between river water and shallow aquifers i e holocene and pleistocene across the delta this result is in line with the findings of wagner et al 2012 that shallow groundwater is effectively connected to surface water e g rivers irrigation channels or floodplains in the area this connectivity as expressed by higher seasonal variabilities fig 4b c d is more pronounced in the flood prone areas compared to the coastal areas such effective connection suggests a high potential for groundwater recharge from surface water to shallow aquifers particularly for locations in the flood prone areas where long lasting and widespread inundations occur regularly the inundations create a strong hydraulic head differences and provide sufficient water volume for shallow gw recharge which is missing in the coastal region therefore the seasonal signal observed in the coastal shallow aquifers has to be attributed to different sources or causes the most plausible source is likely the lateral inflow of waters that originate from the upstream region i e inundated areas as suggested by hoang and bäumle 2019 during the flood season the hydraulic head in the shallow aquifers underneath the inundated areas rises and creates a head difference for lateral downstream flow within the aquifers towards the coastal region the seasonal signal is thus dampened because of the flow time distance and available volume this seasonal component is additionally dampened in the coastal region by the relatively constant head caused by the ocean for deep groundwater low permeable aquicludes appear to limit the recharge to the deeper aquifers pliocene and miocene aquifers both in flood prone and coastal areas the dominance of trend components fig 3 and the low variation of gwls in the pliocene and miocene aquifers fig 4e f g corroborate these findings significant increasing memory effect and response time with depth fig 7 and fig 8 also indicate that the recent recharge to deep aquifers if any is very limited hence the deeper aquifers may be hardly replenished by surface water sources including precipitation sources in the vmd hung van et al 2019 pointed out that the freshwater from the upper system cannot infiltrate deeper than about 350 m considering our results and the literature any potential recharge of the deeper aquifers is very unlikely to originate from vertical infiltration through the aquiclude layers but rather from the lateral flow within the aquifers from upstream areas the deeper aquifers are located closer to the surface in the highland areas of southern vietnam e g binh phuoc or cambodia ha et al 2019 the presented analysis implies that the vertical recharge pathway via aquiclude layers and inter aquifer connectivity in the multi aquifer system is insignificant in the vmd this in turn means that a natural replenishment of the over exploited deeper aquifers as the primary freshwater sources in the vmd cannot be achieved locally by natural pathways instead recharge could depend on the infiltration processes and management and exploitation of the deeper aquifers in the neighboring regions particularly cambodia this also means that recovery of gw levels in the deeper aquifers requires a substantial amount of time additionally the operation of all planned dams in the mekong basin will most likely reduce flood season flow a potential consequence of this is the reduction of recharge to the aquifers in the vmd both the shallow aquifers recharge within the vmd and deeper aquifers recharge from the inundated areas in the cambodian part of the delta this finding is in line with kazama et al 2007 who stated that a 44 reduction in flooding areas could result in a 42 decline of shallow groundwater storage in the mekong delta weighing the potential impacts of climate change and reservoir operation on the mekong hydrology on groundwater recharge the negative impacts of reservoir operation will more likely overwrite the possible positive effects of increased flood season flow under climate change projections lauri et al 2012 although a quantitative assessment of the effects of dam development on groundwater recharge has not been carried yet the presented results imply that any substantial negative changes in flood volume and floodplain inundation could impair the recharge of groundwater in all aquifers in the vmd this aspect should be considered in long term strategic planning of the management of the groundwater resources in addition to the urgently needed short term limitation of current gw exploitation 5 2 drivers of gwl declines extending the findings of previous studies e g wagner et al 2012 erban et al 2014 this work uses more recent data to confirm the previously observed decrease of gwls in deeper aquifers in the vmd by time variant trend analysis based on high frequency groundwater observations considering both shallow and deep aquifers the overall variabilities of the declining trends of gwls confirm the decrease rate of 9 78 cm year reported in erban et al 2014 i e indicate that gw over exploitation continued in the last decade our results indicate that groundwater abstractions highly exceeded groundwater recharge resulting in a considerable decrease of gwls and groundwater storage in the vmd over the last 22 years the lesser changes in gwl in the shallow aquifers however are a result of the interplay between the good connectivity to and recharge from surface water the compaction of the young sediment composing the aquifers wagner et al 2012 and the comparatively low abstraction from these shallow aquifers these factors compensate each other resulting in the observed overall low decline in the shallow aquifers on the contrary the significant decrease of gwls in the deeper aquifers can be linked to the lower recharge rates section 5 1 and to the high amount of groundwater abstraction groundwater in the pliocene and miocene aquifers has good drinking water quality and is thus heavily used the highest decreasing trends were identified mainly for urban areas with high population densities fig 5 and thus indicate that human activities are very likely the dominant driver of this gwl decline moreover in coastal regions saltwater intrusion in surface water impedes the use of shallow groundwater as a drinking water source or for irrigation cf fig 2 smajgl et al 2015 therefore groundwater is the key source of freshwater for domestic uses and agricultural production in the coastal regions wagner et al 2012 the pronounced decreasing trend of gwls in the coastal areas compared to the flood prone areas in the pleistocene aquifers fig 5b c d thus provides evidence for a significant and non sustainable groundwater abstraction in the coastal areas for example groundwater is highly exploited for domestic freshwater supply in ca mau peninsula the results presented in this study indicate that the high demands for groundwater resources cannot be compensated by the limited recharge according to danh and khai 2015 groundwater in the vmd is typically accessed via private tube wells more than one million over the whole delta at depths of 80 120 m corresponding to pleistocene aquifers and abstraction wells of freshwater supply plants reaching depths of 200 450 m corresponding to the pliocene and miocene aquifers therefore the decline of gwls in the pleistocene aquifers can be attributed to household demand in contrast the decrease in the pliocene or miocene aquifers can be linked to the demand of water supply plants and thus the general water demand of the population and economy the acceleration of the decrease of gwls fig 6 can be linked to the increasing trend in groundwater exploitation and the consequent widespread land subsidence for the vmd erban et al 2013 2014 minderhoud et al 2017 similar to many deltas and coastal areas around the world see gambolati and teatini 2015 our study suggests that the current groundwater exploitation already exceeds aquifer recharge capacities in the vmd due to the demand for socio economic and industrial development groundwater exploitation is forecasted to further increase in the future danh and khai 2015 a further severe decline of gwls would however accelerate saltwater intrusion into the alluvial aquifers groundwater contamination land subsidence and thus threaten sustainable development in the entire delta minderhoud et al 2017 5 3 groundwater memory effect in alluvial settings the analysis of the auto correlation with the logarithmic fits and the de correlation time provides insights into the memory effects in the different aquifers for shallow groundwater the short memory effect indicates a good hydraulic connection to surface water and thus a high potential for groundwater recharge this was to be expected from the geological setting following the same logic long memory effects in the deeper aquifers indicate a poor hydraulic connection to surface water and thus limited groundwater recharge because groundwater storage can be attributed to structural factors that are difficult to assess e g the change in grain size of the aquifer material or its degree of compaction which can change the hydraulic conductivities and groundwater outflow duvert et al 2015 the presented analysis of the memory effects might serve as a proxy information on potential groundwater storage in the vmd the memory effect of alluvial aquifers varies according to the geographical location fig 7 groundwater memory increases in both vertical and horizontal directions 1 from shallow to deep aquifers and 2 from upstream i e flood prone regions to downstream i e coastal areas the vertical increase of the memory effect from shallow to deep aquifers can be attributed to the existence of low permeable aquicludes between aquifers the aquicludes between deep aquifers pliocene and miocene are thicker and characterized by lower hydraulic conductivities compared to the shallow aquifers holocene and pleistocene hung van et al 2019 these aquicludes act thus as low pass filters in the frequency domain weakening the variation of gwls at the deep groundwater in the vmd this behavior was also reported for similar geological settings e g for alluvial aquifers in the shiga prefecture japan imagawa et al 2013 and southeast queensland australia duvert et al 2015 similarly the horizontal spatial differences of the memory effect may be caused by the spatial variation of physical properties e g hydraulic conductivity and thickness of the aquifers zhang and schilling 2004 in this context an explanation for the generally higher memory effect from upstream to downstream in the vmd could be the higher thickness of the aquicludes in coastal areas compared to flood prone areas as per fig 2 in hung van et al 2019 generally longer memory effects indicate higher water storage capacities particularly in the case of the deep alluvial aquifers in the vmd a similar explanation for longer memory effects and groundwater storage was given by mangin 1984 and imagawa et al 2013 this means that the potential for groundwater storage and restoration is higher in the deeper aquifers this comes however at the cost of longer natural recharge times which has to be considered in any sustainable gw management plan 5 4 factors controlling the impulse response between surface water and alluvial aquifers the moving window cross correlation analysis shows that the interaction between surface water and groundwater is highly dynamic and exhibiting strong seasonality the differences in impulse response between the river and the different alluvial aquifers can be attributed to 1 groundwater depth 2 seasonal variability 3 location i e flood prone or coastal areas and 4 existence of aquicludes shorter response times were detected for shallow groundwater the flood season and flood prone regions fig 8 except for the holocene aquifer the response time of boreholes in flood prone areas in the dry season are still shorter than those in coastal are in flood season indicating that the response time is more controlled by location than seasonal variability this result supports the assumption that the deeper aquifers might be recharged from upstream areas of the vmd see section 5 1 during the flood season july november inundation is up to 4 0 m high and lasts for 3 6 months in flood prone areas toan 2014 river water levels inundation depths and soil saturation are higher during the flood period thus the pressure pulse is transmitted more rapidly and directly to aquifers compared to the dry period and sufficient amounts of water ponding water on inundated floodplains are available to recharge the gw this means in return that a shortening of the flood season very likely reduces groundwater recharge because of the associated reduction of high water levels and pressure heads in the rivers as well as because of the reduction of the floodplain inundation extent and depths a shortening of the flood season typically occurs during strong el niño events ruiz barradas and nigam 2018 and is also expected as a consequence of the operation of existing and construction of planned dams in the mekong basin lauri et al 2012 due to the long response times it has to be expected that this effect will be more pronounced in the deeper aquifers lower pliocene and miocene where the response times are in the range of the duration of the flood season however as climate change scenarios predict an intensification of the southeast asian monsoon and an increase in flood season discharge hoang et al 2016 there are also chances of increasing average recharge of the deeper aquifers in the vmd in the future provided that the reservoir operation does not diminish this effect 5 5 limitations and wider implications the time series analysis we are applying is in principle a black box model and can only determine mathematical relations correlations between time series not causal relationships bakker and schaars 2019 the approach is thus only suitable to highlight and visualize the behavior of a groundwater system without an explicit analysis of the underlying physics and or drivers of system behavior therefore this study should be considered as the first step towards a characterization of the previously unstudied behaviors of alluvial aquifers in the vmd future research should aim at a quantitative investigation of the drivers of the memory effect and response time in the vmd to understand the physical processes of a groundwater system a physical based or at least conceptual groundwater model is required which is out of the scope of this study in this study time series analysis can provide valuable information about time variant trends of gwls the memory effect and the response time for the whole vmd the visualization of these groundwater dynamics provides an overview on how long an aquifer stores water memory effect how fast an aquifer responds to variations in surface water response time and the recently accelerating decline of gwls in the vmd these findings should be considered as initial contributions to the hydrogeological literature of a little known groundwater system in alluvial settings due to simplicity and ease of interpretation the applied time series analysis can be an additional tool for example to process data and quickly provide efficient alternatives to calibrate groundwater models bakker and schaars 2019 also our approach has direct implications for the initial investigations of an understudied groundwater system where data and or resources e g human or financial are insufficient to develop a dynamic groundwater model 6 conclusions this study provides hydrogeological storage characteristics of the alluvial aquifers in the vmd we examined the groundwater dynamics focusing on 1 the recent trend of groundwater levels in order to indicate gw over exploitation 2 the memory effect of alluvial aquifers for an assessment of the gw storage and 3 the response time between surface water and groundwater as a proxy for gw recharge gwl time series between 1996 and 2017 from 88 boreholes at 27 national stations were collected selecting time series with a sampling resolution higher than once per week and monitoring periods longer than ten years the time series decomposition of gwls highlights the large seasonal variability in the shallow aquifers and the dominance of the trend component in the deep aquifers this indicates an effective connection between the shallow holocene aquifer and surface water and a high potential for shallow groundwater recharge the low permeable aquicludes separating the aquifers behave as low pass filters that reduce the high frequency signals in the gwl variations and limit the recharge to the deeper aquifers the trend analysis indicates that both shallow and deep aquifers are currently over exploited and not fully recharged resulting in a considerable decrease of gwls 0 01 0 55 m year and groundwater storage over the last 22 years significant downward trends were detected in the deep aquifers which is the primary source of gw used for drinking water purposes compared to weak declining trends in shallow aquifers which has a higher potential for groundwater recharge and is much less exploited due to water quality issues this study leads to the conclusion that the groundwater abstraction has accelerated the gwl declines these findings are evidenced by a stronger declining time variant trend observed for almost all boreholes in later periods i e after 2007 compared to early periods i e before 2006 while the slight decline of gwls in the holocene aquifer 0 01 0 11 m year is likely caused by natural variations and effects e g the compaction of the delta the significantly declining gwls of the pliocene and miocene aquifers 0 25 0 55 m year can be attributed to the groundwater over exploitation particularly around urban and industrial areas in the vmd the groundwater memory varies according to the geographical location being shorter from shallow to deep aquifers and from flood to coastal areas the memory effects of shallow and deep groundwater are in the range of 5 17 weeks and 10 33 weeks respectively interpreting longer memory as higher storage it can be concluded that the deeper aquifers have a higher storage capacity than the shallow aquifers the moving cross correlation analysis highlights the highly dynamic interaction between surface water and groundwater the response time between the river and alluvial aquifers depends on groundwater depth seasonal variability and location shorter response times were detected in the flood season compared to the dry season the seasonal variability of response time was influenced by the flood period and the flood timing higher water levels during the flood season likely transmit the pressure pulse more rapidly and directly moreover the response times of the deeper and heavily used aquifers are in the range of the duration of the flood season this finding is relevant for any estimation of the recharge to the most important aquifer i e the pliocene aquifer of the vmd during the flood season it essentially means that this aquifer most likely receives hardly any recharge during shortened flood seasons like e g during the frequently occurring el niño events more generally our study illustrates the usefulness of time series techniques to understand the mechanisms of groundwater recharge discharge and storage in alluvial settings the findings on the variabilities of gwl trends the memory effect of alluvial aquifers and the response time between surface water and groundwater are primarily highlighted for the vmd the information is crucial for groundwater resource management in the vmd due to its simplicity the applied time series analysis can

8278,study region vietnamese mekong delta study focus this study investigates the trends of groundwater levels gwls the memory effect of alluvial aquifers and the response times between surface water and groundwater across the vietnamese mekong delta vmd trend analysis auto and cross correlation and time series decomposition were applied within a moving window approach to examine non stationary behavior new hydrological insights our study revealed an effective connection between the shallowest aquifer unit holocene and surface water and a high potential for shallow groundwater recharge however low permeable aquicludes separating the aquifers behave as low pass filters that reduce the high frequency signals in the gwl variations and limit the recharge to the deep groundwater declining gwls 0 01 0 55 m year were detected for all aquifers throughout the 22 years of observation indicating that the groundwater abstraction exceeds groundwater recharge stronger declining trends were detected for deeper groundwater the dynamic trend analysis indicates that the decrease of gwls accelerated continuously the groundwater memory effect varied according to the geographical location being shorter in shallow aquifers and flood prone areas and longer in deep aquifers and coastal areas variation of the response time between the river and alluvial aquifers was controlled by groundwater depth and season the response time was shorter during the flood season indicating that the bulk of groundwater recharge occurred in the late flood season particularly in the deep aquifers keywords groundwater statistics time series analysis moving window groundwater surface water interactions alluvial aquifers 1 introduction alluvial aquifers play an important role in sustaining agricultural activities and the livelihood of the population in river deltas in areas where rainfall is not uniformly distributed throughout the year e g tropical or arid regions they are primary sources for good quality freshwater as they are less vulnerable to contamination or climate variability than surface water bodies however accurate estimates of groundwater recharge and the response between surface water and alluvial aquifers can be difficult to obtain and significant uncertainties exist in groundwater storage in alluvial settings under impacts of climate change and human activities syvitski et al 2009 vörösmarty et al 2009 hirabayashi et al 2013 which challenge national to global food security kummu et al 2012 understanding the mechanisms of alluvial aquifers is

testing imagawa et al 2013 duvert et al 2015 in this study groundwater flow processes in the alluvial aquifers of the vmd are investigated by trend and correlation analysis as well as time series decomposition all these analyses are incorporated into a moving window approach to identify non stationary responses we investigate 1 trends in groundwater levels 2 the memory effect of alluvial aquifers and 3 the time variant response between surface water and groundwater throughout the vmd the results are essential for groundwater resource management and livelihoods in the region and highlight the general mechanisms of sub surface water transport in alluvial settings 2 study area the study area is the vmd covering an area of 4 million hectares between 8 5 11 5 n and 104 5 106 8 e fig 1 the delta has an extremely low mean elevation 0 8 m above sea level minderhoud et al 2019 during the flood season july november 35 50 of the delta is flooded mainly by river discharge exceeding bank level the resulting inundation reaches depths of up to 4 0 m for 3 6 months toan 2014 constituting inundation areas that recharge water to alluvial aquifers in this study the inundation areas were adapted from triet et al 2017 these areas cover a territory of approximately 2 0 million hectares in the northern part of the vmd fig 1 according to danh and khai 2015 groundwater in the vmd is typically accessed via private tube wells more than 1 million shallow tube wells across the delta at depths of 80 120 m and groundwater abstraction wells of water supply plants reaching depths of 200 450 m the total groundwater abstraction was estimated at approximately 2 5 million m3 per day in 2015 minderhoud et al 2017 the multi layered aquifer system in the vmd has an alluvial basin structure the deepest area of the basement is located below the mekong and bassac rivers and rises to the northeast north and northwest borders anderson 1978 wagner et al 2012 sediments were deposited during transgression and regression events around 6000 5000 yr bp lap nguyen et al 2000 resulting in a highly complex stratigraphy the subsurface structure and hydrogeological units in the vmd are classified according to geological formations holocene pleistocene pliocene and miocene aquifer systems wagner et al 2012 these aquifers are located below ground level around 0 49 m 31 193 m 153 381 m and 275 550 m respectively cf table 1s in the supplement these age units can be sub divided into eight hydrogeological aquifer systems holocene qh upper pleistocene qp3 middle pleistocene qp2 3 lower pleistocene qp1 middle pliocene n2 2 lower pliocene n2 1 upper miocene n1 3 and middle miocene n1 2 3 generally each unit consists of two layers i a low permeable aquitard layer composed of silt and clay and ii a high permeable aquifer layer composed of fine to coarse sand and gravel the horizontal hydraulic conductivities of the aquitards and aquifers are in the range of 3 40 10 8 m s and 1 20 10 4 m s respectively the hydrogeological characterization of these semi confined aquifers is given in wagner et al 2012 and their lithological nature and hydraulic properties are described in minderhoud et al 2017 and summarised in hung van et al 2019 in this study the middle miocene n1 2 3 was not considered due to a lack of data 3 methods 3 1 datasets groundwater levels gwl in the vmd have been recorded starting from the mid 1990s at multiple temporal resolutions from daily to monthly and with different monitoring duration 8 22 years we collected gwl time series between 1996 and 2017 from 88 boreholes table s1 in the supplement at 27 distributed well nests fig 1 from these data sets the borehole data series with temporal resolutions higher than weekly and monitoring durations longer than ten years were selected the datasets were supported by the project research on improvement for the efficiency of water resources monitoring system for early warning of depletion and saline intrusion in the mekong delta plain no đtđl cn 46 18 which is funded by ministry of science and technology most an hourly discharge time series from 1996 to 2017 at chau doc was also collected to represent the variability of surface water in the vmd in the analysis the discharge data was provided by the southern institute of water resources research siwrr for consistency all collected data were aggregated to weekly mean values 3 2 time series decomposition we applied a nonparametric time series decomposition approach known as stl seasonal trend decomposition procedure based on loess cleveland et al 1990 the stl method uses locally weighted regression loess operations with different moving window lengths to separate a time series into three distinct components eq 1 shows the additive decomposition of the trend t t seasonal s t and remainder r t components from the original signal y t 1 y t t t s t r t typically each component can be related to different processes acting during the generation of the time series in the case of gwl time series the role of each component was classified by lafare et al 2016 as follows t t represents the long term processes operating over the period of the entire time series s t represents a cyclical process e g the annual cycles resulting from recharge periods r t represents local processes that cause variability between cycles and can thus be attributed to shorter term events or impacts e g the local recharge and or abstraction on the groundwater system there is no unique choice for selecting the smoothing parameter e g the length of the moving window within the stl algorithm in many applications the decision should be based on the goals of the analysis and the knowledge about the mechanisms generating the time series cleveland et al 1990 while a large value can result in similar components in all years a small value can track the observations more closely shamsudduha et al 2009 in this study we selected a 10 years window for the trend component and 1 year window for the seasonal component in this way we were able to highlight decadal trends and annual cycles 3 3 identification of gwl variability we calculated the ratio between the variance of decomposed components and the original signal eq 2 to measure the relative importance of the variance associated with each component in comparison to the original signal graphical comparison of these ratios lafare et al 2016 and the boxplot of seasonal variation of normalized time series were used to characterize the relative variability of gwl in the vmd 2a ratiotrend variance t t variance y t 2b ratioseasonal variance s t variance y t 2c ratioremainder variance r t variance y t 3 4 trend analysis we applied the mann kendall mk nonparametric trend test mann 1945 kendall 1948 with sen s slope sen 1968 to investigate recent changes 1996 2017 of the groundwater system in the vmd the trend magnitude was reported as sen s slope considering a significance level of 95 trends were calculated by a moving window approach 10 year window with 1 year increment of the original groundwater level time series to investigate the time variations of trends spatial patterns of sen s slope were mapped at the regional scale using gis built in interpolation models and geostatistical kriging techniques in arcgis version 10 4 time series were analyzed using matlab r2019b with the statistics toolbox version 11 6 3 5 auto correlation auto correlation analysis was used to identify the memory effect mangin 1984 massei et al 2006 duvert et al 2015 of alluvial aquifers in the vmd we applied the auto correlation to the remainder component r t because it represents the local effects and short term events lafare et al 2016 while the trend and seasonal components are by definition significantly auto correlated the auto correlation of a time series x is defined as box et al 2015 3 r x k n 1 i 1 n k x i x x i k x σ x 2 where r x k is the autocorrelation coefficient at lag k and x is the arithmetic mean of the time series with n observations σ x is the standard deviation of the time series the value of k was selected smaller than the cutting point n 3 to avoid stability problems the memory effect of the signal was defined as the time lag when r x k reached a value of 0 2 as frequently applied in gwl studies mangin 1984 the value was termed as the de correlation time lag k 0 2 here alternatively the memory effect was also characterized by the overall shape and magnitude of the auto correlogram massei et al 2006 we quantified the slope of the auto correlogram by logarithmic fits following massei et al 2006 duvert et al 2015 4 r x k α log k β where α week 1 and β dimensionless are slope and intercept of the logarithmic function respectively typically α describes the rate at which the correlation decreases during the study period and β corresponds to the loss of correlation for a unit lag k 3 6 cross correlation cross correlation represented by a cross correlogram identifies the relationship between two signals the cross correlation between two time series x and y with n observations is defined as box et al 2015 5 r x y k n 1 i 1 n k x i x y i k y σ x σ y where r x y k is the cross correlation coefficient at lag time k x and y are the arithmetic means of the two time series and σ x and σ y are the standard deviations the cross correlation analysis was applied in a moving window approach 1 year window with 1 week increment to highlight the inter annual variability of the response time of groundwater levels to changes in discharge for each window the cross correlogram function between input and output was calculated and the response time τ the lag time k corresponding to the maximum correlation was identified following delbart et al 2014 and duvert et al 2015 only a cross correlation coefficient higher than the standard error of 2 n 0 5 corresponding to 95 confidence level was accepted n is the number of observations in the moving window diggle 1990 readers are referred to delbart et al 2014 for a graphical example of the sliding cross correlation method the response time evaluated by the cross correlation analysis alone can be less accurate if the autocorrelation of the input signal is high e g close to 1 bailly comte et al 2011 in order to reduce this effect the autocorrelation of the input can be removed by prefiltering the input signal e g removing all serial dependencies such as trend seasonal and autoregressive components by this pre whitening procedure white noise residuals are obtained watts and jenkins 1968 the analyses of time series decomposition undertaken in this study see section 3 2 can be considered as an appropriate approach to prefilter the input signal therefore we used the remainder component of river discharge at chau doc as an input signal in the cross correlation analysis we assumed that the selected input signal represents random un correlated processes in surface water e g unaffected by the trend seasonal and autoregressive components the output signal was the remainder component of the gwl time series it is noted that groundwater recharge in the vmd is considered to stem mainly from surface water wagner et al 2012 we assumed that the precipitation ponding on the ground is mixed with preexisting surface water e g river water and or floodwater before infiltrating to the groundwater this means that all types of recharge sources were summed up in the surface water component in this context the time series of τ gives information about the impulse response that transfers surface water into the aquifers of the vmd 4 results 4 1 variability of gwl time series fig 2 shows an example of the decomposition of weekly discharge at chau doc and the gwl time series at borehole no 14 using the stl algorithm the plot highlights both seasonality and long term trends in gwls the results of the time series decomposition analysis showed that the relative magnitude of each component varies considerably across the delta therefore the relative variability of the gwl was assessed based on the variances of the trend seasonal and remainder components along with the variance of the original time series this relative variability represented by the variance ratios defined by eq 2 is plotted in fig 3 the decomposition of the time series revealed a higher variability of the seasonal component in the shallow aquifers e g holocene and the dominant variability of the trend component in the deep aquifers e g pliocene and miocene for example the trend component represented more than 90 and less than 55 of the variance of the original time series for deep and shallow aquifers respectively fig 3 for the pleistocene aquifer the gwl time series were separated into two distinct clusters dominated by the seasonal cluster 1 and trend components cluster 2 in fig 3 however there was no apparent relationship between the borehole depth and the variance of components in the pleistocene aquifers as indicated by the wide scatter without any grouping of the pleistocene symbols in fig 3 to highlight the seasonal variation each time series was normalized to values between 0 and 1 by subtracting the minimum value and dividing by the total range fig 4 is a boxplot of the normalized time series of gwls and river discharge higher gwls were observed in the flood season the amplitude of the seasonal variation of gwls decreased with increasing borehole depth from substantial seasonal variation in the holocene aquifer to no seasonal variation in the pliocene and miocene aquifers comparing between flood and coastal areas for shallow groundwater a similar seasonal pattern was observed for the holocene aquifer in contrast the gwls in flood prone areas varied slightly more than those in coastal areas for the pleistocene aquifers 4 2 trend of groundwater levels fig 5 shows the results for recent 1996 2017 trends of gwls across the vmd the gwl in all aquifers showed various magnitudes of decreasing trends from 0 01 0 55 m year all significant at the 95 level the strongest negative trends were observed mainly in areas around major cities and major industrial areas e g tan an cao lanh long xuyen can tho and ca mau moreover stronger declining trends were detected in deeper aquifers with the highest decrease 0 30 0 55 m year in the pliocene and miocene aquifers the weakest declining trends 0 01 0 11 m year were observed in the holocene aquifer the medium depth pleistocene aquifers showed decreasing trends in between the trends of the deep and shallow aquifers with values of 0 05 0 28 m year and 0 22 0 41 m year for boreholes located at flood and coastal areas respectively an increasing trend was not found for any of the investigated boreholes a comprehensive analysis of the time variant trends 10 year periods with 1 year increments is presented in fig 6 similar to the previous analysis we observed declining trends in gwls at all aquifers with higher magnitudes in deeper aquifers however no significant trends were detected for some short term periods for the holocene aquifer for other aquifers e g pleistocene pliocene and miocene all declining trend patterns are significant at the 95 level except for the holocene aquifer the magnitude of the declining trend for almost all boreholes was considerably higher in later periods e g after 2007 than in early periods for example the declining trend before 2006 was around 0 1 0 35 m year but increased up to 0 6 0 75 m year after 2007 fig 6 hence the decrease of gwl accelerated over the last two decades the strongest declining time variant trends were observed in the pliocene aquifer particularly close to big cities such as ca mau borehole no 22 can tho borehole no 40 dong thap borehole no 36 and long an borehole no 65 in line with the overall trends fig 5 the gwls in coastal areas decreased more strongly than in flood prone areas for the pleistocene aquifers for the holocene and miocene aquifers the magnitude of the declining gwl trends was not significantly different between flood prone and coastal areas 4 3 memory effect of alluvial aquifers from the remainder component of each gwl time series an auto correlation function was derived distinct behaviors were observed among the 88 auto correlograms with various degrees of groundwater memory effect fig 7 shows the rate of decrease of the auto correlation function α together with the de correlation time lag k 0 2 when the auto correlation coefficient r x of 0 2 was reached both methods logarithmic fit and de correlation time lag highlighted similar results typically a stronger memory effect was detected for deeper aquifers as depicted by more negative α and higher k 0 2 fig 7 stronger memory effects were also identified for boreholes located in coastal areas compared to those in flood prone areas this behavior was however not apparent for holocene aquifers the de correlation time lag of the holocene aquifer was between 5 and 17 weeks the time lag of the pleistocene aquifer was between 6 and 26 weeks showing two distinct groups of flood prone and coastal areas the range of the time lag of pliocene and miocene aquifers was 11 27 weeks and 13 33 weeks respectively 4 4 response time analysis the moving window cross correlation analysis was performed between the remainder component of discharge at chau doc gauging station and of gwls at 88 boreholes depending on the length of each gwl time series 523 to 1098 moving windows were obtained applying a window length of one year and moving in one week increments for example a borehole with 10 year monitoring gwl will result in a sequence of 523 one year moving windows consequently we obtained 88 time series of response time τ with different time lengths e g 523 1 098 values per time series of τ depending on the number of moving windows detected for each borehole each time series of τ was then averaged by calculating the arithmetic means of the τ values falling in the month of the year this analysis is meant to highlight seasonal differences in water level response it is noted that the shape of the cross correlogram varied considerably between boreholes only cross correlation coefficients higher than the standard error of 0 28 corresponding to the 95 confidence level were accepted the variability of the response time was reported for every month in fig 8 showing the seasonal variation of the time required for the pulse of surface water to reach the alluvial aquifers generally we observed high variability in response time in the alluvial multi aquifer system shorter response time was observed for shallow groundwater compared to deep groundwater fig 8 the response time range increased from the holocene 1 9 7 3 weeks to the pleistocene 3 7 18 9 weeks the pliocene 7 5 22 5 weeks and the miocene aquifers 9 1 23 8 weeks except for the holocene aquifer apparent seasonal variation of response time was observed for all aquifers and the response times in the flood prone areas were shorter compared to those in the coastal areas the variability of response time in both flood and dry seasons for the holocene aquifer was insignificant for other aquifers response time varied seasonally with lower values during the flood season the shortest response time was detected mainly in the peak flood period e g september or october with the longest response time at the end of the dry season e g may most likely this was caused by the higher hydraulic head in the surface water during the flood season notably due to a low number of monitoring boreholes in the pliocene and miocene aquifers 3 4 boreholes in each aquifer cf fig 7 the identification of response time variations in these aquifers in the flood prone areas might be impaired long term changes of the response time within the individual boreholes were analysed by the mann kendall nonparametric trend test applied on the moving time windows results of sen s slope considering a significance level of 95 are reported for 88 boreholes in fig 9 long term changes in response time were found to be negligible only 20 boreholes showed minor significant changes in sen s slope of less than 0 3 weeks per year no significant long term change was observed for all other wells 5 discussion 5 1 potential of groundwater recharge and role of alluvial aquifers in the vmd the decreasing magnitude of seasonal variation from shallow to deep groundwater fig 4 suggests that the alluvial aquifers act as low pass filters during the transformation of input signals e g river discharge or water levels into output signals e g groundwater water levels resulting in increasing memory effects fig 7 and response times fig 8 with aquifer depth in the vmd the role of aquifers as a low pass filter in the frequency domain has also been reported in other alluvial settings e g imagawa et al 2013 duvert et al 2015 regarding shallow aquifers the dominance of the seasonal variability fig 3 and similar patterns of seasonal fluctuations between gwls and surface water fig 4 suggest a good hydraulic connection between river water and shallow aquifers i e holocene and pleistocene across the delta this result is in line with the findings of wagner et al 2012 that shallow groundwater is effectively connected to surface water e g rivers irrigation channels or floodplains in the area this connectivity as expressed by higher seasonal variabilities fig 4b c d is more pronounced in the flood prone areas compared to the coastal areas such effective connection suggests a high potential for groundwater recharge from surface water to shallow aquifers particularly for locations in the flood prone areas where long lasting and widespread inundations occur regularly the inundations create a strong hydraulic head differences and provide sufficient water volume for shallow gw recharge which is missing in the coastal region therefore the seasonal signal observed in the coastal shallow aquifers has to be attributed to different sources or causes the most plausible source is likely the lateral inflow of waters that originate from the upstream region i e inundated areas as suggested by hoang and bäumle 2019 during the flood season the hydraulic head in the shallow aquifers underneath the inundated areas rises and creates a head difference for lateral downstream flow within the aquifers towards the coastal region the seasonal signal is thus dampened because of the flow time distance and available volume this seasonal component is additionally dampened in the coastal region by the relatively constant head caused by the ocean for deep groundwater low permeable aquicludes appear to limit the recharge to the deeper aquifers pliocene and miocene aquifers both in flood prone and coastal areas the dominance of trend components fig 3 and the low variation of gwls in the pliocene and miocene aquifers fig 4e f g corroborate these findings significant increasing memory effect and response time with depth fig 7 and fig 8 also indicate that the recent recharge to deep aquifers if any is very limited hence the deeper aquifers may be hardly replenished by surface water sources including precipitation sources in the vmd hung van et al 2019 pointed out that the freshwater from the upper system cannot infiltrate deeper than about 350 m considering our results and the literature any potential recharge of the deeper aquifers is very unlikely to originate from vertical infiltration through the aquiclude layers but rather from the lateral flow within the aquifers from upstream areas the deeper aquifers are located closer to the surface in the highland areas of southern vietnam e g binh phuoc or cambodia ha et al 2019 the presented analysis implies that the vertical recharge pathway via aquiclude layers and inter aquifer connectivity in the multi aquifer system is insignificant in the vmd this in turn means that a natural replenishment of the over exploited deeper aquifers as the primary freshwater sources in the vmd cannot be achieved locally by natural pathways instead recharge could depend on the infiltration processes and management and exploitation of the deeper aquifers in the neighboring regions particularly cambodia this also means that recovery of gw levels in the deeper aquifers requires a substantial amount of time additionally the operation of all planned dams in the mekong basin will most likely reduce flood season flow a potential consequence of this is the reduction of recharge to the aquifers in the vmd both the shallow aquifers recharge within the vmd and deeper aquifers recharge from the inundated areas in the cambodian part of the delta this finding is in line with kazama et al 2007 who stated that a 44 reduction in flooding areas could result in a 42 decline of shallow groundwater storage in the mekong delta weighing the potential impacts of climate change and reservoir operation on the mekong hydrology on groundwater recharge the negative impacts of reservoir operation will more likely overwrite the possible positive effects of increased flood season flow under climate change projections lauri et al 2012 although a quantitative assessment of the effects of dam development on groundwater recharge has not been carried yet the presented results imply that any substantial negative changes in flood volume and floodplain inundation could impair the recharge of groundwater in all aquifers in the vmd this aspect should be considered in long term strategic planning of the management of the groundwater resources in addition to the urgently needed short term limitation of current gw exploitation 5 2 drivers of gwl declines extending the findings of previous studies e g wagner et al 2012 erban et al 2014 this work uses more recent data to confirm the previously observed decrease of gwls in deeper aquifers in the vmd by time variant trend analysis based on high frequency groundwater observations considering both shallow and deep aquifers the overall variabilities of the declining trends of gwls confirm the decrease rate of 9 78 cm year reported in erban et al 2014 i e indicate that gw over exploitation continued in the last decade our results indicate that groundwater abstractions highly exceeded groundwater recharge resulting in a considerable decrease of gwls and groundwater storage in the vmd over the last 22 years the lesser changes in gwl in the shallow aquifers however are a result of the interplay between the good connectivity to and recharge from surface water the compaction of the young sediment composing the aquifers wagner et al 2012 and the comparatively low abstraction from these shallow aquifers these factors compensate each other resulting in the observed overall low decline in the shallow aquifers on the contrary the significant decrease of gwls in the deeper aquifers can be linked to the lower recharge rates section 5 1 and to the high amount of groundwater abstraction groundwater in the pliocene and miocene aquifers has good drinking water quality and is thus heavily used the highest decreasing trends were identified mainly for urban areas with high population densities fig 5 and thus indicate that human activities are very likely the dominant driver of this gwl decline moreover in coastal regions saltwater intrusion in surface water impedes the use of shallow groundwater as a drinking water source or for irrigation cf fig 2 smajgl et al 2015 therefore groundwater is the key source of freshwater for domestic uses and agricultural production in the coastal regions wagner et al 2012 the pronounced decreasing trend of gwls in the coastal areas compared to the flood prone areas in the pleistocene aquifers fig 5b c d thus provides evidence for a significant and non sustainable groundwater abstraction in the coastal areas for example groundwater is highly exploited for domestic freshwater supply in ca mau peninsula the results presented in this study indicate that the high demands for groundwater resources cannot be compensated by the limited recharge according to danh and khai 2015 groundwater in the vmd is typically accessed via private tube wells more than one million over the whole delta at depths of 80 120 m corresponding to pleistocene aquifers and abstraction wells of freshwater supply plants reaching depths of 200 450 m corresponding to the pliocene and miocene aquifers therefore the decline of gwls in the pleistocene aquifers can be attributed to household demand in contrast the decrease in the pliocene or miocene aquifers can be linked to the demand of water supply plants and thus the general water demand of the population and economy the acceleration of the decrease of gwls fig 6 can be linked to the increasing trend in groundwater exploitation and the consequent widespread land subsidence for the vmd erban et al 2013 2014 minderhoud et al 2017 similar to many deltas and coastal areas around the world see gambolati and teatini 2015 our study suggests that the current groundwater exploitation already exceeds aquifer recharge capacities in the vmd due to the demand for socio economic and industrial development groundwater exploitation is forecasted to further increase in the future danh and khai 2015 a further severe decline of gwls would however accelerate saltwater intrusion into the alluvial aquifers groundwater contamination land subsidence and thus threaten sustainable development in the entire delta minderhoud et al 2017 5 3 groundwater memory effect in alluvial settings the analysis of the auto correlation with the logarithmic fits and the de correlation time provides insights into the memory effects in the different aquifers for shallow groundwater the short memory effect indicates a good hydraulic connection to surface water and thus a high potential for groundwater recharge this was to be expected from the geological setting following the same logic long memory effects in the deeper aquifers indicate a poor hydraulic connection to surface water and thus limited groundwater recharge because groundwater storage can be attributed to structural factors that are difficult to assess e g the change in grain size of the aquifer material or its degree of compaction which can change the hydraulic conductivities and groundwater outflow duvert et al 2015 the presented analysis of the memory effects might serve as a proxy information on potential groundwater storage in the vmd the memory effect of alluvial aquifers varies according to the geographical location fig 7 groundwater memory increases in both vertical and horizontal directions 1 from shallow to deep aquifers and 2 from upstream i e flood prone regions to downstream i e coastal areas the vertical increase of the memory effect from shallow to deep aquifers can be attributed to the existence of low permeable aquicludes between aquifers the aquicludes between deep aquifers pliocene and miocene are thicker and characterized by lower hydraulic conductivities compared to the shallow aquifers holocene and pleistocene hung van et al 2019 these aquicludes act thus as low pass filters in the frequency domain weakening the variation of gwls at the deep groundwater in the vmd this behavior was also reported for similar geological settings e g for alluvial aquifers in the shiga prefecture japan imagawa et al 2013 and southeast queensland australia duvert et al 2015 similarly the horizontal spatial differences of the memory effect may be caused by the spatial variation of physical properties e g hydraulic conductivity and thickness of the aquifers zhang and schilling 2004 in this context an explanation for the generally higher memory effect from upstream to downstream in the vmd could be the higher thickness of the aquicludes in coastal areas compared to flood prone areas as per fig 2 in hung van et al 2019 generally longer memory effects indicate higher water storage capacities particularly in the case of the deep alluvial aquifers in the vmd a similar explanation for longer memory effects and groundwater storage was given by mangin 1984 and imagawa et al 2013 this means that the potential for groundwater storage and restoration is higher in the deeper aquifers this comes however at the cost of longer natural recharge times which has to be considered in any sustainable gw management plan 5 4 factors controlling the impulse response between surface water and alluvial aquifers the moving window cross correlation analysis shows that the interaction between surface water and groundwater is highly dynamic and exhibiting strong seasonality the differences in impulse response between the river and the different alluvial aquifers can be attributed to 1 groundwater depth 2 seasonal variability 3 location i e flood prone or coastal areas and 4 existence of aquicludes shorter response times were detected for shallow groundwater the flood season and flood prone regions fig 8 except for the holocene aquifer the response time of boreholes in flood prone areas in the dry season are still shorter than those in coastal are in flood season indicating that the response time is more controlled by location than seasonal variability this result supports the assumption that the deeper aquifers might be recharged from upstream areas of the vmd see section 5 1 during the flood season july november inundation is up to 4 0 m high and lasts for 3 6 months in flood prone areas toan 2014 river water levels inundation depths and soil saturation are higher during the flood period thus the pressure pulse is transmitted more rapidly and directly to aquifers compared to the dry period and sufficient amounts of water ponding water on inundated floodplains are available to recharge the gw this means in return that a shortening of the flood season very likely reduces groundwater recharge because of the associated reduction of high water levels and pressure heads in the rivers as well as because of the reduction of the floodplain inundation extent and depths a shortening of the flood season typically occurs during strong el niño events ruiz barradas and nigam 2018 and is also expected as a consequence of the operation of existing and construction of planned dams in the mekong basin lauri et al 2012 due to the long response times it has to be expected that this effect will be more pronounced in the deeper aquifers lower pliocene and miocene where the response times are in the range of the duration of the flood season however as climate change scenarios predict an intensification of the southeast asian monsoon and an increase in flood season discharge hoang et al 2016 there are also chances of increasing average recharge of the deeper aquifers in the vmd in the future provided that the reservoir operation does not diminish this effect 5 5 limitations and wider implications the time series analysis we are applying is in principle a black box model and can only determine mathematical relations correlations between time series not causal relationships bakker and schaars 2019 the approach is thus only suitable to highlight and visualize the behavior of a groundwater system without an explicit analysis of the underlying physics and or drivers of system behavior therefore this study should be considered as the first step towards a characterization of the previously unstudied behaviors of alluvial aquifers in the vmd future research should aim at a quantitative investigation of the drivers of the memory effect and response time in the vmd to understand the physical processes of a groundwater system a physical based or at least conceptual groundwater model is required which is out of the scope of this study in this study time series analysis can provide valuable information about time variant trends of gwls the memory effect and the response time for the whole vmd the visualization of these groundwater dynamics provides an overview on how long an aquifer stores water memory effect how fast an aquifer responds to variations in surface water response time and the recently accelerating decline of gwls in the vmd these findings should be considered as initial contributions to the hydrogeological literature of a little known groundwater system in alluvial settings due to simplicity and ease of interpretation the applied time series analysis can be an additional tool for example to process data and quickly provide efficient alternatives to calibrate groundwater models bakker and schaars 2019 also our approach has direct implications for the initial investigations of an understudied groundwater system where data and or resources e g human or financial are insufficient to develop a dynamic groundwater model 6 conclusions this study provides hydrogeological storage characteristics of the alluvial aquifers in the vmd we examined the groundwater dynamics focusing on 1 the recent trend of groundwater levels in order to indicate gw over exploitation 2 the memory effect of alluvial aquifers for an assessment of the gw storage and 3 the response time between surface water and groundwater as a proxy for gw recharge gwl time series between 1996 and 2017 from 88 boreholes at 27 national stations were collected selecting time series with a sampling resolution higher than once per week and monitoring periods longer than ten years the time series decomposition of gwls highlights the large seasonal variability in the shallow aquifers and the dominance of the trend component in the deep aquifers this indicates an effective connection between the shallow holocene aquifer and surface water and a high potential for shallow groundwater recharge the low permeable aquicludes separating the aquifers behave as low pass filters that reduce the high frequency signals in the gwl variations and limit the recharge to the deeper aquifers the trend analysis indicates that both shallow and deep aquifers are currently over exploited and not fully recharged resulting in a considerable decrease of gwls 0 01 0 55 m year and groundwater storage over the last 22 years significant downward trends were detected in the deep aquifers which is the primary source of gw used for drinking water purposes compared to weak declining trends in shallow aquifers which has a higher potential for groundwater recharge and is much less exploited due to water quality issues this study leads to the conclusion that the groundwater abstraction has accelerated the gwl declines these findings are evidenced by a stronger declining time variant trend observed for almost all boreholes in later periods i e after 2007 compared to early periods i e before 2006 while the slight decline of gwls in the holocene aquifer 0 01 0 11 m year is likely caused by natural variations and effects e g the compaction of the delta the significantly declining gwls of the pliocene and miocene aquifers 0 25 0 55 m year can be attributed to the groundwater over exploitation particularly around urban and industrial areas in the vmd the groundwater memory varies according to the geographical location being shorter from shallow to deep aquifers and from flood to coastal areas the memory effects of shallow and deep groundwater are in the range of 5 17 weeks and 10 33 weeks respectively interpreting longer memory as higher storage it can be concluded that the deeper aquifers have a higher storage capacity than the shallow aquifers the moving cross correlation analysis highlights the highly dynamic interaction between surface water and groundwater the response time between the river and alluvial aquifers depends on groundwater depth seasonal variability and location shorter response times were detected in the flood season compared to the dry season the seasonal variability of response time was influenced by the flood period and the flood timing higher water levels during the flood season likely transmit the pressure pulse more rapidly and directly moreover the response times of the deeper and heavily used aquifers are in the range of the duration of the flood season this finding is relevant for any estimation of the recharge to the most important aquifer i e the pliocene aquifer of the vmd during the flood season it essentially means that this aquifer most likely receives hardly any recharge during shortened flood seasons like e g during the frequently occurring el niño events more generally our study illustrates the usefulness of time series techniques to understand the mechanisms of groundwater recharge discharge and storage in alluvial settings the findings on the variabilities of gwl trends the memory effect of alluvial aquifers and the response time between surface water and groundwater are primarily highlighted for the vmd the information is crucial for groundwater resource management in the vmd due to its simplicity the applied time series analysis can

8279,study region we investigate samples from two italian regions i e lazio and sicily located in central and south italy respectively and characterized by two diverse climates study focus in engineering practice the study of maxima daily rainfall values is commonly dealt with light tailed probability distribution functions such as the gumbel the choice of a distribution rather than another may cause estimation errors of rainfall values associated to specific return periods recently several studies demonstrate that heavy tailed distributions are preferable for extreme events modelling here we opt for six theoretical probability distribution functions and evaluate their performance in fitting extreme precipitation samples we select the samples with two common methods i e the peak over threshold and the annual maxima we assess the best fitting distribution to the empirical samples of extreme values through the ratio mean square error method and the kolmogorov smirnov test new hydrological insights for the region the assessment of the best fitting distribution to daily rainfall of the two different areas investigated here leads to interesting remarks despite the diversity of their climate results suggest that heavy tailed distributions describe more accurately empirical data rather than light tailed ones therefore extreme events may have been largely underestimated in the past in both areas the proposed investigation can prompt the choice of the best fitting probability distribution to evaluate the design hydrological quantities supporting common engineering practice keywords daily precipitation extreme rainfall tail behaviour fitting method kolmogorov smirnov test 1 introduction it is widely recognised that heavy rainfall at a daily time scale has a crucial role in flood risk estimation and consequently in design and management of flood protection works koutsoyiannis 2007 due to the availability of daily rainfall data across the world precipitation at daily scale represents one of the most investigated variables in hydrology de michele 2019 moreover daily rainfall data measured by precipitation gauges are much more stable and reliable than those measured with hourly or sub hourly scales not least studies on long term series of hydrological phenomena need daily precipitation as input world meteorogical organization 1988 such data are fundamental in both scientific research and engineering practice as for instance the estimation of long series analysis alpert et al 2002 arnone et al 2013 bonaccorso and aronica 2016 the study and forecasting of drought cancelliere et al 2007 mineo et al 2019 the evaluation of the return period for design hydraulic works de michele and avanzi 2018 mineo et al 2018 the assessment of rainfall erosivity petkovšek and mikoš 2004 usda agricultural research service 2013 the domestic rainwater harvesting campisano and modica 2012 and the estimation of sub daily precipitation through disaggregation techniques koutsoyiannis 2003 among the most common practices that require the analysis of daily records there is the identification of the theoretical probability distribution that allows the best fit to empirical samples a poor fit to empirical data can lead to under or over sizing hydraulic structures de michele and avanzi 2018 młyński et al 2019 hence defining a proper method to model the extreme rainfall is still challenging for hydrologists and engineers cavanaugh et al 2015 traditionally in the hydrological practice annual maximum am and peak over threshold pot are the two main approaches to select extreme values from historical time series the am method consists in selecting maximum rainfall values one for each year of observation the pot sample is achieved by selecting all extreme values that exceed an arbitrarily fixed threshold chow 1964 several authors provide a comparative survey on the adaptation of different theoretical probability distributions to hydrological empirical samples selected by these two approaches madsen et al 1997a 1997b propose a regional estimation scheme for extreme events modelling by selecting am and pot samples for discharge data recorded in new zealand their findings reveal that the pot generalized pareto distribution gpd model is generally more efficient than the am generalized extreme value gev model bezak et al 2014 show that the pot method provides better results than the am for a flood frequency analysis in slovenia moreover the pot approach provides a better adaptation to heavy tailed distributions compared to the am madsen et al 1997b and uses more information since it includes much more extreme events beguería 2005 although the pot method seems to be a valid alternative to the am method the impact of threshold selection can greatly influence the analysis of the extreme values as a matter of facts the threshold value directly influences both the length of the sample and the statistical independence of its values these matters are widely investigated in literature and a general accepted methodology for the identification of the optimal threshold value is still an open issue beguería 2005 mailhot et al 2013 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 in order to avoid the choice of an a priori threshold value a commonly accepted approach in literature is known as annual exceedance series aes chow 1964 koutsoyiannis 2004a gupta 2011 papalexiou et al 2013 this method works by selecting the first n extreme values where n is the number of years of record even though the aes method avoids evaluating the threshold value it still does not imply that the selected events are independent in the past many scholars investigated dependent samples behaviour e g hurst 1951 mandelbrot and wallis 1968 leadbetter 1983 koutsoyiannis 2008 volpi et al 2015 dependence may introduce some estimation bias if the dependence is of long range type with high hurst coefficient i e h 0 8 however this problem can be dealt with by taking dependence into account also the formula for return period does not change in presence of dependence of any type koutsoyiannis 2008 volpi et al 2015 nevertheless we select independent events using the concept of inter event time definition ietd adams et al 1986 which is the minimum inter arrival time between two events and thus aims at obtaining individual events independently on the sample selection method it is crucial to evaluate which probability distribution fits the empirical samples more accurately recently many authors carried out comparisons between different probability distributions to identify the one providing the best fitting to the empirical sample of extreme rainfall events e g deidda and puliga 2006 papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 de michele and avanzi 2018 młyński et al 2019 generally the most common probability distributions used in engineering practice are the gumbel and the fréchet both belonging to the gev distributions family papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 the gumbel distribution is often used to describe am series mailhot et al 2013 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 and more generally is the most common probabilistic distribution used for the study of hydrological extremes koutsoyiannis 2007 de michele 2019 at the same time however koutsoyiannis 2004a 2004b highlight that the gumbel distribution is not appropriate for studying hydrological extremes while the fréchet distribution or ev2 results a better alternative specifically the empirical analyses performed by koutsoyiannis 2007 highlight that the gumbel distribution may significantly underestimate the largest extreme rainfall amounts although its predictions for small return periods are satisfactory since a general rule to choose the best probability distribution does not exist in this paper we propose two coupled methods for assessing their goodness the ratio mean square error method rmsem papalexiou et al 2013 and the kolmogorov smirnov test ks keutelian 1991 specifically we test six theoretical probability distributions i e gamma g lognormal ln weibull w gumbel gu fréchet f and pareto type ii p to fit the empirical daily rainfall data recorded in two italian regions furthermore we perform the analysis for both the two sample selection methods am and aes the original contribution of this work is to define the most suitable distribution to describe extreme events selected with the am and aes respectively and to assess the effects of an incorrect estimation for both regional datasets results show that heavy tailed distributions are the most suitable to describe the analysed empirical samples the investigation shows that the use of different distributions rather than the best fitting one can lead to a considerable under or over estimation of the rainfall value associated to a specific return period this difference increases consistently with the return period results backup the analysis performed by papalexiou et al 2013 who analysed a global data set however in their study italy was not assessed thoroughly and sicily and lazio regions remained unexplored with this work we aim at filling the gap left the two regions are characterized by the mediterranean climate however their topographic and morphological characteristics make their climate peculiar and diversified in the inland for the first time the extension of the dataset allows a thoroughly analysis of daily rainfall extremes and their best fitting distributions the paper is organised as follow in section 2 we describe the datasets in section 3 we present the methodology while in section 4 we discuss the results of the fitting performance finally in section 5 we state the conclusions of the study 2 dataset in this study we use daily rainfall records observed in two italian regions lazio and sicily the data provided by the two regional hydrographic service networks consist of 345 and 568 rain gauges respectively for lazio and sicily lazio is located in central italy while sicily is in the south see fig 1 the two regions have a very different climate lazio is characterized by a mild temperate climate along the coast while the winter is colder in the inner hilly area the climate becomes continental in the apennine area on the other hand sicily is characterized by a mediterranean climate with long and warm summer and mild and wet winter along the southern coast summer is sweltering because of the african air flow because of the diversity of their climate the assessment of the best fitting distribution to daily rainfall in their two different areas leads to interesting remarks to be statistically consistent in our analysis we select only the rain gauges that fulfilled the following criteria i missing data less than 10 in each year and ii record length greater than or equal to 50 years world meteorogical organization 1988 in table 1 we show the data samples of rain gauges that satisfied these criteria for both regions in fig 1 we report locations and record lengths of each selected rain gauge 3 methods the paper involves the following aspects i preliminary samples selection starting from daily rainfall records ii definition of the parameters of the different theoretical probability distributions iii description of the theoretical probability distributions and iv statistical validation of the best distribution with a goodness of fit test 3 1 sample definition the extreme values theory provides the tools to assess the frequency and severity of extremes rainfall events by fitting theoretical probability distributions to sample of empirical values fisher and tippett 1928 gnedenko 1943 gumbel 1958 starting with the observed daily data the first step of our analysis consists in selecting and defining two samples via am and aes methods respectively the goal is to understand which are the consequences of these two sample selection methods in terms of rainfall predicted values variability for a fixed return period it is important to underline that in this paper the term tail refers to the upper part of a probability distribution function that governs at the same time both magnitude and frequency of extreme events papalexiou et al 2013 the am method may distort the tail behaviour as it takes into account only the largest value among those occurring in one year on the other hand using the aes method the selected events may not be independent while dependency has a very low probability to occur in the am samples since am method selects a single extreme event per year as discussed by volpi et al 2015 the sample may be populated by dependent events nevertheless here we select independent events considering an inter event time ietd adams et al 1986 of at least 24 h jun et al 2017 we assume that the selected n largest daily values of the record with n equal to the number of observed years are representative of the distributions tail and capable to provide information for the tail behaviour from a statistical perspective an important issue to consider is the presence of ties ties can influence the probability distributions fitting performance to the observed sample as proposed by salvadori et al 2014 using a physically based strategy ties can be dealt with by introducing randomised precipitation values r j 1 r j r j φ u j where r j is the j th repeated value in a sorted sample of daily precipitation values u j is an independent identically distributed random variable ranging from 0 5 to 0 5 and φ 0 1 mm is the rain gauges resolution the choice of φ value depends on it being small enough with respect to the range of r j in order to obtain a statistically equivalent value of r j by applying this procedure we remove the ties by replacing them with statistically equivalent values 3 2 parameters estimation and fitting method several works established that using heavy tailed distributions is more appropriate to describe the behaviour of extreme rainfall events de michele and avanzi 2018 deidda and puliga 2006 koutsoyiannis and papalexiou 2016 papalexiou et al 2013 the implication due to the use of heavy tailed distributions is that more frequent and severe rain events are more likely to be predicted than those characterised by light tails this means that the general approach of adopting light tailed distributions would result in a significant underestimation of the associated risk with potential implications for human lives the identification of the best fitting distribution can be strongly affected i by the parameter estimation method ii by a proper interpretation of the goodness of fit test and iii finally by the choice of the distribution that is candidate to fit the empirical sample in this study we use a straightforward methodology proposed by papalexiou et al 2013 to statistically describe extreme rainfall events for both the selected samples am and aes as described in section 3 1 the empirical probability of non exceedance f n x i according to the weibull plotting position is given by 2 f n x i r x i n 1 where n is the length of the sample equal to the number of recording years and r x i is the rank of the rainfall value x i sorted in ascending order with i 1 n the fitting method consists in the numerical minimisation of a modified mean square error norm rmse młyński et al 2019 papalexiou et al 2018 2013 here proposed in term of non exceedance probability 3 r m s e 1 n i 1 n f n x i f x i 1 f n x i 2 where f x i is the theoretical cumulative distribution function cdf while f n x i is the empirical distribution function edf the rmse method rmsem is chosen since it allows an almost unbiased estimation of the parameters and it has a smaller variance when compared to other norms for specific distribution e g pareto and lognormal as also found by papalexiou et al 2013 moreover its ease of use allows practitioners a straightforward application therefore in light of the aforementioned properties when compared to other widespread norms rmse presents a high efficiency and performance the rmse value enables for the unambiguous identification of the fit performance the distribution with the smallest rmse represents the best one to describe the empirical analysed sample papalexiou et al 2013 in table 2 we report the main statistical indicators of the four datasets comparing the basic statistics related to the two regions the precipitations of sicily is characterized by more accentuated extremes both for high and for low records according to the extreme variability of rainfall values during the year sicily is characterised by higher values of the standard deviation sd than lazio moreover the lowest values of the events selected with the am method are smaller than those of aes while obviously the highest values are selected equally by both methods the aes samples are therefore characterised by events belonging to a range of values smaller than those of am 3 3 theoretical probability distributions and fitting performance the method proposed in the previous section allows directly fitting and comparing the adaptation to the empirical data of different theoretical distributions in this paper we focus on six probability distributions gamma g lognormal ln weibull w gumbel gu fréchet f and pareto type ii p primarily we adopt these distributions since they are the most used in the study of extreme rainfall events secondly as they are all bi parametric can be considered comparable in terms of degree of freedom according to different tail classification werner and upper 2002 el adlouni et al 2008 the selected distributions can be ordered from heavier tailed to lighter tailed as follows pareto type ii fréchet lognormal weibull with shape parameter 1 gumbel gamma weibull with shape parameter 1 the pareto type ii distribution is a power type distribution defined in 0 its cdf is provided by eq 4 with a scale parameter β 0 and a shape parameter γ 0 4 f p x 1 γ x β 1 γ the fréchet distribution is a special case of the generalized extreme value distribution gev type ii defined in 0 its cdf is provided by eq 5 and it is defined by the scale parameter β 0 and the shape parameter γ 0 5 f f x e x β γ koutsoyiannis 2007 shows that the fréchet distribution in its form provided by eq 5 is characterised by an heavy tail moreover following the classification provided by ouarda et al 1994 fréchet belongs to the case in which the tail has the same behaviour of the pareto distribution the lognormal distribution is characterised by the scale parameter β 0 and the shape parameter γ 0 and is also considered a heavy tailed distribution 6 f l n x 1 1 2 erfc ln x β 1 γ erfc 2 π x e t 2 d t weibull distribution can be considered as a generalisation of the exponential distribution with cdf expresses as follow 7 f w x 1 e x β γ the weibull distribution with both scale β and shape γ parameters greater than zero can belong to the heavy tail class if γ 1 or to light tail class if γ 1 the gumbel distribution represents another particular case of the gev with the cdf given as 8 f g u x e e β x θ for the gumbel distribution the shape parameter is γ 0 and both the scale and the location are β θ 0 koutsoyiannis 2007 has shown that the gumbel distribution in its form provided by eq 8 is characterised by a light tail therefore unlike the other distributions where the shape parameter is an unknown quantity in eq 8 γ is defined and equal to zero this aspect can be significant in the fitting performance since the shape parameter governs the asymptotic behaviour of the tail the last candidate distribution is the gamma which like the weibull belongs to the exponential family its cdf is 9 f g x 1 γ γ x β γ γ γ s x x t s 1 e t d t γ s 0 t s 1 e t d t the tail of the gamma distribution also has different behaviour based on the value assumed by the shape parameter a for 0 γ 1 it has a slightly lighter tail than the exponential tail as it decreases faster b for γ 1 the tail degenerates in the exponential one c for γ 1 it exhibits a slightly heavier tail as it decreases more slowly than the exponential 3 4 best fitting analysis kolmogorov smirnov test by solving eq 3 the rmse values and the two parameters for the six candidate distributions are estimated as mentioned the rmsem can be considered a straightforward method to determine the best fit performance between cdfs since the distribution that has the lowest rmse value is the one that guarantees the best adaptation to the empirical sample although we have long data series estimated parameters are characterized by uncertainty mcneil 1997 to assess the reliability of the theoretical distribution with the empirical one the ks is adopted zeng et al 2015 it allows to compare cumulative frequency f n x with cumulative probability distribution f x adirosi et al 2016 in addition to the ks test in literature several goodness of fit test have been developed among the others we can list the cramer von mises and the anderson darling test conceived to give heavier weighting to tails of a distribution kottegoda and rosso 2008 in this study the ks test have been preferred as its reliability makes it a widespread test in daily precipitation extremes studies cugerone and de michele 2015 we carry out the popular ks test in order to compare the fitting performance provided by the rmsem the ks test statistic is represented by the maximum distance in absolute value between cumulative frequency and hypothesized cumulative distribution kottegoda and rosso 2008 since it is often misunderstood in practical engineering it is worth to recall that if the parameters of the distributions to be tested are estimated from the data the distribution of the ks test statistic is dependent on the distribution under analysis and the critical value must be calculated ad hoc in this paper we follow the procedure proposed by keutelian 1991 by estimating critical values of the test statistic using monte carlo simulations for each distribution and each rain gauge station we estimate the parameters with the rmsem then we use such parameters to generate 100 500 1000 5000 and 10 000 samples for each rain gauge with a length n equal to the original one subsequently we re estimate the parameters for each of the generated samples with the rmsem and compute the maximum difference d c r between the cdf and the cumulative frequencies we conduct the ks test for two significance levels α equal to 95 and 99 therefore the critical values of the test statistic are at the 95 and 99 percentile respectively d c r 95 and d c r 99 the ks test is accepted if the maximum difference in absolute value d between the cdf and the cumulative frequency of the empirical sample is smaller than the critical values d c r 95 d c r 99 ultimately it can be recalled that since both d and d c r are functional for each different distribution and for each empirical sample the ks test cannot be used to define which one among the candidate distributions best fits a particular sample 4 results and discussion in this paper we investigate which probability distribution provides the best fit to the samples selected for the two datasets collected in lazio and sicily the first analysis concerns the identification of the parameters of the six theoretical probability distributions with the rmsem for both the selected samples i e am and aes the results obtained for both datasets lazio and sicily respectively and for both sample selection methods are shown in fig 2 it can be argued that for the two regional dataset i e sicily and lazio fréchet distribution provides the best fit for the am samples while aes samples are optimally fitted by the pareto type ii as expected the performance of the gumbel distribution is significantly reduced for the aes samples coles et al 2001 madsen et al 1997a it is interesting to note that for the aes samples the weibull distribution never provides the best fit for the lazio region and for the sicilian dataset weibull distribution results as the best fitting distribution limited to a negligible aes samples percentage i e 1 for the am samples instead the weibull distribution provides the best fit for a low percentage of the analysed stations 2 3 and 5 7 respectively for lazio and sicily when the weibull best fits the empirical data although for a minimal percentage it always shows a shape parameter greater than one γ 1 it is therefore representative of a light tailed distribution it is noteworthy that the gumbel distribution presents a much lower percentage in the sicilian samples compared to the lazio am data these findings backup the results of de michele and avanzi 2018 as the gumbel distribution seems to provide a better fit to a wet pluviometric regime while sicily is characterized by a diverse climate in its lands according to a probabilistic approach it is possible to ascribe a return period to any rainfall value in fig 3 we show predicted values of extreme rainfall against their corresponding return period with filled markers we identify the distribution that provides the best fit to the empirical samples it is noteworthy to observe that the use of a distribution other than the best fitting one can entail a considerable under or over estimation of the rainfall value associated to a specific return period for the sake of simplicity in fig 3 we represent the results only for two rain gauge stations one for each region subiaco scolastica and caltagirone respectively for lazio and sicily in fig 3 it is noticeable that for high return periods there is a remarkable difference in the predicted rainfall values obtained from the six probability distributions considering a return period of 1000 years the use of a light tailed distribution i e weibull or gamma in fig 3 may significantly under estimate the rainfall amount the use of millennial return periods despite the uncertainty related to their estimation from an empirical sample with limited observations is commonly required for the design of hydraulic structures bertini et al 2020 moreover the choice of the sample selection i e am and aes entails different values of predicted rainfall for the same return period fig 4 provides the possible maximum under and over estimation i e δh of the predicted rainfall value for six different return periods particularly we estimate δ h as the difference of the rainfall depths predicted by the best fitting distribution and the one predicted by the worst fitting distribution based on the rmsem it is worth noting that for both regions the am samples show a greater variability although the median value is always lower than that obtained for the aes samples such aspect is due to the peculiarity of the sample and thus to its selection method precipitation values selected with the am method show a wider variability compared to those obtained with the aes method as also shown in table 2 the highlighted variability in table 2 for the sicilian datasets is confirmed in fig 4 b several extreme and catastrophic precipitation events occurred in sicily during the period of registration this results in a wider variability in the calculated δ h and makes the choice of the best distribution essential the last step of our analysis is represented by the ks test to verify if the probability distribution selected with the rmsem is actually suitable to describe the population of data we conduct the ks test on both datasets and for both sample selection methods with two different significance levels 95 and 99 starting with the parameters calculated with the rmsem we generated 100 500 1000 5000 and 10 000 different samples for each station with a length equal to the original one to evaluate the number of synthetic samples suitable for the analysis as the number of synthetic samples increases the critical values of each distribution tend to stabilise towards a constant value this is because the portion of the population of which the empirical sample represents a realisation increases with the number of generated synthetic sample to perform a rigorous statistical analysis it would be necessary to refer to the highest number of generated samples however we notice that already for 5000 synthetic samples the critical value d c r starts to converge to a constant value therefore apart from a significant computational cost in generating 10 000 synthetic samples it does not significantly influence the results of the ks test the subsequent elaborations and results presented below refer to a number of synthetic samples equal to 5 000 once defined the value d c r 95 and d c r 99 for each sample we consider two different possibilities to choose the final best fitting distribution if the distribution with the lowest value of rmse had been validated by the ks test this would have been accepted as the final distribution if instead the distribution with the lowest value of rmse had been rejected by the ks test the final distribution was selected among the distributions accepted by the test and corresponding to the one remaining with the lowest rmse thus it should be noted that in case the ks test does not accept any probability distribution the distribution with the lowest rmse is chosen in table 3 we report the rate of rain gauges that pass the ks test for each distribution it is necessary to specify the distinction between acceptance and validation of the distribution the first term indicates whether for a given station the distribution was accepted regardless of the result of rmsem while the second concerns only distributions with the best fitting rmsem overall the am method always provides a best fitting distribution for each analysed rain gauge obviously we can note that the use of a 95 significance level leads to more stringent results than the 99 it is interesting to highlight that for the majority of the cases the rmsem and the ks are equivalent however the rmsem seems to be easier and offers two main advantages it allows the estimation of the parameters of the distributions and compares and provide the best fitting distribution finally in fig 5 we show the geographic representation of the results relative to a level of reliability of 99 the maps in fig 5 can be extremely useful as they provide the best fitting distributions for each site as shown by results heavy tailed distributions have a better performance than light tailed ones in both regions this suggests that despite the difference in terms of pluviometric regime heavy tailed distributions play a dominant role as a consequence extreme events may have been under estimated in the engineering practice whereby the use of light tailed distributions is widespread with repercussions in the design of hydraulic infrastructures 5 conclusions analysis of daily precipitation data is a topic of interest in many hydrologic fields and in engineering practice being their modelling fundamental to define the project loading for both the design of hydraulic structures and the risk analysis in this paper we analyse daily precipitation values recorded by a dense network of rain gauges deployed in two italian regions with two very different climates although they both belong to the mediterranean climate area lazio and sicily for the analysis we select only rain gauges having at least 50 years of daily rainfall data with at most 10 of missing data per year we use two different selection methods to extract the empirical samples annual maxima am and annual exceedance series aes to conduct a proper statistical analysis we process the ties by replacing them with statistically equivalent values then we assess the performance of six theoretical probability distributions among the most used to describe daily rainfall pareto type ii p fréchet f lognormal lg weibull w gamma g and gumbel gu to fit these six probability distributions to the empirical samples we use a modified norm of the mean square error rmse to calculate numerically the parameters and simultaneously to identify the best fitting distribution alongside the rmse we choose the widespread kolmogorov smirnov test to validate statistically the results obtained from the previous method we perform the kolmogorov smirnoff ks test generating several synthetic samples using monte carlo simulations the number of generated synthetic samples does not significantly influence the results of the ks test the results of the analysis carried out on the empirical samples of both regions show that heavy tailed distributions provide a better fit than light tailed for about 80 of stations for both the selection sample methods in particular fréchet distribution is the most performing for the am samples and the pareto type ii for the aes this aspect conflicts with what is commonly sensed in engineering practice in fact the study of daily rainfall is generally dealt with using a light tailed probability distribution i e gumbel the difference in terms of return period and the related precipitation values is notable for each of the six candidate distributions and it increases dramatically for high return periods especially for the am samples as expected the sample selection method of extreme rainfall values leads to significantly different results this aspect needs to be further investigated especially considering that in the engineering practice the am is the most widely adopted method despite we consider this study preliminary at this stage we believe that the proposed investigation can represent a useful occasion to reassess the widespread practice to evaluate design variables as it is of utmost importance the correct estimation of project loading of hydraulic structures the rmsem and the ks test show to be equivalent in terms of results however the rmsem offers two main advantages as it allows the comparison and the definition of the best fitting distribution and of its parameters this can largely benefit practitioners when dealing with the determination of the best fitting distribution the analysis show that heavy tailed distributions perform better in both regions despite they have different climatic characteristics results are thus in agreement with papalexiou et al 2013 who investigated many regions around the globe except central and south italy that remained unexplored in this regard this paper aims at filling the gap left on these areas as a result the project loading of hydraulic structures may have been considerably under or over estimated in the past this difference increases consistently with the return period as shown in fig 4 we thus believe that the proposed investigation can raise awareness to accurately evaluate the design hydrological quantities supporting common engineering practice credit authorship

8279,study region we investigate samples from two italian regions i e lazio and sicily located in central and south italy respectively and characterized by two diverse climates study focus in engineering practice the study of maxima daily rainfall values is commonly dealt with light tailed probability distribution functions such as the gumbel the choice of a distribution rather than another may cause estimation errors of rainfall values associated to specific return periods recently several studies demonstrate that heavy tailed distributions are preferable for extreme events modelling here we opt for six theoretical probability distribution functions and evaluate their performance in fitting extreme precipitation samples we select the samples with two common methods i e the peak over threshold and the annual maxima we assess the best fitting distribution to the empirical samples of extreme values through the ratio mean square error method and the kolmogorov smirnov test new hydrological insights for the region the assessment of the best fitting distribution to daily rainfall of the two different areas investigated here leads to interesting remarks despite the diversity of their climate results suggest that heavy tailed distributions describe more accurately empirical data rather than light tailed ones therefore extreme events may have been largely underestimated in the past in both areas the proposed investigation can prompt the choice of the best fitting probability distribution to evaluate the design hydrological quantities supporting common engineering practice keywords daily precipitation extreme rainfall tail behaviour fitting method kolmogorov smirnov test 1 introduction it is widely recognised that heavy rainfall at a daily time scale has a crucial role in flood risk estimation and consequently in design and management of flood protection works koutsoyiannis 2007 due to the availability of daily rainfall data across the world precipitation at daily scale represents one of the most investigated variables in hydrology de michele 2019 moreover daily rainfall data measured by precipitation gauges are much more stable and reliable than those measured with hourly or sub hourly scales not least studies on long term series of hydrological phenomena need daily precipitation as input world meteorogical organization 1988 such data are fundamental in both scientific research and engineering practice as for instance the estimation of long series analysis alpert et al 2002 arnone et al 2013 bonaccorso and aronica 2016 the study and forecasting of drought cancelliere et al 2007 mineo et al 2019 the evaluation of the return period for design hydraulic works de michele and avanzi 2018 mineo et al 2018 the assessment of rainfall erosivity petkovšek and mikoš 2004 usda agricultural research service 2013 the domestic rainwater harvesting campisano and modica 2012 and the estimation of sub daily precipitation through disaggregation techniques koutsoyiannis 2003 among the most common practices that require the analysis of daily records there is the identification of the theoretical probability distribution that allows the best fit to empirical samples a poor fit to empirical data can lead to under or over sizing hydraulic structures de michele and avanzi 2018 młyński et al 2019 hence defining a proper method to model the extreme rainfall is still challenging for hydrologists and engineers cavanaugh et al 2015 traditionally in the hydrological practice annual maximum am and peak over threshold pot are the two main approaches to select extreme values from historical time series the am method consists in selecting maximum rainfall values one for each year of observation the pot sample is achieved by selecting all extreme values that exceed an arbitrarily fixed threshold chow 1964 several authors provide a comparative survey on the adaptation of different theoretical probability distributions to hydrological empirical samples selected by these two approaches madsen et al 1997a 1997b propose a regional estimation scheme for extreme events modelling by selecting am and pot samples for discharge data recorded in new zealand their findings reveal that the pot generalized pareto distribution gpd model is generally more efficient than the am generalized extreme value gev model bezak et al 2014 show that the pot method provides better results than the am for a flood frequency analysis in slovenia moreover the pot approach provides a better adaptation to heavy tailed distributions compared to the am madsen et al 1997b and uses more information since it includes much more extreme events beguería 2005 although the pot method seems to be a valid alternative to the am method the impact of threshold selection can greatly influence the analysis of the extreme values as a matter of facts the threshold value directly influences both the length of the sample and the statistical independence of its values these matters are widely investigated in literature and a general accepted methodology for the identification of the optimal threshold value is still an open issue beguería 2005 mailhot et al 2013 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 in order to avoid the choice of an a priori threshold value a commonly accepted approach in literature is known as annual exceedance series aes chow 1964 koutsoyiannis 2004a gupta 2011 papalexiou et al 2013 this method works by selecting the first n extreme values where n is the number of years of record even though the aes method avoids evaluating the threshold value it still does not imply that the selected events are independent in the past many scholars investigated dependent samples behaviour e g hurst 1951 mandelbrot and wallis 1968 leadbetter 1983 koutsoyiannis 2008 volpi et al 2015 dependence may introduce some estimation bias if the dependence is of long range type with high hurst coefficient i e h 0 8 however this problem can be dealt with by taking dependence into account also the formula for return period does not change in presence of dependence of any type koutsoyiannis 2008 volpi et al 2015 nevertheless we select independent events using the concept of inter event time definition ietd adams et al 1986 which is the minimum inter arrival time between two events and thus aims at obtaining individual events independently on the sample selection method it is crucial to evaluate which probability distribution fits the empirical samples more accurately recently many authors carried out comparisons between different probability distributions to identify the one providing the best fitting to the empirical sample of extreme rainfall events e g deidda and puliga 2006 papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 de michele and avanzi 2018 młyński et al 2019 generally the most common probability distributions used in engineering practice are the gumbel and the fréchet both belonging to the gev distributions family papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 the gumbel distribution is often used to describe am series mailhot et al 2013 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 and more generally is the most common probabilistic distribution used for the study of hydrological extremes koutsoyiannis 2007 de michele 2019 at the same time however koutsoyiannis 2004a 2004b highlight that the gumbel distribution is not appropriate for studying hydrological extremes while the fréchet distribution or ev2 results a better alternative specifically the empirical analyses performed by koutsoyiannis 2007 highlight that the gumbel distribution may significantly underestimate the largest extreme rainfall amounts although its predictions for small return periods are satisfactory since a general rule to choose the best probability distribution does not exist in this paper we propose two coupled methods for assessing their goodness the ratio mean square error method rmsem papalexiou et al 2013 and the kolmogorov smirnov test ks keutelian 1991 specifically we test six theoretical probability distributions i e gamma g lognormal ln weibull w gumbel gu fréchet f and pareto type ii p to fit the empirical daily rainfall data recorded in two italian regions furthermore we perform the analysis for both the two sample selection methods am and aes the original contribution of this work is to define the most suitable distribution to describe extreme events selected with the am and aes respectively and to assess the effects of an incorrect estimation for both regional datasets results show that heavy tailed distributions are the most suitable to describe the analysed empirical samples the investigation shows that the use of different distributions rather than the best fitting one can lead to a considerable under or over estimation of the rainfall value associated to a specific return period this difference increases consistently with the return period results backup the analysis performed by papalexiou et al 2013 who analysed a global data set however in their study italy was not assessed thoroughly and sicily and lazio regions remained unexplored with this work we aim at filling the gap left the two regions are characterized by the mediterranean climate however their topographic and morphological characteristics make their climate peculiar and diversified in the inland for the first time the extension of the dataset allows a thoroughly analysis of daily rainfall extremes and their best fitting distributions the paper is organised as follow in section 2 we describe the datasets in section 3 we present the methodology while in section 4 we discuss the results of the fitting performance finally in section 5 we state the conclusions of the study 2 dataset in this study we use daily rainfall records observed in two italian regions lazio and sicily the data provided by the two regional hydrographic service networks consist of 345 and 568 rain gauges respectively for lazio and sicily lazio is located in central italy while sicily is in the south see fig 1 the two regions have a very different climate lazio is characterized by a mild temperate climate along the coast while the winter is colder in the inner hilly area the climate becomes continental in the apennine area on the other hand sicily is characterized by a mediterranean climate with long and warm summer and mild and wet winter along the southern coast summer is sweltering because of the african air flow because of the diversity of their climate the assessment of the best fitting distribution to daily rainfall in their two different areas leads to interesting remarks to be statistically consistent in our analysis we select only the rain gauges that fulfilled the following criteria i missing data less than 10 in each year and ii record length greater than or equal to 50 years world meteorogical organization 1988 in table 1 we show the data samples of rain gauges that satisfied these criteria for both regions in fig 1 we report locations and record lengths of each selected rain gauge 3 methods the paper involves the following aspects i preliminary samples selection starting from daily rainfall records ii definition of the parameters of the different theoretical probability distributions iii description of the theoretical probability distributions and iv statistical validation of the best distribution with a goodness of fit test 3 1 sample definition the extreme values theory provides the tools to assess the frequency and severity of extremes rainfall events by fitting theoretical probability distributions to sample of empirical values fisher and tippett 1928 gnedenko 1943 gumbel 1958 starting with the observed daily data the first step of our analysis consists in selecting and defining two samples via am and aes methods respectively the goal is to understand which are the consequences of these two sample selection methods in terms of rainfall predicted values variability for a fixed return period it is important to underline that in this paper the term tail refers to the upper part of a probability distribution function that governs at the same time both magnitude and frequency of extreme events papalexiou et al 2013 the am method may distort the tail behaviour as it takes into account only the largest value among those occurring in one year on the other hand using the aes method the selected events may not be independent while dependency has a very low probability to occur in the am samples since am method selects a single extreme event per year as discussed by volpi et al 2015 the sample may be populated by dependent events nevertheless here we select independent events considering an inter event time ietd adams et al 1986 of at least 24 h jun et al 2017 we assume that the selected n largest daily values of the record with n equal to the number of observed years are representative of the distributions tail and capable to provide information for the tail behaviour from a statistical perspective an important issue to consider is the presence of ties ties can influence the probability distributions fitting performance to the observed sample as proposed by salvadori et al 2014 using a physically based strategy ties can be dealt with by introducing randomised precipitation values r j 1 r j r j φ u j where r j is the j th repeated value in a sorted sample of daily precipitation values u j is an independent identically distributed random variable ranging from 0 5 to 0 5 and φ 0 1 mm is the rain gauges resolution the choice of φ value depends on it being small enough with respect to the range of r j in order to obtain a statistically equivalent value of r j by applying this procedure we remove the ties by replacing them with statistically equivalent values 3 2 parameters estimation and fitting method several works established that using heavy tailed distributions is more appropriate to describe the behaviour of extreme rainfall events de michele and avanzi 2018 deidda and puliga 2006 koutsoyiannis and papalexiou 2016 papalexiou et al 2013 the implication due to the use of heavy tailed distributions is that more frequent and severe rain events are more likely to be predicted than those characterised by light tails this means that the general approach of adopting light tailed distributions would result in a significant underestimation of the associated risk with potential implications for human lives the identification of the best fitting distribution can be strongly affected i by the parameter estimation method ii by a proper interpretation of the goodness of fit test and iii finally by the choice of the distribution that is candidate to fit the empirical sample in this study we use a straightforward methodology proposed by papalexiou et al 2013 to statistically describe extreme rainfall events for both the selected samples am and aes as described in section 3 1 the empirical probability of non exceedance f n x i according to the weibull plotting position is given by 2 f n x i r x i n 1 where n is the length of the sample equal to the number of recording years and r x i is the rank of the rainfall value x i sorted in ascending order with i 1 n the fitting method consists in the numerical minimisation of a modified mean square error norm rmse młyński et al 2019 papalexiou et al 2018 2013 here proposed in term of non exceedance probability 3 r m s e 1 n i 1 n f n x i f x i 1 f n x i 2 where f x i is the theoretical cumulative distribution function cdf while f n x i is the empirical distribution function edf the rmse method rmsem is chosen since it allows an almost unbiased estimation of the parameters and it has a smaller variance when compared to other norms for specific distribution e g pareto and lognormal as also found by papalexiou et al 2013 moreover its ease of use allows practitioners a straightforward application therefore in light of the aforementioned properties when compared to other widespread norms rmse presents a high efficiency and performance the rmse value enables for the unambiguous identification of the fit performance the distribution with the smallest rmse represents the best one to describe the empirical analysed sample papalexiou et al 2013 in table 2 we report the main statistical indicators of the four datasets comparing the basic statistics related to the two regions the precipitations of sicily is characterized by more accentuated extremes both for high and for low records according to the extreme variability of rainfall values during the year sicily is characterised by higher values of the standard deviation sd than lazio moreover the lowest values of the events selected with the am method are smaller than those of aes while obviously the highest values are selected equally by both methods the aes samples are therefore characterised by events belonging to a range of values smaller than those of am 3 3 theoretical probability distributions and fitting performance the method proposed in the previous section allows directly fitting and comparing the adaptation to the empirical data of different theoretical distributions in this paper we focus on six probability distributions gamma g lognormal ln weibull w gumbel gu fréchet f and pareto type ii p primarily we adopt these distributions since they are the most used in the study of extreme rainfall events secondly as they are all bi parametric can be considered comparable in terms of degree of freedom according to different tail classification werner and upper 2002 el adlouni et al 2008 the selected distributions can be ordered from heavier tailed to lighter tailed as follows pareto type ii fréchet lognormal weibull with shape parameter 1 gumbel gamma weibull with shape parameter 1 the pareto type ii distribution is a power type distribution defined in 0 its cdf is provided by eq 4 with a scale parameter β 0 and a shape parameter γ 0 4 f p x 1 γ x β 1 γ the fréchet distribution is a special case of the generalized extreme value distribution gev type ii defined in 0 its cdf is provided by eq 5 and it is defined by the scale parameter β 0 and the shape parameter γ 0 5 f f x e x β γ koutsoyiannis 2007 shows that the fréchet distribution in its form provided by eq 5 is characterised by an heavy tail moreover following the classification provided by ouarda et al 1994 fréchet belongs to the case in which the tail has the same behaviour of the pareto distribution the lognormal distribution is characterised by the scale parameter β 0 and the shape parameter γ 0 and is also considered a heavy tailed distribution 6 f l n x 1 1 2 erfc ln x β 1 γ erfc 2 π x e t 2 d t weibull distribution can be considered as a generalisation of the exponential distribution with cdf expresses as follow 7 f w x 1 e x β γ the weibull distribution with both scale β and shape γ parameters greater than zero can belong to the heavy tail class if γ 1 or to light tail class if γ 1 the gumbel distribution represents another particular case of the gev with the cdf given as 8 f g u x e e β x θ for the gumbel distribution the shape parameter is γ 0 and both the scale and the location are β θ 0 koutsoyiannis 2007 has shown that the gumbel distribution in its form provided by eq 8 is characterised by a light tail therefore unlike the other distributions where the shape parameter is an unknown quantity in eq 8 γ is defined and equal to zero this aspect can be significant in the fitting performance since the shape parameter governs the asymptotic behaviour of the tail the last candidate distribution is the gamma which like the weibull belongs to the exponential family its cdf is 9 f g x 1 γ γ x β γ γ γ s x x t s 1 e t d t γ s 0 t s 1 e t d t the tail of the gamma distribution also has different behaviour based on the value assumed by the shape parameter a for 0 γ 1 it has a slightly lighter tail than the exponential tail as it decreases faster b for γ 1 the tail degenerates in the exponential one c for γ 1 it exhibits a slightly heavier tail as it decreases more slowly than the exponential 3 4 best fitting analysis kolmogorov smirnov test by solving eq 3 the rmse values and the two parameters for the six candidate distributions are estimated as mentioned the rmsem can be considered a straightforward method to determine the best fit performance between cdfs since the distribution that has the lowest rmse value is the one that guarantees the best adaptation to the empirical sample although we have long data series estimated parameters are characterized by uncertainty mcneil 1997 to assess the reliability of the theoretical distribution with the empirical one the ks is adopted zeng et al 2015 it allows to compare cumulative frequency f n x with cumulative probability distribution f x adirosi et al 2016 in addition to the ks test in literature several goodness of fit test have been developed among the others we can list the cramer von mises and the anderson darling test conceived to give heavier weighting to tails of a distribution kottegoda and rosso 2008 in this study the ks test have been preferred as its reliability makes it a widespread test in daily precipitation extremes studies cugerone and de michele 2015 we carry out the popular ks test in order to compare the fitting performance provided by the rmsem the ks test statistic is represented by the maximum distance in absolute value between cumulative frequency and hypothesized cumulative distribution kottegoda and rosso 2008 since it is often misunderstood in practical engineering it is worth to recall that if the parameters of the distributions to be tested are estimated from the data the distribution of the ks test statistic is dependent on the distribution under analysis and the critical value must be calculated ad hoc in this paper we follow the procedure proposed by keutelian 1991 by estimating critical values of the test statistic using monte carlo simulations for each distribution and each rain gauge station we estimate the parameters with the rmsem then we use such parameters to generate 100 500 1000 5000 and 10 000 samples for each rain gauge with a length n equal to the original one subsequently we re estimate the parameters for each of the generated samples with the rmsem and compute the maximum difference d c r between the cdf and the cumulative frequencies we conduct the ks test for two significance levels α equal to 95 and 99 therefore the critical values of the test statistic are at the 95 and 99 percentile respectively d c r 95 and d c r 99 the ks test is accepted if the maximum difference in absolute value d between the cdf and the cumulative frequency of the empirical sample is smaller than the critical values d c r 95 d c r 99 ultimately it can be recalled that since both d and d c r are functional for each different distribution and for each empirical sample the ks test cannot be used to define which one among the candidate distributions best fits a particular sample 4 results and discussion in this paper we investigate which probability distribution provides the best fit to the samples selected for the two datasets collected in lazio and sicily the first analysis concerns the identification of the parameters of the six theoretical probability distributions with the rmsem for both the selected samples i e am and aes the results obtained for both datasets lazio and sicily respectively and for both sample selection methods are shown in fig 2 it can be argued that for the two regional dataset i e sicily and lazio fréchet distribution provides the best fit for the am samples while aes samples are optimally fitted by the pareto type ii as expected the performance of the gumbel distribution is significantly reduced for the aes samples coles et al 2001 madsen et al 1997a it is interesting to note that for the aes samples the weibull distribution never provides the best fit for the lazio region and for the sicilian dataset weibull distribution results as the best fitting distribution limited to a negligible aes samples percentage i e 1 for the am samples instead the weibull distribution provides the best fit for a low percentage of the analysed stations 2 3 and 5 7 respectively for lazio and sicily when the weibull best fits the empirical data although for a minimal percentage it always shows a shape parameter greater than one γ 1 it is therefore representative of a light tailed distribution it is noteworthy that the gumbel distribution presents a much lower percentage in the sicilian samples compared to the lazio am data these findings backup the results of de michele and avanzi 2018 as the gumbel distribution seems to provide a better fit to a wet pluviometric regime while sicily is characterized by a diverse climate in its lands according to a probabilistic approach it is possible to ascribe a return period to any rainfall value in fig 3 we show predicted values of extreme rainfall against their corresponding return period with filled markers we identify the distribution that provides the best fit to the empirical samples it is noteworthy to observe that the use of a distribution other than the best fitting one can entail a considerable under or over estimation of the rainfall value associated to a specific return period for the sake of simplicity in fig 3 we represent the results only for two rain gauge stations one for each region subiaco scolastica and caltagirone respectively for lazio and sicily in fig 3 it is noticeable that for high return periods there is a remarkable difference in the predicted rainfall values obtained from the six probability distributions considering a return period of 1000 years the use of a light tailed distribution i e weibull or gamma in fig 3 may significantly under estimate the rainfall amount the use of millennial return periods despite the uncertainty related to their estimation from an empirical sample with limited observations is commonly required for the design of hydraulic structures bertini et al 2020 moreover the choice of the sample selection i e am and aes entails different values of predicted rainfall for the same return period fig 4 provides the possible maximum under and over estimation i e δh of the predicted rainfall value for six different return periods particularly we estimate δ h as the difference of the rainfall depths predicted by the best fitting distribution and the one predicted by the worst fitting distribution based on the rmsem it is worth noting that for both regions the am samples show a greater variability although the median value is always lower than that obtained for the aes samples such aspect is due to the peculiarity of the sample and thus to its selection method precipitation values selected with the am method show a wider variability compared to those obtained with the aes method as also shown in table 2 the highlighted variability in table 2 for the sicilian datasets is confirmed in fig 4 b several extreme and catastrophic precipitation events occurred in sicily during the period of registration this results in a wider variability in the calculated δ h and makes the choice of the best distribution essential the last step of our analysis is represented by the ks test to verify if the probability distribution selected with the rmsem is actually suitable to describe the population of data we conduct the ks test on both datasets and for both sample selection methods with two different significance levels 95 and 99 starting with the parameters calculated with the rmsem we generated 100 500 1000 5000 and 10 000 different samples for each station with a length equal to the original one to evaluate the number of synthetic samples suitable for the analysis as the number of synthetic samples increases the critical values of each distribution tend to stabilise towards a constant value this is because the portion of the population of which the empirical sample represents a realisation increases with the number of generated synthetic sample to perform a rigorous statistical analysis it would be necessary to refer to the highest number of generated samples however we notice that already for 5000 synthetic samples the critical value d c r starts to converge to a constant value therefore apart from a significant computational cost in generating 10 000 synthetic samples it does not significantly influence the results of the ks test the subsequent elaborations and results presented below refer to a number of synthetic samples equal to 5 000 once defined the value d c r 95 and d c r 99 for each sample we consider two different possibilities to choose the final best fitting distribution if the distribution with the lowest value of rmse had been validated by the ks test this would have been accepted as the final distribution if instead the distribution with the lowest value of rmse had been rejected by the ks test the final distribution was selected among the distributions accepted by the test and corresponding to the one remaining with the lowest rmse thus it should be noted that in case the ks test does not accept any probability distribution the distribution with the lowest rmse is chosen in table 3 we report the rate of rain gauges that pass the ks test for each distribution it is necessary to specify the distinction between acceptance and validation of the distribution the first term indicates whether for a given station the distribution was accepted regardless of the result of rmsem while the second concerns only distributions with the best fitting rmsem overall the am method always provides a best fitting distribution for each analysed rain gauge obviously we can note that the use of a 95 significance level leads to more stringent results than the 99 it is interesting to highlight that for the majority of the cases the rmsem and the ks are equivalent however the rmsem seems to be easier and offers two main advantages it allows the estimation of the parameters of the distributions and compares and provide the best fitting distribution finally in fig 5 we show the geographic representation of the results relative to a level of reliability of 99 the maps in fig 5 can be extremely useful as they provide the best fitting distributions for each site as shown by results heavy tailed distributions have a better performance than light tailed ones in both regions this suggests that despite the difference in terms of pluviometric regime heavy tailed distributions play a dominant role as a consequence extreme events may have been under estimated in the engineering practice whereby the use of light tailed distributions is widespread with repercussions in the design of hydraulic infrastructures 5 conclusions analysis of daily precipitation data is a topic of interest in many hydrologic fields and in engineering practice being their modelling fundamental to define the project loading for both the design of hydraulic structures and the risk analysis in this paper we analyse daily precipitation values recorded by a dense network of rain gauges deployed in two italian regions with two very different climates although they both belong to the mediterranean climate area lazio and sicily for the analysis we select only rain gauges having at least 50 years of daily rainfall data with at most 10 of missing data per year we use two different selection methods to extract the empirical samples annual maxima am and annual exceedance series aes to conduct a proper statistical analysis we process the ties by replacing them with statistically equivalent values then we assess the performance of six theoretical probability distributions among the most used to describe daily rainfall pareto type ii p fréchet f lognormal lg weibull w gamma g and gumbel gu to fit these six probability distributions to the empirical samples we use a modified norm of the mean square error rmse to calculate numerically the parameters and simultaneously to identify the best fitting distribution alongside the rmse we choose the widespread kolmogorov smirnov test to validate statistically the results obtained from the previous method we perform the kolmogorov smirnoff ks test generating several synthetic samples using monte carlo simulations the number of generated synthetic samples does not significantly influence the results of the ks test the results of the analysis carried out on the empirical samples of both regions show that heavy tailed distributions provide a better fit than light tailed for about 80 of stations for both the selection sample methods in particular fréchet distribution is the most performing for the am samples and the pareto type ii for the aes this aspect conflicts with what is commonly sensed in engineering practice in fact the study of daily rainfall is generally dealt with using a light tailed probability distribution i e gumbel the difference in terms of return period and the related precipitation values is notable for each of the six candidate distributions and it increases dramatically for high return periods especially for the am samples as expected the sample selection method of extreme rainfall values leads to significantly different results this aspect needs to be further investigated especially considering that in the engineering practice the am is the most widely adopted method despite we consider this study preliminary at this stage we believe that the proposed investigation can represent a useful occasion to reassess the widespread practice to evaluate design variables as it is of utmost importance the correct estimation of project loading of hydraulic structures the rmsem and the ks test show to be equivalent in terms of results however the rmsem offers two main advantages as it allows the comparison and the definition of the best fitting distribution and of its parameters this can largely benefit practitioners when dealing with the determination of the best fitting distribution the analysis show that heavy tailed distributions perform better in both regions despite they have different climatic characteristics results are thus in agreement with papalexiou et al 2013 who investigated many regions around the globe except central and south italy that remained unexplored in this regard this paper aims at filling the gap left on these areas as a result the project loading of hydraulic structures may have been considerably under or over estimated in the past this difference increases consistently with the return period as shown in fig 4 we thus believe that the proposed investigation can raise awareness to accurately evaluate the design hydrological quantities supporting common engineering practice credit authorship
