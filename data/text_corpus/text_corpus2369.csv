11845,radon 222rn a radioactive gas of natural origin was listed by the world health organization in 2009 as the second largest cause of lung cancer 3 14 after tobacco global awareness of the importance of controlling its concentration in water led to the implementation of the european directive 2013 51 euratom which establishes permitted levels in drinking water this study applies a mathematical model to determine 222rn concentration in water supplying an artificial aquifer over the full range of recharge discharge conditions volumes and times and therefore flows this was done by creating an artificial aquifer on a laboratory scale which reproduces the recharges and discharges experienced by real aquifers through rainwater or groundwater the equipment used in this study was an rtm 2100 with a specific system for continuous monitoring of 222rn in water a high purity ge detector for gamma spectrometry and a portable liquid scintillation counter lsc called triathler for specific measurements of 222rn in water the aim of this paper is to show the application of the mathematical model under different recharge discharge conditions applied to the artificial aquifer the concentration of 222rn in water determined by the model can also be used as a tracer to find the origin and volume of water that reaches a real aquifer graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater

introduction the concentrations of 222rn that can be found in the outside air are practically negligible with an annual average of 10 bq m 3 nero et al 1990 who 2001 however in the inside of buildings and naturally enclosed spaces such as wells galleries or caves the values can be very high such as 50 462 bq m 3 in the cave of castañar de ibor lario et al 2006 or quite high such as the average value of 2500 bq m 3 as shown in a study of 220 caves cigna 2005 in general its location in the ground coincides directly with the distribution of the parent 226ra which through the emission of an α particle in its decay process generates the nucleus of 222rn this is however not always true since in addition to molecular diffusion short displacements through concentration gradients there are air convective mechanisms fast and significant displacements driven by pressure gradients and it can also be carried far from the point of production by water since it is a gas existing studies mainly focused on determining its concentration in the air in places such as underground mines youssef et al 2019 veiga et al 2004 workplaces and homes quindós 1995 icrp 137 2017 but groundwater is also a very important route for the accumulation and transport of 222rn values in water can span from less than 2 bq l 1 in surface water up to 50 000 bq l 1 in groundwater csn 2001 haroon et al 2022 qasim et al 2021 which occurs when water passes over rocks with a high content of 226ra or circulates through cracks with high concentrations of 222rn in the air some studies have shown that high levels of 222rn dissolved in water are a significant source in enclosed spaces and lead to non negligible radiation in the gastrointestinal tract and throughout the body by means of ingestion galán et al 2004 other research has used 222rn as a tracer to study water discharge in groundwater avery et al 2018 and in submarine groundwater selvam et al 2021 but other methodologies are used with water samples taken at given points in time in this case however 222rn in water was continuously monitored for this study an artificial aquifer with stable concentrations of 222rn was built in the laboratory with the aim of validating a mathematical model under different recharge discharge conditions which happens in real aquifers such as in las caldas of the besaya thermal spa analysed by our research group sainz et al 2016 the experimentation in the laboratory is innovative in so far as it has allowed an artificial aquifer to be recharged with waters of different origin simulating recharges with rainwater 222rn free or with groundwater rich in 222rn it was further possible to work with different recharge and discharge conditions different volumes flows 222rn concentrations and recharge and discharge times celaya 2018 the main aim of this research is to validate a mathematical model that allows 222rn to be used as a tracer to determine the origin and volume of the water that reaches natural aquifers 2 materials and methods 2 1 instrumentation 2 1 1 hpge coaxial detector the hpge coaxial detector model gl 2015 7500 canberra usa allows the detection of gamma emissions between 30 and 3000 kev 222rn concentration celaya et al 2018b was determined by the counts taken in the spectrum that correspond to 214pb 351 932 kev laboratoire national henri becquerel 2018 with an efficiency of 1 29 and fwhm full width half maximum of 0 66 2 1 2 triathler with alpha beta separator lsc we used a triathler model 425 034 with an integrated alpha beta separator hidex finland as the liquid scintillation counter lsc this instrument differentiates the longer pulse duration of alpha particles 100 ns from the shorter pulse duration generated by beta particles 30 ns wisser et al 2006 this technique allows detecting generated alpha emissions in the disintegration of 226ra 222rn and its short lived descendants 218po and 214po through a photomultiplier tube the liquid scintillator aqualight hidex is a hydrocarbon with two aromatic rings called diisopropylnaphthalene used in the so called direct or one phase method to measure 222rn in water celaya et al 2018b the efficiency obtained was 262 when the sample contained 222rn 218po and 214po will also be generated without the presence of 226ra and 349 when the sample contained 226ra 222rn 218po and 214po will also be generated calibration was performed using a certified source of 222ra and dilutions with various known concentrations 12 20 32 100 296 843 and 2943 bq l 1 celaya et al 2018b the good results obtained with this instrument in national celaya et al 2018a and international intercomparison exercises for radon in water such as rem 2018 joint research centre or proftest syke 2015 finnish environment institute confirm the correct calibration of this device 2 1 3 rtm 2100 rtm 2100 sarad germany is a device used for the continuous measurement of 222rn and 220rn concentration in air as well as temperature relative humidity and atmospheric pressure a pump inside drives air from the outside towards the 250 mm3 measuring chamber where a silicon detector is located having previously passed through two filters that retain all descendants of 222rn and 220rn the sensitivity of this equipment is 1 65 counts min kbq m 3 according to the calibration certificate provided by bundesamt für strahlenschutz bfs since this is a device that continuously measures 222rn in air a system must be attached that allows continuous measurement in water this system is based on the transfer of 222rn contained in water to the air that circulates through silicone tubes inside a container fig 1 for this reason it is necessary to calculate a transfer factor t f to convert the measurement taken by the rtm 2100 of radon in air bq m 3 to radon in water bq l 1 fig 1 shows two circuits the water circuit is gray b e and f while the air circuit is white a c y d an internal pump starts the circuit the air outlet is marked on the device with the designation out a the circuit continues with silicone tubes b which are impermeable to water but permeable to radon this component is submerged and placed inside the container filled with the water to be measured next there is a compensation bottle and a peltier dryer c which prevent water vapour from entering the detector before the air returns to the equipment at the entrance marked in d the other part of the system i e the water circuit begins with an external pump submerged in the aquifer e its function is to continuously send water to the container f where the silicone tubes b are placed and finally the water returns to the aquifer container 2 2 artificial aquifer description 2 2 1 aquifer container to reproduce the recharge and discharge processes experienced by natural aquifers an artificial aquifer was built on a laboratory scale the first step was choosing the 100 l container a tap was incorporated into the structure to make the sampling accessible and acrylic putty was used to seal the lid and to serve as an insulator preventing water and 222rn from leaking from the top of the container lid fig 2 the different tubes and perforations made for adaptation can be seen as described below firstly we can see the blue plug g with the hole where the aquifer recharges next the hose returning from the water circuit h and the outlet hose of the artificial aquifer identified by the transparent tube i can be seen finally in the upper middle part is the electrical connection cable of the pump j which drives the water through the water circuit 2 2 2 222rn source of the artificial aquifer creating the 222rn source of the artificial aquifer relied on the expertise of our research group to construct a222rn enriched water container with a source of 226ra fig 3 celaya et al 2018b fig 3 shows the distribution of the silicone tubes inside the methacrylate container used in the construction of the artificial aquifer the aim is to distribute the silicone tubes throughout the container to ensure that 222rn is distributed homogeneously thanks to a small pump that generates a current to mix the water the 222rn source was a methacrylate box containing uranium mine soil with 226ra 745 20 kbq kg 1 measured with a hpge coaxial detector gamma spectrometer with laboratory accreditation iso 17025 that provided enough 222rn to achieve a concentration in water of 578 28 bq l 1 this box was connected by plastic tubes to a pump that applied a flow of 0 03 l min 1 of air distributing the 222rn along the silicone tubes and then to the water using the process described for the distribution of 222rn in the methacrylate container 945 cm of silicone tubes were placed inside the artificial aquifer container attached to the radon source formed by 271 g of soil used in the previous experiment the system that generates 222rn in the artificial aquifer is formed by a methacrylate box 8 16 5 5 cm length x width x height and 2 tubes there is one inlet tube on the right side with air which is driven by the pump and another outlet tube on the left which is joined to the silicone tubes inside the aquifer the pump supplies an airflow of 0 03 l min 1 which is sufficient to carry the air with 222rn generated in the box and to return it after passing through the silicone tubes inside the aquifer 2 2 3 222rn source to generate the radon rich recharge water the system was developed to generate groundwater rich in 222rn which is used to recharge the artificial aquifer a cooling box was loaded with water from a public supply inside a glass bowl containing soil rich in 226ra 745 20 kbq kg 1 was placed and sealed with an elastic silicone lid in order to diffuse 222rn easily into the water 2 3 sample collection water sampling in the artificial aquifer was carried out through the tap with each sample collected in 100 ml beakers the process consisted of putting the tap next to the beaker and taking 29 samples with a small flow of water the aim was to avoid bubbles and splashes that could cause leaks of the content with 222rn and to measure them in the lsc in order to calculate the transfer factor t f 2 4 starting the artificial aquifer fig 4 shows the complete structure of the artificial aquifer with all the described components on the left the aquifer container k can be seen it is connected to the 222rn source l and to the rtm 2100 n measurement tool for 222rn in water m to start it the upper part was filled with approximately 100 l of water using a hose connected to a public water supply after this initial charge the rtm began the measuring process in the artificial aquifer and 42 days later the value of 222rn in the aquifer water reached equilibrium and the rtm measurements showed values of around 2 5 106 bq m 3 2 4 1 transfer factor calculation this factor is necessary to convert the values of radon in air bq m 3 of the rtm 2100 to the values of radon in water bq l 1 to calculate this factor 29 water samples were taken and measured with the lsc triathler while the measurements provided by the rtm were being recorded in the meantime the relationship between the rtm readings and the lsc t f was obtained after applying a linear adjustment of type y a x the t f factor which is the slope obtained from this linear adjustment allows the rtm 2100 readings expressed in bq m 3 to be converted into bq l 1 via eq 1 1 c r n l s c t f c r n r t m t f 1 98 0 01 10 4 b q l 1 b q m 3 2 5 mathematical models the mathematical models used in this study can explain the variation experienced by the concentration of 222rn in the aquifer during the recharge and discharge processes that take place continuously there are two models that are applied in the possible states of the aquifer saínz et al 2016 2 5 1 closed compartment model ccm this model attempts to explain the variation in the concentration of 222rn over time when the aquifer has no external water supply i e when it maintains a constant volume the differential equation that explains this situation is eq 2 kowalczk et al 2010 sainz et al 2016 2 d c d t φ λ c solving this differential equation allows the dynamics of the 222rn concentration in water in a ccm to be determined 3 c t c 0 e λ t φ λ 1 e λ t to understand the terms of eq 3 it is necessary to look at eqs 4 and 5 4 φ e s v 5 λ λ r n λ v where i c t is the 222rn concentration in water over time bq l 1 ii c 0 is the initial 222rn concentration in water bq l 1 iii λ is the constant that adds the λ rn and the λ v h 1 iv λ rn is the 222rn decay constant 7 55 10 3 h 1 λ rn ln 2 t 1 2 laboratoire national henri becquerel 2018 v λ v is the constant that reflects 222rn loss at the water air interface per unit time h 1 vi t is time h vii φ is the radon emission rate for the aquifer source bq l 1 h 1 viii e is the 222rn exhalation for the aquifer source bq h 1 m 2 ix s is the exhalation surface of the aquifer source m2 x v is the volume of water l 2 5 2 open compartment model ocm the need to model aquifers that have external water contributions with different 222rn concentrations leads to adapting the previous model ccm to the open compartment model ocm this new model assumes the previous terms except for the addition of a new exchange term the differential equation that expresses this mathematical model is kowalczk et al 2010 sainz et al 2016 6 d c d t φ λ c λ i c c solving this differential equation allows the dynamics of the 222rn concentration in water in an ocm to be determined 7 c t c 0 e λ t d λ 1 e λ t to understand the terms of eq 7 it is necessary to look at eqs 8 10 8 d φ λ i c 9 λ λ λ i 10 λ i v r v a t r where i λ is a term that results from adding the λ calculated in the ccm and the λ i of the volume exchange h 1 ii d is a term that adds the radon emission rate of the aquifer source and the radon concentration in recharge water multiplied by λ i bq l 1 h 1 iii λ i is the constant that reflects the exchange of volume of water per unit time h 1 iv c is the 222rn concentration of the recharge water bq l 1 v v r is the volume of water used in the recharge l vi v a is the volume of the aquifer l the aim of this mathematical model is to determine the concentration of 222rn in the recharge water of the aquifer which is determined by c 2 6 simulations of recharge and discharge episodes in the artificial aquifer every simulation performed in this study has two parts a recharge episode together with a discharge episode in order not to exceed the total volume of the artificial aquifer around 100 l water discharges in this research simulate those of any aquifer to a river sea or other nearby aquifer the water discharged in the simulations was taken from the aquifer container tap and its volume was then measured likewise the volumes of water used in the recharge episodes were measured both in the simulations with rainwater in which water from the public supply free of 222rn was used and in the simulations with groundwater in which enriched water sourced from the cooling box was used table 1 shows the 11 simulations carried out and their specifications fig 5 shows the general graph with the 11 discharge and recharge simulations carried out during the 15 months that the artificial aquifer was being studied the line represents the 222rn concentration in bq l 1 measured by rtm 2100 after applying the t f calculated from eq 1 3 results fig 6 shows simulation 2 where the adjustment with ocm is made after the recharge with water from a public supply it was observed that the concentration of 222rn in the water decreases for 7 8 h and begins to increase again until reaching equilibrium after 250 300 h this increase can be seen in fig 7 where it begins to reach equilibrium at 250 h applying the adjustment with ccm to the represented data these adjustments ocm and ccm made to simulation 2 have been applied to the 11 episodes and the results of the adjustments are presented in table 2 table 2 shows all the parameters of interest affected by applying the ccm and ocm mathematical models to the 11 recharge and discharge simulations performed in the artificial aquifer table 3 meanwhile shows λ i eq 9 λv eq 5 222rn concentration measured with lsc c r and 222rn concentration estimated with the model for the recharge water c as can be seen in the results of table 3 simulations 2 3 and 4 with water from a public supply and simulating the recharge of the aquifer with rainwater 222rn free returned 222rn concentrations in the recharge water c higher than the real concentrations c r measured with lsc these results indicate that although the model fits very well the values of r2 are very close to unity it does not allow c to be correctly determined in the conditions of trials 2 3 and 4 simulations 5 6 and 7 were carried out with water rich in 222rn which simulate the recharge of the aquifer with groundwater and returned a higher value of c than the aquifer water indicating that the recharge was carried out with deep waters rich in 222rn however the c values obtained in these three cases 696 31 673 30 812 38 bq l 1 are lower than c r 2109 88 1805 76 2191 91 bq l 1 the value of c 106 17 bq l 1 obtained with the model for the conditions of simulation 8 gives a better value than those obtained with the previous simulations although it is still far from c r the value of c 1924 124 bq l 1 obtained in simulation 9 is much higher than the concentration of the aquifer clearly indicating that the recharge has occurred with groundwater which is rich in 222rn however this value of c is far from c r 3340 136 bq l 1 simulation 10 has provided a much better value of c 62 23 bq l 1 than the previous cases and is quite close to the value for public water 2 bq l 1 the result of c 2020 149 bq l 1 in case 11 simulating a recharge with 222rn rich groundwater at constant volume of the aquifer is still far from the real value c r used during the recharge 3313 135 bq l 1 nevertheless it improves on the results of the previous simulations 4 discussion a series of 11 recharge discharge episodes in an artificial aquifer with 222rn in water have been simulated in the laboratory reproducing natural processes such as recharge episodes with rainwater where the 222rn concentration in water is lower than 2 bq l 1 or with water from other aquifers where the 222rn concentrations are high in these simulations volumes and times and therefore flows have been modified both in the recharge and discharge processes in order to analyse the behaviour of the closed compartment model ccm and the open compartment model ocm after applying the mathematical model to the 11 episodes which were studied we consider that for the ocm adjustment processes 7 8 h of data after finishing the recharge process is sufficient to obtain good results when ccm adjustments are made more data is needed to reach equilibrium in this study between 250 and 300 h were needed the adjustments made to the experimental values which were obtained in the simulated aquifer regarding the ccm and the ocm show very good r squared values and are close to the unit the results of the model for the 222rn concentration in the recharge water c in the various recharge discharge simulations which were carried out in the artificial aquifer provide different values from those expected this situation happens when the volume of the artificial aquifer does not remain constant simulations 2 to 9 i e when the recharge discharge episodes are not simultaneous and have different flows despite these values the results allow us to determine the origin of the water used in the recharge episodes indicating whether water with a higher or lower 222rn concentration is present in the aquifer that has been used in the same way the results obtained in simulations 10 and 11 by the model in the artificial aquifer when the recharge discharge episodes are carried out simultaneously and progressively constant volume which is a similar situation to the real case of las caldas spa saínz et al 2016 are reasonably adjusted to the expected values 5 conclusions the results of this study together with previous ones saínz et al 2016 indicate that this mathematical model ccm and ocm can be used when the volume of the aquifer is constant when the recharge flow is similar to the discharge flow the validation of the model carried out in this study with continuous measurements of 222rn in water will allow the concentration of 222rn in water to be used as a tracer to determine the origin and volume of water that feeds real aquifers such as thermal spas facilities where the water volumes are kept constant a future mathematical study will be necessary to adapt this model to variable volumes of water in order to use it in all types of aquifers but for now this model at least permits to identify the origin of the water that reaches any type of aquifer in any case the continuous monitoring of 222rn in water used in this study with an rtm 2100 with a specific continuous measurement system allows us to identify any change in the aquifer conditions in real time if necessary

public supply inside a glass bowl containing soil rich in 226ra 745 20 kbq kg 1 was placed and sealed with an elastic silicone lid in order to diffuse 222rn easily into the water 2 3 sample collection water sampling in the artificial aquifer was carried out through the tap with each sample collected in 100 ml beakers the process consisted of putting the tap next to the beaker and taking 29 samples with a small flow of water the aim was to avoid bubbles and splashes that could cause leaks of the content with 222rn and to measure them in the lsc in order to calculate the transfer factor t f 2 4 starting the artificial aquifer fig 4 shows the complete structure of the artificial aquifer with all the described components on the left the aquifer container k can be seen it is connected to the 222rn source l and to the rtm 2100 n measurement tool for 222rn in water m to start it the upper part was filled with approximately 100 l of water using a hose connected to a public water supply after this initial charge the rtm began the measuring process in the artificial aquifer and 42 days later the value of 222rn in the aquifer water reached equilibrium and the rtm measurements showed values of around 2 5 106 bq m 3 2 4 1 transfer factor calculation this factor is necessary to convert the values of radon in air bq m 3 of the rtm 2100 to the values of radon in water bq l 1 to calculate this factor 29 water samples were taken and measured with the lsc triathler while the measurements provided by the rtm were being recorded in the meantime the relationship between the rtm readings and the lsc t f was obtained after applying a linear adjustment of type y a x the t f factor which is the slope obtained from this linear adjustment allows the rtm 2100 readings expressed in bq m 3 to be converted into bq l 1 via eq 1 1 c r n l s c t f c r n r t m t f 1 98 0 01 10 4 b q l 1 b q m 3 2 5 mathematical models the mathematical models used in this study can explain the variation experienced by the concentration of 222rn in the aquifer during the recharge and discharge processes that take place continuously there are two models that are applied in the possible states of the aquifer saínz et al 2016 2 5 1 closed compartment model ccm this model attempts to explain the variation in the concentration of 222rn over time when the aquifer has no external water supply i e when it maintains a constant volume the differential equation that explains this situation is eq 2 kowalczk et al 2010 sainz et al 2016 2 d c d t φ λ c solving this differential equation allows the dynamics of the 222rn concentration in water in a ccm to be determined 3 c t c 0 e λ t φ λ 1 e λ t to understand the terms of eq 3 it is necessary to look at eqs 4 and 5 4 φ e s v 5 λ λ r n λ v where i c t is the 222rn concentration in water over time bq l 1 ii c 0 is the initial 222rn concentration in water bq l 1 iii λ is the constant that adds the λ rn and the λ v h 1 iv λ rn is the 222rn decay constant 7 55 10 3 h 1 λ rn ln 2 t 1 2 laboratoire national henri becquerel 2018 v λ v is the constant that reflects 222rn loss at the water air interface per unit time h 1 vi t is time h vii φ is the radon emission rate for the aquifer source bq l 1 h 1 viii e is the 222rn exhalation for the aquifer source bq h 1 m 2 ix s is the exhalation surface of the aquifer source m2 x v is the volume of water l 2 5 2 open compartment model ocm the need to model aquifers that have external water contributions with different 222rn concentrations leads to adapting the previous model ccm to the open compartment model ocm this new model assumes the previous terms except for the addition of a new exchange term the differential equation that expresses this mathematical model is kowalczk et al 2010 sainz et al 2016 6 d c d t φ λ c λ i c c solving this differential equation allows the dynamics of the 222rn concentration in water in an ocm to be determined 7 c t c 0 e λ t d λ 1 e λ t to understand the terms of eq 7 it is necessary to look at eqs 8 10 8 d φ λ i c 9 λ λ λ i 10 λ i v r v a t r where i λ is a term that results from adding the λ calculated in the ccm and the λ i of the volume exchange h 1 ii d is a term that adds the radon emission rate of the aquifer source and the radon concentration in recharge water multiplied by λ i bq l 1 h 1 iii λ i is the constant that reflects the exchange of volume of water per unit time h 1 iv c is the 222rn concentration of the recharge water bq l 1 v v r is the volume of water used in the recharge l vi v a is the volume of the aquifer l the aim of this mathematical model is to determine the concentration of 222rn in the recharge water of the aquifer which is determined by c 2 6 simulations of recharge and discharge episodes in the artificial aquifer every simulation performed in this study has two parts a recharge episode together with a discharge episode in order not to exceed the total volume of the artificial aquifer around 100 l water discharges in this research simulate those of any aquifer to a river sea or other nearby aquifer the water discharged in the simulations was taken from the aquifer container tap and its volume was then measured likewise the volumes of water used in the recharge episodes were measured both in the simulations with rainwater in which water from the public supply free of 222rn was used and in the simulations with groundwater in which enriched water sourced from the cooling box was used table 1 shows the 11 simulations carried out and their specifications fig 5 shows the general graph with the 11 discharge and recharge simulations carried out during the 15 months that the artificial aquifer was being studied the line represents the 222rn concentration in bq l 1 measured by rtm 2100 after applying the t f calculated from eq 1 3 results fig 6 shows simulation 2 where the adjustment with ocm is made after the recharge with water from a public supply it was observed that the concentration of 222rn in the water decreases for 7 8 h and begins to increase again until reaching equilibrium after 250 300 h this increase can be seen in fig 7 where it begins to reach equilibrium at 250 h applying the adjustment with ccm to the represented data these adjustments ocm and ccm made to simulation 2 have been applied to the 11 episodes and the results of the adjustments are presented in table 2 table 2 shows all the parameters of interest affected by applying the ccm and ocm mathematical models to the 11 recharge and discharge simulations performed in the artificial aquifer table 3 meanwhile shows λ i eq 9 λv eq 5 222rn concentration measured with lsc c r and 222rn concentration estimated with the model for the recharge water c as can be seen in the results of table 3 simulations 2 3 and 4 with water from a public supply and simulating the recharge of the aquifer with rainwater 222rn free returned 222rn concentrations in the recharge water c higher than the real concentrations c r measured with lsc these results indicate that although the model fits very well the values of r2 are very close to unity it does not allow c to be correctly determined in the conditions of trials 2 3 and 4 simulations 5 6 and 7 were carried out with water rich in 222rn which simulate the recharge of the aquifer with groundwater and returned a higher value of c than the aquifer water indicating that the recharge was carried out with deep waters rich in 222rn however the c values obtained in these three cases 696 31 673 30 812 38 bq l 1 are lower than c r 2109 88 1805 76 2191 91 bq l 1 the value of c 106 17 bq l 1 obtained with the model for the conditions of simulation 8 gives a better value than those obtained with the previous simulations although it is still far from c r the value of c 1924 124 bq l 1 obtained in simulation 9 is much higher than the concentration of the aquifer clearly indicating that the recharge has occurred with groundwater which is rich in 222rn however this value of c is far from c r 3340 136 bq l 1 simulation 10 has provided a much better value of c 62 23 bq l 1 than the previous cases and is quite close to the value for public water 2 bq l 1 the result of c 2020 149 bq l 1 in case 11 simulating a recharge with 222rn rich groundwater at constant volume of the aquifer is still far from the real value c r used during the recharge 3313 135 bq l 1 nevertheless it improves on the results of the previous simulations 4 discussion a series of 11 recharge discharge episodes in an artificial aquifer with 222rn in water have been simulated in the laboratory reproducing natural processes such as recharge episodes with rainwater where the 222rn concentration in water is lower than 2 bq l 1 or with water from other aquifers where the 222rn concentrations are high in these simulations volumes and times and therefore flows have been modified both in the recharge and discharge processes in order to analyse the behaviour of the closed compartment model ccm and the open compartment model ocm after applying the mathematical model to the 11 episodes which were studied we consider that for the ocm adjustment processes 7 8 h of data after finishing the recharge process is sufficient to obtain good results when ccm adjustments are made more data is needed to reach equilibrium in this study between 250 and 300 h were needed the adjustments made to the experimental values which were obtained in the simulated aquifer regarding the ccm and the ocm show very good r squared values and are close to the unit the results of the model for the 222rn concentration in the recharge water c in the various recharge discharge simulations which were carried out in the artificial aquifer provide different values from those expected this situation happens when the volume of the artificial aquifer does not remain constant simulations 2 to 9 i e when the recharge discharge episodes are not simultaneous and have different flows despite these values the results allow us to determine the origin of the water used in the recharge episodes indicating whether water with a higher or lower 222rn concentration is present in the aquifer that has been used in the same way the results obtained in simulations 10 and 11 by the model in the artificial aquifer when the recharge discharge episodes are carried out simultaneously and progressively constant volume which is a similar situation to the real case of las caldas spa saínz et al 2016 are reasonably adjusted to the expected values 5 conclusions the results of this study together with previous ones saínz et al 2016 indicate that this mathematical model ccm and ocm can be used when the volume of the aquifer is constant when the recharge flow is similar to the discharge flow the validation of the model carried out in this study with continuous measurements of 222rn in water will allow the concentration of 222rn in water to be used as a tracer to determine the origin and volume of water that feeds real aquifers such as thermal spas facilities where the water volumes are kept constant a future mathematical study will be necessary to adapt this model to variable volumes of water in order to use it in all types of aquifers but for now this model at least permits to identify the origin of the water that reaches any type of aquifer in any case the continuous monitoring of 222rn in water used in this study with an rtm 2100 with a specific continuous measurement system allows us to identify any change in the aquifer conditions in real time if necessary

11846,this work report results of experimental studies on concurrent removal of co existing fe ii as v and fluoride ions from groundwater by electrocoagulation ec experimental studies were completed to explore the impact of initial ph current density initial ion concentration stirring speed salt dose and electrode spacing on removing co existing as v fe ii and fluoride ions experimental results infer that contaminated groundwater containing 400 μg l of as v 20 mg l of fe ii and 10 mg l fluoride ions may be treated by ec using a current density of 0 432 ma cm2 salt dosage of 0 30 g l initial ph of 7 and stirring speed of 200 rpm within 60 min various other water quality parameters like residual tds sulfate ions nitrate ions chloride phosphate ions hardness turbidity and alkalinity during the ec process were found to vary at different operating conditions experimental analysis shows that the presence of co existing fe ii as v and fluoride ions in the water improve the removal efficiency of pollutant ions kinetic analysis showed that the removal of arsenic iron and fluoride ions followed the apparent first order model edax investigation of the sludge endorses the entrapment of fluoride fe as along with other ions like ca na cl al etc by the metal hydroxide flocs graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater arsenic fluoride iron aluminium electrode electrocoagulation 1 introduction human exposure to naturally existing dissolved contaminants ions in groundwater and surface water has been identified as the world s biggest mass poisoning in human history biswas et al 2012 ahmad and bhattacharya 2019 in the subsequent years the occurrence of toxic contaminants ions of arsenic fluoride iron along with many co existing ions like nitrate sulfate etc has been reported in various parts of the world chakraborti et al 2011 bhattacharya et al 2020 dhadge et al 2018 chronic poisoning due to prolonged exposure to arsenic fluoride and iron through drinking water and other dietary components has been a global issue in recent years kumar et al 2017 bundschuh et al 2017 ahmad et al 2017 such water contamination occurs mainly due to the release of untreated industrial wastewater into the river streams toxic chemicals in various activities and similar other human activities bhattacharya et al 2007a 2007b sometimes natural reasons like erosion and weathering of mineral bearing rocks also add these contaminants to groundwater maity et al 2021 most of the population in india bangladesh pakistan greece romania croatia argentina bolivia chille are highly affected by arsenic contamination ahmad et al 2020a 2020b bandaru et al 2020 herrera et al 2020 as per the estimation from the recent global models 94 220 million people are potentially exposed to naturally occurring arsenic as in groundwater used for drinking consumption of water with as v concentrations above who permissible limits of 10 μg l causes many health problems like keratosis of feet and hands cancer which may lead to the early death of humans das and nandi 2019b maity et al 2012 gustafsson and bhattacharya 2007 ahmad et al 2019 kapaj et al 2006 world health organization 2004 however many literatures suggests that prolonged consumption of as in drinking water even below the 10 μg l might have serious health consequences including increased internal cancer rates and diabetes generally the arsenic ion is found in groundwater as arsenite as iii or arsenate as v salt among which as v is known to be more carcinogenic das and nandi 2019b dhaneskaran and sahu 2021 pazhoor et al 2021 the existence of arsenic in groundwater in its oxy anions forms depends on the presence of other co existing ions in the water and the ph of the groundwater van genuchten and ahmad 2020 the presence of higher amounts ca and fe iii ions as co existing ions in groundwater at lower ph enhance the precipitation of the as v ions ahmad et al 2020a b dissolve oxygen do present in groundwater also effect the presence of co existing arsenic and iron ions as the do can oxidize fe ii to form fe iii oxyhydr oxide precipitates which have a strong arsenic sorption affinity ahmad et al 2020a annaduzzamana et al 2021a 2021b also do may act as an oxidant to groundwater initiate beneficial side reactions and notably oxidize as iii to as v so there is a major possibility of as v occurrence in groundwater fluoride ions have been detected in groundwater in many regions of the world tirkey et al 2018 due to excessive intake of fluoride laden drinking water around 65 of endemic fluorosis occurs globally severely damaging bones teeth and organs such as the kidneys lungs and nerves of the human body tirkey et al 2018 globally around 200 million persons consume fluoride contaminated groundwater with more than 1 5 mg l of fluoride tirkey et al 2018 as reported by who more than 25 countries worldwide including india are highly vulnerable to fluoride contamination in drinking water herrera et al 2020 more than 25 million people in india are affected by various diseases originating from heavy fluoride ions in groundwater across 20 states and union territories similarly iron contamination in groundwater is also a prevalent problem faced by indian people in day to day life ghosh et al 2008 though iron is classified as a secondary contaminant consumption of water with fe ii ions concentration above 0 3 mg l regularly causes iron overload on the human body indigestion as well as make water highly turbid change in colour aesthetic in taste and with odours das and nandi 2019a some locations of india have reported the presence of fe ii as v and fluoride ions above who limits chakraborti et al 2011 bhattacharya et al 2020 biswas et al 2014 ahmad et al 2019 reported the existence of arsenic in groundwater in its oxy anions forms depends on the presence of other co existing in the water and ph of the groundwater bandaru et al 2020 suggested that ec using fe electrode can be an effective method for arsenic removal as dissolved oxygen do can oxidize fe ii to form fe iii precipitates which have a strong arsenic sorption affinity genutchen et al 2020 reported that oxidation of groundwater initiates beneficial side reactions and leads to conversion of as iii to as v which is readily sorbed oxyanion researchers reported that simultaneous exposure of fe ii as v and fluoride ions adversely affect the human body compared to a single exposure of these pollutants dhadge et al 2018 silva et al 2018 bordoloi et al 2013 thakur and mondal 2017 chakraborti et al 2011 reported the occurrence of fluoride within the range of 0 14 17 mg l iron within 0 1 77 mg l and arsenic within 0 1 1219 μg l in various locations of north eastern and eastern india bhattacharya et al 2020 reported the occurrence of co existing fluoride arsenic and iron in groundwater of various locations in tripura india patolia and sinha 2017 reported excessive contamination of fluoride along with iron arsenic nitrate alkalinity sulfate etc in the groundwater of dhanbad india therefore there is increasing concern about finding cost effective water treatment processes to remove co existing as v fe ii and fluoride ions from groundwater merely very little research has been carried out on the removal of co existing as v fe ii and fluoride ions from water dhadge et al 2018 silva et al 2018 several methods have been reported for individual removal of fluoride iron and arsenic contamination from the water like adsorption tirkey et al 2018 chemical coagulation pazhoor et al 2021 oxidation bordoloi et al 2013 membrane filtration ahmad et al 2020b biological process maity et al 2021 and electrocoagulation thakur and mondal 2017 bandaru et al 2020 guzmán et al 2016 among these methods adsorption and coagulation are extensively used in water treatment plants however adsorption and coagulation methods have several disadvantages such as higher sensitivity to ph the generation of a higher amount of sludge and the requirement of chemicals which may also retain an unpleasant taste and odor in the treated water reverse osmosis requires highly skilled labour to operate as well as treatment time is more and very costly ion exchange methods require regular regeneration or replacement of costly resins along with skilled human resources electrocoagulation ec is nowadays considered a superior method for water treatment compared to other methods as it has numerous properties like modular design flexible operation and enticing advantages like low cost no additional requirement of chemicals lesser treatment time low maintenance cost which makes it favorable for sustainable implementation and operation in rural communities guzmán et al 2016 das and nandi 2018 titchou et al 2021 bandaru et al 2020 based on experimental results reported by previous work das and nandi 2019a 2019b ec is an efficient method for removing co existing pollutants in ec al oh 3 s flocs are released due to the electrolytic dissolution of aluminum anode based on the electrochemical reaction in reported literature das and nandi 2019a eqns 1 4

surface area as a result they can easily trap the pollutants present in water and finally precipitate and separate as sludge which is water insoluble in nature silva et al 2018 dhadge et al 2018 have studied the concurrent removal of arsenic iron and fluoride by ec and the influence of various operating conditions on its removal silva et al 2018 has reported the co existing removal of fluoride iron and arsenic and the impact of different operating conditions of ec they also reported that the presence of iron and fluoride considerably influence the removal of arsenic most of the work dhadge et al 2018 silva et al 2018 reported has conducted the experiments considering the higher range of arsenic iron and fluoride ion concentrations which are typically found in industrial wastewater generally such contaminates are found in the lower or medium range in groundwater as reported in the literature chakraborti et al 2011 bhattacharya et al 2020 bordoloi et al 2013 during ec other parameters that determine water quality like turbidity salinity tds sulfate nitrate chloride alkalinity hardness ph etc changes must be observed before water may be considered drinkable however no previous studies have been reported any comprehensive report on variations of all such water quality parameters in the ec treated water given that groundwater is polluted with individual ions of fe ii as v fluoride as well as other co existing ions in this study the suitability of the ec process on the removal of as v fe ii and fluoride ions was investigated the influence of different ec process parameters such as current density j ma cm 2 ph electrode spacing d cm salt dose c s g l stirring speed r rpm along with the individual effects of fe ii as v and fluoride ions on the overall removal of fe ii as v and ions were studied a kinetic study has been carried out for a comprehensive understanding of the importance of operating parameters on ec such a study will be beneficial in evaluating the influence of co existing ions present in groundwater on the removal efficiency of fluoride and fe ii and as v ions by ec 2 material and methods a 5 l glass beaker was used to perform ec experiments with 3 l of sample water using aluminium al plates as electrodes with an operative area of 116 cm2 length 0 073 m width 0 1 m thickness 0 001 m at room atmosphere 26 2 c to provide the necessary electric supply a dc power source 0 10 a 0 30 v model l6410s aplab was used magnetic stirrer model spint digital mc 02 tarson was used for continuous mixing of flocs produced and water during ec after each experiment the surface of the electrodes was cleaned using abrasive paper and follower by diluted hydrochloric acid and water wash to remove all the impurities the polarity of the electrode was reversed after each experiment to avoid extreme passivation in a single electrode plate the schematic diagram of the schematic diagram is shown in figure s1 the ternary mixture of fe ii as v and fluoride was prepared by dissolving the proper amount of analytical grade feso4 merck india naf fisher scientific india and na2haso4 7h2o loba chemicals india salts in groundwater collected through the motorized pump from iit ism dhanbad campus nacl salt was used to modify the conductivity of the groundwater as the natural conductivity of groundwater was not adequate to support the desirable conductivity necessary for pollutant ions removal to modify the initial ph 1 m hcl and 1 m naoh were added to the solution table s1 summarizes the concentration of various pollutants after the addition of different chemicals along with who approved drinking water quality parameters to study the effect of various operating parameters ec experiments were performed with wide ranges of values for each parameter to identify the best possible operating parameters individually by detailed systematic study represented in table s2 elaborately entire ec experiments were carried out for 60 min and repeated thrice for accuracy with 0 5 variations during the ec tests samples of 3 5 ml were withdrawn and analysed after filtration and separating the sludge using whatman 1 filter paper pore size 0 42 μm treated water was tested for conductivity turbidity salinity tds and ph of water by using turbidity meter model tn 100 thermo scientific and multiparameter kit model pc2700 eutech respectively after required calibration the concentration of fluoride ions in water was measured using an ion selective electrode for fluoride model eutech india the fe ii ions concentration was

model 7100 using respective standards the ec generated sludge s elemental composition was conducted by fesem edax analysis supra 55 monocl4 carl zeiss 3 results and discussions 3 1 influence of initial ph on fe ii as v and fluoride ions removal it is reported by chakraborti et al 2011 bhattacharya et al 2020 that the ph of contaminated groundwater mostly varied between the ranges of 6 8 ghosh et al 2008 reported that the ph of water immensely influence the removal efficiency of fe ii ion as fe ii ion is highly prone to oxidation in the presence of oxygen and ph below 6 according to the reaction as follows 5 f e 2 1 4 o 2 h f e 3 1 2 h 2 o as a result of the preceding process fe2 ions are transformed to fe3 and stable compounds are produced considering all the above aspects in the present work ph was varied from 5 to 9 fig 1 a depicts the influence of initial ph on the removal of as v ions from water it is noticed from fig 1a that residual as v ions reduced with the rise in ph from 5 to 7 no significant variation of residual as v ion was observed above ph 7 similar tendencies were also seen in the case of fe ii ion fig 1b and fluoride ion fig 1c removal residual as v concentration after 60 min of ec for initial ph of 5 6 7 8 and 9 were 8 2 4 5 0 1 9 8 and 14 2 μg l respectively similarly residual fe ii ion and fluoride ion concentrations for ph of 5 6 7 8 and 9 were 6 52 5 02 0 29 8 01 and 8 92 mg l and 3 2 4 6 0 98 5 4 and 5 8 mg l post 60 min of operation a significant upsurge in the removal rate of as v ion with the increase in ph from 5 to 7 was due to faster charge neutralization above ph 7 al oh 3 s flocs become stable and insoluble das and nandi 2019b such insoluble flocs get separated from the solution and reduce the probability for ionic diffusion of pollutant ions in coagulant das and nandi 2020 as a result decrease in fe ii as v and fluoride ions removal were observed above ph 7 table s3 shows the residual values of turbidity ph and other parameters from table s3 it was seen that values of all the parameters were minimum at ph 7 and within who permissible limits table 1 however the final value of ph i e after 60 min of ec was found to slightly increase in the range of 7 27 7 42 such an increase in ph after ec experiment can be explained by the generation of hydroxide anions during the process variations of residual values of all the parameters between 5 and 9 were due to variation in metal hydroxide flocs generation and its adsorption and entrapping capacity of the ions at various ph due to its solubility difference at various ph as the maximum removal for all the pollutants occurred at ph 7 it was considered as ideal ph for all the remaining experiments 3 2 influence of stirring speed on fe ii as v and fluoride ions removal fig s2a c shows the variation in residual concentration of fe ii as v and fluoride ions for different stirring speed r of 150 200 and 300 rpm it is seen from fig s2a c that stirring speed has significant impacts on fe ii as v and fluoride ions removal residual concentration of fe ii and fluoride ions for stirring speed of 150 200 and 300 rpm were 6 54 0 32 7 56 mg l and 1 23 0 98 2 1 mg l after 60 min of ec respectively it is observed from fig s2b and s2c that the residual concentration for fe ii and fluoride ions do not attain the who permissible limit for the lower stirring speed of 150 rpm and extremely higher agitating speed of 300 rpm as v ions removal varied with stirring speed during the initial 50 min and later all speeds showed the same ion removal the highest ion removal was observed at 200 rpm for all three contaminants such variations in pollutant ion removal can be explained by the fact that at a very lower stirring speed the contact of the contaminant ions and hydroxide flocs becomes inadequate which slows down the removal reaction at extremely high stirring speed pollutant ions and flocs rotated along with solution without desirable interactions as a result ion removal efficiency reduced das and nandi 2020 maximum removal of all the three contaminants was found at moderate stirring of 200 rpm it was used in remaining all the experiments 3 3 influence of salt dose on fe ii as v and fluoride ions removal electrolyte concentration salt dose or conductivity affects the cell voltage and consumption of energy amid the ec process silva et al 2018 in the present work the nacl dose was varied from 0 30 to 0 80 g l with corresponding electrical conductivity of solution varying from 650 to 1100 μs cm fig 2 a c shows the variation in residual concentration of fe ii as v and fluoride ions at various nacl cs concentrations it is seen from fig 2a c that with the increment in cs fe ii as v and fluoride ions removal increases slightly residual fe ii ions concentration decreased from 0 29 to 0 12 mg l and residual fluoride ions concentration decreased from 0 98 to 0 54 mg l when c s raised from 0 30 to 0 80 g l lower cs were enough for as v ions to reduce its concentration below 10 μg l an increase in pollutant ion removal with nacl dose was due to higher electrode dissolution at greater solution due to better electron transport which enhances the capture of the pollutant ions by the flocs table s4 summarizes the residual values of turbidity tds and other parameters after 60 min of ec for different cs from table s4 it is seen that with the increase in cs from 0 30 to 0 80 g l the final turbidity of the treated water slightly increases from 0 91 to 0 98 ntu conductivity increases drastically from 280 to 338 μs cm tds increases from 119 to 227 mg l and salinity increases from 121 to 212 mg l the residual chloride ion concentration was observed to increase slightly from 0 14 to 0 34 mg l alkalinity and hardness were also found to increase with the increase in ions originating from higher nacl dose with the increase in chloride ions in feed water the rate of chlorine gas generation increased nandi and patel 2014 as a result residual chloride ion concentration does not increase significantly with salt dose such observations infer that the addition of higher amounts of salt up to 0 80 g l does not significantly modify residual water quality addition of an excessive amount of nacl not only increases the cost of the treatment but also degrades the water quality considering the additional cost of nacl addition as well as a minor increase in pollutant ions removal ability lower dose of salt concentration 0 30 g l was utilized in all ec tests 3 4 influence of current density on fe ii as v and fluoride ions removal current density j were varied from 0 431 ma cm2 to 6 466 ma cm2 0 05 0 75 a to assess its impact on fe ii as v and fluoride ions removal and the results are depicted in fig 3 a c fig 3a illustrates that residual as v ion concentration after 60 min of ec was below 10 μg l for all j values for j above 0 862 ma cm2 99 98 as v ion removal was seen within 15 min of ec it is noticed from fig 3b that final fe ii ion concentration varied from 0 29 to 0 004 mg l as j increased from 0 431 ma cm2 to 6 466 ma cm2 the permissible limit of residual fe ii ions 0 3 mg l was attained within 50 min ec for j of 0 432 ma cm2 for higher j of 6 466 ma cm2 it takes less time than 30 min to reduce below 0 33 mg l from fig 3c it was found that residual fluoride ion concentration varied from 0 98 to 0 08 mg l as j increases from 0 431 ma cm2 to 6 466 ma cm2 permissible limits of 1 5 mg l fluoride arrived after 60 min for j of 0 432 ma cm2 and within 30 min for higher j of 6 466 ma cm2 it can be observed that any increase in j above 2 15 ma cm2 does not influence the removal rate of the ions significantly such phenomena can be explained by the fact that at very high j pollutant ions present in solution become limiting reactants compared to available generated coagulants in excess such conditions during ec are extremely undesirable as an increase in electrode material and energy consumption does not improve pollutant removal it was observed that individual pollutant ion removal during ec was apparently following the first order kinetic model as follows das and nandi 2020 6 l n c o c k t where c 0 and c specifies the pollutant ions concentrations of initial and at time t min respectively k denotes the rate constant from fig s3a c it can be observed that as v fe ii and fluoride ions removal follows the first order model at different current densities from all the figures it can be observed that ion removal followed the first order kinetic model obtained values of rate constant k min 1 for all the pollutant ions at various current densities are summarized in table s5 from table s5 it was noticed that with an increase in current density from 0 432 to 6 466 ma cm2 as v ion removal rate k increased from 0 1373 to 0 1808 min 1 for fe ii ions k increased from 0 0582 to 0 1562 min 1 and fluoride ions k increased from 0 0307 to 0 0792 min 1 such increase in k with current density was due to faster flocs a l o h 3 generation at higher current density and thus the entrapment of ions occurs at a faster speed and increases the removal rate table 1 summarizes the residual values of turbidity tds and other parameters after 60 min of ec for different j it is seen that from table 1 turbidity conductivity tds salinity and ph values also alter during ec the removal of additional metal ions anions and soluble elements by the coagulation process resulted in a reduction in turbidity conductivity tds and salinity as j increased the increase in oh ions in the solution causes a little rise in the ph of the solution the concentration of al was found to exceed the permissible limit and increase in the treated water due to higher anodic dissolution at higher current density sulfate nitrate phosphate chloride alkalinity and hardness were found within the permissible limit for all current densities since desirable removal of as v fe ii and fluoride ions was achieved at the lowest j of 0 432 ma cm2 after 60 min of ec and all the parameters were within who permissible limits table s1 the current density of 0 432 ma cm2 was used in further experiments experimental results obtained in the present work were compared with some of the results reported in the literature dhadge et al 2018 investigated the simultaneous removal of fluoride iron and arsenic from synthetic water using 10 l of water containing 10 mg l of fluoride 25 mg l of fe ii and 200 μg l of as v ions using aluminium electrode at a current density of 62 5 ma cm2 and conductivity of 340 μs cm they reported 93 2 98 74 and 95 65 removal of fluoride fe ii and as v ions after 45 min of ec silva et al 2018 reported carried out experimental studies on the effect of co existing 20 mg l of fe ii 10 mg l of fluoride and 300 μg l of as v ions on its removal efficiency using 3 l of water they reported complete removal of all contaminants in 60 min of ec at a current density of 1 25 ma cm2 and conductivity of 345 μs cm using aluminum electrode in this context the present study shows that a lower current density of 0 432 ma cm2 can be used to achieve who approved water quality within 60 min of ec from a ternary mixture of 10 mg l of fluoride 20 mg l of fe ii and 400 μg l of as v by using 3 l of working volume if the conductivity is modified up to 650 μs cm hence for cost effective removal of various ions use of a higher volume of water should be used to make ec a less energy consuming process 3 5 influence of electrode spacing on as v fe ii and fluoride ions removal electrode spacing d was varied from 1 cm to 2 5 cm to assess its impact on fe ii as v and fluoride ions removal and results are demonstrated in fig 4 a c it is noticed from fig 4a that residual as v ion concentration as v was below 10 μg l at all d values residual fe ii ions increase from 0 32 to 1 89 mg l fig 4b and residual fluoride ions increase from 0 98 to 3 28 mg l fig 4c with an increase in d from 1 cm to 2 5 cm the residual concentration of fe ii and fluoride ion for higher d values above 1 cm did not attain the who permissible limit due to insufficient removal of these ions an increase in residual fe ii and fluoride ions with an increase in d can be interpreted by the reason that with an increase in d interactions between al3 ions and oh ions generated from electrodes get delayed and as a result the overall rate of flocs generation decreases hence the interaction between the produced flocs and the as v fe ii and fluoride ions slows down and finally the rate of fe ii and fluoride ion entrapment decreases overall the removal of as v ions was faster compared to other ions due to the higher absorption capacity of as v ions in aluminum hydroxide flocs silva et al 2018 and also to the fe iii flocs generated from fe ii oxidation table s6 summarizes the residual values of turbidity tds and other parameters after 60 min of ec for varying d it is noticed from table s6 that with the increase in d from 1 to 2 5 cm the residual value of conductivity increases from 280 to 315 μs cm turbidity from 0 91 to 1 91 ntu salinity from 121 to 140 after 60 min of ec process while ph was within 7 18 0 1 the removal efficiency of alkalinity hardness chloride phosphate nitrates and sulfate was found to decrease slightly with electrode spacing such an increase in tds turbidity conductivity salinity with d was due to the slower removal of pollutant ions by the coagulation process since desirable removal efficiency within the permissible limit of all the three contaminants was achieved at the lowest d of 1 cm a minimal d of 1 cm was used for all the further experiments 3 6 influence of fe ii ions on as v and fluoride ions removal to identify the impact of fe ii ions on the removal of co existing as v and fluoride ions fe ii ion concentration was considered within 0 60 mg l keeping the initial as v and fluoride concentration constant fig 5 a b shows the variation in residual as v and fluoride ions concentration with varying fe ii ions concentrations of 0 20 40 60 mg l it is seen from fig 5a that the removal efficiency of as v increases as the fe ii ions concentration is increased residual concentration of as v decreases to 5 2 μg l when fe ii is not present in the mixture within 10 min after ec the residual as v concentration dropped to 3 2 g l as the fe ii ion concentration increased from 20 to 60 mg l according to the experimental data the removal effectiveness of as v nearly approaches 100 percent in the first 30 min of the ec treatment a subsequent generation of aluminum hydroxide precipitates due to the presence of fe ii ions in the solution which increases the total amount of adsorbent material in the bulk solution and removes or traps the as v ions by adsorption also the continuous in situ formation of hydrous ferric oxide flocs during the process and the favorable lower ph i e 7 provides higher sorption capacities for the as v ions in the solution and likely contributed to the improved performance in the removal rate the low ph and dissolved oxygen concentration in the system limited the rapid oxidation of fe2 and facilitated more as v removal annaduzzamana et al 2021a annaduzzamana et al 2021b therefore the removal rate of as v ions increases in the presence of fe ii ions during ec similar result patterns are also observed in fig 5b for the removal of fluoride ions in the presence of a different concentration of fe ii ions residual fluoride concentration after 60 min of ec was 2 8 0 98 0 91 and 0 70 mg l for different fe ii concentration of 0 20 40 and 60 mg l such an increase in fluoride ion removal with an increase in fe ii ion was due to adsorption of fluoride ions by fe oh 3 flocs generated by fe ii ions these freshly produced fe oh 3 flocs entrap as v and fluoride ions by sweep coagulation silva et al 2018 as a consequence overall as v and fluoride ions removal increases furthermore experimental data show that the presence of fe ii ions promotes fluoride elimination during ec besides the formation of iron hydroxides occurs along with al oh 3 flocs as a result in an increase in ph which adds the quantity of flocs in the bulk solution and promotes the removal rate of fluoride 3 7 influence of fluoride ions on as v and fe ii ions removal to evaluate the impact of fluoride ions on the removal of as v and fe ii ions different concentrations of fluoride within the range of 0 20 mg l keeping as v and fe ii ions concentration constant fig 6 a shows the variation of as v ions at various concentrations of fluoride ions with fe ii ion dose of 20 mg l it is noticed from fig 6a that the removal efficiency of as v increases as the fluoride concentration increases as v ion removal rate was lower in the absence of fluoride ions as the fluoride concentration increases to 20 mg l as v removal rate improves and residual concentration of as v decreases to 0 1 μg l within 20 min of ec the experiments revealed that the replacement of oh groups by f on aluminium flocs improves their ability to absorb arsenic das and nandi 2020 a similar effect is seen in fig 6b for the elimination of fe ii ions while varying the fluoride ion concentrations from fig 6b it is observed that residual fe ii ions concentration decreases from 1 213 0 29 0 265 and 0 117 mg l as the fluoride ion concentration increases in the solution from 0 10 15 and 20 mg l respectively such results can be explained by considering the removal mechanism of fluoride by ec dhadge et al 2018 during fluoride removal by ec fluoride ions present in the solution are substituted by the hydroxide groups of the aluminum hydroxide flocs generated and release oh ions to the solution das and nandi 2019b for higher fluoride concentration more oh ions are retained in the solution as a faster reaction rate of fluoride such increase in ph of the solution prompts higher production of iron hydroxide flocs which can readily trap other ions present in solution and hence as v and fe ii ion removal increased experimental results suggest that the removal efficiency of fe ii ions significantly increases with the increase in initial fluoride concentration such trends in results can be explained in a better way by looking into the removal mechanism of fluoride during ec the fluoride anion from the solution substitutes the hydroxide groups available in the al oh 3 flocs as per the following equation silva et al 2018 7 a l o h 3 s y f a q a l o h 3 y f y s y o h during fluoride removal a generous amount of oh is produced and released into the solution which becomes immoderate with a higher initial concentration of fluoride this prompts an increase in the ph of the solution during the ec experiments and leads to the formation of a higher amount of iron hydroxide precipitates which can be easily eliminated by filtration as a result the addition of fluoride accelerates the amount of removal of fe ii ions 3 8 influence of as v ions on fe ii and fluoride ions removal to evaluate the impact of arsenic on fe ii and fluoride ions removal different concentrations of as v within the range of 0 400 μg l were considered keeping the initial concentration of fe ii and fluoride constant fig 7 a shows the variation in residual fluoride concentration at various concentrations of as v ions with fe ii ions concentration of 20 mg l fig 7a illustrates that the removal efficiency of fluoride increased as the as v ions concentration increased fluoride ion removal rate was lower in the absence of as v ions as the as v concentration increased up to 400 μg l the fluoride removal rate improved residual fluoride concentration after 60 min of ec was 3 45 2 8 0 98 0 91 and 0 70 mg l for different as v ion concentration of 0 100 200 300 and 400 μg l respectively the presence of as v in the solution has little effect on the removal efficiency of fe ii ions but this influence lowers the operation time required to reach the acceptable limit at ph 7 or near to it as v ion exists in its negative form i e haso4 2 which is predominating in nature and can be readily adsorbed by al oh 3 s and al2o3 s flocs silva et al 2018 8 a l o h 3 s h a s o 4 2 a l o h 3 h a s o 4 2 9 a l 2 o 3 s h a s o 4 2 a l 2 o 3 s h a s o 4 2 both the as v and fe ii ions are captured by the al oh 3 flocs during the early phases of the ec process thus all these pollutants are eliminated by a complicated competing adsorptive mechanism that can be seen in the removal efficiency of fe ii ions with the addition of as v fig 7a however as the experiment advances the elimination of fe ii ions via hydroxides colloidal particles and precipitating will become more prevalent making the fe ii removal less influenced by the concentration of as v present similar trends were also observed in fig 7b for the removal of fe ii ions in the presence of a different concentration of as v ions from fig 7b it is noticed that residual fe ii ions concentration decreased from 0 87 0 62 0 45 0 38 and 0 29 mg l as the as v ion concentration increased in the solution from 0 100 200 300 and 400 μg l respectively the increased adsorption capacity of al oh 3 flocs in the as f fe co existing system resulted in an improvement in the removal rate of fe ii and fluoride ions in the existence of as v ions liu et al 2015 in the presence of as v ions the formation of al f oh occurs rapidly such modified coagulant has more active adsorptive sites and enhances the removal of other species from the solution liu et al 2015 3 9 analysis of ec generated sludge figure s4a b shows the surface morphology of produced sludge and the edax spectrum it can be observed from figures s4a that the sludge is porous in nature edax spectra shown in figure s4b infer that sludge contains fluoride fe as along with na al ca si etc which explains the entrapment of the ions by the metal hydroxide flocs table s7 shows the detailed weight of all the elements detected in the sludge it is observed that almost 7 96 fluoride 0 99 fe 0 25 as 25 99 al were the major pollutants along with other ions like na 1 95 cl 1 17 ca 1 14 etc entrapped in the sludge which can be explained by the removal mechanism pattern during ec process by al oh 3 flocs as per eqn 3 nonetheless the composition of the sludge may vary subsequently to the source of the groundwater and the contaminants present in it such porous metal hydroxide sludge can be collected from several experiments as the amount obtained from a single experiment is not large and it can be utilized as adsorbents un et al 2017 4 conclusions the present study studied the simultaneous removal of co existing as v fe ii and fluoride ions from groundwater using electrocoagulation to achieve its concentration below who permissible limit during the experimental studies various operating parameters like initial ph current density salt dose stirring speed and initial concentration of ions were varied to analyze their impacts on as v fe ii and fluoride ions removal obtained results infer that to get drinkable water quality from contaminated water containing as v of 400 μg l fe ii of 20 mg l and fluoride of 10 mg l j of 0 432 ma cm2 cs of 0 30 g l initial ph of 7 d of 1 cm and r of 200 rpm are necessary it was observed ec based process could reduce other water impurities such as turbidity tds nitrate ions phosphate ions sulfate ions chloride alkalinity and hardness from groundwater simultaneously the presence of fe ii ions improved as v and fluoride ions removal due to faster reduction of as v to as iii ions similarly presence of fluoride ions improved the fe ii and as v ions removal due to increased al oh 3 flocs generation in water the presence of as v improved fe ii and fluoride removal due to improved adsorption capacity of al oh 3 flocs in the as f fe co existing system kinetic analysis showed that the removal of arsenic iron and fluoride ions followed the apparent first order model characterization of ec generated sludge confirmed the removal of major elements like fe as fluorine as well as trace elements such as al si cl ca etc from the sample water overall

11846,this work report results of experimental studies on concurrent removal of co existing fe ii as v and fluoride ions from groundwater by electrocoagulation ec experimental studies were completed to explore the impact of initial ph current density initial ion concentration stirring speed salt dose and electrode spacing on removing co existing as v fe ii and fluoride ions experimental results

of fluoride fe as along with other ions like ca na cl al etc by the metal hydroxide flocs graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater arsenic fluoride iron aluminium electrode electrocoagulation 1 introduction human exposure to naturally existing dissolved contaminants ions in groundwater and surface water has been identified as the world s biggest mass poisoning in human history biswas et al 2012 ahmad and bhattacharya 2019 in the subsequent years the occurrence of toxic contaminants ions of arsenic fluoride iron along with many co existing ions like nitrate sulfate etc has been reported in various parts of the world chakraborti et al 2011 bhattacharya et al 2020 dhadge et al 2018 chronic poisoning due to prolonged exposure to arsenic fluoride and iron through drinking water and other dietary components has been a global issue in recent years kumar et al 2017 bundschuh et al 2017 ahmad et al 2017 such water contamination occurs mainly due to the release of untreated industrial wastewater into the river streams toxic chemicals in various activities and similar other human activities bhattacharya et al 2007a 2007b sometimes natural reasons like erosion and weathering of mineral bearing rocks also add these contaminants to groundwater maity et al 2021 most of the population in india bangladesh pakistan greece romania croatia argentina bolivia chille are highly affected by arsenic contamination ahmad et al 2020a 2020b bandaru et al 2020 herrera et al 2020 as per the estimation from the recent global models 94 220 million people are potentially exposed to naturally occurring arsenic as in groundwater used for drinking consumption of water with as v concentrations above who permissible limits of 10 μg l causes many health problems like keratosis of feet and hands cancer which may lead to the early death of humans das and nandi 2019b maity et al 2012 gustafsson and bhattacharya 2007 ahmad et al 2019 kapaj et al 2006 world health organization 2004 however many literatures suggests that prolonged consumption of as in drinking water even below the 10 μg l might have serious health consequences including increased internal cancer rates and diabetes generally the arsenic ion is found in groundwater as arsenite as iii or arsenate as v salt among which as v is known to be more carcinogenic das and nandi 2019b dhaneskaran and sahu 2021 pazhoor et al 2021 the existence of arsenic in groundwater in its oxy anions forms depends on the presence of other co existing ions in the water and the ph of the groundwater van genuchten and ahmad 2020 the presence of higher amounts ca and fe iii ions as co existing ions in groundwater at lower ph enhance the precipitation of the as v ions ahmad et al 2020a b dissolve oxygen do present in groundwater also effect the presence of co existing arsenic and iron ions as the do can oxidize fe ii to form fe iii oxyhydr oxide precipitates which have a strong arsenic sorption affinity ahmad et al 2020a annaduzzamana et al 2021a 2021b also do may act as an oxidant to groundwater initiate beneficial side reactions and notably oxidize as iii to as v so there is a major possibility of as v occurrence in groundwater fluoride ions have been detected in groundwater in many regions of the world tirkey et al 2018 due to excessive intake of fluoride laden drinking water around 65 of endemic fluorosis occurs globally severely damaging bones teeth and organs such as the kidneys lungs and nerves of the human body tirkey et al 2018 globally around 200 million persons consume fluoride contaminated groundwater with more than 1 5 mg l of fluoride tirkey et al 2018 as reported by who more than 25 countries worldwide including india are highly vulnerable to fluoride contamination in drinking water herrera et al 2020 more than 25 million people in india are affected by various diseases originating from heavy fluoride ions in groundwater across 20 states and union territories similarly iron contamination in groundwater is also a prevalent problem faced by indian people in day to day life ghosh et al 2008 though iron is classified as a secondary contaminant consumption of water with fe ii ions concentration above 0 3 mg l regularly causes iron overload on the human body indigestion as well as make water highly turbid change in colour aesthetic in taste and with odours das and nandi 2019a some locations of india have reported the presence of fe ii as v and fluoride ions above who limits chakraborti et al 2011 bhattacharya et al 2020 biswas et al 2014 ahmad et al 2019 reported the existence of arsenic in groundwater in its oxy anions forms depends on the presence of other co existing in the water and ph of the groundwater bandaru et al 2020 suggested that ec using fe electrode can be an effective method for arsenic removal as dissolved oxygen do can oxidize fe ii to form fe iii precipitates which have a strong arsenic sorption affinity genutchen et al 2020 reported that oxidation of groundwater initiates beneficial side reactions and leads to conversion of as iii to as v which is readily sorbed oxyanion researchers reported that simultaneous exposure of fe ii as v and fluoride ions adversely affect the human body compared to a single exposure of these pollutants dhadge et al 2018 silva et al 2018 bordoloi et al 2013 thakur and mondal 2017 chakraborti et al 2011 reported the occurrence of fluoride within the range of 0 14 17 mg l iron within 0 1 77 mg l and arsenic within 0 1 1219 μg l in various locations of north eastern and eastern india bhattacharya et al 2020 reported the occurrence of co existing fluoride arsenic and iron in groundwater of various locations in tripura india patolia and sinha 2017 reported excessive contamination of fluoride along with iron arsenic nitrate alkalinity sulfate etc in the groundwater of dhanbad india therefore there is increasing concern about finding cost effective water treatment processes to remove co existing as v fe ii and fluoride ions from groundwater merely very little research has been carried out on the removal of co existing as v fe ii and fluoride ions from water dhadge et al 2018 silva et al 2018 several methods have been reported for individual removal of fluoride iron and arsenic contamination from the water like adsorption tirkey et al 2018 chemical coagulation pazhoor et al 2021 oxidation bordoloi et al 2013 membrane filtration ahmad et al 2020b biological process maity et al 2021 and electrocoagulation thakur and mondal 2017 bandaru et al 2020 guzmán et al 2016 among these methods adsorption and coagulation are extensively used in water treatment plants however adsorption and coagulation methods have several disadvantages such as higher sensitivity to ph the generation of a higher amount of sludge and the requirement of chemicals which may also retain an unpleasant taste and odor in the treated water reverse osmosis requires highly skilled labour to operate as well as treatment time is more and very costly ion exchange methods require regular regeneration or replacement of costly resins along with skilled human resources electrocoagulation ec is nowadays considered a superior method for water treatment compared to other methods as it has numerous properties like modular design flexible operation and enticing advantages like low cost no additional requirement of chemicals lesser treatment time low maintenance cost which makes it favorable for sustainable implementation and operation in rural communities guzmán et al 2016 das and nandi 2018 titchou et al 2021 bandaru et al 2020 based on experimental results reported by previous work das and nandi 2019a 2019b ec is an efficient method for removing co existing pollutants in ec al oh 3 s flocs are released due to the electrolytic dissolution of aluminum anode based on the electrochemical reaction in reported literature das and nandi 2019a eqns 1 4

surface area as a result they can easily trap the pollutants present in water and finally precipitate and separate as sludge which is water insoluble in nature silva et al 2018 dhadge et al 2018 have studied the concurrent removal of arsenic iron and fluoride by ec and the influence of various operating conditions on its removal silva et al 2018 has reported the co existing removal of fluoride iron and arsenic and the impact of different operating conditions of ec they also reported that the presence of iron and fluoride considerably influence the removal of arsenic most of the work dhadge et al 2018 silva et al 2018 reported has conducted the experiments considering the higher range of arsenic iron and fluoride ion concentrations which are typically found in industrial wastewater generally such contaminates are found in the lower or medium range in groundwater as reported in the literature chakraborti et al 2011 bhattacharya et al 2020 bordoloi et al 2013 during ec other parameters that determine water quality like turbidity salinity tds sulfate nitrate chloride alkalinity hardness ph etc changes must be observed before water may be considered drinkable however no previous studies have been reported any comprehensive report on variations of all such water quality parameters in the ec treated water given that groundwater is polluted with individual ions of fe ii as v fluoride as well as other co existing ions in this study the suitability of the ec process on the removal of as v fe ii and fluoride ions was investigated the influence of different ec process parameters such as current density j ma cm 2 ph electrode spacing d cm salt dose c s g l stirring speed r rpm along with the individual effects of fe ii as v and fluoride ions on the overall removal of fe ii as v and ions were studied a kinetic study has been carried out for a comprehensive understanding of the importance of operating parameters on ec such a study will be beneficial in evaluating the influence of co existing ions present in groundwater on the removal efficiency of fluoride and fe ii and as v ions by ec 2 material and methods a 5 l glass beaker was used to perform ec experiments with 3 l of sample water using aluminium al plates as electrodes with an operative area of 116 cm2 length 0 073 m width 0 1 m thickness 0 001 m at room atmosphere 26 2 c to provide the necessary electric supply a dc power source 0 10 a 0 30 v model l6410s aplab was used magnetic stirrer model spint digital mc 02 tarson was used for continuous mixing of flocs produced and water during ec after each experiment the surface of the electrodes was cleaned using abrasive paper and follower by diluted hydrochloric acid and water wash to remove all the impurities the polarity of the

through the motorized pump from iit ism dhanbad campus nacl salt was used to modify the conductivity of the groundwater as the natural conductivity of groundwater was not adequate to support the desirable conductivity necessary for pollutant ions removal to modify the initial ph 1 m hcl and 1 m naoh were added to the solution table s1 summarizes the concentration of various pollutants after the addition of different chemicals along with who approved drinking water quality parameters to study the effect of various operating parameters ec experiments were performed with wide ranges of values for each parameter to identify the best possible operating parameters individually by detailed systematic study represented in table s2 elaborately entire ec experiments were carried out for 60 min and repeated thrice for accuracy with 0 5 variations during the ec tests samples of 3 5 ml were withdrawn and analysed after filtration and separating the sludge using whatman 1 filter paper pore

initial ph on fe ii as v and fluoride ions removal it is reported by chakraborti et al 2011 bhattacharya et al 2020 that the ph of contaminated groundwater mostly varied between the ranges of 6 8 ghosh et al 2008 reported that the ph of water immensely influence the removal efficiency of fe ii ion as fe ii ion is highly prone to oxidation in the presence of oxygen and ph below 6 according to the reaction as follows 5 f e 2 1 4 o 2 h f e 3 1 2 h 2 o as a result of the preceding process fe2 ions are transformed to fe3 and stable compounds are produced considering all the above aspects in the present work ph was varied from 5 to 9 fig 1 a depicts the influence of initial ph on the removal of as v ions from water it is noticed from fig 1a that residual as v ions reduced with the rise in ph from 5 to 7 no significant variation of residual as v ion was observed above ph 7 similar tendencies were also seen in the case of fe ii ion fig 1b and fluoride ion fig 1c removal residual as v concentration after 60 min of ec for initial ph of 5 6 7 8 and 9 were 8 2 4 5 0 1 9 8 and 14 2 μg l respectively similarly residual fe ii ion and fluoride ion concentrations for ph of 5 6 7 8 and 9 were 6 52 5 02 0 29 8 01 and 8 92 mg l and 3 2 4 6 0 98 5 4 and 5 8 mg l post 60 min of operation a significant upsurge in the removal rate of as v ion with the increase in ph from 5 to 7 was due to faster charge neutralization above ph 7 al oh 3 s flocs become stable and insoluble das and nandi 2019b such insoluble flocs get separated from the solution and reduce the probability for ionic diffusion of pollutant ions in coagulant das and nandi 2020 as a result decrease in fe ii as v and fluoride ions removal were observed above ph 7 table s3 shows the residual values of turbidity ph and other parameters from table s3 it was seen that values of all the parameters were minimum at ph 7 and within who permissible limits table 1 however the final value of ph i e after 60 min of ec was found to slightly increase in the range of 7 27 7 42 such an increase in ph after ec experiment can be explained by the generation of hydroxide anions during the process variations of residual values of all the parameters between 5 and 9 were due to variation in metal hydroxide flocs generation and its adsorption and entrapping capacity of the ions at various ph due to its solubility difference at various ph as the maximum removal for all the pollutants occurred at ph 7 it was considered as ideal ph for all the remaining experiments 3 2 influence of stirring speed on fe ii as v and fluoride ions removal fig s2a c shows the variation in residual concentration of fe ii as v and fluoride ions for different stirring speed r of 150 200 and 300 rpm it is seen from fig s2a c that stirring speed has significant impacts on fe ii as v and fluoride ions removal residual concentration of fe ii and fluoride ions for stirring speed of 150 200 and 300 rpm were 6 54 0 32 7 56 mg l and 1 23 0 98 2 1 mg l after 60 min of ec respectively it is observed from fig s2b and s2c that the residual concentration for fe ii and fluoride ions do not attain the who permissible limit for the lower stirring speed of 150 rpm and extremely higher agitating speed of 300 rpm as v ions removal varied with stirring speed during the initial 50 min and later all speeds showed the same ion removal the highest ion removal was observed at 200 rpm for all three contaminants such variations in pollutant ion removal can be explained by the fact that at a very lower stirring speed the contact of the contaminant ions and hydroxide flocs becomes inadequate which slows down the removal reaction at extremely high stirring speed pollutant ions and flocs rotated along with solution without desirable interactions as a result ion removal efficiency reduced das and nandi 2020 maximum removal of all the three contaminants was found at moderate stirring of 200 rpm it was used in remaining all the experiments 3 3 influence of salt dose on fe ii as v and fluoride ions removal electrolyte concentration salt dose or conductivity affects the cell voltage and consumption of energy amid the ec process silva et al 2018 in the present work the nacl dose was varied from 0 30 to 0 80 g l with corresponding electrical conductivity of solution varying from 650 to 1100 μs cm fig 2 a c shows the variation in residual concentration of fe ii as v and fluoride ions at various nacl cs concentrations it is seen from fig 2a c that with the increment in cs fe ii as v and fluoride ions removal increases slightly residual fe ii ions concentration decreased from 0 29 to 0 12 mg l and residual fluoride ions concentration decreased from 0 98 to 0 54 mg l when c s raised from 0 30 to 0 80 g l lower cs were enough for as v ions to reduce its concentration below 10 μg l an increase in pollutant ion removal with nacl dose was due to higher electrode dissolution at greater solution due to better electron transport which enhances the capture of the pollutant ions by the flocs table s4 summarizes the residual values of turbidity tds and other parameters after 60 min of ec for different cs from table s4 it is seen that with the increase in cs from 0 30 to 0 80 g l the final turbidity of the treated water slightly increases from 0 91 to 0 98 ntu conductivity increases drastically from 280 to 338 μs cm tds increases from 119 to 227 mg l and salinity increases from 121 to 212 mg l the residual chloride ion concentration was observed to increase slightly from 0 14 to 0 34 mg l alkalinity and hardness were also found to increase with the increase in ions originating from higher nacl dose with the increase in chloride ions in feed water the rate of chlorine gas generation increased nandi and patel 2014 as a result residual chloride ion concentration does not increase significantly with salt dose such observations infer that the addition of higher amounts of salt up to 0 80 g l does not significantly modify residual water quality addition of an excessive amount of nacl not only increases the cost of the treatment but also degrades the water quality considering the additional cost of nacl addition as well as a minor increase in pollutant ions removal ability lower dose of salt concentration 0 30 g l was utilized in all ec tests 3 4 influence of current density on fe ii as v and fluoride ions removal current density j were varied from 0 431 ma cm2 to 6 466 ma cm2 0 05 0 75 a to assess its impact on fe ii as v and fluoride ions removal and the results are depicted in fig 3 a c fig 3a illustrates that residual as v ion concentration after 60 min of ec was below 10 μg l for all j values for j above 0 862 ma cm2 99 98 as v ion removal was seen within 15 min of ec it is noticed from fig 3b that final fe ii ion concentration varied from 0 29 to 0 004 mg l as j increased from 0 431 ma cm2 to 6 466 ma cm2 the permissible limit of residual fe ii ions 0 3 mg l was attained within 50 min ec for j of 0 432 ma cm2 for higher j of 6 466 ma cm2 it takes less time than 30 min to reduce below 0 33 mg l from fig 3c it was found that residual fluoride ion concentration varied from 0 98 to 0 08 mg l as j increases from 0 431 ma cm2 to 6 466 ma cm2 permissible limits of 1 5 mg l fluoride arrived after 60 min for j of 0 432 ma cm2 and within 30 min for higher j of 6 466 ma cm2 it can be observed that any increase in j above 2 15 ma cm2 does not influence the removal rate of the ions significantly such phenomena can be explained by the fact that at very high j pollutant ions present in solution become limiting reactants compared to available generated coagulants in excess such conditions during ec are extremely undesirable as an increase in electrode material and energy consumption does not improve pollutant removal it was observed that individual pollutant ion removal during ec was apparently following the first order kinetic model as follows das and nandi 2020 6 l n c o c k t where c 0 and c specifies the pollutant ions concentrations of initial and at time t min respectively k denotes the rate constant from fig s3a c it can be observed that as v fe ii and fluoride ions removal follows the first order model at different current densities from all the figures it can be observed that ion removal followed the first order kinetic model obtained values of rate constant k min 1 for all the pollutant ions at various current densities are summarized in table s5 from table s5 it was noticed that with an increase in current density from 0 432 to 6 466 ma cm2 as v ion removal rate k increased from 0 1373 to 0 1808 min 1 for fe ii ions k increased from 0 0582 to 0 1562 min 1 and fluoride ions k increased from 0 0307 to 0 0792 min 1 such increase in k with current density was due to faster flocs a l o h 3 generation at higher current density and thus the entrapment of ions occurs at a faster speed and increases the removal rate table 1 summarizes the residual values of turbidity tds and other parameters after 60 min of ec for different j it is seen that from table 1 turbidity conductivity tds salinity and ph values also alter during ec the removal of additional metal ions anions and soluble elements by the coagulation process resulted in a reduction in turbidity conductivity tds and salinity as j increased the increase in oh ions in the solution causes a little rise in the ph of the solution the concentration of al was found to exceed the permissible limit and increase in the treated water due to higher anodic dissolution at higher current density sulfate nitrate phosphate chloride alkalinity and hardness were found within the permissible limit for all current densities since desirable removal of as v fe ii and fluoride ions was achieved at the lowest j of 0 432 ma cm2 after 60 min of ec and all the parameters were within who permissible limits table s1 the current density of 0 432 ma cm2 was used in further experiments experimental results obtained in the present work were compared with some of the results reported in the literature dhadge et al 2018 investigated the simultaneous removal of fluoride iron and arsenic from synthetic water using 10 l of water containing 10 mg l of fluoride 25 mg l of fe ii and 200 μg l of as v ions using aluminium electrode at a current density of 62 5 ma cm2 and conductivity of 340 μs cm they reported 93 2 98 74 and 95 65 removal of fluoride fe ii and as v ions after 45 min of ec silva et al 2018 reported carried out experimental studies on the effect of co existing 20 mg l of fe ii 10 mg l of fluoride and 300 μg l of as v ions on its removal efficiency using 3 l of water they reported complete removal of all contaminants in 60 min of ec at a current density of 1 25 ma cm2 and conductivity of 345 μs cm using aluminum electrode in this context the present study shows that a lower current density of 0 432 ma cm2 can be used to achieve who approved water quality within 60 min of ec from a ternary mixture of 10 mg l of fluoride 20 mg l of fe ii and 400 μg l of as v by using 3 l of working volume if the conductivity is modified up to 650 μs cm hence for cost effective removal of various ions use of a higher volume of water should be used to make ec a less energy consuming process 3 5 influence of electrode spacing on as v fe ii and fluoride ions removal electrode spacing d was varied from 1 cm to 2 5 cm to assess its impact on fe ii as v and fluoride ions removal and results are demonstrated in fig 4 a c it is noticed from fig 4a that residual as v ion concentration as v was below 10 μg l at all d values residual fe ii ions increase from 0 32 to 1 89 mg l fig 4b and residual fluoride ions increase from 0 98 to 3 28 mg l fig 4c with an increase in d from 1 cm to 2 5 cm the residual concentration of fe ii and fluoride ion for higher d values above 1 cm did not attain the who permissible limit due to insufficient removal of these ions an increase in residual fe ii and fluoride ions with an increase in d can be interpreted by the reason that with an increase in d interactions between al3 ions and oh ions generated from electrodes get delayed and as a result the overall rate of flocs generation decreases hence the interaction between the produced flocs and the as v fe ii and fluoride ions slows down and finally the rate of fe ii and fluoride ion entrapment decreases overall the removal of as v ions was faster compared to other ions due to the higher absorption capacity of as v ions in aluminum hydroxide flocs silva et al 2018 and also to the fe iii flocs generated from fe ii oxidation table s6 summarizes the residual values of turbidity tds and other parameters after 60 min of ec for varying d it is noticed from table s6 that with the increase in d from 1 to 2 5 cm the residual value of conductivity increases from 280 to 315 μs cm turbidity from 0 91 to 1 91 ntu salinity from 121 to 140 after 60 min of ec process while ph was within 7 18 0 1 the removal efficiency of alkalinity hardness chloride phosphate nitrates and sulfate was found to decrease slightly with electrode spacing such an increase in tds turbidity conductivity salinity with d was due to the slower removal of pollutant ions by the coagulation process since desirable removal efficiency within the permissible limit of all the three contaminants was achieved at the lowest d of 1 cm a minimal d of 1 cm was used for all the further experiments 3 6 influence of fe ii ions on as v and fluoride ions removal to identify the impact of fe ii ions on the removal of co existing as v and fluoride ions fe ii ion concentration was considered within 0 60 mg l keeping the initial as v and fluoride concentration constant fig 5 a b shows the variation in residual as v and fluoride ions concentration with varying fe ii ions concentrations of 0 20 40 60 mg l it is seen from fig 5a that the removal efficiency of as v increases as the fe ii ions concentration is increased residual concentration of as v decreases to 5 2 μg l when fe ii is not present in the mixture within 10 min after ec the residual as v concentration dropped to 3 2 g l as the fe ii ion concentration increased from 20 to 60 mg l according to the experimental data the removal effectiveness of as v nearly approaches 100 percent in the first 30 min of the ec treatment a subsequent generation of aluminum hydroxide precipitates due to the presence of fe ii ions in the solution which increases the total amount of adsorbent material in the bulk solution and removes or traps the as v ions by adsorption also the continuous in situ formation of hydrous ferric oxide flocs during the process and the favorable lower ph i e 7 provides higher sorption capacities for the as v ions in the solution and likely contributed to the improved performance in the removal rate the low ph and dissolved oxygen concentration in the system limited the rapid oxidation of fe2 and facilitated more as v removal annaduzzamana et al 2021a annaduzzamana et al 2021b therefore the removal rate of as v ions increases in the presence of fe ii ions during ec similar result patterns are also observed in fig 5b for the removal of fluoride ions in the presence of a different concentration of fe ii ions residual fluoride concentration after 60 min of ec was 2 8 0 98 0 91 and 0 70 mg l for different fe ii concentration of 0 20 40 and 60 mg l such an increase in fluoride ion removal with an increase in fe ii ion was due to adsorption of fluoride ions by fe oh 3 flocs generated by fe ii ions these freshly produced fe oh 3 flocs entrap as v and fluoride ions by sweep coagulation silva et al 2018 as a consequence overall as v and fluoride ions removal increases furthermore experimental data show that the presence of fe ii ions promotes fluoride elimination during ec besides the formation of iron hydroxides occurs along with al oh 3 flocs as a result in an increase in ph which adds the quantity of flocs in the bulk solution and promotes the removal rate of fluoride 3 7 influence of fluoride ions on as v and fe ii ions removal to evaluate the impact of fluoride ions on the removal of as v and fe ii ions different concentrations of fluoride within the range of 0 20 mg l keeping as v and fe ii ions concentration constant fig 6 a shows the variation of as v ions at various concentrations of fluoride ions with fe ii ion dose of 20 mg l it is noticed from fig 6a that the removal efficiency of as v increases as the fluoride concentration increases as v ion removal rate was lower in the absence of fluoride ions as the fluoride concentration increases to 20 mg l as v removal rate improves and residual concentration of as v decreases to 0 1 μg l within 20 min of ec the experiments revealed that the replacement of oh groups by f on aluminium flocs improves their ability to absorb arsenic das and nandi 2020 a similar effect is seen in fig 6b for the elimination of fe ii ions while varying the fluoride ion concentrations from fig 6b it is observed that residual fe ii ions concentration decreases from 1 213 0 29 0 265 and 0 117 mg l as the fluoride ion concentration increases in the solution from 0 10 15 and 20 mg l respectively such results can be explained by considering the removal mechanism of fluoride by ec dhadge et al 2018 during fluoride removal by ec fluoride ions present in the solution are substituted by the hydroxide groups of the aluminum hydroxide flocs generated and release oh ions to the solution das and nandi 2019b for higher fluoride concentration more oh ions are retained in the solution as a faster reaction rate of fluoride such increase in ph of the solution prompts higher production of iron hydroxide flocs which can readily trap other ions present in solution and hence as v and fe ii ion removal increased experimental results suggest that the removal efficiency of fe ii ions significantly increases with the increase in initial fluoride concentration such trends in results can be explained in a better way by looking into the removal mechanism of fluoride during ec the fluoride anion from the solution substitutes the hydroxide groups available in the al oh 3 flocs as per the following equation silva et al 2018 7 a l o h 3 s y f a q a l o h 3 y f y s y o h during fluoride removal a generous amount of oh is produced and released into the solution which becomes immoderate with a higher initial concentration of fluoride this prompts an increase in the ph of the solution during the ec experiments and leads to the formation of a higher amount of iron hydroxide precipitates which can be easily eliminated by filtration as a result the addition of fluoride accelerates the amount of removal of fe ii ions 3 8 influence of as v ions on fe ii and fluoride ions removal to evaluate the impact of arsenic on fe ii and fluoride ions removal different concentrations of as v within the range of 0 400 μg l were considered keeping the initial concentration of fe ii and fluoride constant fig 7 a shows the variation in residual fluoride concentration at various concentrations of as v ions with fe ii ions concentration of 20 mg l fig 7a illustrates that the removal efficiency of fluoride increased as the as v ions concentration increased fluoride ion removal rate was lower in the absence of as v ions as the as v concentration increased up to 400 μg l the fluoride removal rate improved residual fluoride concentration after 60 min of ec was 3 45 2 8 0 98 0 91 and 0 70 mg l for different as v ion concentration of 0 100 200 300 and 400 μg l respectively the presence of as v in the solution has little effect on the removal efficiency of fe ii ions but this influence lowers the operation time required to reach the acceptable limit at ph 7 or near to it as v ion exists in its negative form i e haso4 2 which is predominating in nature and can be readily adsorbed by al oh 3 s and al2o3 s flocs silva et al 2018 8 a l o h 3 s h a s o 4 2 a l o h 3 h a s o 4 2 9 a l 2 o 3 s h a s o 4 2 a l 2 o 3 s h a s o 4 2 both the as v and fe ii ions are captured by the al oh 3 flocs during the early phases of the ec process thus all these pollutants are eliminated by a complicated competing adsorptive mechanism that can be seen in the removal efficiency of fe ii ions with the addition of as v fig 7a however as the experiment advances the elimination of fe ii ions via hydroxides colloidal particles and precipitating will become more prevalent making the fe ii removal less influenced by the concentration of as v present similar trends were also observed in fig 7b for the removal of fe ii ions in the presence of a different concentration of as v ions from fig 7b it is noticed that residual fe ii ions concentration decreased from 0 87 0 62 0 45 0 38 and 0 29 mg l as the as v ion concentration increased in the solution from 0 100 200 300 and 400 μg l respectively the increased adsorption capacity of al oh 3 flocs in the as f fe co existing system resulted in an improvement in the removal rate of fe ii and fluoride ions in the existence of as v ions liu et al 2015 in the presence of as v ions the formation of al f oh occurs rapidly such modified coagulant has more active adsorptive sites and enhances the removal of other species from the solution liu et al 2015 3 9 analysis of ec generated sludge figure s4a b shows the surface morphology of produced sludge and the edax spectrum it can be observed from figures s4a that the sludge is porous in nature edax spectra shown in figure s4b infer that sludge contains fluoride fe as along with na al ca si etc which explains the entrapment of the ions by the metal hydroxide flocs table s7 shows the detailed weight of all the elements detected in the sludge it is observed that almost 7 96 fluoride 0 99 fe 0 25 as 25 99 al were the major pollutants along with other ions like na 1 95 cl 1 17 ca 1 14 etc entrapped in the sludge which can be explained by the removal mechanism pattern during ec process by al oh 3 flocs as per eqn 3 nonetheless the composition of the sludge may vary subsequently to the source of the groundwater and the contaminants present in it such porous metal hydroxide sludge can be collected from several experiments as the amount obtained from a single experiment is not large and it can be utilized as adsorbents un et al 2017 4 conclusions the present study studied the simultaneous removal of co existing as v fe ii and fluoride ions from groundwater using electrocoagulation to achieve its concentration below who permissible limit during the experimental studies various operating parameters like initial ph current density salt dose stirring speed and initial concentration of ions were varied to analyze their impacts on as v fe ii and fluoride ions removal obtained results infer that to get drinkable water quality from contaminated water containing as v of 400 μg l fe ii of 20 mg l and fluoride of 10 mg l j of 0 432 ma cm2 cs of 0 30 g l initial ph of 7 d of 1 cm and r of 200 rpm are necessary it was observed ec based process could reduce other water impurities such as turbidity tds nitrate ions phosphate ions sulfate ions chloride alkalinity and hardness from groundwater simultaneously the presence of fe ii ions improved as v and fluoride ions removal due to faster reduction of as v to as iii ions similarly presence of fluoride ions improved the fe ii and as v ions removal due to increased al oh 3 flocs generation in water the presence of as v improved fe ii and fluoride removal due to improved adsorption capacity of al oh 3 flocs in the as f fe co existing system kinetic analysis showed that the removal of arsenic iron and fluoride ions followed the apparent first order model characterization of ec generated sludge confirmed the removal of major elements like fe as fluorine as well as trace elements such as al si cl ca etc from the sample water overall

11847,the escalating community demands for water supply in urban areas lead to overexploitation on groundwater and worsening the condition of the resources these exploitation activities will affect the quality quantity and continuity qqc of groundwater especially those that are produced as the resource for the water supply industry the study area is a water supply industry plant located in bekasi west java indonesia that uses groundwater originating from the bekasi karawang groundwater basin proper management is needed to maintain the qqc of the groundwater and one of the steps in pursuing it is with the groundwater protection zone gpz delineation the aim of this study is to delineate the gpz in the study area based on the natural conditions and the conceptual hydrogeological models the method used to delineate the gpz is groundwater flow modelling as a result this study identifies the unconfined and confined aquifers systems at the plant while the groundwater extraction is only sourced from the confined aquifer our findings reveal that the groundwater in both unconfined and confined aquifers generally flows in a south north direction with the travel time varying from 25 days to 133 years the gpz resulted for the water supply plant consists of the production well protection zone and the recharge area protection zone this study also suggests recommendations for groundwater management in the gpz based on the source of contaminants graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater protection zone groundwater flow modelling aquifer systems conceptual model water supply plant 1 introduction the community s demand for water supply especially groundwater is escalating along with the increase of land developments and human needs groundwater as a natural resource is widely known as a renewable resource that has strategic value over time the changing environment as a consequence of the development has also brought undesirable impacts on the groundwater condition and brings adverse effects on the community and the environment actions for the protection and control of supply and water resources are urgently needed due to inefficient use of resources and contamination threats that endanger water security del carmen paris et al 2019 the assessment of groundwater which is based on the quality quantity and continuity qqc aspects is a necessary action to be conducted kodoatie and syarief 2010 especially in urban areas when the demand is higher the study area of this research is located in the water supply industry plant in bekasi west java indonesia that uses groundwater as the main resource bekasi is one of the industrial and urban areas in indonesia with a high level of groundwater use the high demand for groundwater is in accordance with the dense population and high number of industries several studies on groundwater quality in bekasi have been carried out these studies conclude that based on the quality the groundwater in the residential and industrial zone is still feasible to be consumed arwati 2017 pratiwi et al 2021 suprihatiningsih et al 2018 however these resources are still vulnerable to contamination derived from industrial and infrastructure activities household waste and faecal contamination maysarah et al 2020 suprihatiningsih et al 2018 in this case groundwater qqc becomes an important parameter that must be seriously considered by the water supply company related to its effects on product quality groundwater protection zone gpz delineation is one of the steps of groundwater qqc assessment resulting in zonation area where the land use activities should be under control and regulation to achieve water security howard and schmoll 2006 nel et al 2009 the gpz delineation provides strategic solutions to control prevent and minimize the potential of groundwater contamination that occur on or below the land surface before reaching groundwater production wells baoxiang and fanhai 2011 burgess and fletcher 1998 nel et al 2009 zhu and balke 2008 the gpz implementation may require land use restrictions industrial waste treatment service adaptations systematic controls of groundwater qqc and detailed well inspections del carmen paris et al 2019 in recent decades the need to assess the groundwater qqc is fully supported by the development of modelling systems and geographic information system gis that is possible to analyze various thematic variables and overlaid them into a new integrated layer achu et al 2019 bhave et al 2019 senthilkumar et al 2019 thus the applications could support the wide area assessments as well as the site specific interest areas i e in residential areas urban areas and water supply plants the groundwater flow modelling method along with the support of gis applications is considered more helpful to locate and delineate the gpz compared to other methods because able to predict the direction and velocity of groundwater flow and other

groundwater flow leading from south to north the unconfined aquifer system has a thickness between 0 and 50 m at 0 50 m depth below the ground level meanwhile the confined aquifer system has a

modelling boundaries are shown in fig 5 i e bekasi river as the western boundary cikarang river as the eastern boundary and a no flow boundary of the bekasi karawang groundwater basin as the southern boundary the northern boundary uses the shoreline of point 0 m above sea level as the constant head boundary the hydraulic conductivity k values applied in the conceptual model table 2 are according to the various types of lithology morris and johnson 1967 based on the understanding of the geological concept in the study area the k values applied in the modelling are the hydraulic conductivity value of the fine grained and medium grained sandstones with the understanding that the sedimentation of sandstone grains finer downstream the k value for the aquifer will be divided into three rates these rates are the hydraulic conductivity value of medium sandstones of 3 59 10 3 cm day k1 fine sandstones of 2 32 10 4 cm day k3 the mean value between fine and medium sandstones is 1 67 x 10 3 cm day k2 other hydraulic conductivity values used in the modelling are from siltstone of 9 26 10 5 cm day k4 and claystone of 2 32 10 7 cm day k5 4 4 discretization and parameter inputs of groundwater modelling the groundwater model covers 2657 km2 area discretized into a unit cell of 50 x 75 cells with an area of approximately 894 754 m per cell the active cells will be analyzed to identify the groundwater flow patterns while the analysis is not carried out on the inactive cell the inactive cells consist of 1 the western part of the modelling area which is a different groundwater basin i e the jakarta groundwater basin 2 the southern part of the modelling area which is the boundary of groundwater recharge and 3 the aquitard layer which is the bedrock of the modelling area the hydraulic conductivity value and groundwater boundary parameters are inputted into the modelling groundwater boundaries situated in the study area include no flow boundary constant head boundary river drain and groundwater recharge boundary fig 6 a the groundwater recharge area of the model consists of three zones based on the rates i e 737 2 mm year zone a 459 8 mm year zone b and 216 3 mm year zone c fig 6b the highest groundwater recharge rate found in zone a positively correlated with the higher elevation while the lowest recharge rate was found in zone c with the lower elevation 4 5 groundwater withdrawal the data of groundwater withdrawal obtained from the exact value of fourteen production wells the data limitations are complemented by secondary data obtained from the energy and mineral resources department of west java province consisting of the total number of wells and groundwater extraction rate carried out in the bekasi karawang groundwater basin the measurements of groundwater withdrawal are 10 848 21 m3 year in karawang regency 14 304 16 m3 year in bekasi regency and 11 496 95 m3 year in bekasi city the illustration of groundwater withdrawal locations in production wells is shown in fig 7 the production well spreads out in the middle of the model area which refers to the existence of the developed and built up area 4 6 groundwater model and the calibration the very high error rate in the first model produced occurred because the processes of calibration and adjustment with the conceptual model were not yet carried out the highest error on the uncalibrated model appears in the groundwater flow pattern the groundwater flow that is supposed to flow from south to north does not occur the groundwater recharge variable parameter is assumed to be very sensitive to this model another significant variable is the amount of water that enters the aquifer system as has been described in the previous section the groundwater recharge was only based on rainfall and evapotranspiration minus runoff in each data pixel the rainfall temperature and area variables were calculated to obtain the runoff rate however the error rate is also influenced by other factors such as the high amount of runoff due to the massive changes in land use development to comply with these influences the scenario was added to consider the percentage of the build up area such as settlements roads houses buildings to reduce the rate of groundwater recharge in each pixel sourced from the spatial data by the geospatial information agency of indonesia in a scale of 1 25 000 the next step is related to the hydraulic conductivity value the sensitivity analysis of the calibration will be focused on reducing the amount of water that enters the aquifer system and converting the hydraulic conductivity value several scenarios of sensitivity analysis were carried out to obtain the best model which consists of different amounts of groundwater recharge rate based on the spatial data of the build up areas and hydraulic conductivity value in the final scenario the groundwater recharge value in the northernmost recharge area was removed by two cells in each column along the entire row west east the hydraulic conductivity value used in the model before calibration is based on the fine sand lithology as mentioned in table 2 2 32 10 4 cm day then it was converted with the range of the value from the conductivity test which was previously conducted from 30 of the production well operated at the water supply plant in bekasi the result of the conductivity test value is between 1 14 10 4 cm s to 5 10 4 cm s the hydraulic conductivity value is also converted within the test result ranges and gets 2 66 10 4 cm s as the best value to find the best fit model in the best fit model groundwater flow is in the appropriate flow model which flows from south to north the normalized rms value of the calibrated model is 13 215 meaning the lower value indicates a better fit model moreover the correlation coefficient is calculated as 0 897 meaning the model is fitted with the natural system if the correlation coefficient is close to one the next step was examining the contour pattern of the calibrated model the contour pattern generated from the groundwater flow modelling will be compared with the elevation interpolation of the unconfined groundwater level and the confined aquifer piezometric plane the interpolation of these two elevations is carried out using the inverse distance weighting method in arcgis software fig 8 is the graph of the calculated and observed head that shows the calibration result on modflow the blue circle points represent the value of the observational wells in the confined aquifer piezometric plane layer 3 with a total of 26 confined observation wells the observation well in the unconfined aquifer layer 1 is represented by the red rectangular points with a total of 14 unconfined observation wells fig 9 is the result of calibrated groundwater flow modelling showing the groundwater head and velocity in the unconfined aquifer layer 1 and the confined aquifer layer 3 the height of groundwater pressure in fig 9 is using a contour interval of 50 m the detailing map was carried out on both the unconfined aquifer and the confined aquifer with a contour interval of 5 m the magnitude of groundwater flow velocity is indicated with the arrow symbol where the bigger the arrow symbol the greater the groundwater flow velocity the unconfined aquifer layer 1 has a maximum groundwater flow rate of 6 95 10 4 cm s while the confined aquifer layer 3 has a maximum groundwater flow rate of 6 8 10 4 cm s 4 7 groundwater protection zone gpz in the confined aquifer systems the gpz for raw water sources to be delineated are protection zone 1 and protection zone 2 based on the national rivers authority burgess and fletcher 1998 zone 1 is a production well protection zone that has been sterilized within a radius of 5 m from each well to protect the production well hygiene and performance the sterilization means that there are no activities allowed in this zone except the maintenance of the production wells protection zone 2 is a water catchment area for a confined aquifer system the delineation of gpz is carried out using the results of the calibrated groundwater modelling by analyzing the groundwater flow in the confined aquifer layer 3 as the aquifer system used by the water supply plant in addition groundwater flow and velocity are calculated to determine the travel time to the production well the method used at this stage is to combine the results of groundwater flow modelling produced by modflow software and raster analysis using arcgis software the time travel of groundwater flows which will be known later are used to delineate the gpz for raw water sources the raster is made by grouping using the maximum value of groundwater flow generated in groundwater flow modelling the groundwater flow velocity value used is based on the confined aquifer system layer 3 of 6 8 10 4 cm s fig 10 shows the groundwater flow to the water supply plant a and the distance from the capture zone to the 14 production wells b to get the distance value the euclidean distance operation was performed on the fourteen production wells of the water supply plant using arcgis software the travel time value is obtained from the distance and velocity values of a particle the method used in the arcgis software is the raster calculator analysis to calculate each raster pixel value of distance and velocity fig 11 shows the travel time of the groundwater flow to the production well of the water supply plant the shortest travel time takes approximately 25 days to get to the production well while the longest travel time is approximately 133 years production wells at the water supply plant are extracting groundwater from the confined aquifer systems gpz in the confined aquifer system is different from those in the unconfined aquifer system due to the impermeable layer presence above the confined aquifer the confined aquifer part that does not have this layer is generally an upstream recharge area fig 12 shows the gpz resulting from this study divided into two zones i e the production well protection zone green area and the recharge area protection zone red area the figure shows the delineation result of the groundwater recharge area with the direction of groundwater flow towards the production wells the gpz delineation method has also been widely applied in other parts of the world although the use of variables and data processing techniques is not entirely the same as that used in this study as conducted by del carmen paris et al 2019 microbiological parameters are also used as assessment variables in delineating the wellhead protection zones in the new pumping field supplying esperanza and rafaela cities of santa fe province argentina their study results show that the groundwater travel time ranges from 50 to 100 days hydrogeological modflow modelling was also carried out by osmanaj et al 2021 to delineate gpz in pozharan wellfield of the republic of kosovo as a result osmanaj et al 2021 recommend fencing activities restriction and waste dumps removal according to the gpz ranks some restriction recommendations based on gpz are also recommended in germany zhu and balke 2008 water in reservoirs and lakes is also determined as surface water protection zones with the need of special treatment if acidification happens caused by acid rain or eutrophication due to the inflow of sewage zhu and balke 2008 in the south african study case nel et al 2009 gpz delineation is more focused on comparing the cost of water supply protection with the cost incurred due to the treatment of sick and dying people due to contaminated drinking water nel et al 2009 delineate gpz as i an operational zone immediately adjacent to the site of the borehole referred to as the accident prevention zone and ii in inner protection zone based on the time expected to reduce pathogen presence to an acceptable level referred to as the microbial protection area 4 8 recommendations the two zones of gpz aim to maintain the sustainability of groundwater production used by the water supply plant however any groundwater qqc management and maintenance that will be implemented should not be performed in production well and recharge area protection zones only but also must be implemented in the inside capture zone between the two areas yellow boundary the monitoring within each groundwater protection zone must include us epa 2004 groundwater chemical composition monitoring including specification of the contributions from human activity associated surface systems monitoring including terrestrial ecosystems and bodies of surface water with which the groundwater body is dynamically linked water balance components monitoring which should include river and groundwater levels rainfall discharge and abstraction table 3 shows the recommendation for groundwater management in the gpz based on the source of contaminants that can reduce the qqc of groundwater produced by the water supply plant the two main zones of gpz i e zone 1 inside water supply plant and surrounding area and zone 2 groundwater recharge catchment area were illustrated in fig 13 in zone 1 the main contaminants were sourced by the human and industrial activities inside the water supply plant there are also possibilities of contamination from surrounding areas of the water supply plant such as the industrial activity coming from another plant and human settlements close to the water supply plant in zone 2 located in the southern parts of the model some activities can also reduce the qqc of the groundwater the contaminants come from the mining areas the housing areas the agriculture areas and the development of new residential areas 5 conclusion the degrading of the quality quantity and continuity qqc of groundwater will cause various problems especially for the water supply industry one of the steps to prevent qqc degradation is the delineation of the groundwater protection zone gpz based on the conceptual hydrogeological model the groundwater modelling and gpz delineation resulted from this study the study area consists of two aquifer systems i e confined aquifer and unconfined aquifer while the groundwater extraction is sourced only from the confined aquifer generally the thickness of both system aquifers is thicker to the northern area and flow from the south to the north of the study area the lithology variety in the aquifers is dominated by sandstone with a hydraulic conductivity of 1 41 10 4 1 31 10 3 cm s the maximum groundwater flow velocity is 6 9 10 4 cm s in unconfined aquifers and 6 8 10 4 cm s in confined aquifers the gpz resulted for the water supply plant consists of the production well protection zone and the recharge area protection zone this study also provides recommendations for groundwater management in the gpz based on the source of contaminants these recommendations should not be implemented only in the two protection zones but also in the capture area of production wells proper implementation of gpz hopefully will ensure long term water quality benefits declaration of competing interest the

11847,the escalating community demands for water supply in urban areas lead to overexploitation on groundwater and worsening the condition of the resources these exploitation activities will affect the quality quantity and continuity qqc of groundwater especially those that are produced as the resource for the water supply industry the study area is a water supply industry plant located in bekasi west java indonesia that uses groundwater originating from the bekasi karawang groundwater basin proper management is needed to maintain the qqc of the groundwater and one of the steps in pursuing it is with the groundwater protection zone gpz delineation the aim of this study is to delineate the gpz in the study area based on the natural conditions and the conceptual hydrogeological models the method used to delineate the gpz is groundwater flow modelling as a result this study identifies the unconfined and confined aquifers systems at the plant while the groundwater extraction is only sourced from the confined aquifer our findings reveal that the groundwater in both unconfined and confined aquifers generally flows in a south north direction with the travel time varying from 25 days to 133 years the gpz resulted for the water supply plant consists of the production well protection zone and the recharge area protection zone this study also suggests recommendations for groundwater management in the gpz based on the source of contaminants graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater protection zone groundwater flow modelling aquifer systems conceptual model water supply plant 1 introduction the community s demand for water supply especially groundwater is escalating along with the increase of land developments and human needs groundwater as a natural resource is widely known as a renewable resource that has strategic value over time the changing environment as a consequence of the development has also brought undesirable impacts on the groundwater condition and brings adverse effects on the community and the environment actions for the protection and control of supply and water resources are urgently needed due to inefficient use of resources and contamination threats that endanger water security del carmen paris et al 2019 the assessment of groundwater which is based on the quality quantity and continuity qqc aspects is a necessary action to be conducted kodoatie and syarief 2010 especially in urban areas when the demand is higher the study area of this research is located in the water supply industry plant in bekasi west java indonesia that uses groundwater as the main resource bekasi is one of the industrial and urban areas in indonesia with a high level of groundwater use the high demand for groundwater is in accordance with the dense population and high number of industries several studies on groundwater quality in bekasi have been carried out these studies conclude that based on the quality the groundwater in the residential and industrial zone is still feasible to be consumed arwati 2017 pratiwi et al 2021 suprihatiningsih et al 2018 however these resources are still vulnerable to contamination derived from industrial and infrastructure activities household waste and faecal contamination maysarah et al 2020 suprihatiningsih et al 2018 in this case groundwater qqc becomes an important parameter that must be seriously considered by the water supply company related to its effects on product quality groundwater protection zone gpz delineation is one of the steps of groundwater qqc assessment resulting in zonation area where the land use activities should be under control and regulation to achieve water security howard and schmoll 2006 nel et al 2009 the gpz delineation provides strategic solutions to control prevent and minimize the potential of groundwater contamination that occur on or below the land surface before reaching groundwater production wells baoxiang and fanhai 2011 burgess and fletcher 1998 nel et al 2009 zhu and balke 2008 the gpz implementation may require land use restrictions industrial waste treatment service adaptations systematic controls of groundwater qqc and detailed well inspections del carmen paris et al 2019 in recent decades the need to assess the groundwater qqc is fully supported by the development of modelling systems and geographic information system gis that is possible to analyze various thematic variables and overlaid them into a new integrated layer achu et al 2019 bhave et al 2019 senthilkumar et al 2019 thus the applications could support the wide area assessments as well as the site specific interest areas i e in residential areas urban areas and water supply plants the groundwater flow modelling method along with the support of gis applications is considered more helpful to locate and delineate the gpz compared to other methods because able to predict the direction and velocity of groundwater flow and other hydrogeological parameters the aim of this study is to delineate the gpz in the study area based on the natural conditions and the conceptual hydrogeological models 2 study area 2 1 geography and

that the groundwater travel time ranges from 50 to 100 days hydrogeological modflow modelling was also carried out by osmanaj et al 2021 to delineate gpz in pozharan wellfield of the republic of kosovo as a result osmanaj et al 2021 recommend fencing activities restriction and waste dumps removal according to the gpz ranks some restriction recommendations based on gpz are also recommended in germany zhu and balke 2008 water in reservoirs and lakes is also determined as surface water protection zones with the need of special treatment if acidification happens caused by acid rain or eutrophication due to the inflow of sewage zhu and balke 2008 in the south african study case nel et al 2009 gpz delineation is more focused on comparing the cost of water supply protection with the cost incurred due to the treatment of sick and dying people due to contaminated drinking water nel et al 2009 delineate gpz as i an operational zone immediately adjacent to the site of the borehole referred to as the accident prevention zone and ii in inner protection zone based on the time expected to reduce pathogen presence to an acceptable level referred to as the microbial protection area 4 8 recommendations the two zones of gpz aim to maintain the sustainability of groundwater production used by the water supply plant however any groundwater qqc management and maintenance that will be implemented should not be performed in production well and recharge area protection zones only but also must be implemented in the inside capture zone between the two areas yellow boundary the monitoring within each groundwater protection zone must include us epa 2004 groundwater chemical composition monitoring including specification of the contributions from human activity associated surface systems monitoring including terrestrial ecosystems and bodies of surface water with which the groundwater body is dynamically linked water balance components monitoring which should include river and groundwater levels rainfall discharge and abstraction table 3 shows the recommendation for groundwater management in the gpz based on the source of contaminants that can reduce the qqc of groundwater produced by the water supply plant the two main zones of gpz i e zone 1 inside water supply plant and surrounding area and zone 2 groundwater recharge catchment area were illustrated in fig 13 in zone 1 the main contaminants were sourced by the human and industrial activities inside the water supply plant there are also possibilities of contamination from surrounding areas of the water supply plant such as the industrial activity coming from another plant and human settlements close to the water supply plant in zone 2 located in the southern parts of the model some activities can also reduce the qqc of the groundwater the contaminants come from the mining areas the housing areas the agriculture areas and the development of new residential areas 5 conclusion the degrading of the quality quantity and continuity qqc of groundwater will cause various problems especially for the water supply industry one of the steps to prevent qqc degradation is the delineation of the groundwater protection zone gpz based on the conceptual hydrogeological model the groundwater modelling and gpz delineation resulted from this study the study area consists of two aquifer systems i e confined aquifer and unconfined aquifer while the groundwater extraction is sourced only from the confined aquifer generally the thickness of both system aquifers is thicker to the northern area and flow from the south to the north of the study area the lithology variety in the aquifers is dominated by sandstone with a hydraulic conductivity of 1 41 10 4 1 31 10 3 cm s the maximum groundwater flow velocity is 6 9 10 4 cm s in unconfined aquifers and 6 8 10 4 cm s in confined aquifers the gpz resulted for the water supply plant consists of the production well protection zone and the recharge area protection zone this study also provides recommendations for groundwater management in the gpz based on the source of contaminants these recommendations should not be implemented only in the two protection zones but also in the capture area of production wells proper implementation of gpz hopefully will ensure long term water quality benefits declaration of competing interest the

11848,in this study a natural algerian zeolite of the mordenite type was activated and tested for nickel adsorption in aqueous solution na mordenite was characterized by different techniques such as x ray diffraction xrd and scanning electron microscopy sem brunauer emmett teller bet analysis shows that this mineral was a micro meso macroporous material with a high specific surface area sbet 124 95 m2 g and a total pore volume of 0 45 cm3 g box behnken design bbd was used to optimize the adsorption process the optimal conditions predicted by the model were initial concentration 10 mg l adsorbent

studies revealed that the avrami kinetic model and redlich peterson isotherm best expressed the experimental data based on the x ray fluorescence results and zeta potential measurements the mechanism of nickel adsorption by na mordenite appears to be an electrostatic and ion exchange process graphical abstract image 1 keywords na mordenite box behnken design adsorption heavy metals optimization natural zeolite 1 introduction in recent decades there has been a significant increase in the number of factories that employ heavy metals as a basic material in their industries such as metallurgy electroplating batteries manufacturing and mining in return their hazardous waste is dumped directly into the aquatic stream without being treated this is currently posing a real danger to the natural environment and human beings kumar et al 2019 w lin et al 2020 nickel is a toxic and carcinogenic metal it is one of the most soluble ions found in waste streams the world health organization who sets a nickel limit of 0 01 mg l in drinking water and a nickel discharge limit of 2 mg l in wastewater exposure to this metal at high concentration causes kidney and lung damage as well as shortness of breath vomiting nose and skin dermatitis heidari et al 2020 jafari and bandarchian 2017 vilvanathan shanthakumar 2017 yildiz 2018 several physical and chemical methods are currently used to remove heavy metals from wastewater and industrial effluents such as chemical precipitation membrane separation solvent extraction and coagulation a criterion for choosing between these methods is the concentration range of the solution to be treated and the target concentration of the treated effluent precipitation can for instance be very interesting in the case of concentrated solutions but the limit of the treatment will be linked to the residual solubility of the compounds for membrane processes conditions required to avoid membrane fouling should also be considered finally the cost of the treatment and the possible generation of by products must also be taken into account in the case of solutions that contain heavy metals adsorption has often proven to be a simple cheap and highly successful process treatment igder et al 2018 irannajad and kamran haghighi 2021 parveen et al 2019 in recent years several materials have been used as adsorbents for nickel removal in aqueous solutions such as oyster shell powder hsu 2009 cancrinite type zeolite qiu and zheng 2009 natural zeolite clinoptilolite çanli and abali 2016 chitosan sporopollenin microcapsules sargin and arslan 2015 activated carbon aboli et al 2020 and electroplating sludge waste peng et al 2019 but it remains the choice of the adsorbent that determines the possibility of its use in industrial applications as it must be efficient non toxic available and cheaper hsu 2009 among the materials that meet these conditions natural zeolite is a hydrated aluminosilicate mineral with porous structures its framework structure is constructed from three dimensional tetrahedral to4 where t is a centrally occupied silicon or aluminum atom surrounded by four oxygen atoms these tetrahedral elements are connected to each other by covalent bonds that form cages cavities and channels koningsveld 2007 widiastuti et al 2019 the surface of zeolite has a negative charge resulting from the isomorphic substitution of si 4 by al 3 which is balanced by exchangeable cations alkali or alkaline earth metals namely sodium calcium potassium and magnesium these ions have the ability to exchange with heavy metals therefore natural zeolite is a promising adsorbent for heavy metals removal via ion exchange or electrostatic attraction s wang and peng 2010 yang et al 2011 the adsorption process is affected by several factors such as ph temperature ionic strength concentration and adsorbent dosage x wang et al 2007 as a result the parameters of the adsorption process must be optimized to find the best response in fact the classical method used to optimize the adsorption process in many studies is based on varying one parameter and fixing the other however this method is time consuming and requires a large number of experiments recently many researchers have used response surface methodology rsm as an alternative to the classical method to optimize the adsorption process rsm is a set of mathematical and statistical techniques used to study the effect of the interaction of factors on experiment response and to predict the optimal conditions its advantage is that it reduces the number of experiments and laboratory work anfar et al 2019 danmaliki et al 2016 mondal et al 2017 algeria has a large reserve of zeolitic tuffs particularly in the north east of the country where mordenite zeolite is the dominant mineral with the recent expansion of industrial activities especially metal based industries the development of low cost adsorbents for the removal of heavy metals from wastewater and industrial effluents has become necessary algerian mordenite zeolite is a low cost abundant and non toxic material that has not been previously exploited for heavy metals adsorption moreover each natural zeolite in different regions has its own characteristics depending on the sources of its geological formation which needs to be studied individually alshameri et al 2014 thus the investigation of the ability of this local zeolite to adsorb heavy metals is the focus of this study the main objective of this paper is to optimize the adsorption of nickel by the natural algerian activated zeolite na mordenite to the best of our knowledge this zeolite was tested for the first time for the adsorption of heavy metals the mordenite was activated and used as an adsorbent for the removal of nickel from aqueous solution the na mordenite was identified and characterized by different analytical techniques x ray diffraction fourier transform infrared spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy dynamic light scattering and brunauer emmett teller adsorption of nickel on na mordenite was performed using the box benkhen design as a type of rsm with three levels and three factors initial concentration amount of adsorbent and ph this experimental design model was applied to study the effects of the interactions of the elimination parameters and to find the optimal conditions for the nickel adsorption process in order to determine the nature and mechanism of the adsorption process the kinetic adsorption isotherm and thermodynamic parameters are also investigated in this study 2 material and methods 2 1 adsorbent the natural mineral used was an algerian zeolite collected from a deposit in bejaia east of algeria firstly the bulk sample was crushed to a particle size of 2 mm quartered and then sieved through several sieves 2 mm to 125 μm two fractions the whole sample and 125 μm were evaluated in this investigation both fractions were dry milled for 2 min at 700 rpm with a pulverisette 9 vibrating cup mill fritsch the fraction 125 μm was used in the experiments since it has a high zeolite content 2 2 adsorbate and chemicals nickel sulphate 6 hydrate niso4 6h2o 99 salt was purchased from riedel de haën sodium chloride nacl 99 5 silver nitrate agno3 99 5 and sodium hydroxide pellets naoh 97 were supplied by biochem chemopharma nitric acid hno3 52 5 was purchased from prolabo all chemicals used were laboratory reagents except silver nitrate and nitric acid an analytical reagent distilled water was used to prepare all solutions 2 3 activation of zeolite the zeolite was activated according to the method prepared by solache ríos et al 2015 with some modifications 4 5 g was weighed and purified with 1 0 mol l hno3 for 4 h at room temperature to remove the soluble impurity s wang and peng 2010 after 8 days in a 5 m nacl solution the zeolite was filtered washed with distilled water until no chloride ions were detected agno3 test and dried at 60 c for 24 h 2 4 point of zero charge the ph of zero point charge phzpc of the adsorbent was determined according to keshvardoostchokami et al 2017 in which a series of 100 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 ml of 0 005 mol l nacl solution were prepared and their solution ph was adjusted between 3 and 10 using 0 1 mol l hno3 or naoh solutions 0 05 g of adsorbent was added to each prepared solution and stirred for 48 h the phi was plotted against the difference between the initial and final ph values dph phf phi the phzpc was determined by the point of intersection of the resulting curve where dph 0 2 5 batch adsorption studies the stock solution 1 g l of ni2 is prepared by dissolving the desired amount of nickel sulphate niso4 6h2o in distilled water the other concentrations of ni2 are prepared by diluting the stock solution the adsorbent content 0 1 0 5 g l is added to a 250 ml beaker at 25 c containing 100 ml of working concentration in the experimental design range 10 150 mg l naoh and hno3 solutions 0 1 mol l are used to adjust the solution ph 3 6 the time and shaking speed are fixed at 3 h and 200 rpm respectively after each experiment the solution is filtered by a syringe filter 0 45 μm pvdf and the residual concentration of ni2 was determined by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer ice 3000 series aas thermo scientific mass balance is used to calculate the amount of adsorbed metal q t mg g eq 1 and the percentage removal r eq 2 of ni2 1 q t c i c t v m 2 r c i c e c e 100 where c i c t and c e mg l are the initial temporal and equilibrium concentrations of ni2 in the aqueous solution respectively v l is the volume of the solutions and m g is the weight of the adsorbent 2 6 experimental design the response surface methodology based on three variables and three levels box behnken design is used to investigate and optimize the adsorption study three factors including initial metal concentration adsorbent dosage and ph of the solution were selected as independent variables while the percentage of nickel removal was selected as a dependent variable the range and the level low 1 middle 0 and high 1 of these factors in numerical and coded values are given in table 1 all the values were chosen after preliminary experiments the following model is a polynomial equation eq 3 with different interactions used to predict the response r ni2 removal in

random error the analyses of the results the response surface plot optimum values and adequacy of the selected model were validated according to the analysis of variance anova statistics using minitab 2017 software 2 7 kinetic models the kinetic data of nickel adsorption on na mordenite was evaluated using three nonlinear mathematical reactions such as the pseudo first order pseudo second order and the fractional avrami model 2 7 1 pseudo first order kinetic model the pseudo first order model proposed by lagergren 1898 assumes that the adsorption occurs as a non reversible reaction its mathematical equation is represented as follows 4 q t q e 1 e x p k 1 t where q t mg g and q e mg g are the adsorption capacities at time t and equilibrium respectively k 1 min 1 is the rate constant of pseudo first order 2 7 2 pseudo second order kinetic model the pseudo second order model is an empirical reaction proposed by ho and mckay 1999 which assumes that the rate limiting step is chemisorption its equation is represented as follows 5 q t q e 2 k 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where q t mg g and q e mg g are the adsorption capacities at time t and equilibrium respectively k 2 g mg min is the rate constant of pseudo second order 2 7 3 avrami kinetic model the fractional avrami model was developed to explain particle nucleation but it has also been used to explain adsorption kinetics its equation is represented as follows avrami 1939 6 q t q a v 1 e x p k a v t n a v where q av mg g and k av min 1 are the adsorption capacity at equilibrium and the rate constant of the avrami model respectively n av is a constant that is related to the change in the adsorption mechanism cestari et al 2005 2 8 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms describe the relationship between the amount of heavy metals ions adsorbed at equilibrium and the residual equilibrium concentration in the solution at a constant temperature çanli and abali 2016 the experimental data has been analyzed using various isotherm models including langmuir freundlich redlich peterson and dubinin kaganer radushkevich isotherms 2 8 1 langmuir isotherm the langmuir isotherm is based on the assumption that the adsorption process is a monolayer with a homogenous adsorbent surface and no interaction between the adsorbates the langmuir isotherm is represented by the equation below langmuir 1918 7 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e where q e mg g and c e mg l are the adsorption capacity and solution concentration at equilibrium respectively q m mg g and k l mg l are langmuir constants corresponding to the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity and interaction between adsorbent adsorbat in the aqueous solution respectively 2 8 2 freundlich isotherm the freundlich isotherm assumes a multilayer adsorption process with adsorbent surface heterogeneity freundlich 1906 the equation that describes the freundlich isotherm is 8 q e k f c e 1 n where q e mg g and c e mg l are the adsorption capacity and solution concentration at equilibrium respectively k f mg g mg l n and n are freundlich constants that relate to adsorbent capacity and adsorption intensity respectively 2 8 3 redlich peterson isotherm the redlich peterson isotherm is a hybrid isotherm that combines both langmuir and freundlich isotherms in the adsorption process redlich and peterson 1959 its three parameter empirical equation is represented as follows 9 q e k r p c e 1 a r p c e β where q e mg g and c e mg l are the adsorption capacity and solution concentration at equilibrium respectively k rp l g and a rp mg l are redlich peterson constants β is the model exponent the value of β is between 0 and 1 when β is close to 0 then the redlich peterson isotherm tends to become the freundlich isotherm and when β is close to 1 then the redlich peterson isotherm tends to become the langmuir isotherm 2 8 4 dubinin kaganer radushkevich isotherm to determine whether the adsorption process is physical adsorption or an ion exchange process the d k r isotherm was used in this study its equation is as follows dubinin et al 1947 10 l n q e l n q m β ε 2 11 ε r t l n 1 1 c e where q e mol g and c e mol l are the adsorption capacity and solution concentration at equilibrium respectively q m mol g is the maximum adsorption capacity and β j2 mol2 is a constant q m and β represent the slope and intercept of lnq e versus ε 2 plot respectively r j mol k is the universal gas constant and t is the absolute temperature k the adsorption energy e kj mol can be computed by the following equation dubinin et al 1947 12 e 1 2 β 2 9 thermodynamic parameters the thermodynamic parameters were determined on the basis of the temperature dependent adsorption isotherms the gibbs free energy δg kj mol entropy δs kj mol k and enthalpy δh kj mol were calculated using the following equations dursun et al 2005 13 δ g r t l n q m 14 l n q m δ s r δ h r t where r j mol k is the universal gas constant t k is the absolute temperature and q m is the langmuir constant δh and δs are calculated from the slope and intercept of the plot ln q m versus 1 t 2 10 nonlinear regression the mathematical models eqs 15 17 proposed in this study concerning the isotherms and kinetics are nonlinear equations the suitable model was selected based on three statistical parameters correlation coefficient r2 adjusted correlation coefficient adjr2

routine isqnonlin is used to determine the parameters of the model all calculations are carried out using matlab 2015 2 11 equipments the x ray diffractograms xrd were obtained using the expert pro diffractometer system which was outfitted with cu kα radiation the measurement conditions were generator voltage of 40 kv a scan range of 5 80 and step sizes of 0 02 the mineralogical phases are identified and the crystallite structures are checked using xrd patterns the chemical composition of natural zeolite is determined using x ray fluorescence xrf spectroscopy the morphological properties of the zeolite sample before and after adsorption were studied using scanning electron microscopy sem of the jeol neoscope jcm 5000 type to evaluate the textural properties and check whether activation improved them the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm at 77 k bet specific surface area pore volume and average pore size were measured before and after activation using micromeritics 3flex surface characterization usa the temperature and degassing time were 260 c and 14 h respectively the ir spectra of each sample were measured with an atr mode on a thermo scientific nicolettmistm5 spectrometer in the 400 4000 cm 1 range the particle size distribution dls is measured in distilled water using a laser scattering particle size distribution analyzer la 960 horiba scientific na mordenite zeta potential measurements are carried out with a nanoparticle analyzer sz 100 horiba scientific 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorbent characterization the x ray diffraction xrd pattern of natural zeolite is shown in fig 1 by comparing the data collected and simulated to reference data selected in the crystallography open database cod it is possible to identify the phases present in this mineral it is found that the major mineralogical components are mordenite 60 with graphite and diopside as the main impurities the elemental chemical composition of algerian natural zeolite table 2 reveals the aluminosilicate nature of this mineral with a si al ratio 5 thus this natural zeolite can be classified as a high silica zeolite auerbach et al 2003 the main exchangeable cations of this mordenite were potassium calcium and sodium after activation with nacl solution the sodium content increased while the potassium and calcium contents decreased resulting in homo ionic na mordenite after adsorption it is clear that sodium content decreased while a new element nickel appeared suggesting the ion exchange process between sodium and nickel it can also be noticed that the binding of ni2 ions 0 71 on the zeolite led not only to the release of part of the na cations 0 96 from na mordenite but also to those of ti4 0 46 and much less of mg2 0 01 by reducing their contents in na mordenite ni2 the particle size distribution of na mordenite is shown in the supplementary material fig 1 s1 the na mordenite has a particle size range from 2 μm to 22 μm with an average diameter of 8 73 μm the ir spectra of mordenite na mordenite and na mordenite ni2 are shown in fig 2 it is observed that the main peaks characteristic of natural zeolite mordenite are present in the ir spectra and are in good agreement with those present in the literature auerbach et al 2003 çanli and abali 2016 x wang et al 2007 the strong vibrational bond at 1002 cm 1 represents the asymmetric stretching mode of the inner tetrahedral sio4 the two weak vibrational bonds at 791 and 721 cm 1 are assigned to symmetrical external and internal stretching respectively the weak band at 581 cm 1 is due to five membered mordenite rings the bands at 1630 and 3632 cm 1 are due to the presence of water on the surface of the zeolite and the o h stretching vibration of the lattice terminal silanol si oh respectively a slight shift was observed in na mordenite and na mordenite ni2 especially in the asymmetric bond of sio4 whereas the bond at 1002 cm 1 shifted to 997 cm 1 after activation and also shifted a second time to 1007 cm 1 after the adsorption of nickel the o h stretching of the silanol group at 3632 cm 1 was shifted to 3627 cm 1 after activation and no further change was observed after adsorption this shift may be due to charge compensating cations in the channels and cages of zeolite caused by the cation exchange process the bond at 1630 cm 1 of the water in na mordenite ni2 had disappeared because of heat treatment auerbach et al 2003 shukla et al 2009 in addition the increase in the wave number at 1007 cm 1 of the si o bond elongation of the silanol grouping is due to the increase in the bond length and electronegativity of oxygen as a result of the electrostatic attraction induced by oxygen on the adsorbed ni2 cation fig 3 shows sem micrographs of mordenite a na mordenite b and na mordenite ni2 c d as seen in fig 3 a natural mordenite has a wavy and rough surface after acid digestion and activation with nacl fig 3 b the surface becomes rougher and more porous indicating that the activation had a positive effect on the porosity improvement the morphology of the particles presents an irregular shape and different sizes the sizes of some particles found at sem were in the range of those obtained at dls fig 1 s1 after adsorption the morphology of the particles has changed they are more or less rounded fig 3 c broken and separated at ph 4 5 fig 3 d the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of mordenite and na mordenite are shown in fig 4 a and fig 4 b respectively and their textural parameters are listed in table 3 as described by the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac classification mordenite and na mordenite show a type iv isotherm with hysteresis loops indicating the mesoporous nature of the adsorbent see fig 5 besides a small amount of n2 adsorbed at a low relative pressure p p0 0 1 is observed suggesting the presence of a micropore structure whose characteristics are estimated by the t plot method and presented in table 3 conversely a strong adsorption of n2 at high values of relative pressure p p0 0 9 is observed suggesting the presence of a macropore structure therefore this adsorbent can be classified as a micro meso macroporous material musa et al 2011 zhong et al 2020 the barrett joyner halonda bjh method is used to determine the pore size distribution and volume it is found that mordenite and na mordenite have a pore size between 1 7 nm and 300 nm with a total pore volume of 0 32 and 0 45 cm3 g respectively as shown in table 3 sbet total pore volume and average pore size increased after activation na mordenite implying that activation improved the textural properties and thus the adsorption capacity hor et al 2016 the same results were observed by barragán p et al 2017 and l lin et al 2013 when they treated a local natural zeolite with nacl solution zeolite rich tuffs from mexico and natural zeolite from china the zeta potential values of na mordenite and na mordenite ni2 after adsorption are shown in supplementary material fig 2 s1 na mordenite has a negative value which indicates the negative charge of the na mordenite surface moreover the high value of zeta potential 54 4 mv indicates favorable adsorption of heavy metals because the more negative the zeta potential the higher the adsorption capacity he and xie 2018 after adsorption its value increased from 54 4 mv to 48 2 mv confirming the successful adsorption of nickel by electrostatic attraction and ion exchange process annadurai et al 2002 ghorbel abid et al 2016 he and xie 2018 the ph of na mordenite at the zero charge point phzpc was found to be 4 8 as shown in fig 0 5 indicating that at ph below 4 8 na mordenite has a positive surface and prefers anions adsorption whereas at ph above 4 8 negatively charged sites predominate and cation adsorption is preferred ahmad and mirza 2018 3 2 parameters optimization using bbd the response surface of box behnken design bbd with three factors 15 realized experiments and three center points was established in this study the working conditions as coded and real values with observed and predicted responses are presented in table 4 in order to confirm the adequacy of the model and the significance of each factor analyses of variance anova are required table 5 shows the anova statistics of the quadratic model used to predict the ni2 removals high f values f 0 05 and small p values p 0 05 indicate a significant terms while small f values and high p values p 0 05 indicate non significant terms singh and bhateria 2020 in this regard the model f value of 179 38 and p value 0 00 imply a high significance of the model in addition the lack of fit of the model was insignificant p 0 05 indeed an insignificant lack of fit indicates that the model best describes the experimental data davodi et al 2017 the high correlation coefficient r2 0 9969 also indicates that the model predictions are accurate as shown in fig 6 an almost straight line is observed when the predicted versus observed data has been plotted the predicted r2coefficient is an important parameter because it demonstrates how close the predicted response can be to the observed response in this study predr2 is very high 0 9780 and is in good agreement with adjusted r2 0 9914 ince and ince 2017 fig 7 a b c d shows the residual plot resulting from the model including normal probability residual versus predicted value residual histogram and residual versus order plot respectively it can be seen that the data points follow a normal distribution and are very close to a straight line furthermore the plot of the residuals versus the predicted value shows that the deviation between the experimental and predicted data is very small which confirms the validation of this model guo et al 2020 as a result the model used in this study is considered appropriate for predicting the optimal conditions of nickel adsorption in the na mordenite zeolite the quadratic model eq 18 used in this study to predict optimal conditions of the response nickel removal r is 18 r 37 00 0 1775 a 151 0 b 14 13 c 0 000296 a a 218 3 b b 1 273 c c 0 0495 a b 0 00129 a c 2

the effects of the independent variables on response efficiency follow this order a 30 213 b b 17 465 b 5 925 c 5 877 a a 2 90 a b 1 385 b c 1 225 a c 0 27 negative and positive values indicate antagonistic and synergistic effects respectively where factors having a positive effect need to be increased while those having a negative effect need to be reduced to achieve the best response singh and bhateria 2020 3 2 1 three dimensional 3d response surface and contour plot to study the effect of factor interactions on the adsorption efficiency a three dimensional 3d response surface and its equivalent contour plot were constructed by the model as shown in fig 8 the effect of the interaction between concentration and adsorbent quantity on the removal of ni2 r response is shown in fig 8 a b it is found that the initial concentration and adsorbent dosage have the greatest effect on nickel adsorption as the concentration increased the percent removal decreased unlike this it increased with an increasing amount of adsorbent in general the best results are obtained with a low concentration and a high adsorbent dosage indeed at a lower concentration more available sites in the adsorbent can bind to most nickel cations which may explain the increased removal efficiency however at higher concentrations the binding sites were saturated due to the presence of more cations in the solution and an insufficient number of sites to be occupied ghasemi et al 2014 kalantari et al 2014a 2014b the contour plot fig 8 b shows the range of interaction parameters in which the response is greater than 90 the optimal values of concentration and adsorbent dosage were found in the range of 10 31 mg l and 0 2 0 5 g l respectively fig 8 c d shows the interaction effect of ph and adsorbent dosage on ni2 removals it is clear that the solution ph also has a significant effect on the uptake of ni2 the percentage removal increased when the solution ph and adsorbent dosage increased the ph is an important parameter as it affects the charge of adsorbent binding sites and affects the solution chemistry of metal ions rahimi et al 2015 at a lower ph the removal percentage decreased because there were more h protons in the solution competing with ni2 for adsorbent active sites due to a repulsive force existing between them as the solution ph increases from 3 to 6 the percentage removal also increases up to 80 as seen in fig 8 d this improvement is due to the decrease in h ions in the solution and therefore to the decrease in competition between protons and nickel cations cabrera et al 2005 the results obtained are consistent with the previous studies irannajad and haghighi 2017 karatas 2012 vilvanathan shanthakumar 2017 yang et al 2011 the best response selected from the contour plot fig 8 d caused by the interaction between ph and adsorbent dosage is in the range of 80 90 with optimal ph and adsorbent dosage values in the range of 3 71 6 and 0 22 0 44 g l respectively consider fig 8 e f which represents the interaction effects of initial concentration and ph against the percentage removal of ni2 as mentioned earlier the percentage removal increases with increasing ph of the solution and decreasing initial concentration the best response up to 90 is observed when the ph of the solution and the initial concentration were 5 20 6 and 10 25 mg l respectively fig 08 f 3 2 2 optimal conditions the optimal values of the factors studied in this work initial concentration adsorbent dosage and ph are selected on the basis of the desirability function the desirability function is a mathematical method used to predict the maximum response corresponding to the optimal conditions the desirability value being between 0 and 1 where the higher the desirability value the better the expected response davodi et al 2017 essa et al 2014 table 7 shows the optimal values obtained by the model it was found that the maximum response predicted by the model was 96 94 under the following conditions initial concentration 10 mg l adsorbent dosage 0 32 g l and ph 5 27 under these conditions the experimental value was found to be 95 13 which is in good agreement with the predicted value 3 3 kinetic study in order to study the effect of contact time on the adsorption process and to find the equilibrium time the quantity adsorbed qt is calculated at different time intervals 0 180 min using the optimal conditions predicted by rsm the experimental data and the corresponding fitted proposed models are depicted in fig 9 based on the kinetic parameters presented in table 8 and as shown in fig 9 it is clear that the experimental data were better fitted by the avrami model which indicated the higher value of r2 adjr2 and the lower value of mse compared to the other models in addition the predicted adsorption capacity qav is in agreement with the experimental value qe 2 77 mg g therefore the nickel adsorption process on na mordenite may follow multiple kinetic orders and the adsorption mechanism may change during the contact time hossain et al 2013 njoku 2014 it can also be seen from fig 9 that this was a two step the first step starting from 0 to 40 min characterized by rapid removal due to the available active sites on the surface adsorbent and a second step from 40 min to 180 min with a slight increase in adsorption capacity due to the saturation of the active sites and the decrease in solution concentration ivanovic et al 2013 the desorption observed at certain points is called an inversion phenomenon which may be due to counter diffusion in the deeper layer of the zeolite sprynskyy et al 2006 the same phenomenon was observed by sprynskyy et al 2006 in the adsorption of nickel by the clinoptilolite zeolite 3 4 isotherm study in order to investigate the isotherms of this study the experimental data were calculated using the same optimal conditions predicted by the rsm but at different initial ion concentrations ranging from 10 to 200 mg l and at three different temperatures 20 40 and 60 c the isotherm parameters predicted by the suggested models at three temperatures namely 20 40 and 60 c are presented in table 9 and the corresponding fit is shown in fig 10 it can be seen that the redlich peterson isotherm best describes the experimental data at all three temperatures which is reflected in the high value of r2 adjr2 and the low value of mse the results obtained for the langmuir and freundlich isotherms are also very close to the redlich peterson isotherm indicating the validation of both isotherms in this adsorption study therefore the nature of the adsorption isotherm is a combination of the langmuir and freundlich isotherms and is consistent with the results obtained in the kinetic study which indicates the change in the adsorption process to confirm the favorability of the adsorption process the values of the exponent n predicted by the freundlich isotherm must be between 1 and 10 for favorable adsorption emami moghaddama et al 2020 as can be seen in table 9 the values of n at the three temperatures are between 1 and 10 indicating favorable adsorption the isotherm parameters of the d k r model are summarized in supplementary material table 2 s2 and fig 10 c shows their fit at three temperatures 20 40 and 60 c as shown in table 2 s2 the adsorption energy values of 9 22 9 28 and 12 51 kj mol at the three temperatures 20 40 and 60 c are in the 8 16 kj mol range indicating the nature of the ions exchange process of nickel adsorption by na mordenite erdem et al 2004 as a complementary study the isotherms of this study were predicted using the model s mathematical equation bbd eq 18 indeed for a given ph eq 18 provides a percentage removal of nickel as a function of the initial solution concentration and the amount of adsorbent from this percentage eq 2 allows to calculate ce and eq 1 allows calculating qe the predicted data as well as the corresponding parameters and their fitting are presented in the supplementary material s3 s4 3 5 thermodynamic study the thermodynamic parameters are presented in table 11 the negative values of δg at all temperatures suggest the spontaneous nature of the adsorption process in addition the decrease in the value of δg with increasing the temperature of the solution indicates better adsorption at a higher temperature the positive value of δh reflects the endothermic nature of nickel adsorption by na mordenite where the adsorption capacity has increased with increasing temperature this increase may be due to the increasing of the mobility of the ions in the solution and therefore the increased of diffusion rate of nickel ions the positive value of δs indicates increased randomness in the adsorption process irandoost et al 2019 jorfi et al 2019 mahmoodi saffar dastgerdi 2018 4 conclusion summing up the results it can be concluded that mordenite zeolite is the main mineralogical phase of this mineral the latter is activated and used as an adsorbent to remove nickel ions in aqueous solution na mordenite exhibited higher values for specific surface area total pore volume and average pore size compared to mordenite showing that activation has improved textural properties box benkhen design was used as a statistical approach to optimize the adsorption parameters it is found that the model best predicted the experimental data with a high correlation coefficient r2 0 99 the avrami model and the redlich peterson isotherm best expressed the experimental results of kinetic and isotherm studies the maximum adsorption capacity predicted by the langmuir isotherm was found to be 36 79 mg g at 60 c the thermodynamic study revealed the spontaneous and endothermic nature of this specific adsorption mechanism with more favorable adsorption at high temperatures ion exchange and electrostatic interaction both contribute to the adsorption mechanism clearly further

11848,in this study a natural algerian zeolite of the mordenite type was activated and tested for nickel adsorption in aqueous solution na mordenite was characterized by different techniques such as x ray diffraction xrd and scanning electron microscopy sem brunauer emmett teller bet analysis shows that this mineral was a micro meso macroporous material with a high specific surface area sbet 124 95 m2 g and a total pore volume of 0 45 cm3 g box behnken design bbd was used to optimize the adsorption process the optimal conditions predicted by the model were initial concentration 10 mg l adsorbent

studies revealed that the avrami kinetic model and redlich peterson isotherm best expressed the experimental data based on the x ray fluorescence results and zeta potential measurements the mechanism of nickel adsorption by na mordenite appears to be an electrostatic and ion exchange process graphical abstract image 1 keywords na mordenite box behnken design adsorption heavy metals optimization natural zeolite 1 introduction in recent decades there has been a significant increase in the number of factories that employ heavy metals as a basic material in their industries such as metallurgy electroplating batteries manufacturing and mining in return their hazardous waste is dumped directly into the aquatic stream without being treated this is currently posing a real danger to the natural environment and human beings kumar et al 2019 w lin et al 2020 nickel is a toxic and carcinogenic metal it is one of the most soluble ions found in waste streams the world health organization who sets a nickel limit of 0 01 mg l in drinking water and a nickel discharge limit of 2 mg l in wastewater exposure to this metal at high concentration causes kidney and lung damage as well as shortness of breath vomiting nose and skin dermatitis heidari et al 2020 jafari and bandarchian 2017 vilvanathan shanthakumar 2017 yildiz 2018 several physical and chemical methods are currently used to remove heavy metals from wastewater and industrial effluents such as chemical precipitation membrane separation solvent extraction and coagulation a criterion for choosing between these methods is the concentration range of the solution to be treated and the target concentration of the treated effluent precipitation can for instance be very interesting in the case of concentrated solutions but the limit of the treatment will be linked to the residual solubility of the compounds for membrane processes conditions required to avoid membrane fouling should also be considered finally the cost of the treatment and the possible generation of by products must also be taken into account in the case of solutions that contain heavy metals adsorption has often proven to be a simple cheap and highly successful process treatment igder et al 2018 irannajad and kamran haghighi 2021 parveen et al 2019 in recent years several materials have been used as adsorbents for nickel removal in aqueous solutions such as oyster shell powder hsu 2009 cancrinite type zeolite qiu and zheng 2009 natural zeolite clinoptilolite çanli and abali 2016 chitosan sporopollenin microcapsules sargin and arslan 2015 activated carbon aboli et al 2020 and electroplating sludge waste peng et al 2019 but it remains the choice of the adsorbent that determines the possibility of its use in industrial applications as it must be efficient non toxic available and cheaper hsu 2009 among the materials that meet these conditions natural zeolite is a hydrated aluminosilicate mineral with porous structures its framework structure is constructed from three dimensional tetrahedral to4 where t is a centrally occupied silicon or aluminum atom surrounded by four oxygen atoms these tetrahedral elements are connected to each other by covalent bonds that form cages cavities and channels koningsveld 2007 widiastuti et al 2019 the surface of zeolite has a negative charge resulting from the isomorphic substitution of si 4 by al 3 which is balanced by exchangeable cations alkali or alkaline earth metals namely sodium calcium potassium and magnesium these ions have the ability to exchange with heavy metals therefore natural zeolite is a promising adsorbent for heavy metals removal via ion exchange or electrostatic attraction s wang and peng 2010 yang et al 2011 the adsorption process is affected by several factors such as ph temperature ionic strength concentration and adsorbent dosage x wang et al 2007 as a result the parameters of the adsorption process must be optimized to find the best response in fact the classical method used to optimize the adsorption process in many studies is based on varying one parameter and fixing the other however this method is time consuming and requires a large number of experiments recently many researchers have used response surface methodology rsm as an alternative to the classical method to optimize the adsorption process rsm is a set of mathematical and statistical techniques used to study the effect of the interaction of factors on experiment response and to predict the optimal conditions its advantage is that it reduces the number of experiments and laboratory work anfar et al 2019 danmaliki et al 2016 mondal et al 2017 algeria has a large reserve of zeolitic tuffs particularly in the north east of the country where mordenite zeolite is the dominant mineral with the recent expansion of industrial activities especially metal based industries the development of low cost adsorbents for the removal of heavy metals from wastewater and industrial effluents has become necessary algerian mordenite zeolite is a low cost abundant and non toxic material that has not been previously exploited for heavy metals adsorption moreover each natural zeolite in different regions has its own characteristics depending on the sources of its geological formation which needs to be studied individually alshameri et al 2014 thus the investigation of the ability of this local zeolite to adsorb heavy metals is the focus of this study the main objective of this paper is to optimize the adsorption of nickel by the natural algerian activated zeolite na mordenite to the best of our knowledge this zeolite was tested for the first time for the adsorption of heavy metals the mordenite was activated and used as an adsorbent for the removal of nickel from aqueous solution the na mordenite was identified and characterized by different analytical techniques x ray diffraction fourier transform infrared spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy dynamic light scattering and brunauer emmett teller adsorption of nickel on na mordenite was performed using the box benkhen design as a type of rsm with three levels and three factors initial concentration amount of adsorbent and ph this experimental design model was applied to study the effects of the interactions of the elimination parameters and to find the optimal conditions for the nickel adsorption process in order to determine the nature and mechanism of the adsorption process the kinetic adsorption isotherm and thermodynamic parameters are also investigated in this study 2 material and methods 2 1 adsorbent the natural mineral used was an algerian zeolite collected from a deposit in bejaia east of algeria firstly the bulk sample was crushed to a particle size of 2 mm quartered and then sieved through several sieves 2 mm to 125 μm two fractions the whole sample and 125 μm were evaluated in this investigation both fractions were dry milled for 2 min at 700 rpm with a pulverisette 9 vibrating cup mill fritsch the fraction 125 μm was used in the experiments since it has a high zeolite content 2 2 adsorbate and chemicals nickel sulphate 6 hydrate niso4 6h2o 99 salt was purchased from riedel de haën sodium chloride nacl 99 5 silver nitrate agno3 99 5 and sodium hydroxide pellets naoh 97 were supplied by biochem chemopharma nitric acid hno3 52 5 was purchased from prolabo all chemicals used were laboratory reagents except silver nitrate and nitric acid an analytical reagent distilled water was used to prepare all solutions 2 3 activation of zeolite the zeolite was activated according to the method prepared by solache ríos et al 2015 with some modifications 4 5 g was weighed and purified with 1 0 mol l hno3 for 4 h at room temperature to remove the soluble impurity s wang and peng 2010 after 8 days in a 5 m nacl solution the zeolite was filtered washed with distilled water until no chloride ions were detected agno3 test and dried at 60 c for 24 h 2 4 point of zero charge the ph of zero point charge phzpc of the adsorbent was determined according to keshvardoostchokami et al 2017 in which a series of 100 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 ml of 0 005 mol l nacl solution were prepared and their solution ph was adjusted between 3 and 10 using 0 1 mol l hno3 or naoh solutions 0 05 g of adsorbent was added to each prepared solution and stirred for 48 h the phi was plotted against the difference between the initial and final ph values dph phf phi the phzpc was determined by the point of intersection of the resulting curve where dph 0 2 5 batch adsorption studies the stock solution 1 g l of ni2 is prepared by dissolving the desired amount of nickel sulphate niso4 6h2o in distilled water the other concentrations of ni2 are prepared by diluting the stock solution the adsorbent content 0 1 0 5 g l is added to a 250 ml beaker at 25 c containing 100 ml of working concentration in the experimental design range 10 150 mg l naoh and hno3 solutions 0 1 mol l are used to adjust the solution ph 3 6 the time and shaking speed are fixed at 3 h and 200 rpm respectively after each experiment the solution is filtered by a syringe filter 0 45 μm pvdf and the residual concentration of ni2 was determined by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer ice 3000 series aas thermo scientific mass balance is used to calculate the amount of adsorbed metal q t mg g eq 1 and the percentage removal r eq 2 of ni2 1 q t c i c t v m 2 r c i c e c e 100 where c i c t and c e mg l are the initial temporal and equilibrium concentrations of ni2 in the aqueous solution respectively v l is the volume of the solutions and m g is the weight of the adsorbent 2 6 experimental design the response surface methodology based on three variables and three levels box behnken design is used to investigate and optimize the adsorption study three factors including initial metal concentration adsorbent dosage and ph of the solution were selected as independent variables while the percentage of nickel removal was selected as a dependent variable the range and the level low 1 middle 0 and high 1 of these factors in numerical and coded values are given in table 1 all the values were chosen after preliminary experiments the following model is a polynomial equation eq 3 with different interactions used to predict the response r ni2 removal in

random error the analyses of the results the response surface plot optimum values and adequacy of the selected model were validated according to the analysis of variance anova statistics using minitab 2017 software 2 7 kinetic models the kinetic data of nickel adsorption on na mordenite was evaluated using three nonlinear mathematical reactions such as the pseudo first order pseudo second order and the fractional avrami model 2 7 1 pseudo first order kinetic model the pseudo first order model proposed by lagergren 1898 assumes that the adsorption occurs as a non reversible reaction its mathematical equation is represented as follows 4 q t q e 1 e x p k 1 t where q t mg g and q e mg g are the adsorption capacities at time t and equilibrium respectively k 1 min 1 is the rate constant of pseudo first order 2 7 2 pseudo second order kinetic model the pseudo second order model is an empirical reaction proposed by ho and mckay 1999 which assumes that the rate limiting step is chemisorption its equation is represented as follows 5 q t q e 2 k 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where q t mg g and q e mg g are the adsorption capacities at time t and equilibrium respectively k 2 g mg min is the rate constant of pseudo second order 2 7 3 avrami kinetic model the fractional avrami model was developed to explain particle nucleation but it has also been used to explain adsorption kinetics its equation is represented as follows avrami 1939 6 q t q a v 1 e x p k a v t n a v where q av mg g and k av min 1 are the adsorption capacity at equilibrium and the rate constant of the avrami model respectively n av is a constant that is related to the change in the adsorption mechanism cestari et al 2005 2 8 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms describe the relationship between the amount of heavy metals ions adsorbed at equilibrium and the residual equilibrium concentration in the solution at a constant temperature çanli and abali 2016 the experimental data has been analyzed using various isotherm models including langmuir freundlich redlich peterson and dubinin kaganer radushkevich isotherms 2 8 1 langmuir isotherm the langmuir isotherm is based on the assumption that the adsorption process is a monolayer with a homogenous adsorbent surface and no interaction between the adsorbates the langmuir isotherm is represented by the equation below langmuir 1918 7 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e where q e mg g and c e mg l are the adsorption capacity and solution concentration at equilibrium respectively q m mg g and k l mg l are langmuir constants corresponding to the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity and interaction between adsorbent adsorbat in the aqueous solution respectively 2 8 2 freundlich isotherm the freundlich isotherm assumes a multilayer adsorption process with adsorbent surface heterogeneity freundlich 1906 the equation that describes the freundlich isotherm is 8 q e k f c e 1 n where q e mg g and c e mg l are the adsorption capacity and solution concentration at equilibrium respectively k f mg g mg l n and n are freundlich constants that relate to adsorbent capacity and adsorption intensity respectively 2 8 3 redlich peterson isotherm the redlich peterson isotherm is a hybrid isotherm that combines both langmuir and freundlich isotherms in the adsorption process redlich and peterson 1959 its three parameter empirical equation is represented as follows 9 q e k r p c e 1 a r p c e β where q e mg g and c e mg l are the adsorption capacity and solution concentration at equilibrium respectively k rp l g and a rp mg l are redlich peterson constants β is the model exponent the value of β is between 0 and 1 when β is close to 0 then the redlich peterson isotherm tends to become the freundlich isotherm and when β is close to 1 then the redlich peterson isotherm tends to become the langmuir isotherm 2 8 4 dubinin kaganer radushkevich isotherm to determine whether the adsorption process is physical adsorption or an ion exchange process the d k r isotherm was used in this study its equation is as follows dubinin et al 1947 10 l n q e l n q m β ε 2 11 ε r t l n 1 1 c e where q e mol g and c e mol l are the adsorption capacity and solution concentration at equilibrium respectively q m mol g is the maximum adsorption capacity and β j2 mol2 is a constant q m and β represent the slope and intercept of lnq e versus ε 2 plot respectively r j mol k is the universal gas constant and t is the absolute temperature k the adsorption energy e kj mol can be computed by the following equation dubinin et al 1947 12 e 1 2 β 2 9 thermodynamic parameters the thermodynamic parameters were determined on the basis of the temperature dependent adsorption isotherms the gibbs free energy δg kj mol entropy δs kj mol k and enthalpy δh kj mol were calculated using the following equations dursun et al 2005 13 δ g r t l n q m 14 l n q m δ s r δ h r t where r j mol k is the universal gas constant t k is the absolute temperature and q m is the langmuir constant δh and δs are calculated from the slope and intercept of the plot ln q m versus 1 t 2 10 nonlinear regression the mathematical models eqs 15 17 proposed in this study concerning the isotherms and kinetics are nonlinear equations the suitable model was selected based on three statistical parameters correlation coefficient r2 adjusted correlation coefficient adjr2

routine isqnonlin is used to determine the parameters of the model all calculations are carried out using matlab 2015 2 11 equipments the x ray diffractograms xrd were obtained using the expert pro diffractometer system which was outfitted with cu kα radiation the measurement conditions were generator voltage of 40 kv a scan range of 5 80 and step sizes of 0 02 the mineralogical phases are identified and the crystallite structures are checked using xrd patterns the chemical composition of natural zeolite is determined using x ray fluorescence xrf spectroscopy the morphological properties of the zeolite sample before and after adsorption were studied using scanning electron microscopy sem of the jeol neoscope jcm 5000 type to evaluate the textural properties and check whether activation improved them the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm at 77 k bet specific surface area pore volume and average pore size were measured before and after activation using micromeritics 3flex surface characterization usa the temperature and degassing time were 260 c and 14 h respectively the ir spectra of each sample were measured with an atr mode on a thermo scientific nicolettmistm5 spectrometer in the 400 4000 cm 1 range the particle size distribution dls is measured in distilled water using a laser scattering particle size distribution analyzer la 960 horiba scientific na mordenite zeta potential measurements are carried out with a nanoparticle analyzer sz 100 horiba scientific 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorbent characterization the x ray diffraction xrd pattern of natural zeolite is shown in fig 1 by comparing the data collected and simulated to reference data selected in the crystallography open database cod it is possible to identify the phases present in this mineral it is found that the major mineralogical components are mordenite 60 with graphite and diopside as the main impurities the elemental chemical composition of algerian natural zeolite table 2 reveals the aluminosilicate nature of this mineral with a si al ratio 5 thus this natural zeolite can be classified as a high silica zeolite auerbach et al 2003 the main exchangeable cations of this mordenite were potassium calcium and sodium after activation with nacl solution the sodium content increased while the potassium and calcium contents decreased resulting in homo ionic na mordenite after adsorption it is clear that sodium content decreased while a new element nickel appeared suggesting the ion exchange process between sodium and nickel it can also be noticed that the binding of ni2 ions 0 71 on the zeolite led not only to the release of part of the na cations 0 96 from na mordenite but also to those of ti4 0 46 and much less of mg2 0 01 by reducing their contents in na mordenite ni2 the particle size distribution of na mordenite is shown in the supplementary material fig 1 s1 the na mordenite has a particle size range from 2 μm to 22 μm with an average diameter of 8 73 μm the ir spectra of mordenite na mordenite and na mordenite ni2 are shown in fig 2 it is observed that the main peaks characteristic of natural zeolite mordenite are present in the ir spectra and are in good agreement with those present in the literature auerbach et al 2003 çanli and abali 2016 x wang et al 2007 the strong vibrational bond at 1002 cm 1 represents the asymmetric stretching mode of the inner tetrahedral sio4 the two weak vibrational bonds at 791 and 721 cm 1 are assigned to symmetrical external and internal stretching respectively the weak band at 581 cm 1 is due to five membered mordenite rings the bands at 1630 and 3632 cm 1 are due to the presence of water on the surface of the zeolite and the o h stretching vibration of the lattice terminal silanol si oh respectively a slight shift was observed in na mordenite and na mordenite ni2 especially in the asymmetric bond of sio4 whereas the bond at 1002 cm 1 shifted to 997 cm 1 after activation and also shifted a second time to 1007 cm 1 after the adsorption of nickel the o h stretching of the silanol group at 3632 cm 1 was shifted to 3627 cm 1 after activation and no further change was observed after adsorption this shift may be due to charge compensating cations in the channels and cages of zeolite caused by the cation exchange process the bond at 1630 cm 1 of the water in na mordenite ni2 had disappeared because of heat treatment auerbach et al 2003 shukla et al 2009 in addition the increase in the wave number at 1007 cm 1 of the si o bond elongation of the silanol grouping is due to the increase in the bond length and electronegativity of oxygen as a result of the electrostatic attraction induced by oxygen on the adsorbed ni2 cation fig 3 shows sem micrographs of mordenite a na mordenite b and na mordenite ni2 c d as seen in fig 3 a natural mordenite has a wavy and rough surface after acid digestion and activation with nacl fig 3 b the surface becomes rougher and more porous indicating that the activation had a positive effect on the porosity improvement the morphology of the particles presents an irregular shape and different sizes the sizes of some particles found at sem were in the range of those obtained at dls fig 1 s1 after adsorption the morphology of the particles has changed they are more or less rounded fig 3 c broken and separated at ph 4 5 fig 3 d the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of mordenite and na mordenite are shown in fig 4 a and fig 4 b respectively and their textural parameters are listed in table 3 as described by the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac classification mordenite and na mordenite show a type iv isotherm with hysteresis loops indicating the mesoporous nature of the adsorbent see fig 5 besides a small amount of n2 adsorbed at a low relative pressure p p0 0 1 is observed suggesting the presence of a micropore structure whose characteristics are estimated by the t plot method and presented in table 3 conversely a strong adsorption of n2 at high values of relative pressure p p0 0 9 is observed suggesting the presence of a macropore structure therefore this adsorbent can be classified as a micro meso macroporous material musa et al 2011 zhong et al 2020 the barrett joyner halonda bjh method is used to determine the pore size distribution and volume it is found that mordenite and na mordenite have a pore size between 1 7 nm and 300 nm with a total pore volume of 0 32 and 0 45 cm3 g respectively as shown in table 3 sbet total pore volume and average pore size increased after activation na mordenite implying that activation improved the textural properties and thus the adsorption capacity hor et al 2016 the same results were observed by barragán p et al 2017 and l lin et al 2013 when they treated a local natural zeolite with nacl solution zeolite rich tuffs from mexico and natural zeolite from china the zeta potential values of na mordenite and na mordenite ni2 after adsorption are shown in supplementary material fig 2 s1 na mordenite has a negative value which indicates the negative charge of the na mordenite surface moreover the high value of zeta potential 54 4 mv indicates favorable adsorption of heavy metals because the more negative the zeta potential the higher the adsorption capacity he and xie 2018 after adsorption its value increased from 54 4 mv to 48 2 mv confirming the successful adsorption of nickel by electrostatic attraction and ion exchange process annadurai et al 2002 ghorbel abid et al 2016 he and xie 2018 the ph of na mordenite at the zero charge point phzpc was found to be 4 8 as shown in fig 0 5 indicating that at ph below 4 8 na mordenite has a positive surface and prefers anions adsorption whereas at ph above 4 8 negatively charged sites predominate and cation adsorption is preferred ahmad and mirza 2018 3 2 parameters optimization using bbd the response surface of box behnken design bbd with three factors 15 realized experiments and three center points was established in this study the working conditions as coded and real values with observed and predicted responses are presented in table 4 in order to confirm the adequacy of the model and the significance of each factor analyses of variance anova are required table 5 shows the anova statistics of the quadratic model used to predict the ni2 removals high f values f 0 05 and small p values p 0 05 indicate a significant terms while small f values and high p values p 0 05 indicate non significant terms singh and bhateria 2020 in this regard the model f value of 179 38 and p value 0 00 imply a high significance of the model in addition the lack of fit of the model was insignificant p 0 05 indeed an insignificant lack of fit indicates that the model best describes the experimental data davodi et al 2017 the high correlation coefficient r2 0 9969 also indicates that the model predictions are accurate as shown in fig 6 an almost straight line is observed when the predicted versus observed data has been plotted the predicted r2coefficient is an important parameter because it demonstrates how close the predicted response can be to the observed response in this study predr2 is very high 0 9780 and is in good agreement with adjusted r2 0 9914 ince and ince 2017 fig 7 a b c d shows the residual plot resulting from the model including normal probability residual versus predicted value residual histogram and residual versus order plot respectively it can be seen that the data points follow a normal distribution and are very close to a straight line furthermore the plot of the residuals versus the predicted value shows that the deviation between the experimental and predicted data is very small which confirms the validation of this model guo et al 2020 as a result the model used in this study is considered appropriate for predicting the optimal conditions of nickel adsorption in the na mordenite zeolite the quadratic model eq 18 used in this study to predict optimal conditions of the response nickel removal r is 18 r 37 00 0 1775 a 151 0 b 14 13 c 0 000296 a a 218 3 b b 1 273 c c 0 0495 a b 0 00129 a c 2

and bhateria 2020 3 2 1 three dimensional 3d response surface and contour plot to study the effect of factor interactions on the adsorption efficiency a three dimensional 3d response surface and its equivalent contour plot were constructed by the model as shown in fig 8 the effect of the interaction between concentration and adsorbent quantity on the removal of ni2 r response is shown in fig 8 a b it is found that the initial concentration and adsorbent dosage have the greatest effect on nickel adsorption as the concentration increased the percent removal decreased unlike this it increased with an increasing amount of adsorbent in general the best results are obtained with a low concentration and a high adsorbent dosage indeed at a lower concentration more available sites in the adsorbent can bind to most nickel cations which may explain the increased removal efficiency however at higher concentrations the binding sites were saturated due to the presence of more cations in the solution and an insufficient number of sites to be occupied ghasemi et al 2014 kalantari et al 2014a 2014b the contour plot fig 8 b shows the range of interaction parameters in which the response is greater than 90 the optimal values of concentration and adsorbent dosage were found in the range of 10 31 mg l and 0 2 0 5 g l respectively fig 8 c d shows the interaction effect of ph and adsorbent dosage on ni2 removals it is clear that the solution ph also has a significant effect on the uptake of ni2 the percentage removal increased when the solution ph and adsorbent dosage increased the ph is an important parameter as it affects the charge of adsorbent binding sites and affects the solution chemistry of metal ions rahimi et al 2015 at a lower ph the removal percentage decreased because there were more h protons in the solution competing with ni2 for adsorbent active sites due to a repulsive force existing between them as the solution ph increases from 3 to 6 the percentage removal also increases up to 80 as seen in fig 8 d this improvement is due to the decrease in h ions in the solution and therefore to the decrease in competition between protons and nickel cations cabrera et al 2005 the results obtained are consistent with the previous studies irannajad and haghighi 2017 karatas 2012 vilvanathan shanthakumar 2017 yang et al 2011 the best response selected from the contour plot fig 8 d caused by the interaction between ph and adsorbent dosage is in the range of 80 90 with optimal ph and adsorbent dosage values in the range of 3 71 6 and 0 22 0 44 g l respectively consider fig 8 e f which represents the interaction effects of initial concentration and ph against the percentage removal of ni2 as mentioned earlier the percentage removal increases with increasing ph of the solution and decreasing initial concentration the best response up to 90 is observed when the ph of the solution and the initial concentration were 5 20 6 and 10 25 mg l respectively fig 08 f 3 2 2 optimal conditions the optimal values of the factors studied in this work initial concentration adsorbent dosage and ph are selected on the basis of the desirability function the desirability function is a mathematical method used to predict the maximum response corresponding to the optimal conditions the desirability value being between 0 and 1 where the higher the desirability value the better the expected response davodi et al 2017 essa et al 2014 table 7 shows the optimal values obtained by the model it was found that the maximum response predicted by the model was 96 94 under the following conditions initial concentration 10 mg l adsorbent dosage 0 32 g l and ph 5 27 under these conditions the experimental value was found to be 95 13 which is in good agreement with the predicted value 3 3 kinetic study in order to study the effect of contact time on the adsorption process and to find the equilibrium time the quantity adsorbed qt is calculated at different time intervals 0 180 min using the optimal conditions predicted by rsm the experimental data and the corresponding fitted proposed models are depicted in fig 9 based on the kinetic parameters presented in table 8 and as shown in fig 9 it is clear that the experimental data were better fitted by the avrami model which indicated the higher value of r2 adjr2 and the lower value of mse compared to the other models in addition the predicted adsorption capacity qav is in agreement with the experimental value qe 2 77 mg g therefore the nickel adsorption process on na mordenite may follow multiple kinetic orders and the adsorption mechanism may change during the contact time hossain et al 2013 njoku 2014 it can also be seen from fig 9 that this was a two step the first step starting from 0 to 40 min characterized by rapid removal due to the available active sites on the surface adsorbent and a second step from 40 min to 180 min with a slight increase in adsorption capacity due to the saturation of the active sites and the decrease in solution concentration ivanovic et al 2013 the desorption observed at certain points is called an inversion phenomenon which may be due to counter diffusion in the deeper layer of the zeolite sprynskyy et al 2006 the same phenomenon was observed by sprynskyy et al 2006 in the adsorption of nickel by the clinoptilolite zeolite 3 4 isotherm study in order to investigate the isotherms of this study the experimental data were calculated using the same optimal conditions predicted by the rsm but at different initial ion concentrations ranging from 10 to 200 mg l and at three different temperatures 20 40 and 60 c the isotherm parameters predicted by the suggested models at three temperatures namely 20 40 and 60 c are presented in table 9 and the corresponding fit is shown in fig 10 it can be seen that the redlich peterson isotherm best describes the experimental data at all three temperatures which is reflected in the high value of r2 adjr2 and the low value of mse the results obtained for the langmuir and freundlich isotherms are also very close to the redlich peterson isotherm indicating the validation of both isotherms in this adsorption study therefore the nature of the adsorption isotherm is a combination of the langmuir and freundlich isotherms and is consistent with the results obtained in the kinetic study which indicates the change in the adsorption process to confirm the favorability of the adsorption process the values of the exponent n predicted by the freundlich isotherm must be between 1 and 10 for favorable adsorption emami moghaddama et al 2020 as can be seen in table 9 the values of n at the three temperatures are between 1 and 10 indicating favorable adsorption the isotherm parameters of the d k r model are summarized in supplementary material table 2 s2 and fig 10 c shows their fit at three temperatures 20 40 and 60 c as shown in table 2 s2 the adsorption energy values of 9 22 9 28 and 12 51 kj mol at the three temperatures 20 40 and 60 c are in the 8 16 kj mol range indicating the nature of the ions exchange process of nickel adsorption by na mordenite erdem et al 2004 as a complementary study the isotherms of this study were predicted using the model s mathematical equation bbd eq 18 indeed for a given ph eq 18 provides a percentage removal of nickel as a function of the initial solution concentration and the amount of adsorbent from this percentage eq 2 allows to calculate ce and eq 1 allows calculating qe the predicted data as well as the corresponding parameters and their fitting are presented in the supplementary material s3 s4 3 5 thermodynamic study the thermodynamic parameters are presented in table 11 the negative values of δg at all temperatures suggest the spontaneous nature of the adsorption process in addition the decrease in the value of δg with increasing the temperature of the solution indicates better adsorption at a higher temperature the positive value of δh reflects the endothermic nature of nickel adsorption by na mordenite where the adsorption capacity has increased with increasing temperature this increase may be due to the increasing of the mobility of the ions in the solution and therefore the increased of diffusion rate of nickel ions the positive value of δs indicates increased randomness in the adsorption process irandoost et al 2019 jorfi et al 2019 mahmoodi saffar dastgerdi 2018 4 conclusion summing up the results it can be concluded that mordenite zeolite is the main mineralogical phase of this mineral the latter is activated and used as an adsorbent to remove nickel ions in aqueous solution na mordenite exhibited higher values for specific surface area total pore volume and average pore size compared to mordenite showing that activation has improved textural properties box benkhen design was used as a statistical approach to optimize the adsorption parameters it is found that the model best predicted the experimental data with a high correlation coefficient r2 0 99 the avrami model and the redlich peterson isotherm best expressed the experimental results of kinetic and isotherm studies the maximum adsorption capacity predicted by the langmuir isotherm was found to be 36 79 mg g at 60 c the thermodynamic study revealed the spontaneous and endothermic nature of this specific adsorption mechanism with more favorable adsorption at high temperatures ion exchange and electrostatic interaction both contribute to the adsorption mechanism clearly further

were extracted by using the principal component analysis and varimax rotation jha et al 2009 2 5 water quality index wqi 2 5 1 general introduction and importance wqi is used for the comparative evaluation of water pollution it represents the overall water quality status in a single value which helps select suitable treatment techniques to combat the concerning issues joshi et al 2009 tyagi et al 2013 water quality analysis is usually concerned with the quality of natural water and its potential applications drinking irrigation domestic and industries in practice monitoring the characteristics of many pollution sources entering surface water bodies and groundwater systems is costly and time consuming furthermore many academics and scientists have struggled to describe and address water unified and straightforwardly these issues arise due to the complexities of water quality measurements and the extensive range of criteria used to characterize the state of water quality in water resources akhtar et al 2021 the effect of various aspects that describe water quality and the difficulties in categorizing the major characteristics used to quantify the health of water resources quantitatively are extremely difficult to comprehend as a result the water quality index wqi is regarded as a mathematical instrument that considerably reduces the complexity of water quality data sets while providing a single categorizing value that describes the water quality state of water bodies or the degree of pollution tripathi and singal 2019 wqi can prove to be an essential tool since it can be used for awareness of the general public and policymakers which may help enhance water quality therefore the present study was conducted to determine the impact of mass bathing during kumbh 2019 on water quality in terms of wqi 2 5 2 wqi calculation weighted arithmetic index wqi was calculated for the determination of water quality status using the formula chandra et al 2017 w q i w n q n w n where wn unit weight for the nth parameter qn quality rating for the nth water quality parameter the water quality is divided into 5 different categories excellent 0 25 good 26 50 poor 51 75 very poor 76 100 and unsuitable for drinking 100 by using wqi value sharma et al 2017 3 result and discussion the mean concentration and the standard deviation of water quality parameters are given in table 1 the boxplots for physicochemical parameters and mpn count showing their variation during the kumbh 2019 are given in fig 3 a and b ph is one of the most significant parameters and its higher values correspond to the high concentration of hco3 and other bases annapoorna and janardhana 2015 the ph of the water samples was in the alkaline range and about 84 of the collected samples showed ph value above the permissible limit 6 5 8 5 recommended by world health organizations who 2006 table 1 this alkaline nature indicates that the water was well buffered bhasin et al 2015 the ph value did not show significant variation p 0 05 during the kumbh event however a higher mean value was observed during the post kumbh period table 2 and fig 3a the use of soap and detergents during the mass bathing events may cause an increase in the ph of water bodies due to their higher ph value tarun et al 2014 jani et al 2018 also reported similar behavior of ph during the mass bathing event on the godavari river electrical conductivity is used to determine salinity and measure the rate at which an electric current can pass through a solution ec values range between 50 and 1500 μs cm for natural water matta kumar 2015 ec values varied from 348 to 751 μs cm and showed significant variation p 0 05 during the kumbh event table 1 table 2 the ec value was relatively higher during the pre kumbh period and its value decreased during the kumbh and post kumbh periods fig 3a low ec value during the kumbh period can be attributed to the discharge of additional water in the ganga river released by the tehri dam mani 2019 the observed ec values were well within the permissible limit of 1000 μs cm given by the environmental protection agency epa 2001 for drinking water table 1 tds refers to the sum of all major cations na k ca2 mg2 anions cl so4 2 po4 3 hco3 dissolved organic matter and dissolved silica kim and hunter 2001 the tds concentration ranged between 210 and 545 mg l 1 and showed significant variation p 0 05 during the kumbh 2019 table 1 table 2 tds concentration usually increases during the mass bathing event due to organic matter and dissolved nutrients purohit et al 2020 however in the case of kumbh 2019 the tds concentration was relatively lower during the kumbh and post kumbh periods owing to the release of extra water from the tehri dam fig 3a mani 2019 the river discharge and tds concentration usually follow the inverse relationship charkhabi and sakizadeh 2006 the observed tds concentration was well within the bureau of indian standards bis standard of 500 mg l 1 for drinking water table 1 the observed tds concentration in this study was well within the value reported for the ganga and yamuna at prayagraj sharma et al 2014 dissolved oxygen do is essential for the survival of the aquatic ecosystem and to oxidize the organic material present in the riverine system the do level in an aquatic system depends upon temperature salinity altitude and biological transformation process gupta et al 2017 the do level occurred in the range of 5 14 5 mg l 1 in natural waters and was in the range of 8 25 9 67 mg l 1 during the kumbh table 1 raghav et al 2020 reported do values in the range of 8 3 11 9 mg l 1 for river ganga in the prayagraj during the kumbh the do value was well above the recommended 5 mg l 1 for organized outdoor bathing given by the central pollution control board cpcb 2013 india table 1 the do value did not show significant variation p 0 05 during the kumbh event however a lower mean do level was observed during the kumbh period and can be attributed to the addition of organic load during the major bathing events that required oxygen for its aerobic decomposition table 2 and fig 3a bhatnagar et al 2016 jani et al 2018 a similar result was obtained by telang et al 2009 for the narmada river where the do levels decreased during mass bathing events as the oxygen was consumed in the decomposition of organic matter introduced in the river due to various religious activities the cod acts as an indicator of organic matter present in water and is measured in terms of oxygen consumed during the chemical oxidation of organic matter king et al 2003 kulshrestha and sharma 2006 ngwenya 2006 the cod value ranged between 25 6 and 53 3 mg l 1 in the study area and showed significant variation p 0 05 during the kumbh event with relatively higher concentration during the kumbh and post kumbh period tables 1 and 2 fig 3a the cod was significantly affected during this study as the concentration was quite higher than the who standard of 10 mg l 1 indicating the effect of the mass bathing event on water quality table 1 such high values of cod can be attributed to the usage of soap and other bathing materials offering flowers milk flour oil and sewage waste purohit et al 2020 total 0 12 million toilets and 20 000 dustbins were provided in the sangam area along with bioremediation technique geo bag based sewage treatment system was used during the kumbh to maintain the water quality but only a few drains were partially treated by using this technique and that may be the reason behind the high cod concentration in the study area raghav et al 2020 an increase in the cod concentration was also reported during the mass bathing events of kumbh 2013 at prayagraj due to the increased load of organic matter dwivedi et al 2020 the observed concentration of cod during the kumbh could be much higher if the state government had not decided on the closure of tanneries between december 15 2018 and march 15 2019 in the upstream cities of kanpur and unnao jaiswal 2019 water hardness does not harm health as such for living organisms however a higher concentration of hardness in water is known to cause the problem of kidney stones as well as heart problems matta kumar 2015 total hardness th in the collected water samples fell within the bis prescribed standard value of 200 mg l 1 for drinking water and was in the range of 100 231 33 mg l 1 in the study area table 1 the th value did not show significant variation p 0 05 during the kumbh event however higher mean th value was observed during the pre kumbh period table 2 fig 3a the major contributor of hco3 ion in the river water is the gaseous exchange with the atmosphere chemical weathering and the organic matter decomposition process in the catchment area jha et al 2009 bicarbonate is the most dominant anion in the ganga and yamuna river system and contributes more than 80 of the total anion load in the river system sarin et al 1989 the hco3 concentration varied between 48 and 191 mg l 1 in the study area and was within the bis limit of 300 mg l 1 in drinking water table 1 the value of hco3 concentration showed significant variation p 0 05 during the kumbh event and a higher mean value was observed during the pre kumbh period table 2 fig 3a the relatively lower value during kumbh and post kumbh periods are mainly due to high water discharge due to the tehri dam s release fig 3a mani 2019 the chloride in the aquatic system can be contributed from natural and anthropogenic sources the natural sources include rock water interactions seepage from saline deposits and atmospheric deposition albek 1999 the anthropogenic sources include domestic waste discharge runoff from agricultural and urban areas and landfill leachate as per bis guidelines the concentration of cl should not increase above 250 mg l 1 table 1 the reported concentration of chloride ions varies between 2 9 and 97 mg l 1 in the middle stretch of river ganga neeri 2017 the chloride concentration was in the range of 19 5 75 mg l 1 during the kumbh event and was well within the permissible limit of 250 mg l 1 table 1 the chloride showed significant variation p 0 05 during the kumbh event with a relatively higher mean value was observed during the pre kumbh period table 2 fig 3a this increase in chloride may be due to the input of sewage waste toilet discharge detergents and other bathing products in the river water bhatnagar and sangwan 2009 sulfate so4 2 is an important anion in natural water and originates from the weathering and dissolution of sulfur containing minerals and rocks pyrite barite galena gypsum and chalcopyrite oxidation of sulfide minerals atmospheric precipitation and human activities ren et al 2017 the sulfate ion concentration was well within the bis limit of 200 mg l 1 and ranged between 40 80 and 140 mg l 1 in the study area during the kumbh 2019 the sulfate showed significant variation p 0 05 during the kumbh event with a relatively higher mean value was observed during the pre kumbh period table 2 fig 3b the concentration of bicarbonate chloride and sulfate showed a dilution effect during the kumbh event due to the release of extra water from the tehri dam fig 3a and b mani 2019 the major sources that contribute po4 3 in water primarily include agricultural runoff containing phosphate fertilizers and wastewater containing detergents ravindra and kaushik 2003 the concentration of po4 3 was in the range of 0 02 2 19 mg l 1 during the kumbh event and the average concentration observed during the post kumbh period was above the permissible limit of 0 5 mg l 1 given by epa 2001 standard table 1 the phosphate concentration showed significant variation p 0 05 during the kumbh event with a relatively higher mean value during the post kumbh period may be due to the mineralization of organic matter addiscott and thomas 2000 table 2 fig 3b similar results for phosphate were obtained in the study conducted by purohit et al 2020 during mass bathing events in the kshipra river the no3 in river water is mainly contributed from agricultural runoff change in the land use pattern and dry and wet precipitation jha et al 2009 significant variation p 0 05 was observed in the nitrate concentration during the kumbh event with a higher mean concentration during the post kumbh and kumbh periods table 2 fig 3b the relatively higher concentration of nitrate during kumbh 2019 can be attributed to microbial nitrification of nh4 contributed through mass bathing in the river channel dai et al 2008 the nitrate concentration in the study area was well within the permissible limit of 45 mg l 1 given by bis for drinking water the higher ammonium ion concentration indicates the addition from domestic sewage and their treatment activities or anaerobic decay of organic matter clinch et al 1988 sharma et al 2017 the ammonium ion concentration was well within the permissible limit of 0 5 mg l 1 given by bis table 1 the ammonium did not show significant variation p 0 05 however a relatively higher concentration was observed during the kumbh period which may be due to the addition of organic matter and its subsequent decomposition in the river system during the mass bathing event table 2 and fig 3b xia et al 2018 the dissolved silica concentration was another important parameter that was affected in this study as it showed significant variation p 0 05 during the kumbh event with a higher mean concentration observed during the kumbh and post kumbh period and can be attributed to resuspension of sediments caused by the pilgrims while taking a dip during mass bathing events arai et al 2012 table 2 fig 3b base cations ca2 mg2 na and k function as macro minerals for some of the most fundamental biological processes and contribute to soil and water bodies lucas et al 2013 major cations are contributed mainly from the chemical weathering reactions in the river catchment area and the varying degree of input from anthropogenic activities such as industrial and sewage waste and decreased biological uptake by vegetation kaushal et al 2017 the cation concentration followed the decreasing order as na ca2 k with sodium as the dominant cation during the kumbh event table 1 the alkaline na k nature of ganga water has been reported earlier too haritash et al 2016 the sodium concentration in river water can be attributed from the mineral weathering runoff from saline soil irrigation water and sewage waste banerjee and prasad 2020 the sodium concentration ranged between 17 and 68 mg l 1 in the study area and was present within the bis limit of 200 mg l 1 table 1 the sodium concentration did not show significant variation p 0 05 during the kumbh event however concentration was relatively higher during the pre kumbh period table 2 and fig 3b the calcium concentration showed significant variation p 0 05 during the kumbh event with relatively a higher concentration was observed during the pre kumbh period table 2 and fig 3b in this analysis all three cations viz ca2 na and k showed a dilution effect similar to major anions and showed relatively higher concentration during the pre kumbh period table 1 fig 3b this trend indicates that these three cations are mainly originated from the chemical weathering in the ghaghara river and mass bathing event not contributed significantly as source for these ions the potassium concentration ranges between 4 and 7 33 mg l 1 in the study area and is present within the bis limit of 12 mg l 1 table 1 coliform bacteria have been used to indicate fecal contamination of water for a long time and thus considered a potential health hazard gauthier and archibald 2001 it poses a health risk to humans due to the presence of enteric pathogens and can cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal diseases arora et al 2013 morace and mckenzie 2002 the most probable number mpn of coliforms measures the degree of coliforms in 100 ml of water as per the cpcb guideline the permissible limit for total coliforms organism mpn 100 ml is 50 or less for water class a which can be used as a drinking water source without conventional treatment but after disinfection and for water class b which can be used for organized outdoor bathing it is 500 or less cpcb 2013 it is generally believed that a greater extent of pollution in a given water body is associated with the higher most probable number of coliforms kulshrestha and sharma 2006 mpn count was observed to be severely affected during the mass bathing event it is introduced in the river water from human waste discharged from the toilets in the mela area and kumbh tent city to accommodate many pilgrims jani et al 2018 in this study total coliform ranged from 920 to 1600 mpn index per 100 ml in pre kumbh greater than 1800 mpn index per 100 ml during the kumbh period and from 920 to 1700 mpn 100 ml in the post kumbh period table 1 such an increase in the mpn count is indicative of the mixing of untreated sewage and toilet waste being discharged from the temporary tent city into the river sinha et al 2020 the increase in the mpn count during the kumbh period indicates the effect of mass bathing events on the quality of the ganga and yamuna rivers in the sangam area the mpn count showed significant variatio p 0 05 during the kumbh event with a relatively higher value of mpn count were observed during the kumbh period in the study area table 2 fig 3b the water quality of the study area was not suitable for drinking and bathing due to the high mpn count during the study period jani et al 2018 reported 130 fold increase in the bacterial load of godavari river during the mass bathing event of kumbh 2015 at nasik india bhatnagar et al 2016 also reported an increase in the mpn index of water bodies located in haryana after the mass bathing event kulshrestha and sharma 2006 reported the deterioration in the water quality of the ganga river due to mass bathing events during ardhkumbh 2004 at haridwar 3 1 statistical analysis 3 1 1 correlation analysis the strong correlations between elements indicate the same input sources and similar geochemical behavior of the elements matta kumar 2015 the correlation analysis was performed using pearson s correlation coefficient r between different water quality parameters for significant correlation pathak et al 2015 the value of r varies between 1 to 1 where a value greater than 0 5 represents a strong positive linear relationship between the variables the correlation between parameters during the pre kumbh period is presented in table 3 a it represents a strong positive correlation of tds with ec hardness hco3 cl so4 2 na k and ca2 this indicates the contribution from chemical weathering in the catchment area resulting in major cations bicarbonate and dissolved silica in the river system the cod concentration correlated with the nh4 ion indicating the input of sewage waste from the kumbh mela area during the mass bathing event table 3 a the presence of chloride ions with the association of major cations na k ca and mg also contributes to the th and tds load of the aquatic system and therefore chloride showed a positive correlation with the th and tds during the kumbh 2019 bhatnagar and sangwan 2009 table 3 b indicates the correlation between water quality parameters during the kumbh period this period witnessed a strong positive correlation of ec and tds with hardness hco3 cl na k and ca2 this indicates a contribution from the chemical weathering in the study area and atmospheric deposition in the catchment area the po4 3 ion showed a positive correlation with the nh4 ion indicating organic matter input and subsequent mineralization during the mass bathing event table 3 c indicates the correlation between water quality parameters during the post kumbh period it was observed that mpn values showed a strong correlation with ammonium ion value indicating input of sewage waste from the kumbh mela area during the mass bathing event the strong correlation between major ion bicarbonate and dissolved silica concentration indicated the input from weathering reaction taking place in the catchment area and the exchange process between sediment and water phase taking in the river channel 3 1 2 factor analysis factor analysis reduces data size without losing its originality and describes the most important parameters in the data set vega et al 1998 alberto et al 2001 major processes contributing to the water quality were identified by r mode factor analysis the factors with eigenvalue 1 0 were considered significant and factor loading indicates the correlation of factors with the individual parameters jha et al 2009 the result of factor analysis is presented in table 4 for the pre kumbh period four factors were identified which controlled the river water chemistry factor 1 represented a 49 35 variance in the data this factor includes variables like ec tds cod total hardness hco3 cl so4 2 ca2 and k this factor indicates the contribution of chemical weathering from the catchment area and organic matter input during the mass bathing event factor 2 accounted for 16 20 variance in the data set and showed positive loading for the na and negative loading for the ph and mpn in the study area factor 3 accounted for 12 07 variance and showed positive loading for the do po4 3 and h4sio4 indicated the contribution from the catchment area as suspended load factor 4 accounted for a 7 5 variance in the data set and showed negative loading for the no3 which can be attributed to uptake for biotic use during the kumbh period four factors were identified that regulate the river water chemistry factor 1 represents 53 34 variance in the data the variables include ec tds total hardness hco3 cl so4 2 na ca2 and k this factor indicates the contribution of chemical weathering and atmospheric deposition in the study area factor 2 accounts for 14 61 variance in the data set and shows positive loading for so4 2 and h4sio4 and negative loading for the nh4 and po4 3 in the study area and indicates addition and mineralization of organic matter during the mass bathing event factor 3 accounts for a 9 15 variance in the data set and positive loading for the mpn and indicates the input of sewage waste from the kumbh mela area during the mass bathing event factor 4 accounted for a 7 9 variance in the data set and showed positive loading for the do and no3 which can be attributed to increasing water discharge during the mass bathing period for the post kumbh period four factors were identified factor 1 shows a variance of 44 26 and positive loading for ec tds total hardness hco3 cl so4 2 na ca2 and k this factor indicates the contribution of chemical weathering and the leaching of secondary clay minerals in the study area factor 2 accounts for 14 47 variance with positive loading for dissolved silica and mpn count indicating the contribution of resuspension of sediment in increasing silica concentration and the addition of sewage waste during the mass bathing event factor 3 accounts for a variance of 12 48 with positive loading for po4 3 and nh4 indicating the sewage waste s contribution and organic matter decomposition during the mass bathing event factor 4 accounts for 11 97 variance in the data set and positive loading for the k and mpn and negative loading for the no3 in the data set 3 2 water quality status based on wqi the different water parameters having different units are converted into a common scale known as sub indices which are then added together to form a single index known as wqi value used to assess the water quality status sutadian et al 2016 the wqi was calculated using 17 sub indices using the measured concentration of physicochemical parameters and their permissible limits table 1 we use the permissible limit of water class a in the case of mpn 50 100 ml as devotees also consume ganga water as a ritual during the mass bathing event the results of wqi for the pre kumbh during kumbh and post kumbh period in the study area is given in table 5 the spatial distribution of wqi in the study area during the kumbh event is given in fig 4 the most important sub indices were ph cod nh4 and mpn which control the study area s water quality and wqi value the value of wqi during the pre kumbh period ranges from 59 to 116 with an average value of 81 the wqi value indicated that water quality varies from poor to unsuitable for drinking purposes during the pre kumbh period table 5 the wqi value during the kumbh period ranges from 85 to 132 with an average of 102 the wqi value indicates that water quality degraded during the kumbh period and varies from very poor to unsuitable for drinking purposes during the kumbh period table 5 the increase in wqi during the kumbh 2019 was mainly due to the addition of organic matter from sewage waste soap and detergents and religious offerings during the mass bathing event the wqi value during the post kumbh period varies from 76 to 108 with an average value of 96 indicating the very poor to unsuitable for drinking purpose category of water quality the sampling location 6 ganga in the pre sangam region showed maximum variation in the wqi value during the kumbh period table 5 the decreasing wqi value at sampling locations 11 and 13 during the kumbh period indicates improvement in the water quality which can be attributed to the release of extra water from the tehri dam during the kumbh event fig 4 the wqi value showed significant variation p 0 05 during the kumbh event table 2 the wqi value showed a significant increase 12 72 during the kumbh period in the study area indicating the effect of mass bathing on the water quality in the study area the major factors responsible for water quality deterioration include mass bathing and waste solid waste urinal and fecal waste waste from religious offerings like flowers incense sticks and idols generated from the kumbh mela area waste raghav et al 2020 bhatnagar et al 2016 reported the increase in the wqi value after the mass bathing event in haryana sinha et al 2020 showed the impact of the mass bathing event during ganga sagar mela using wqi and reported the decline in water quality due to the mass bathing event 4 conclusion the mass bathing during kumbh poses a major challenge to public and environmental health in the wake of rituals in religious events combined with the large crowd gathered during these events in the present study the most affected water quality parameter during kumbh was the total coliform count of the river water it showed a greater than 1 5 fold increase during the kumbh period and due to its high presence sangam water was unfit for organized outdoor bathing the cod po4 3 and mpn count concentration was higher than the permissible limit during the kumbh 2019 statistical analysis including correlation and factor analysis indicates the effect of pilgrims bathing and anthropogenic activities like the discharge of sewage waste from the kumbh mela area affects the water quality in the study area the direct effects of mass bathing are evident from the increased concentration of cod and dissolved silica during the kumbh period this increase can result from the use of soap and other bathing material offerings in the form of flowers and oil etc and resuspension of sand and clay particles by the pilgrims while taking baths during the mass bathing events also the effects of mas bathing can be observed on the mpn count and ammonium ion concentration due to the addition of sewage waste from the kumbh mela area when mixed with river water this waste is responsible for the degradation of water quality the wqi indicated that the water quality was worst during the kumbh period due to the addition of organic matter and nutrients when mass bathing days were relatively higher the water quality parameters that mainly control the wqi value include ph cod nh4 and mpn values the parameters showed a change in the concentration due to the addition of organic and human waste during the kumbh 2019 wqi value was minimum during the pre kumbh period and then increased during the kumbh indicating the deterioration in the water quality in the post kumbh period the wqi value decreased again due to the absence of mass bathing based on the change in the value of the wqi it can be concluded that the water quality of the study area changed from poor water quality to unfit for drinking purposes during the kumbh 2019 the maximum variation in the wqi value was observed in the pre sangam area at site 6 of the ganga river during the kumbh event proper management of sewage waste generating from the temporary kumbh tent city proper handling of solid waste generated in the kumbh mela area and making pilgrims desist from throwing religious offerings in the river water can be a few steps that the administration may employ to improve the water quality during the mass bathing

poor to unsuitable for drinking purposes during the kumbh 2019 graphical abstract image 1 keywords ganga mass bathing event kumbh 2019 water quality index wqi yamuna 1 introduction rivers are an integral part of the indian culture and religious beliefs and hold special importance in india water is responsible for approximately 80 of all human diseases therefore regular monitoring of its physicochemical and microbiological parameters is critical for the suitability of the water for various use it prevents disease outbreaks and hazards and prevents further water deterioration zabed et al 2014 one of the leading causes of increased river contamination is mass bathing an ancient indian custom bhasin et al 2015 kumbh is a mass bathing event that takes place every six years ardh kumbh and at twelve year intervals kumbh at the bank of holy rivers it takes place at triveni sangam confluence of ganga yamuna and the legendry saraswati rivers in prayagraj haridwar on the banks of ganga nasik on the banks of godavari river and ujjain on the banks of the kshipra river kumbh represents the gathering of people including naga sadhus sadhus belonging from different akhadas and their followers people with religious beliefs and the curious visitors from india and abroad kumbh mela has been included in the representative list of intangible cultural heritage of humanity by united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco in 2017 government of india 2017 a makeshift tent city is established to host pilgrims during the kumbh period maclean 2009 sharma et al 2012 the kumbh of 2019 was held between january 15 to march 4 2019 it included six major bathing events i e makar sankranti on january 15 2019 paush purnima on january 21 2019 mauni amavasya on february 4 2019 basant panchami on february 10 2019 maghi purnima on february 19 2019 and mahashivratri on march 4 2019 kumbh mela official website 2018 the 49 day events attracted about 240 million visitors and are considered the largest gathering in the history of kumbh mela john 2019 raghav et al 2020 such mass bathing event is going to affect the water quality due to increased loading of organic matter and nutrients contributed through the various religious activities such as immersion of flowers ash and idols along with waste discharge from makeshift kumbh city sharma et al 2012 shukla and gupta 2015 bhatnagar et al 2016 sinha et al 2020 the mass bathing events represent large human gatherings on the bank of the river which can significantly impact the river ecosystem and the health of the participating population owing to the exposure to several health risks sridhar et al 2015 during the mass bathing events water quality can be affected by bathing and religious offering flowers flours and idols which contribute to suspended solids organic matter nutrients phosphate nitrate and sulfate soap and detergents to water bodies water quality parameters such as do cod hco3 cl no3 so4 2 po4 3 and h4sio4 get affected due to bathing activities sharma et al 2012 shukla and gupta 2015 bhatnagar et al 2016 sinha et al 2020 mass bathing events also led to kumbh city s establishment where pilgrims stayed during kumbh 2019 events the waste coming out from this temporary tent city includes food waste garbage rubbish and sewage waste that affects the water quality parameters like do cod nh4 no3 so4 2 po4 3 and mpn value of the river if disposed of without proper treatment raghav et al 2020 it always draws the attention of scientific communities and a large number of studies were carried out to evaluate the impact during the past kumbh events arora et al 2013 bhatnagar et al 2016 jani et al 2018 aggrawal et al 2020 dwivedi et al 2020 the kumbh held in 2019 was the largest in terms of footfall and only a few studies related to its impact on water quality have been reported srivastava et al 2020 yadav and bhatia 2020 the small sample size constraints all these studies and also only a few parameters were analyzed to evaluate the impact in the present study we assessed the changes in the water quality of river ganga and the yamuna along with their confluence at sangam in prayagraj district water samples collected from 15 locations were analyzed for 17 water quality parameters during the mass bathing event the concentration of these water quality parameters was then summarized by a single entity water quality index wqi developed by the canadian council of the ministers of the environment ccme in 2001 and intended to provide the reporting of water quality data in a simplified manner lumb et al 2006 wqi sums up the health of a water body in the form of a single numeric value by using a mathematical equation that includes data of water quality parameters sharma et al 2017 the wqi value was used to interpret the changes in the water quality during the mass bathing event of kumbh the objective of this study is i to estimate the significant variation in the concentration of physicochemical and biological water quality parameters during the kumbh 2019 by using anova analysis ii to identify factors responsible for the variation of water quality parameters during kumbh 2019 by using correlation analysis and factor analysis iii to determine the change in the wqi value during the kumbh 2019 to interpret the effect of mass bathing on water quality 2 material and methodology 2 1 study area prayagraj district covers an area of 5 482 square kilometers lying between 24 47 and 25 47 n latitude and 81 09 and 81 21 e

evaluation of water pollution it represents the overall water quality status in a single value which helps select suitable treatment techniques to combat the concerning issues joshi et al 2009 tyagi et al 2013 water quality analysis is usually concerned with the quality of natural water and its potential applications drinking irrigation domestic and industries in practice monitoring the characteristics of many pollution sources entering surface water bodies and groundwater systems is costly and time consuming furthermore many academics and scientists have struggled to describe and address water unified and straightforwardly these issues arise due to the complexities of water quality measurements and the extensive range of criteria used to characterize the state of water quality in water resources akhtar et al 2021 the effect of various aspects that describe water quality and the difficulties in categorizing the major characteristics used to quantify the health of water resources quantitatively are extremely difficult to comprehend as a result the water quality index wqi is regarded as a mathematical instrument that considerably reduces the complexity of water quality data sets while providing a single categorizing value that describes the water quality state of water bodies or the degree of pollution tripathi and singal 2019 wqi can prove to be an essential tool since it can be used for awareness of the general public and policymakers which may help enhance water quality therefore the present study was conducted to determine the impact of mass bathing during kumbh 2019 on water quality in terms of wqi 2 5 2 wqi calculation weighted arithmetic index wqi was calculated for the determination of water quality status using the formula chandra et al 2017 w q i w n q n w n where wn unit weight for the nth parameter qn quality rating for the nth water quality parameter the water quality is divided into 5 different categories excellent 0 25 good 26 50 poor 51 75 very poor 76 100 and unsuitable for drinking 100 by using wqi value sharma et al 2017 3 result and discussion the mean concentration and the standard deviation of water quality parameters are given in table 1 the boxplots for physicochemical parameters and mpn count showing their variation during the kumbh 2019 are given in fig 3 a and b ph is one of the most significant parameters and its higher values correspond to the high concentration of hco3 and other bases annapoorna and janardhana 2015 the ph of the water samples was in the alkaline range and about 84 of the collected samples showed ph value above the permissible limit 6 5 8 5 recommended by world health organizations who 2006 table 1 this alkaline nature indicates that the water was well buffered bhasin et al 2015 the ph value did not show significant variation p 0 05 during the kumbh event however a higher mean value was observed during the post kumbh period table 2 and fig 3a the use of soap and detergents during the mass bathing events may cause an increase in the ph of water bodies due to their higher ph value tarun et al 2014 jani et al 2018 also reported similar behavior of ph during the mass bathing event on the godavari river electrical conductivity is used to determine salinity and measure the rate at which an electric current can pass through a solution ec values range between 50 and 1500 μs cm for natural water matta kumar 2015 ec values varied from 348 to 751 μs cm and showed significant variation p 0 05 during the kumbh event table 1 table 2 the ec value was relatively higher during the pre kumbh period and its value decreased during the kumbh and post kumbh periods fig 3a low ec value during the kumbh period can be attributed to the discharge of additional water in the ganga river released by the tehri dam mani 2019 the observed ec values were well within the permissible limit of 1000 μs cm given by the environmental protection agency epa 2001 for drinking water

and 545 mg l 1 and showed significant variation p 0 05 during the kumbh 2019 table 1 table 2 tds concentration usually increases during the mass bathing event due to organic matter and dissolved nutrients purohit et al 2020 however in the case of kumbh 2019 the tds concentration was relatively lower during the kumbh and post kumbh periods owing to the release of extra water from the tehri dam fig 3a mani 2019 the river discharge and tds concentration usually follow the inverse relationship charkhabi and sakizadeh 2006 the observed tds concentration was well within the bureau of indian standards bis standard of 500 mg l 1 for drinking water table 1 the observed tds concentration in this study was well within the value reported for the ganga and yamuna at prayagraj sharma et al 2014 dissolved oxygen do is essential for the survival of the aquatic ecosystem and to oxidize the organic material present in the riverine system the do level in an aquatic system depends upon temperature salinity altitude and biological transformation process gupta et al 2017 the do level occurred in the range of 5 14 5 mg l 1 in natural waters and was in the range of 8 25 9 67 mg l 1 during the kumbh table 1 raghav et al 2020 reported do values in the range of 8 3 11 9 mg l 1 for river ganga in the prayagraj during the kumbh the do value was well above the recommended 5 mg l 1 for organized outdoor bathing given by the central pollution control board cpcb 2013 india table 1 the do value did not show significant variation p 0 05 during the kumbh event however a lower mean do level was observed during the kumbh period and can be attributed to the addition of organic load during the major bathing events that required oxygen for its aerobic decomposition table 2 and fig 3a bhatnagar et al 2016 jani et al 2018 a similar result was obtained by telang et al 2009 for the narmada river where the do levels decreased during mass bathing events as the oxygen was consumed in the decomposition of organic matter introduced in the river due to various religious activities the cod acts as an indicator of organic matter present in water and is measured in terms of oxygen consumed during the chemical oxidation of organic matter king et al 2003 kulshrestha and sharma 2006 ngwenya 2006 the cod value ranged between 25 6 and 53 3 mg l 1 in the study area and showed significant variation p 0 05 during the kumbh event with relatively higher concentration during the kumbh and post kumbh period tables 1 and 2 fig 3a the cod was significantly affected during this study as the concentration was quite higher than the who standard of 10 mg l 1 indicating the effect of the mass bathing event on water quality table 1 such high values of cod can be attributed to the usage of soap and other bathing materials offering flowers milk flour oil and sewage waste purohit et al 2020 total 0 12 million toilets and 20 000 dustbins were provided in the sangam area along with bioremediation technique geo bag based sewage treatment system was used during the kumbh to maintain the water quality but only a few drains were partially treated by using this technique and that may be the reason behind the high cod concentration in the study area raghav et al 2020 an increase in the cod concentration was also reported during the mass bathing events of kumbh 2013 at prayagraj due to the increased load of organic matter dwivedi et al 2020 the observed concentration of cod during the kumbh could be much higher if the state government had not decided on the closure of tanneries between december 15 2018 and march 15 2019 in the upstream cities of kanpur and unnao jaiswal 2019 water hardness does not harm health as such for living organisms however a higher concentration of hardness in water is known to cause the problem of kidney stones as well as heart problems matta kumar 2015 total hardness th in the collected water samples fell within the bis prescribed standard value of 200 mg l 1 for drinking water and was in the range of 100 231 33 mg l 1 in the study area table 1 the th value did not show significant variation p 0 05 during the kumbh event however higher mean th value was observed during the pre kumbh period table 2 fig 3a the major contributor of hco3 ion in the river water is the gaseous exchange with the atmosphere chemical weathering and the organic matter decomposition process in the catchment area jha et al 2009 bicarbonate is the most dominant anion in the ganga and yamuna river system and contributes more than 80 of the total anion load in the river system sarin et al 1989 the hco3 concentration varied between 48 and 191 mg l 1 in the study area and was within the bis limit of 300 mg l 1 in drinking water table 1 the value of hco3 concentration showed significant variation p 0 05 during the kumbh event and a higher mean value was observed during the pre kumbh period table 2 fig 3a the relatively lower value during kumbh and post kumbh periods are mainly due to high water discharge due to the tehri dam s release fig 3a mani 2019 the chloride in the aquatic system can be contributed from natural and anthropogenic sources the natural sources include rock water interactions seepage from saline deposits and atmospheric deposition albek 1999 the anthropogenic sources include domestic waste discharge runoff from agricultural and urban areas and landfill leachate as per bis guidelines the concentration of cl should not increase above 250 mg l 1 table 1 the reported concentration of chloride ions varies between 2 9 and 97 mg l 1 in the middle stretch of river ganga neeri 2017 the chloride concentration was in the range of 19 5 75 mg l 1 during the kumbh event and was well within the permissible limit of 250 mg l 1 table 1 the chloride showed significant variation p 0 05 during the kumbh event with a relatively higher mean value was observed during the pre kumbh period table 2 fig 3a this increase in chloride may be due to the input of sewage waste toilet discharge detergents and other bathing products in the river water bhatnagar and sangwan 2009 sulfate so4 2 is an important anion in natural water and originates from the weathering and dissolution of sulfur containing minerals and rocks pyrite barite galena gypsum and chalcopyrite oxidation of sulfide minerals atmospheric precipitation and human activities ren et al 2017 the sulfate ion concentration was well within the bis limit of 200 mg l 1 and ranged between 40 80 and 140 mg l 1 in the study area during the kumbh 2019 the sulfate showed significant variation p 0 05 during the kumbh event with a relatively higher mean value was observed during the pre kumbh period table 2 fig 3b the concentration of bicarbonate chloride and sulfate showed a dilution effect during the kumbh event due to the release of extra water from the tehri dam fig 3a and b mani 2019 the major sources that contribute po4 3 in water primarily include agricultural runoff containing phosphate fertilizers and wastewater containing detergents ravindra and kaushik 2003 the concentration of po4 3 was in the range of 0 02 2 19 mg l 1 during the kumbh event and the average concentration observed during the post kumbh period was above the permissible limit of 0 5 mg l 1 given by epa 2001 standard table 1 the phosphate concentration showed significant variation p 0 05 during the kumbh event with a relatively higher mean value during the post kumbh period may be due to the mineralization of organic matter addiscott and thomas 2000 table 2 fig 3b similar results for phosphate were obtained in the study conducted by purohit et al 2020 during mass bathing events in the kshipra river the no3 in river water is mainly contributed from agricultural runoff change in the land use pattern and dry and wet precipitation jha et al 2009 significant variation p 0 05 was observed in the nitrate concentration during the kumbh event with a higher mean concentration during the post kumbh and kumbh periods table 2 fig 3b the relatively higher concentration of nitrate during kumbh 2019 can be attributed to microbial nitrification of nh4 contributed through mass bathing in the river channel dai et al 2008 the nitrate concentration in the study area was well within the permissible limit of 45 mg l 1 given by bis for drinking water the higher ammonium ion concentration indicates the addition from domestic sewage and their treatment activities or anaerobic decay of organic matter clinch et al 1988 sharma et al 2017 the ammonium ion concentration was well within the permissible limit of 0 5 mg l 1 given by bis table 1 the ammonium did not show significant variation p 0 05 however a relatively higher concentration was observed during the kumbh period which may be due to the addition of organic matter and its subsequent decomposition in the river system during the mass bathing event table 2 and fig 3b xia et al 2018 the dissolved silica concentration was another important parameter that was affected in this study as it showed significant variation p 0 05 during the kumbh event with a higher mean concentration observed during the kumbh and post kumbh period and can be attributed to resuspension of sediments caused by the pilgrims while taking a dip during mass bathing events arai et al 2012 table 2 fig 3b base cations ca2 mg2 na and k function as macro minerals for some of the most fundamental biological processes and contribute to soil and water bodies lucas et al 2013 major cations are contributed mainly from the chemical weathering reactions in the river catchment area and the varying degree of input from anthropogenic activities such as industrial and sewage waste and decreased biological uptake by vegetation kaushal et al 2017 the cation concentration followed the decreasing order as na ca2 k with sodium as the dominant cation during the kumbh event table 1 the alkaline na k nature of ganga water has been reported earlier too haritash et al 2016 the sodium concentration in river water can be attributed from the mineral weathering runoff from saline soil irrigation water and sewage waste banerjee and prasad 2020 the sodium concentration ranged between 17 and 68 mg l 1 in the study area and was present within the bis limit of 200 mg l 1 table 1 the sodium concentration did not show significant variation p 0 05 during the kumbh event however concentration was relatively higher during the pre kumbh period table 2 and fig 3b the calcium concentration showed significant variation p 0 05 during the kumbh event with relatively a higher concentration was observed during the pre kumbh period table 2 and fig 3b in this analysis all three cations viz ca2 na and k showed a dilution effect similar to major anions and showed relatively higher concentration during the pre kumbh period table 1 fig 3b this trend indicates that these three cations are mainly originated from the chemical weathering in the ghaghara river and mass bathing event not contributed significantly as source for these ions the potassium concentration ranges between 4 and 7 33 mg l 1 in the study area and is present within the bis limit of 12 mg l 1 table 1 coliform bacteria have been used to indicate fecal contamination of water for a long time and thus considered a potential health hazard gauthier and archibald 2001 it poses a health risk to humans due to the presence of enteric pathogens and can cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal diseases arora et al 2013 morace and mckenzie 2002 the most probable number mpn of coliforms measures the degree of coliforms in 100 ml of water as per the cpcb guideline the permissible limit for total coliforms organism mpn 100 ml is 50 or less for water class a which can be used as a drinking water source without conventional treatment but after disinfection and for water class b which can be used for organized outdoor bathing it is 500 or less cpcb 2013 it is generally believed that a greater extent of pollution in a given water body is associated with the higher most probable number of coliforms kulshrestha and sharma 2006 mpn count was observed to be severely affected during the mass bathing event it is introduced in the river water from human waste discharged from the toilets in the mela area and kumbh tent city to accommodate many pilgrims jani et al 2018 in this study total coliform ranged from 920 to 1600 mpn index per 100 ml in pre kumbh greater than 1800 mpn index per 100 ml during the kumbh period and from 920 to 1700 mpn 100 ml in the post kumbh period table 1 such an increase in the mpn count is indicative of the mixing of untreated sewage and toilet waste being discharged from the temporary tent city into the river sinha et al 2020 the increase in the mpn count during the kumbh period indicates the effect of mass bathing events on the quality of the ganga and yamuna rivers in the sangam area the mpn count showed significant variatio p 0 05 during the kumbh event with a relatively higher value of mpn count were observed during the kumbh period in the study area table 2 fig 3b the water quality of the study area was not suitable for drinking and bathing due to the high mpn count during the study period jani et al 2018 reported 130 fold increase in the bacterial load of godavari river during the mass bathing event of kumbh 2015 at nasik india bhatnagar et al 2016 also reported an increase in the mpn index of water bodies located in haryana after the mass bathing event kulshrestha and sharma 2006 reported the deterioration in the water quality of the ganga river due to mass bathing events during ardhkumbh 2004 at haridwar 3 1 statistical analysis 3 1 1 correlation analysis the strong correlations between elements indicate the same input sources and similar geochemical behavior of the elements matta kumar 2015 the correlation analysis was performed using pearson s correlation coefficient r between different water quality parameters for significant correlation pathak et al 2015 the value of r varies between 1 to 1 where a value greater than 0 5 represents a strong positive linear relationship between the variables the correlation between parameters during the pre kumbh period is presented in table 3 a it represents a strong positive correlation of tds with ec hardness hco3 cl so4 2 na k and ca2 this indicates the contribution from chemical weathering in the catchment area resulting in major cations bicarbonate and dissolved silica in the river system the cod concentration correlated with the nh4 ion indicating the input of sewage waste from the kumbh mela area during the mass bathing event table 3 a the presence of chloride ions with the association of major cations na k ca and mg also contributes to the th and tds load of the aquatic system and therefore chloride showed a positive correlation with the th and tds during the kumbh 2019 bhatnagar and sangwan 2009 table 3 b indicates the correlation between water quality parameters during the kumbh period this period witnessed a strong positive correlation of ec and tds with hardness hco3 cl na k and ca2 this indicates a contribution from the chemical weathering in the study area and atmospheric deposition in the catchment area the po4 3 ion showed a positive correlation with the nh4 ion indicating organic matter input and subsequent mineralization during the mass bathing event table 3 c indicates the correlation between water quality parameters during the post kumbh period it was observed that mpn values showed a strong correlation with ammonium ion value indicating input of sewage waste from the kumbh mela area during the mass bathing event the strong correlation between major ion bicarbonate and dissolved silica concentration indicated the input from weathering reaction taking place in the catchment area and the exchange process between sediment and water phase taking in the river channel 3 1 2 factor analysis factor analysis reduces data size without losing its originality and describes the most important parameters in the data set vega et al 1998 alberto et al 2001 major processes contributing to the water quality were identified by r mode factor analysis the factors with eigenvalue 1 0 were considered significant and factor loading indicates the correlation of factors with the individual parameters jha et al 2009 the result of factor analysis is presented in table 4 for the pre kumbh period four factors were identified which controlled the river water chemistry factor 1 represented a 49 35 variance in the data this factor includes variables like ec tds cod total hardness hco3 cl so4 2 ca2 and k this factor indicates the contribution of chemical weathering from the catchment area and organic matter input during the mass bathing event factor 2 accounted for 16 20 variance in the data set and showed positive loading for the na and negative loading for the ph and mpn in the study area factor 3 accounted for 12 07 variance and showed positive loading for the do po4 3 and h4sio4 indicated the contribution from the catchment area as suspended load factor 4 accounted for a 7 5 variance in the data set and showed negative loading for the no3 which can be attributed to uptake for biotic use during the kumbh period four factors were identified that regulate the river water chemistry factor 1 represents 53 34 variance in the data the variables include ec tds total hardness hco3 cl so4 2 na ca2 and k this factor indicates the contribution of chemical weathering and atmospheric deposition in the study area factor 2 accounts for 14 61 variance in the data set and shows positive loading for so4 2 and h4sio4 and negative loading for the nh4 and po4 3 in the study area and indicates addition and mineralization of organic matter during the mass bathing event factor 3 accounts for a 9 15 variance in the data set and positive loading for the mpn and indicates the input of sewage waste from the kumbh mela area during the mass bathing event factor 4 accounted for a 7 9 variance in the data set and showed positive loading for the do and no3 which can be attributed to increasing water discharge during the mass bathing period for the post kumbh period four factors were identified factor 1 shows a variance of 44 26 and positive loading for ec tds total hardness hco3 cl so4 2 na ca2 and k this factor indicates the contribution of chemical weathering and the leaching of secondary clay minerals in the study area factor 2 accounts for 14 47 variance with positive loading for dissolved silica and mpn count indicating the contribution of resuspension of sediment in increasing silica concentration and the addition of sewage waste during the mass bathing event factor 3 accounts for a variance of 12 48 with positive loading for po4 3 and nh4 indicating the sewage waste s contribution and organic matter decomposition during the mass bathing event factor 4 accounts for 11 97 variance in the data set and positive loading for the k and mpn and negative loading for the no3 in the data set 3 2 water quality status based on wqi the different water parameters having different units are converted into a common scale known as sub indices which are then added together to form a single index known as wqi value used to assess the water quality status sutadian et al 2016 the wqi was calculated using 17 sub indices using the measured concentration of physicochemical parameters and their permissible limits table 1 we use the permissible limit of water class a in the case of mpn 50 100 ml as devotees also consume ganga water as a ritual during the mass bathing event the results of wqi for the pre kumbh during kumbh and post kumbh period in the study area is given in table 5 the spatial distribution of wqi in the study area during the kumbh event is given in fig 4 the most important sub indices were ph cod nh4 and mpn which control the study area s water quality and wqi value the value of wqi during the pre kumbh period ranges from 59 to 116 with an average value of 81 the wqi value indicated that water quality varies from poor to unsuitable for drinking purposes during the pre kumbh period table 5 the wqi value during the kumbh period ranges from 85 to 132 with an average of 102 the wqi value indicates that water quality degraded during the kumbh period and varies from very poor to unsuitable for drinking purposes during the kumbh period table 5 the increase in wqi during the kumbh 2019 was mainly due to the addition of organic matter from sewage waste soap and detergents and religious offerings during the mass bathing event the wqi value during the post kumbh period varies from 76 to 108 with an average value of 96 indicating the very poor to unsuitable for drinking purpose category of water quality the sampling location 6 ganga in the pre sangam region showed maximum variation in the wqi value during the kumbh period table 5 the decreasing wqi value at sampling locations 11 and 13 during the kumbh period indicates improvement in the water quality which can be attributed to the release of extra water from the tehri dam during the kumbh event fig 4 the wqi value showed significant variation p 0 05 during the kumbh event table 2 the wqi value showed a significant increase 12 72 during the kumbh period in the study area indicating the effect of mass bathing on the water quality in the study area the major factors responsible for water quality deterioration include mass bathing and waste solid waste urinal and fecal waste waste from religious offerings like flowers incense sticks and idols generated from the kumbh mela area waste raghav et al 2020 bhatnagar et al 2016 reported the increase in the wqi value after the mass bathing event in haryana sinha et al 2020 showed the impact of the mass bathing event during ganga sagar mela using wqi and reported the decline in water quality due to the mass bathing event 4 conclusion the mass bathing during kumbh poses a major challenge to public and environmental health in the wake of rituals in religious events combined with the large crowd gathered during these events in the present study the most affected water quality parameter during kumbh was the total coliform count of the river water it showed a greater than 1 5 fold increase during the kumbh period and due to its high presence sangam water was unfit for organized outdoor bathing the cod po4 3 and mpn count concentration was higher than the permissible limit during the kumbh 2019 statistical analysis including correlation and factor analysis indicates the effect of pilgrims bathing and anthropogenic activities like the discharge of sewage waste from the kumbh mela area affects the water quality in the study area the direct effects of mass bathing are evident from the increased concentration of cod and dissolved silica during the kumbh period this increase can result from the use of soap and other bathing material offerings in the form of flowers and oil etc and resuspension of sand and clay particles by the pilgrims while taking baths during the mass bathing events also the effects of mas bathing can be observed on the mpn count and ammonium ion concentration due to the addition of sewage waste from the kumbh mela area when mixed with river water this waste is responsible for the degradation of water quality the wqi indicated that the water quality was worst during the kumbh period due to the addition of organic matter and nutrients when mass bathing days were relatively higher the water quality parameters that mainly control the wqi value include ph cod nh4 and mpn values the parameters showed a change in the concentration due to the addition of organic and human waste during the kumbh 2019 wqi value was minimum during the pre kumbh period and then increased during the kumbh indicating the deterioration in the water quality in the post kumbh period the wqi value decreased again due to the absence of mass bathing based on the change in the value of the wqi it can be concluded that the water quality of the study area changed from poor water quality to unfit for drinking purposes during the kumbh 2019 the maximum variation in the wqi value was observed in the pre sangam area at site 6 of the ganga river during the kumbh event proper management of sewage waste generating from the temporary kumbh tent city proper handling of solid waste generated in the kumbh mela area and making pilgrims desist from throwing religious offerings in the river water can be a few steps that the administration may employ to improve the water quality during the mass bathing
