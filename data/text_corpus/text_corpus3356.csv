ecosystem state shifting from macrophyte dominated to algae dominated state stockwell et al 2020 in particular water turbidity may experience a sharp increase in a short term period in case of extreme meteorological conditions such as strong winds or heavy rainfall events kasprzak et al 2017 due to its important role water turbidity clarity has been increasingly investigated feng et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 especially in china with severe problem of water quality deterioration huang et al 2019 huang et al 2021 a national quantification of lake clarity in china using landsat oli images revealed

johnston 2013 such as monitoring air temperature overeem et al 2013 earthquake kong et al 2016 and water turbidity leeuw and boss 2018 such cost effective manner to quantify water turbidity using smartphones provided an avenue for broader audiences not limited to aquatic scientists and water managers to learn water turbidity and would be especially helpful in case of limited resources for water measurement notwithstanding cost effective in water turbidity measurement many existing smartphone based methods e g hydrocolor did not support an update of measurement accuracy and uncertainty in case of more measured data bayram et al 2018 hussain et al 2016 koydemir et al 2019 leeuw and boss 2018 this is a weakness because uncertainty is of particular crucial information for both measurement and model estimation dotto et al 2012 schellart et al 2010 tscheikner gratl et al 2019 uncertainty estimation was considered to be a continuous process performed in parallel to the modeling exercise rather than being an activity that is carried out after the main modeling activities tscheikner gratl et al 2019 moreover the ever increasing measured data have great potential in improving the prediction accuracy with the advances in data mining techniques reichstein et al 2019 therefore we need a robust framework to support model update increasing data and provide uncertainty information to users to this end we developed a novel framework as a rapid and cost effective alternative of the existing turbidimeters to predict water turbidity using smartphone images the framework used bayesian modeling to predict water turbidity and quantify uncertainties of the prediction compared with previous studies in predicting water turbidity koydemir et al 2019 meyers et al 2017 the framework had the unique advantages of updating structure and parameters for the developed bayesian models in case of more measured data and uncertainty estimation for each prediction data records water samples and images from various aquatic ecosystems e g rivers lakes and ponds across china were collected to evaluate the performance of our bayesian based framework 2 a novel framework to predict water turbidity to predict water turbidity using smartphone images a framework was developed based on bayesian modeling fig 1 in the developed framework a raw image for the water with an eight color background was taken by the smartphone digital camera for each image we obtained 24 rgb red green and blue values to predict water turbidity via the developed bayesian model paired data 24 rgb values of smartphone image and measured water turbidity from sensor were assimilated in a nearly real time manner to update the bayesian model our framework had two novel contributions including 1 a bayesian model to predict water turbidity and quantify prediction uncertainty and 2 a model update method to reduce model uncertainties with increasing measured data the critical procedures of the framework were described as follows 1 developing a bayesian model to predict water turbidity and quantify prediction uncertainty the developed bayesian model aimed to achieve a rapid and cost effective method to predict water turbidity with simple inputs of smartphone images the developed model can be summarized as the following equations 1 y k α 0 i 1 n α i x i k ε 2 α 0 α i ε n 0 1 where y k is the normalization value a range of 0 1 of estimated water turbidity for sample k α 0 and α i are the empirical coefficients which were assigned normal prior distributions with mean of 0 and variance of 1 x i k is the normalization value a range of 0 1 of input variable i clip image based on an eight color background for sample k to better extract the feature of the clip image for model inputs x i k we compared the median and mean values for these clip images we found that there is no significant difference between mean and median values for images with minor noise however as showed in the value distribution of the clip image figure s1 in the supporting information mean value of a clip image may be significantly affected by unexpected noise while median value better represents the majority of the image values therefore the median value is better than the mean value due to its ability to omit the influences from unexpected noise in the image and is thus selected as model inputs n is the number of input variables with a value of 24 eight color background colors with 3 channels for each color ε is the model error term performance of these bayesian models was assessed through both model fit and uncertainty model fit was quantified using the nash sutcliffe efficiency ns to compare the agreement between measured and predicted values higher ns means better model fit model uncertainty was quantified using the mean posterior standard deviation of bayesian samples for all empirical coefficients α 0 and α i larger posterior standard deviation means higher model uncertainty we applied an improved convergence diagnostic r by vehtari et al 2020 to assess convergence of two markov chain monte carlo mcmc chains bayesian modeling was implemented based on the python library of pymc3 specifically developed for bayesian statistical modeling and probabilistic machine learning salvatier et al 2016 further details on bayesian modeling can be found in previous studies kelly et al 2019 xia et al 2016 a cross validation strategy was applied to achieve an adequate evaluation of the developed bayesian model it has been widely demonstrated to be a robust method to overcome the weakness of limited data for model development fushiki 2011 2 generating input variables for the developed bayesian model previous publications revealed that water turbidity can be well estimated based on the visible light bands e g shen et al 2020 leeuw and boss 2018 moreover our surveying experiences revealed that a large difference of water turbidity can be easily distinguished with our eyes see figure s2 based on above mentioned facts we argued that the information of water turbidity can be extracted from the smartphone images therefore smartphone images were used as the input variables for the developed bayesian models to estimate water turbidity to avoid unnecessary noises smartphones were set to an angle that is parallel to the water surface fig 1 inspired by the design of secchi disk black and white disk we designed an eight color background for image taking to improve model performance in order to cover various visible colors the eight color background included 7 visible colors red orange yellow green cyan blue and purple and white color with rgb values of 255 0 0 255 125 0 255 255 0 0 255 0 0 255 255 0 0 255 255 0 255 255 255 255 respectively this eight color background allowed us to obtain 8 sets of rgb values from each raw image the use of eight color background aimed to eliminate the influences of various water colors caused by components e g phytoplankton sediment and humus in aquatic ecosystems for example the aggravation of phytoplankton algal blooms in water would result in dark green color in part of the water samples in addition images were taken using a total of 13 various smartphones huawei and iphone etc in table s1 to improve the generality of the developed bayesian models 3 model update method to reduce model uncertainties in case that measured turbidity from sensor is available both the measured value and rgb values 8 sets from each taken image were stored in the data base for bayesian modeling all records in the data base were then used to update the structure and parameters of the developed bayesian model in a nearly real time manner to address the collinearity problem existed among these 24 input variables figure s3 the algorithm of recursive feature elimination rfe was used to select target variables the variable selection step was implemented for the development of each bayesian model the updated model was then used to predict turbidity with the inputs of rgb values 8 sets 3 framework application given the conceptual merit of the developed framework we applied the framework with a measured dataset from various aquatic ecosystems including rivers lakes and ponds and evaluated its performance in the case study 3 1 water turbidity measurement and prediction a national sampling program during 2020 2021 across china was implemented to validate the performance of the framework fig 2 according to the sampling procedures we have several specific designs to ensure an adequate evaluation on our developed framework including water samples from various water body types of river lake and pond and images taken using various smartphones in various weather sunshine conditions based on the sampling program 120 paired records an image and a measured water turbidity value for each record across china were collected for bayesian modeling practice detailed information sampling location date time weather conditions etc on these collected data records were provided in table s1 of the supporting information the following steps were implemented to collect a paired data record an image and measured water turbidity 1 each water sample 20 l was poured into a bucket with eight color background fig 1 to 15 cm depth 2 an image with three channels of rgb was taken with this eight color background using a smartphone 3 measured turbidity was obtained using a portable turbidity meter of turb 430t wtw designed by xylem analytics germany https www xylemanalytics com compared with previous studies that designed a device to support measuring water turbidity e g koydemir et al 2019 this study did not lean on any other devices except a panel with eight color background during the image taking step and thus resulted in an image with more channels fig 2 based on the collected data records we applied the framework to predict water turbidity a 3 folder cross validation strategy was used to evaluate model performance of the developed bayesian models by a training dataset 80 records and a validation dataset 40 records for each validation we further evaluated the change of model fit and uncertainty by adding the data record from validation dataset one by one into the training dataset 3 2 prediction accuracy and uncertainties based on our bayesian modeling practices in section 3 1 we achieved several interesting results on model performance and uncertainties 1 the developed bayesian model in the framework revealed a satisfactory performance with the training data of 120 data records fig 3 we achieved a model fit of ns 0 89 p 0 001 the 3 folder cross validation results showed that the model performance was consistently acceptable ns 0 73 p 0 001 with a training dataset of 81 data records fig 4 in particular model error did not show a significant difference between high 70 ntu and low 70 ntu water turbidity values figure s4 and also did not show a significant difference among these 120 data records from various smartphones figure s5 this model performance is satisfactory for the developed bayesian models given the considerable noise in the model inputs of taken images in fig 3 compared with previous water turbidity prediction using a smartphone hussain et al 2016 koydemir et al 2019 leeuw and boss 2018 our study had a much more intensive sampling program for field testing see table s2 for detailed comparison it is not surprise that our model performance is slightly lower compared with the studies that coupling additional devices for water turbidity prediction hussain et al 2016 koydemir et al 2019 because these devices were able to improve the image quality and reduce noise for model inputs in addition to the satisfactory model fit all the developed bayesian models displayed a r value very close to 1 0 r 1 0 0 01 suggestive of a perfect convergence for our markov chain monte carlo sampling brooks and gelman 1998 vehtari et al 2020 the monte carlo error for each parameter was less than 5 of the sample standard deviation which confirmed that an acceptable degree of accuracy for the posterior estimates was achieved spiegelhalter et al 2003 2 model uncertainties decreased with increasing dataset for model training with increasing data records from 80 to 120 to train the developed model our 3 folder cross validation results consistently showed a decreasing trend slope 0 p 0 001 of posterior standard deviation representing model uncertainty fig 4a in addition to the reducing model uncertainties the model showed a well ns 0 87 and stable slope 0 001 p 0 05 model fit during the training period fig 4 the stable model fit was further confirmed with four scatter plots with 81 91 101 111 training data records respectively of measured and predicted water turbidity from the cross validation results of k 1 fig 4b compared with the model fit during the training period the model fit during the validation period had a larger fluctuation and an increasing trend slope 0 002 p 0 01 with increasing data records for model training fig 4a further evaluation of the measured and predicted water turbidity for the predictions in fig 4a can be found in the scatter plots of figure s4 notwithstanding the improved trend of model performance i e increasing model fit and decreasing model uncertainty in case of more data records for training it is not surprising that both the ns and posterior standard deviation had some fluctuation fig 4a this is because adding sampling data e g data record 93 in k 2 fig 4a from a site with diverse characteristic may result in decreasing model fit ns value from 0 76 to 0 71 and slightly increasing uncertainties posterior standard deviation however as showed in fig 4a the performance would improve in case that more data records with similar characteristic were used for model training such more training data with diverse characteristics would result in a model with higher generality that can be used in other aquatic ecosystems 3 multi color background significantly improved our model performance to learn the impact of the multi color background design on model performance we compared the model performance using 1 8 color background our comparison results figure s5 revealed that the model with 8 color background inputs had a better model fit ns 0 89 figure s5 h than that a ns range between 0 38 and 0 67 figure s5 a g with less color 1 7 background inputs implying that the eight color background improved our model performance 4 discussion 4 1 advantages of the developed framework the framework design and application in our case study demonstrated its high value in water turbidity prediction different from satellite images widely used for large scale investigation of water turbidity clarity bi et al 2018 feng et al 2012 hou et al 2017 zhao et al 2011 the framework aimed to provide a cost effective way to predict water turbidity compared with previous studies in turbidity prediction measurement bayram et al 2018 koydemir et al 2019 leeuw and boss 2018 the developed framework had several advantages including model update uncertainty quantification rfe algorithm for variable selection and cross validation to achieve an adequately evaluated model several existing models sensors provided a fixed uncertainty values for application that is not necessarily true because the uncertainty can be reduced in case that more paired data records an image and measured turbidity for each record were used for model development bayesian modeling in our study provided an excellent avenue for uncertainty estimation that is also confirmed in previous publications reichstein et al 2019 the framework included a model update method aiming to reduce model uncertainties via updating both model structures and parameters such strategy has a maximum use of increasing measured data and is thus particularly useful under the context of ever increasing measured dataset worldwide to ensure the generality and performance of the developed models we have several specific strategies during the water sampling procedure 1 as shown in table s1 water samples were collected from eight different types of aquatic ecosystems included large lakes surface area 100 km2 e g lake taihu and poyang urban lakes e g lake xuanwu in nanjing mountain reservoirs urban rivers rural rivers long rivers length 1000 km e g yangtze river agricultural ponds across china the intensive sampling at a national scale would support us to obtain a broad range of water samples the wide covering of water bodies would ensure the usefulness of the framework in various water body types 2 the images for these water samples were taken using 13 various smartphones e g iphone 8 plus and huawei nova 4 in various weather conditions e g sunny and cloudy conditions table s1 the model performance revealed an unbiased model error among these data records from 13 smartphones figure s5 implying the effectiveness of our bayesian based framework to predict water turbidity using images from various smartphones the wide covering of smartphones and weather conditions would improve the reliability of our developed framework to be used in various smartphones and under various weather light conditions 4 2 potential applications of the developed framework although used in water turbidity prediction this framework is transferable to predict other water quality variables this study predict turbidity for inland waters by using only a data driven i e non physically based approach despite being data driven the framework is generic and therefore should be readily transferable to other water quality variables that can be potentially reflected by smartphone images notwithstanding the simple dataset 120 data records to test the develop framework our testing results fig 4 clearly revealed more robust ability in case of increasing dataset therefore we can expect a better model performance in future notwithstanding the promising performance of the framework we still needed several strategies to achieve its broad use 1 combing the framework into a smartphone application to predict water turbidity given the widely use of smartphone smartphone prediction of water quality is strongly encouraged bayram et al 2018 koydemir et al 2019 leeuw and boss 2018 the developed framework is so far a conceptual method however given that its implementation procedures and corresponding equations algorithms were provided in our study the framework can be easily combined into a smartphone application with its visualization design in fig 5 this smartphone application can thus be a cost effective device to predict water turbidity as an alternative to existing turbidimeters in water management practice 2 adjusting the water depth for high turbidity water as showed in fig 1 we used a water depth of 15 cm to take an image due to the relatively low turbidity 150 ntu in the study area however it is important to note that the water depth of 15 cm is not the unique choose and can be adjusted as required based on our testing experiment using the water depth of 10 15 and 20 cm figure s6 we found that a larger water depth would resulted in a useless of the multi color background at a lower water turbidity i e the multi color background is not visible in the smartphone image if we used an extremely low water depth e g 5 cm less information signal of the water sample can be found in the images therefore a medium value 15 cm of water depth was used in this study however the depth can be reduced to build another training and validation dataset for water with extremely high turbidity 4 3 uncertainties in the developed framework and future work although the developed framework had several striking advantages as discussed in section 4 1 it is important to note that there are several existing weaknesses uncertainties some of them required our improvements in future 1 water color can be significantly affected by the substances e g phytoplankton sand humus and dissolved colored material cdom in the water column for example cdom strongly absorbs light in the blue part of the spectrum bricaud et al 1981 and thus distinctly change water color although an eight color background design was used to eliminate the influences of these substances on water color an extremely high concentration would result in an invalid use of this eight color background i e background colors cannot be seen within the image this implied that our framework so far cannot well estimate the water turbidity for the water samples with extremely high turbidity especially caused by the substances with specific colors 2 performance model fit and uncertainties of the developed framework was highly depended on the sampling data for model training therefore collecting more data records water samples and images from various types of water bodies should be an on going effort to improve the overall performance of the framework in particularly images with diverse noise conditions can improve the ability of our framework to filter out noise reichstein et al 2019 and thus improve its generality for a broader use 3 in our framework the quality of smartphone images can be more or less affected by several factors mainly including light conditions smartphone types and shooting angle and thus increased data uncertainties of our bayesian models light conditions can be significantly affected by weather conditions e g sunny cloudy rainy conditions in field various smartphone types e g huawei and iphone in table s1 with various charge coupled device ccd has different signal to noise ratio snr shooting angle would affect the light into the smartphone camera quantifying and reducing the noises caused by above mentioned factors is theoretically possible however generally required additional devices information in the applications e g hussain et al 2016 koydemir et al 2019 and was not implemented so far to keep our framework ease of use as an alternative we used simple strategies e g setting the smartphone to an angle that is parallel to the water surface using images from various smartphones for model training to reduce model uncertainties caused by above mentioned factors 5 conclusions a novel framework was developed in this study to achieve a robust prediction of water turbidity in various aquatic ecosystems our testing with measured data revealed that the developed bayesian model in the framework can well ns 0 73 p 0 001 predict water turbidity based on the taken images from smartphone camera more measured data images and measured turbidity used for model training would resulted in an improved model performance i e reducing model uncertainty and stable model fit given the improving model performance due to increasing measured data our future work in priority would be collecting more

samples in addition images were taken using a total of 13 various smartphones huawei and iphone etc in table s1 to improve the generality of the developed bayesian models 3 model update method to reduce model uncertainties in case that measured turbidity from sensor is available both the measured value and rgb values 8 sets from each taken image were stored in the data base for bayesian modeling all records in the data base were then used to update the structure and parameters of the developed bayesian model in a nearly real time manner to address the collinearity problem existed among these 24 input variables figure s3 the algorithm of recursive feature elimination rfe was used to select target variables the variable selection step was implemented for the development of each bayesian model the updated model was then used to predict turbidity with the inputs of rgb values 8 sets 3 framework application given the conceptual merit of the developed framework we applied the framework with a measured dataset from various aquatic ecosystems including rivers lakes and ponds and evaluated its performance in the case study 3 1 water turbidity measurement and prediction a national sampling program during 2020 2021 across china was implemented to validate the performance of the framework fig 2 according to the sampling procedures we have several specific designs to ensure an adequate evaluation on our developed framework including water samples from various water body types of river lake and pond and images taken using various smartphones in various weather sunshine conditions based on the sampling program 120 paired records an image and a measured water turbidity value for each record across china were collected for bayesian modeling practice detailed information sampling location date time weather conditions etc on these collected data records were provided in table s1 of the supporting information the following steps were implemented to collect a paired data record an image and measured water turbidity 1 each water sample 20 l was poured into a bucket with eight color background fig 1 to 15 cm depth 2 an image with three channels of rgb was taken with this eight color background using a smartphone 3 measured turbidity was obtained using a portable turbidity meter of turb 430t wtw designed by xylem analytics germany https www xylemanalytics com compared with previous studies that designed a device to support measuring water turbidity e g koydemir et al 2019 this study did not lean on any other devices except a panel with eight color background during the image taking step and thus resulted in an image with more channels fig 2 based on the collected data records we applied the framework to predict water turbidity a 3 folder cross validation strategy was used to evaluate model performance of the developed bayesian models by a training dataset 80 records and a validation dataset 40 records for each validation we further evaluated the change of model fit and uncertainty by adding the data record from validation dataset one by one into the training dataset 3 2 prediction accuracy and uncertainties based on our bayesian modeling practices in section 3 1 we achieved several interesting results on model performance and uncertainties 1 the developed bayesian model in the framework revealed a satisfactory performance with the training data of 120 data records fig 3 we achieved a model fit of ns 0 89 p 0 001 the 3 folder cross validation results showed that the model performance was consistently acceptable ns 0 73 p 0 001 with a training dataset of 81 data records fig 4 in particular model error did not show a significant difference between high 70 ntu and low 70 ntu water turbidity values figure s4 and also did not show a significant difference among these 120 data records from various smartphones figure s5 this model performance is satisfactory for the developed bayesian models given the considerable noise in the model inputs of taken images in fig 3 compared with previous water turbidity prediction using a smartphone hussain et al 2016 koydemir et al 2019 leeuw and boss 2018 our study had a much more intensive sampling program for field testing see table s2 for detailed comparison it is not surprise that our model performance is slightly lower compared with the studies that coupling additional devices for water turbidity prediction hussain et al 2016 koydemir et al 2019 because these devices were able to improve the image quality and reduce noise for model inputs in addition to the satisfactory model fit all the developed bayesian models displayed a r value very close to 1 0 r 1 0 0 01 suggestive of a perfect convergence for our markov chain monte carlo sampling brooks and gelman 1998 vehtari et al 2020 the monte carlo error for each parameter was less than 5 of the sample standard deviation which confirmed that an acceptable degree of accuracy for the posterior estimates was achieved spiegelhalter et al 2003 2 model uncertainties decreased with increasing dataset for model training with increasing data records from 80 to 120 to train the developed model our 3 folder cross validation results consistently showed a decreasing trend slope 0 p 0 001 of posterior standard deviation representing model uncertainty fig 4a in addition to the reducing model uncertainties the model showed a well ns 0 87 and stable slope 0 001 p 0 05 model fit during the training period fig 4 the stable model fit was further confirmed with four scatter plots with 81 91 101 111 training data records respectively of measured and predicted water turbidity from the cross validation results of k 1 fig 4b compared with the model fit during the training period the model fit during the validation period had a larger fluctuation and an increasing trend slope 0 002 p 0 01 with increasing data records for model training fig 4a further evaluation of the measured and predicted water turbidity for the predictions in fig 4a can be found in the scatter plots of figure s4 notwithstanding the improved trend of model performance i e increasing model fit and decreasing model uncertainty in case of more data records for training it is not surprising that both the ns and posterior standard deviation had some fluctuation fig 4a this is because adding sampling data e g data record 93 in k 2 fig 4a from a site with diverse characteristic may result in decreasing model fit ns value from 0 76 to 0 71 and slightly increasing uncertainties posterior standard deviation however as showed in fig 4a the performance would improve in case that more data records with similar characteristic were used for model training such more training data with diverse characteristics would result in a model with higher generality that can be used in other aquatic ecosystems 3 multi color background significantly improved our model performance to learn the impact of the multi color background design on model performance we compared the model performance using 1 8 color background our comparison results figure s5 revealed that the model with 8 color background inputs had a better model fit ns 0 89 figure s5 h than that a ns range between 0 38 and 0 67 figure s5 a g with less color 1 7 background inputs implying that the eight color background improved our model performance 4 discussion 4 1 advantages of the developed framework the framework design and application in our case study demonstrated its high value in water turbidity prediction different from satellite images widely used for large scale investigation of water turbidity clarity bi et al 2018 feng et al 2012 hou et al 2017 zhao et al 2011 the framework aimed to provide a cost effective way to predict water turbidity compared with previous studies in turbidity prediction measurement bayram et al 2018 koydemir et al 2019 leeuw and boss 2018 the developed framework had several advantages including model update uncertainty quantification rfe algorithm for variable selection and cross validation to achieve an adequately evaluated model several existing models sensors provided a fixed uncertainty values for application that is not necessarily true because the uncertainty can be reduced in case that more paired data records an image and measured turbidity for each record were used for model development bayesian modeling in our study provided an excellent avenue for uncertainty estimation that is also confirmed in previous publications reichstein et al 2019 the framework included a model update method aiming to reduce model uncertainties via updating both model structures and parameters such strategy has a maximum use of increasing measured data and is thus particularly useful under the context of ever increasing measured dataset worldwide to ensure the generality and performance of the developed models we have several specific strategies during the water sampling procedure 1 as shown in table s1 water samples were collected from eight different types of aquatic ecosystems included large lakes surface area 100 km2 e g lake taihu and poyang urban lakes e g lake xuanwu in nanjing mountain reservoirs urban rivers rural rivers long rivers length 1000 km e g yangtze river agricultural ponds across china the intensive sampling at a national scale would support us to obtain a broad range of water samples the wide covering of water bodies would ensure the usefulness of the framework in various water body types 2 the images for these water samples were taken using 13 various smartphones e g iphone 8 plus and huawei nova 4 in various weather conditions e g sunny and cloudy conditions table s1 the model performance revealed an unbiased model error among these data records from 13 smartphones figure s5 implying the effectiveness of our bayesian based framework to predict water turbidity using images from various smartphones the wide covering of smartphones and weather conditions would improve the reliability of our developed framework to be used in various smartphones and under various weather light conditions 4 2 potential applications of the developed framework although used in water turbidity prediction this framework is transferable to predict other water quality variables this study predict turbidity for inland waters by using only a data driven i e non physically based approach despite being data driven the framework is generic and therefore should be readily transferable to other water quality variables that can be potentially reflected by smartphone images notwithstanding the simple dataset 120 data records to test the develop framework our testing results fig 4 clearly revealed more robust ability in case of increasing dataset therefore we can expect a better model performance in future notwithstanding the promising performance of the framework we still needed several strategies to achieve its broad use 1 combing the framework into a smartphone application to predict water turbidity given the widely use of smartphone smartphone prediction of water quality is strongly encouraged bayram et al 2018 koydemir et al 2019 leeuw and boss 2018 the developed framework is so far a conceptual method however given that its implementation procedures and corresponding equations algorithms were provided in our study the framework can be easily combined into a smartphone application with its visualization design in fig 5 this smartphone application can thus be a cost effective device to predict water turbidity as an alternative to existing turbidimeters in water management practice 2 adjusting the water depth for high turbidity water as showed in fig 1 we used a water depth of 15 cm to take an image due to the relatively low turbidity 150 ntu in the study area however it is important to note that the water depth of 15 cm is not the unique choose and can be adjusted as required based on our testing experiment using the water depth of 10 15 and 20 cm figure s6 we found that a larger water depth would resulted in a useless of the multi color background at a lower water turbidity i e the multi color background is not visible in the smartphone image if we used an extremely low water depth e g 5 cm less information signal of the water sample can be found in the images therefore a medium value 15 cm of water depth was used in this study however the depth can be reduced to build another training and validation dataset for water with extremely high turbidity 4 3 uncertainties in the developed framework and future work although the developed framework had several striking advantages as discussed in section 4 1 it is important to note that there are several existing weaknesses uncertainties some of them required our improvements in future 1 water color can be significantly affected by the substances e g phytoplankton sand humus and dissolved colored material cdom in the water column for example cdom strongly absorbs light in the blue part of the spectrum bricaud et al 1981 and thus distinctly change water color although an eight color background design was used to eliminate the influences of these substances on water color an extremely high concentration would result in an invalid use of this eight color background i e background colors cannot be seen within the image this implied that our framework so far cannot well estimate the water turbidity for the water samples with extremely high turbidity especially caused by the substances with specific colors 2 performance model fit and uncertainties of the developed framework was highly depended on the sampling data for model training therefore collecting more data records water samples and images from various types of water bodies should be an on going effort to improve the overall performance of the framework in particularly images with diverse noise conditions can improve the ability of our framework to filter out noise reichstein et al 2019 and thus improve its generality for a broader use 3 in our framework the quality of smartphone images can be more or less affected by several factors mainly including light conditions smartphone types and shooting angle and thus increased data uncertainties of our bayesian models light conditions can be significantly affected by weather conditions e g sunny cloudy rainy conditions in field various smartphone types e g huawei and iphone in table s1 with various charge coupled device ccd has different signal to noise ratio snr shooting angle would affect the light into the smartphone camera quantifying and reducing the noises caused by above mentioned factors is theoretically possible however generally required additional devices information in the applications e g hussain et al 2016 koydemir et al 2019 and was not implemented so far to keep our framework ease of use as an alternative we used simple strategies e g setting the smartphone to an angle that is parallel to the water surface using images from various smartphones for model training to reduce model uncertainties caused by above mentioned factors 5 conclusions a novel framework was developed in this study to achieve a robust prediction of water turbidity in various aquatic ecosystems our testing with measured data revealed that the developed bayesian model in the framework can well ns 0 73 p 0 001 predict water turbidity based on the taken images from smartphone camera more measured data images and measured turbidity used for model training would resulted in an improved model performance i e reducing model uncertainty and stable model fit given the improving model performance due to increasing measured data our future work in priority would be collecting more

16781,vivianite fe3 po4 2 8h2o is a potential phosphorus p recovery product from wastewater treatment plants wwtps however routine methods for quantification of vivianite bound p vivianite p are needed to establish the link between vivianite formation and operating conditions as current approaches require specialized instrumentation mössbauer or synchrotron this study modified a conventional sequential p extraction protocol by insertion of an extraction step 0 2 2 2 bipyridine 0 1 m kcl targeting vivianite p gu et al water research 2016 103 352 361 this protocol was tested on digested and dewatered sludge from two wwtps in which vivianite molar fe p ratios of 1 0 1 6 was unambiguously identified by optical microscopy powder x ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy the results showed that vivianite p was separated from iron iii bound p fe iii p in the sludge vivianite p constituted about half of the total p tp in the sludge from a fe dosing chemical p removal cpr wwtp but only 16 26 of tp in the sludge from a wwtp using a combination of fe dosing cpr and enhanced biological p removal ebpr the modified protocol revealed that fe bound p fe p i e vivianite p fe iii p was the dominant p fraction in agreement with quantitative 31p nuclear magnetic resonance nmr experiments moreover it was shown that the conventional p extraction protocol underestimated the fe p content by 6 35 the established protocol represents a reliable in house analytical method that can distinguish and quantify vivianite p and fe iii p in sludge i e facilitate optimized vivianite production at wwtps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phosphate recovery sewage sludge vivianite solid state 31p nmr circular economy 1 introduction phosphorus p in the form of inorganic phosphate is an essential nutrient for all living organisms therefore p fertilizers are extensively used in agriculture however the p rock reservoirs the main source for fertilizer production are non renewable and the depletion is predicted within a century mew 2016 simultaneously p is a pollutant in aquatic systems and is removed from wastewater to meet environmental discharge limits and prevent eutrophication of receiving waterbodies thus recovery of phosphate from wastewater is a promising secondary p resource in line with a circular economy it is estimated that p recovered from domestic wastewater could fulfill 15 20 of the global p demand yuan et al 2012 german legislation has since 2017 required that p in sewage sludge must be recovered for all wastewater treatment plants wwtps larger than 50 000 person equivalents if the p content exceeds 2 of the dry weight bmu 2017 the majority of p in wwtp is concentrated in the sludge due to chemical p removal cpr mainly by iron fe dosing wilfert et al 2015 and enhanced biological p removal ebpr in which p is stored as polyphosphate poly p by p accumulating organisms paos staal et al 2019 precipitation of p as struvite nh4mgpo4 6h2o has been extensively studied and is commercially available in wwtp wu et al 2019 however the low p recovery efficiency 10 50 demand for an ebpr process and the addition of magnesium salts impede its general application wu et al 2019 the demand for energy efficient wwtp has increased the use of fe dosing and anaerobic treatment wang et al 2018 which favors vivianite formation from fe reduction and phosphate liberation this makes vivianite fe3 po4 2 8h2o a promising p recovery product from wwtp wilfert et al 2015 2016 the presence of vivianite in both chemically and biologically treated sludge wilfert et al 2016 a wide range of potential applications e g fertilizer pigments and battery materials and a higher market price than struvite 10 000 vs 500 ton wu et al 2019 render p recovery as vivianite attractive in addition the magnetic properties of vivianite facilitate p recovery by magnetic separation prot et al 2019 vivianite has been observed in many parts of wwtp including excess digested and activated sludge deng et al 2020 wilfert et al 2016 in fe dosing cpr wwtp 40 50 of the total p tp was vivianite bound p vivianite p whereas a lower content 10 30 tp was observed in wwtp with ebpr wilfert et al 2016 the highest concentration has been reported in digested sludge which is ascribed to the favorable combination of anoxic conditions i e reduction of fe iii to fe ii and orthophosphate ortho p liberation from biogenic p during anaerobic digestion frossard et al 1997 prot et al 2020 salehin et al 2020 wilfert et al 2018 2016 moreover vivianite formation can be enhanced by a higher fe dosing for example 70 90 of phosphate was bound in vivianite when fe was dosed at a molar fe p ratio of 2 5 in sludge wilfert et al 2018 recently prot et al 2020 observed that the content of vivianite p in digested sludge increased from 20 to 50 of tp after doubling the fe dosing molar fe p from 0 46 to 0 85 it should be emphasized that the term vivianite in most studies especially environmental studies of sludge sediments and soils refers to a blue mixture of vivianite fe3 po4 2 8h2o colorless in pristine state and its oxidation products since vivianite is vulnerable to oxidation upon exposure to oxygen rothe et al 2016 the characteristic blue particles of vivianite are a mixture of vivianite and the different fe ii and fe iii phosphates formed by oxidation e g metavivianite fe2 fe2 3 po4 2 oh 2 6h2o lipscombite fe2 fe2 3 po4 2 oh 2 santabarbaraite fe3 3 po4 2 oh 3 5h2o strengite fepo4 2h2o and a poorly crystalline fe iii oxide hydroxide lepidocrocite γ feo oh c f table s1 and fig s1 rothe et al 2016 wilfert et al 2018 in addition vivianite in environmental samples usually contains impurities due to the presence of mg ca and mn which readily substitute for fe ii in vivianite salehin et al 2020 thus the vivianite formed at wwtp may differ chemically in oxidation state purity or crystallinity as compared to ideal vivianite fe3 po4 2 8h2o prot et al 2020 understanding the relation between vivianite formation and operating conditions at wwtp will facilitate optimized recovery of vivianite however this requires detailed knowledge about the speciation of fe and phosphate in the sludge today powder x ray diffraction pxrd salehin et al 2020 x ray absorption spectroscopy xas e g x ray absorption near edge structure xanes spectroscopy li et al 2018b 2015 and mössbauer spectroscopy wang et al 2019 wilfert et al 2016 have been employed for vivianite quantification in sludge and other environmental samples e g sediments quantification by pxrd is an in house method but only crystalline vivianite ideally 10 50 µm particles is detected whereas poorly crystalline vivianite may be invisible salehin et al 2020 thus pxrd is at best a qualitative method a relatively reliable quantification can be obtained from xas techniques and mössbauer spectroscopy which are not available on demand to most researchers xas and mössbauer spectroscopy require synchrotron access and specialized instrumentation respectively in addition the inevitable oxidation of vivianite during sample processing e g drying and transport to these facilities may alter the sample salehin et al 2020 wilfert et al 2018 hence in house methods based on conventional analytical techniques are desired sequential p extraction which successively extracts different phosphate fractions is a common approach for operational p speciation in environmental samples such as sludge li et al 2018a soils and sediments rothe et al 2016 phosphate in the sample is divided in different p pools such as loosely adsorbed p fe iii bound p fe iii p and ca bound p ca p based on their solubility in different extractants e g h2o reducing agents and acids li et al 2018a several sequential p extraction protocols are available including a scheme for p extraction in marine sediments sedex ruttenberg 1992 and a method for p extraction from freshwater sediments paludan and jensen 1995 reitzel 2005 however these common extraction protocols cannot differentiate between vivianite p and fe iii p nor specifically target vivianite p rothe et al 2016 to evaluate the potential of p recovery as vivianite it is important to distinguish between vivianite p fe iii p and other phosphate phases i e quantify vivianite p as an independent fraction in sludge vivianite is also an important fe phosphate in aquatic sediments o connell et al 2015 rothe et al 2014 thus gu et al 2016 developed an approach for quantification of vivianite p in lake sediments by including an additional extraction step with an aqueous solution of 0 2 wt 2 2 bipyridine in 0 1 m kcl referred to as bipy solution in the following to the sedex protocol of ruttenberg 1992 this extraction step relies on the complexation of 2 2 bipyridine bipy with the fe2 dissolved from vivianite fe3 po4 2 8h2o the formation of the fe bipy 3 2 complex enhances dissolution of vivianite i e releases the phosphate in vivianite gu et al 2016 1 fe3 po4 2 8h2o s 3fe2 aq 2po4 3 aq 8h2o l 2 3bipy aq fe2 aq fe bipy 3 2 aq it is noted that the fe ii phosphate extracted by this step was assigned to vivianite p gu et al 2016 as vivianite has a very low solubility product ksp 10 40 liu et al 2018 and has been identified as the predominant fe ii phosphate under environmental conditions both in sediments and at wwtp gu et al 2016 li et al 2020 wilfert et al 2018 furthermore a high selectivity towards vivianite p with a recovery rate of 89 100 was demonstrated by the bipy solution gu et al 2016 the objective of our study was to establish a protocol for reliable quantification of vivianite in sewage sludge by addition of the bipy extraction step 0 2 2 2 bipyridine 0 1 m kcl proposed by gu et al 2016 to a sequential p extraction method generally used on freshwater sediments and sludge samples dithmer et al 2016 paludan and jensen 1995 reitzel 2005 staal 2018 this allows for separation as well as quantification of vivianite p and fe iii p in sludge which has not been previously reported to our knowledge gu et al 2016 assessed the efficiency of the bipy solution on vivianite extraction using synthetic vivianite and pxrd analysis of lake sediments here we also employed a combination of inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes and quantitative solid state 31p nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy spin counting which provided a more reliable approach to validate the efficiency of the modified p extraction protocol on vivianite p and fe iii p quantification the validated protocol was employed on digested and dewatered sludge from a fe dosing cpr wwtp and a c ebpr wwtp c ebpr represents chemical enhanced biological premoval as a combination of fe dosing cpr and ebpr in which vivianite was unambiguously identified by optical microscopy pxrd and scanning electron microscopy with energy

rinsed with 75 ethanol freeze dried and ground 250 µm for optical microscopy pxrd and sem eds analyses due to hygiene concern the dried sludge samples were sealed in 20 ml glass vials with snap caps

fig s3 including the bipy solution 0 11 m bicarbonate dithionite bd 0 1 m sodium hydroxide naoh 0 5 m and 1 0 m hydrochloric acid hcl as well as 0 2 m potassium peroxodisulfate k2s2o8 for wet oxidation are reported in the supplementary material 2 3 2 extraction procedures wet fresh sludge was used for p extraction in this study solid liquid s l ratio of 0 5 g 25 ml based on wet weight to minimize oxidation of fe ii to fe iii e g degradation of vivianite during drying gu et al 2016 p was extracted following the original sequential p extraction scheme which successively used h2o bd naoh and hcl reitzel 2005 except that a bipy extraction step 0 2 2 2 bipyridine 0 1 m kcl was added between the h2o and bd extraction steps fig s3 the bipy solution was used directly without nitrogen purging because fe ii oxidation is inhibited as 2 2 bipyridine is bound to the surface of the sample gu et al 2016 the potential p species in each p fraction from the modified p extraction protocol are listed in table 1 the bipy extraction step proposed by gu et al 2016 was slightly modified in this study as described below the fe bipy 3 2 complex has an intense red color which can interfere with p quantification by the molybdenum blue method as the complex adsorbs at 880 nm fig s4 thus gu et al 2016 used activated carbon from which p was removed prior to use i e non p activated carbon to remove color from the bipy extract in the presence of 0 5 m kcl to impede p adsorption we noted that the original work contains a typo 5 0 m kcl which should be 0 5 m kcl li 2019 however our preliminary experiments showed that the non p activated carbon might still absorb p in addition to the intended color removal even though 0 5 m kcl was used this could result in bias for p quantification of the bipy extract treated with the activated carbon hence we modified the extraction and removed the red color of the bipy extract by dilution and acidification specifically 1 0 ml bipy extract was mixed with 8 8 ml milliq water and 0 2 ml 2 m sulfuric acid h2so4 this solution was left for 12 h prior to p measurement the acid degraded the fe bipy 3 2 complex and the red color disappeared the colorless bipy extract was subject to p measurement using the molybdenum blue method the procedures for the bipy extraction are described in fig 2 2 3 3 validation of the modified p extraction protocol to investigate the efficacy of bipy extraction on sludge bipy solutions with 0 1 0 2 gu et al 2016 0 4 and 0 6 2 2 bipyridine wt were used for vivianite p extraction from a sludge sample collected in the dewatering step of ejby mølle wwtp in november 2019 s l ratio 0 5 g 25 ml based on wet weight followed the procedures in fig s3 moreover the two reference vivianite materials the synthetic vivianite and the vivianite precipitate were extracted with a s l ratio of 0 01 g 25 ml to examine the efficacy of the modified p extraction protocol furthermore solid state 31p mas nmr spectroscopy was used to gain further insight into the phosphate species extracted by the bipy solution as well as to validate its efficiency for vivianite p and fe iii p extraction based on spin counting experiments c f section 2 4 2 3 4 analysis of sludge by the modified p extraction protocol the four sludge samples i e dg s dw s dg e and dw e were analyzed following the modified p extraction protocol fig s3 in triplicates with the averaged result reported moreover the sludge samples before and after bipy extraction were analyzed by pxrd to assess vivianite extraction for a

500 mhz spectrometer japan equipped with an 11 7 t oxford magnet solid state 31p single pulse sp magic angle spinning mas nmr experiments were conducted using a 3 2 mm double resonance mas nmr probe zirconium oxide rotor and 15 khz spinning speed the 31p sp mas nmr spectra of the sludge samples were obtained with a 45 pulse of 1 4 µs acquisition time of 8 2 ms and 1000 scans the relaxation delays were optimized for each sludge sample and were 20 60 s a 31p sp mas nmr spectrum of struvite was used as an external reference for p quantification by spin counting described below using identical conditions except for a 300 s relaxation delay phosphoric acid 85 wt h3po4 was used as an external chemical shift reference δiso 31p 0 ppm 31p spin counting nmr experiments were employed to quantify the fe bound p fe p in the sludge samples staal et al 2019 briefly the amount of fe p was estimated as the difference between the tp content determined by icp oes and the p content determined from the quantitative 31p sp mas spectrum of the diamagnetic species in sludge as fe p cannot be detected in the standard nmr spectral window e g 500 to 500 ppm due to paramagnetic effects wang and nielsen 2020 the p species in the sludge samples were also investigated by liquid state 31p nmr p was extracted from the freeze dried sludge using a solution of 0 25 m naoh and 0 05 m ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta 99 sigma aldrich with a s l ratio of 1 g 20 ml 16 h 500 rpm room temperature based on the method from huang and tang 2015 given the high p concentration in the sludge extract the supernatant 0 6 ml filtered through a 0 45 µm cellulose acetate membrane filter was mixed with 0 1 ml deuterium oxide d2o eurisotop 99 9 to facilitate 2h locking and referencing for liquid state 31p nmr analysis huang and tang 2015 li et al 2018a liquid state 31p nmr spectra of the sludge extracts were recorded using a 5 mm royal probe with a 45 pulse 5 0 µs acquisition time of 0

performed first to obtain information about the bulk sample properties e g elemental composition and fe p ratio for the following discussion with identification of vivianite in the sludge by optical microscopy pxrd and sem eds the concentration of vivianite was determined by the modified p extraction protocol which was validated and used for sludge for the first time to our knowledge the results from the modified protocol were also compared with those from the original protocol paludan and jensen 1995 reitzel 2005 furthermore the quantification of vivianite p and fe iii p was confirmed by 31p spin counting nmr experiments the characterization method is illustrated in fig 3 3 1 characterization of the four sludge samples and identification of vivianite 3 1 1 elemental analysis of the sludge samples by icp oes to examine the concentrations of elements relevant to the p speciation in sludge p fe al mg ca and mn in the sludge samples prior to p extraction were quantified by icp oes the results are summarized in table 2 along with basic information of the sludge and the bulk fe p molar ratios derived from icp oes for both wwtps the elemental analysis showed that p fe and ca were the major elements 0 5 1 1 mmol g whereas mg and al were presented in lower concentrations 0 1 0 2 mmol g and mn was negligible 0 02 mmol g it is also clear that ejby mølle sludge had nearly twice as much p and ca as søndersø sludge whereas the fe contents were similar this resulted in a higher fe p ratio in søndersø sludge 1 1 as compared with ejby mølle sludge 0 7 which suggested a higher potential for vivianite formation in søndersø sludge since a higher fe p ratio favors vivianite fe p 1 5 formation in sewage sludge prot et al 2020 wilfert et al 2018 3 1 2 pxrd and optical microscopy analyses the crystalline minerals in the sludge samples were determined by pxrd as shown in fig 4 the three distinct reflections at 2θ 11 3 13 4 and 18 3 from vivianite as well as reflections from quartz sio2 sand were observed in the pxrd diffractograms of all samples no reflections from other phosphates or iron minerals such as struvite apatite and hematite were observed thus pxrd indicated that vivianite was the main crystalline phosphate and iron species present in the sludge samples similar results were observed in the digested sludge from a wwtp in netherland and one in finland prot et al 2019 the presence of vivianite in the form of its characteristic blue particles due to partial oxidation rothe et al 2016 was also visually confirmed by optical microscopy fig s5 3 1 3 sem eds analysis further insight into the chemical composition of different particles in the sludge was obtained from elemental mapping by sem eds particles which contained both fe and p were observed for all samples as evidenced by a strong overlap of fe p signals in yellow with circles in fig 5 a the molar fe p ratios of these yellow areas quantified by eds were in the range from 1 0 to 1 6 which was in excellent agreement with earlier reported eds values for vivianite particles in digested sludge fe p 1 1 1 7 wilfert et al 2016 and matched the observation of crystalline vivianite by pxrd c f fig 4 the fe p ratios of the vivianite particles were below the theoretical 1 5 which was ascribed to the partial oxidation of vivianite table s1 and or the substitution of fe ii by mg ii ca ii or mn ii in vivianite prot et al 2020 rothe et al 2016 salehin et al 2020 this was supported by the elemental analysis of the vivianite precipitate in which mg ca and mn were detected in addition to fe and p fig s2 and the total molar ratio of fe mg ca mn p was 1 5 fe p 1 3 the particle size 1 10 µm agreed with that of vivianite recovered from in sewer fe iii dosed digested sludge salehin et al 2020 albeit larger vivianite particles 20 150 µm has also been reported wilfert et al 2016 we ascribed this difference to variation in the chemical conditions e g temperature ph and solids retention time srt which can influence the particle size in sludge liu et al 2018 furthermore the possible vivianite particles with overlap of fe p signals were examined at higher magnification fig 5b left from dg e with fe p 1 1 images from other sludge samples were similar and not shown unlike the synthetic vivianite fig 5b right but similar to the vivianite precipitate fig 5b center vivianite particles in the sludge had an irregular shape indicative of an agglomerate of smaller particles which is characteristic to vivianite formed in sludge prot et al 2020 salehin et al 2020 3 2 p extraction by the modified extraction protocol 3 2 1 validation of the bipy step for vivianite extraction gu et al 2016 demonstrated that the bipy solution 0 2 2 2 bipyridine 0 1 m kcl had a high selectivity on vivianite p and it extracted negligible fe and phosphate from other fe and phosphate bearing minerals such as alpo4 fepo4 2h2o ca5 po4 3oh fes2 and feco3 in addition a 0 2 2 2 bipyridine solution was sufficient to extract vivianite in normal lake sediments where vivianite may account for about half of the tp gu et al 2016 in this study the concentration of 0 2 for 2 2 bipyridine in the bipy solution was also sufficient to extract vivianite from the sludge samples fig s6 for the two vivianite reference materials i e synthetic vivianite and vivianite precipitate it was observed that 70 of tp was extracted in the bipy step fe ii p and the remaining p was dissolved in the bd step fe iii p by using the modified p extraction protocol fig s7 and table s2 this indicated that the oxidized part of vivianite fe iii p can be separated from the ideal vivianite p fe ii p by the modified p extraction protocol thus a more accurate quantification of pure vivianite ideally as fe3 po4 2 8h2o can be achieved we noted that the fe p ratios determined by extraction and eds were in very good agreement c f table s2 this indicated efficient vivianite extraction as well as separation of vivianite p and fe iii p i e oxidized vivianite in the two vivianite reference materials c f blue and dark blue color in fig s2 in addition the sludge before and after the bipy extraction was analyzed by quantitative solid state 31p nmr spectroscopy fig s8 and table s3 it revealed that poly p of biological origin in the sludge was dissolved during the bipy step which was probably due to the high temperature applied in the extraction 50 c for 24 h c f fig s3 however this p fraction should not interfere with the quantification of vivianite p as it was not degraded to ortho p during the bipy step and only determined by the molybdenum blue method after wet oxidation i e included in nrp specifically ortho p was 6 4 0 1 mg g in the bipy extract and 7 6 0 0 mg g after wet oxidation this difference 1 2 mg g matched well with the loss of poly p 1 23 mg g during bipy extraction as estimated by quantitative solid state 31p nmr c f fig s8 3 2 2 quantification of the different p fractions in the sludge samples following validation of the modified p extraction protocol section 3 2 1 the different p fractions especially vivianite p and fe iii p in the sludge samples were extracted and quantified in addition the pxrd diffractograms of the four sludge samples before and after bipy extraction were recorded fig s9 vivianite was present in the original sludge but absent after bipy extraction indicating the complete extraction of vivianite in the bipy step by using the modified p extraction protocol the operational p speciation in the sludge samples determined by the modified p extraction protocol me is shown in fig 6 a it indicates that fe p i e the sum of vivianite p bipy p and fe iii p bd p accounted for the majority of tp in the sludge with søndersø sludge 72 73 higher than ejby mølle sludge 63 64 the higher proportion of fe p in søndersø sludge was in agreement with the higher fe p ratio observed in søndersø sludge compared with that in ejby mølle sludge 1 1 vs 0 7 table 2 furthermore 52 and 48 of tp were found as vivianite p bipy p in dg s and dw s respectively whereas only 26 and 16 of tp were vivianite p in dg e and dw e respectively this implied that søndersø sludge had a higher potential of vivianite formation than ejby mølle sludge in agreement with the observation that a higher fe p ratio favors vivianite formation in sewage sludge prot et al 2020 wilfert et al 2018 the determined vivianite p concentrations were consistent with previous studies for example 40 50 of tp at wwtp relying on fe dosing e g søndersø wwtp in this study whereas only 10 30 of tp at wwtp with ebpr e g ejby mølle wwtp in this study were bound in vivianite as quantified by mössbauer spectroscopy wilfert et al 2016 in contrast higher concentrations of fe iii p bd p which may include fe iii phosphate and phosphate adsorbed on fe iii hydr oxides were observed in dg e and dw e than in dg s and dw s 37 6 47 5 vs 20 6 24 8 this may be due to the higher concentration of p in the former sludge samples 1 vs 0 6 mmol g table 2 and thus more p adsorbed on fe iii hydr oxides it is noted that p bound to reducible mn iv could be disregarded in bd p as the mn content in the sludge samples was less than 2 of fe based on icp oes analysis table 2 the higher naoh p in dg e and dw e was probably due to the more significant phosphate adsorption on minerals given the much higher concentration of p in ejby mølle sludge than in søndersø sludge as described above in addition it could also result from the dissolution of unreacted fe iii p in the bd step e g incomplete extraction due to the high p content in ejby mølle sludge this was consistent with the slightly lower quantity of fe p estimated from extraction than that based on spin counting 5 10 lower c f table 4 and section 3 3 the sludge samples showed 12 20 of tp as nrp due to the extraction of biogenic p such as organic p and poly p in the h2o bipy bd and naoh extraction steps the hcl p 1 2 residue p 1 2 and humic p 2 5 c f fig 6a were all less than 5 and not discussed further table s4 a comparison of the digested and dewatered sludge revealed a lower vivianite p content in dewatered sludge than in digested sludge especially for the sludge from ejby mølle 16 vs 26 of tp fig 6a we ascribed the lower content of vivianite p in dewatered sludge to the partial oxidation of vivianite to fe iii p during the dewatering which was operated in open air this was consistent with the higher amounts of bd p determined in dewatered sludge than in digested sludge 25 of tp in dw s vs 21 of tp in dg s 48 of tp in dw e vs 38 of tp in dg e to examine the effect of bipy extraction on the other extraction steps the four sludge samples were also analyzed by the original p extraction protocol fig s3 for a comparison as fig 6a marked as oe shows bd p which represented phosphate bound to fe iii c f table 1 comprised 57 47 58 and 57 of tp in dg s dw s dg e and dw e respectively which all exceeded the bd p values obtained by the modified p extraction protocol with separate vivianite extraction before the bd step this indicated that some vivianite p e g the oxidized vivianite in the sludge was dissolved in the bd step using the original p extraction protocol remanent vivianite would then dissolve in naoh and be included in the naoh p thus the fe p fraction in sludge was underestimated using the original p extraction bd p as compared with the modified p extraction protocol bipy p bd p c f fig 6b this may explain the higher amount of naoh p determined by the original p extraction 6 9 21 6 than the values obtained from the modified p extraction 1 0 11 9 as shown in fig 6a the total fe p in the sludge i e the sum of vivianite p and fe iii p from the modified p extraction matched well with the fe p content estimated by the 31p spin counting nmr experiments table 4 in contrast the original p extraction method which only considers fe iii p resulted in the fe p values 6 35 lower than those from the modified p extraction method fig 6b thus the original extraction method underestimated the fe p content in sludge as some vivianite p was extracted in the subsequent naoh step which may also be the case for other sequential p extraction methods without a separate vivianite extraction step 3 2 3 elemental analysis of fe and p in the bipy extracts the fe and ortho p content in the bipy extract of the sludge probed vivianite dissolution in the bipy step c f table 3 the fe p ratios of dg s dw s dg e and dw e bipy extracts were 1 0 1 0 1 0 and 1 5 respectively the ratios were lower than the stoichiometry of vivianite fe p 1 5 and this was ascribed to partial degradation of biogenic p and or dissolution of other phosphate minerals e g ca p during the bipy extraction step 24 h 50 c for the two vivianite reference materials the fe p ratio of the bipy extract matched the fe p ratio from icp oes and are lower than the ideal 1 5 c f table 3 and fig s2 gu et al 2016 observed that less than 10 of phosphate extracted by the bipy solution was from ca p dissolved from the lake sediments furthermore the oxidation of in vivianite to strengite or lepidocrocite γ feo oh will result in a molar fe p ratio lower than 1 5 in the bipy extract moreover release of mg and ca substituted for fe in vivianite will also lower the fe p ratio below 1 5 which both icp oes and sem eds clearly showed for the vivianite precipitate c f section 3 1 3 and fig s2 thus further studies on the structure and chemical composition of vivianite are needed but beyond the scope of this work 3 3 solid state 31p nmr analysis of the sludge samples 3 3 1 p speciation in the sludge samples by solid state 31p nmr spectroscopy solid state 31p nmr spectroscopy probed the diamagnetic p containing phases e g ca organic and poly p species in the four sludge samples fig 7 the main resonance δiso 31p 15 to 12 ppm was observed in the 31p mas nmr spectra with the center of gravity at 1 2 ppm for søndersø sludge dg s and dw s and 2 6 ppm for ejby mølle sludge dg e and dw e a weaker resonance from poly p middle groups at δiso 31p 23 ppm which accounted for ca 6 17 of the total intensity was also observed for søndersø sludge the spinning sidebands were attributed to paramagnetic effects from the high content of fe species in sludge c f table 2 wang and nielsen 2020 in combination with the liquid state 31p nmr spectra which observed ortho p organic p and poly p in søndersø sludge and only ortho p in ejby mølle sludge fig s10 the main resonance in the 31p mas nmr spectra of dg s and dw s most likely was an overlap of ortho p δiso 31p 9 3 ppm orthophosphate monoesters δiso 31p 6 3 ppm orthophosphate diesters δiso 31p 2 5 to 1 0 ppm and poly p terminal p groups δiso 31p 4 ppm cade menun 2005 while those of dg e and dw e were mainly attributed to ortho p e g apatite mineral ca p at δiso 31p 2 6 ppm in agreement with δiso 31p being more negative for biogenic p such as organic p and poly p than inorganic ortho p huang and tang 2015 3 3 2 quantification of fe p by spin counting the amount of p in paramagnetic species in sludge was estimated by spin counting as the difference between the tp of sludge e g tp determined by icp oes and the diamagnetic p quantified by 31p mas nmr spectra fig 7 staal et al 2019 p bound to paramagnetic elements like fe and mn is invisible in 31p mas nmr spectra under the experimental conditions used wang and nielsen 2020 as confirmed by 31p mas nmr analysis of the two vivianite reference materials spectra not shown all p in paramagnetic species was assigned to fe p e g vivianite p and fe iii p a valid assumption as the mn content was nearly two orders of magnitude lower than fe table 2 it was estimated that the fe p content in dg s dw s dg e and dw e was 12 6 12 5 17 7 and 18 7 mg g respectively these values were very close to the contents of fe p obtained by the modified p extraction protocol i e sum of vivianite p and fe iii p table 4 in contrast the original p extraction method underestimated the fe p by 6 35 c f fig 6b thus 31p nmr spin counting experiments supported that the modified p extraction protocol was a reliable method to extract and quantify vivianite p and fe iii p in sludge 3 4 application of the modified p extraction protocol for vivianite quantification to ensure complete extraction of vivianite it is recommended that the concentration of 2 2 bipyridine in the bipy solution and s l ratio are assessed when the modified p extraction protocol is used on a new type of sample for example a sample with a high vivianite content may require a higher concentration of 2 2 bipyridine 0 2 and or a lower s l ratio 0 5 g 25 ml wet weight if the objective is only quantification of vivianite p a simplified extraction method consisting of the first two steps i e h2o for loosely bound p and p in porewater of wet samples and bipy extraction for vivianite p can be used thereby reducing the number of extraction steps from six to two and the experimental time to about 30 of the full protocol fig s3 3 5 future perspectives for vivianite quantification p recovery in the form of vivianite from wwtp is an emerging technology and the analytical techniques of vivianite are still under development prot et al 2020 even xas and mössbauer spectroscopy two advanced methods used for vivianite quantification deng et al 2020 li et al 2018b prot et al 2020 wilfert et al 2018 2016 bear limitations and inaccuracy due to the impurities commonly present in environmental samples and the vulnerability of vivianite to oxidation during sample collection storage and preparation for analysis prot et al 2020 salehin et al 2020 the modified p extraction protocol established in this study provides an accessible approach for vivianite quantification by in house analytic techniques which will facilitate the analysis of vivianite and optimization of p recovery in wwtp further investigation of vivianite formation in complex environments e g wastewater and sludge and its authentic structure and how does vivianite aggregate with its oxidation products as well as ca mg or mn impurities is expected in the future for better vivianite quantification no matter which type of analytical method is used 4 conclusions this study developed a modified p extraction protocol for quantification of vivianite in sewage sludge which only relies on conventional analytical equipment and provided detailed insight into the p speciation in the sludge samples the modified p extraction protocol was validated on sludge using sem eds pxrd 31p nmr spectroscopy and icp oes with synthetic vivianite and a vivianite precipitate from a wwtp as reference materials a higher proportion of p was bound to vivianite in the cpr wwtp 48 52 than in the c ebpr wwtp 16 26 fe bound phosphate fe p which was separated into two fractions vivianite p and fe iii p by the modified protocol was the dominant p in the sludge samples 72 73 of tp in the cpr wwtp and 63 64 of tp in the c ebpr wwtp in contrast the conventional protocol underestimated fe p by 6 35 a short p extraction protocol consisting of the first two steps is applicable if the objective is quantification of only vivianite thus the established protocol quantifies vivianite in sewage sludge thereby facilitating the link between vivianite

16781,vivianite fe3 po4 2 8h2o is a potential phosphorus p recovery product from wastewater treatment plants wwtps however routine methods for quantification of vivianite bound p vivianite p are needed to establish the link between vivianite formation and operating conditions as current approaches require specialized instrumentation mössbauer or synchrotron this study modified a conventional sequential p extraction protocol by insertion of an extraction step 0 2 2 2 bipyridine 0 1 m kcl targeting vivianite p gu et al water research 2016 103 352 361 this protocol was tested on digested and dewatered sludge from two wwtps in which vivianite molar fe p ratios of 1 0 1 6 was unambiguously identified by optical microscopy powder x ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy the results showed that vivianite p was separated from iron iii bound p fe iii p in the sludge vivianite p constituted about half of the total p tp in the sludge from a fe dosing chemical p removal cpr wwtp but only 16 26 of tp in the sludge from a wwtp using a combination of fe dosing cpr and enhanced biological p removal ebpr the modified protocol revealed that fe bound p fe p i e vivianite p fe iii p was the dominant p fraction in agreement with quantitative 31p nuclear magnetic resonance nmr experiments moreover it was shown that the conventional p extraction protocol underestimated the fe p content by 6 35 the established protocol represents a reliable in house analytical method that can distinguish and quantify vivianite p and fe iii p in sludge i e facilitate optimized vivianite production at wwtps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phosphate recovery sewage sludge vivianite solid state 31p nmr circular economy 1 introduction phosphorus p in the form of inorganic phosphate is an essential nutrient for all living organisms therefore p fertilizers are extensively used in agriculture however the p rock reservoirs the main source for fertilizer production are non renewable and the depletion is predicted within a century mew 2016 simultaneously p is a pollutant in aquatic systems and is removed from wastewater to meet environmental discharge limits and prevent eutrophication of receiving waterbodies thus recovery of phosphate from wastewater is a promising secondary p resource in line with a circular economy it is estimated that p recovered from domestic wastewater could fulfill 15 20 of the global p demand yuan et al 2012 german legislation has since 2017 required that p in sewage sludge must be recovered for all wastewater treatment plants wwtps larger than 50 000 person equivalents if the p content exceeds 2 of the dry weight bmu 2017 the majority of p in wwtp is concentrated in the sludge due to chemical p removal cpr mainly by iron fe dosing wilfert et al 2015 and enhanced biological p removal ebpr in which p is stored as polyphosphate poly p by p accumulating organisms paos staal et al 2019 precipitation of p as struvite nh4mgpo4 6h2o has been extensively studied and is commercially available in wwtp wu et al 2019 however the low p recovery efficiency 10 50 demand for an ebpr process and the addition of magnesium salts impede its general application wu et al 2019 the demand for energy efficient wwtp has increased the use of fe dosing and anaerobic treatment wang et al 2018 which favors vivianite formation from fe reduction and phosphate liberation this makes vivianite fe3 po4 2 8h2o a promising p recovery product from wwtp wilfert et al 2015 2016 the presence of vivianite in both chemically and biologically treated sludge wilfert et al 2016 a wide range of potential applications e g fertilizer pigments and battery materials and a higher market price than struvite 10 000 vs 500 ton wu et al 2019 render p recovery as vivianite attractive in addition the magnetic properties of vivianite facilitate p recovery by magnetic separation prot et al 2019 vivianite has been observed in many parts of wwtp including excess digested and activated sludge deng et al 2020 wilfert et al 2016 in fe dosing cpr wwtp 40 50 of the total p tp was vivianite bound p vivianite p whereas a lower content 10 30 tp was observed in wwtp with ebpr wilfert et al 2016 the highest concentration has been reported in digested sludge which is ascribed to the favorable combination of anoxic conditions i e reduction of fe iii to fe ii and orthophosphate ortho p liberation from biogenic p during anaerobic digestion frossard et al 1997 prot et al 2020 salehin et al 2020 wilfert et al 2018 2016 moreover vivianite formation can be enhanced by a higher fe dosing for example 70 90 of phosphate was bound in vivianite when fe was dosed at a molar fe p ratio of 2 5 in sludge wilfert et al 2018 recently prot et al 2020 observed that the content of vivianite p in digested sludge increased from 20 to 50 of tp after doubling the fe dosing molar fe p from 0 46 to 0 85 it should be emphasized that the term vivianite in most studies especially environmental studies of sludge sediments and soils refers to a blue mixture of vivianite fe3 po4 2 8h2o colorless in pristine state and its oxidation products since vivianite is vulnerable to oxidation upon exposure to oxygen rothe et al 2016 the characteristic blue particles of vivianite are a mixture of vivianite and the different fe ii and fe iii phosphates formed by oxidation e g metavivianite fe2 fe2 3 po4 2 oh 2 6h2o lipscombite fe2 fe2 3 po4 2 oh 2 santabarbaraite fe3 3 po4 2 oh 3 5h2o strengite fepo4 2h2o and a poorly crystalline fe iii oxide hydroxide lepidocrocite γ feo oh c f table s1 and fig s1 rothe et al 2016 wilfert et al 2018 in addition vivianite in environmental samples usually contains impurities due to the presence of mg ca and mn which readily substitute for fe ii in vivianite salehin et al 2020 thus the vivianite formed at wwtp may differ chemically in oxidation state purity or crystallinity as compared to ideal vivianite fe3 po4 2 8h2o prot et al 2020 understanding the relation between vivianite formation and operating conditions at wwtp will facilitate optimized recovery of vivianite however this requires detailed knowledge about the speciation of fe and phosphate in the sludge today powder x ray diffraction pxrd salehin et al 2020 x ray absorption spectroscopy xas e g x ray absorption near edge structure xanes spectroscopy li et al 2018b 2015 and mössbauer spectroscopy wang et al 2019 wilfert et al 2016 have been employed for vivianite quantification in sludge and other environmental samples e g sediments quantification by pxrd is an in house method but only crystalline vivianite ideally 10 50 µm particles is detected whereas poorly crystalline vivianite may be invisible salehin et al 2020 thus pxrd is at best a qualitative method a relatively reliable quantification can be obtained from xas techniques and mössbauer spectroscopy which are not available on demand to most researchers xas and mössbauer spectroscopy require synchrotron access and specialized instrumentation respectively in addition the inevitable oxidation of vivianite during sample processing e g drying and transport to these facilities may alter the sample salehin et al 2020 wilfert et al 2018 hence in house methods based on conventional analytical techniques are desired sequential p extraction which successively extracts different phosphate fractions is a common approach for operational p speciation in environmental samples such as sludge li et al 2018a soils and sediments rothe et al 2016 phosphate in the sample is divided in different p pools such as loosely adsorbed p fe iii bound p fe iii p and ca bound p ca p based on their solubility in different extractants e g h2o reducing agents and acids li et al 2018a several sequential p extraction protocols are available including a scheme for p extraction in marine sediments sedex ruttenberg 1992 and a method for p extraction from freshwater sediments paludan and jensen 1995 reitzel 2005 however these common extraction protocols cannot differentiate between vivianite p and fe iii p nor specifically target vivianite p rothe et al 2016 to evaluate the potential of p recovery as vivianite it is important to distinguish between vivianite p fe iii p and other phosphate phases i e quantify vivianite p as an independent fraction in sludge vivianite is also an important fe phosphate in aquatic sediments o connell et al 2015 rothe et al 2014 thus gu et al 2016 developed an approach for quantification of vivianite p in lake sediments by including an additional extraction step with an aqueous solution of 0 2 wt 2 2 bipyridine in 0 1 m kcl referred to as bipy solution in the following to the sedex

phosphate extracted by this step was assigned to vivianite p gu et al 2016 as vivianite has a very low solubility product ksp 10 40 liu et al 2018 and has been identified as the predominant fe ii phosphate under environmental conditions both in sediments and at wwtp gu et al 2016 li et al 2020 wilfert et al 2018 furthermore a high selectivity towards vivianite p with a recovery rate of 89 100 was demonstrated by the bipy solution gu et al 2016 the objective of our study was to establish a protocol for reliable quantification of vivianite in sewage sludge by addition of the bipy extraction

reitzel 2005 staal 2018 this allows for separation as well as quantification of vivianite p and fe iii p in sludge which has not been previously reported to our knowledge gu et al 2016 assessed the efficiency of the bipy solution on vivianite extraction using synthetic vivianite and pxrd analysis of lake sediments here we also employed a combination of inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes and quantitative solid state 31p nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy spin counting which provided a more reliable approach to validate the efficiency of the modified p extraction protocol on vivianite p and fe iii p quantification the validated protocol was employed on digested and dewatered sludge from a fe dosing cpr wwtp and a c ebpr wwtp c ebpr represents chemical enhanced biological premoval as a combination of fe dosing cpr and ebpr in which vivianite was unambiguously identified by optical microscopy pxrd and scanning electron microscopy with energy

protocol synthesis of vivianite and characterization of the reference materials are described in detail in fig s2 2 1 2 sludge processing in laboratory the sludge samples were sealed immediately after collection and transported to the laboratory for processing within 1 h dg s and dg e slurry samples were centrifuged at 3000 rcf for 10 min to separate the supernatant from the solid fraction which was used for further investigation the two dewatered sludge samples dw s and dw e were solid pastes and not centrifuged the sludge samples were extracted within 16 h see section 2 3 2 in addition 25 ml of the solid fraction from each sludge sample was freeze dried and ground into fine particles 250 µm for solid and liquid state 31p nmr and icp oes another 25 ml solid fraction from each sample was rinsed with 75 ethanol freeze dried and ground 250 µm for optical microscopy pxrd and sem eds analyses due to hygiene concern the dried sludge samples were sealed in 20 ml glass vials with snap caps covered with tin foil to minimize light exposure and stored in a desiccator under vacuum 2 2 characterization of the sludge samples 2 2 1 bulk elemental analysis of the sludge samples by icp oes ten

fig s3 including the bipy solution 0 11 m bicarbonate dithionite bd 0 1 m sodium hydroxide naoh 0 5 m and 1 0 m hydrochloric acid hcl as well as 0 2 m potassium peroxodisulfate k2s2o8 for wet oxidation are reported in the supplementary material 2 3 2 extraction procedures wet fresh sludge was used for p extraction in this study solid liquid s l ratio of 0 5 g 25 ml based on wet weight to minimize oxidation of fe ii to fe iii e g degradation of vivianite during drying gu et al 2016 p was extracted following the original sequential p extraction scheme which successively used h2o bd naoh and hcl reitzel 2005 except that a bipy extraction step 0 2 2 2 bipyridine 0 1 m kcl was added between the h2o and bd extraction steps fig s3 the bipy solution was used directly without nitrogen purging because fe ii oxidation is inhibited as 2 2 bipyridine is bound to the surface of the sample gu et al 2016 the potential p species in each p fraction from the modified p extraction protocol are listed in table 1 the bipy extraction step proposed by gu et al 2016 was slightly modified in this study as described below the fe bipy 3 2 complex has an intense red color which can interfere with p quantification by the molybdenum blue method as the complex adsorbs at 880 nm fig s4 thus gu et al 2016 used activated carbon from which p was removed prior to use i e non p activated carbon to remove color from the bipy extract in the presence of 0 5 m kcl to impede p adsorption we noted that the original work contains a typo 5 0 m kcl which should be 0 5 m kcl li 2019 however our preliminary experiments showed that the non p activated carbon might still absorb p in addition to the intended color removal even though 0 5 m kcl was used this could result in bias for p quantification of the bipy extract treated with the activated carbon hence we modified the extraction and removed the red color of the bipy extract by dilution and acidification specifically 1 0 ml bipy extract was mixed with 8 8 ml milliq water and 0 2 ml 2 m sulfuric acid h2so4 this solution was left for 12 h prior to p measurement the acid degraded the fe bipy 3 2 complex and the red color disappeared the colorless bipy extract was subject to p measurement using the molybdenum blue method the procedures for the bipy extraction are described in fig 2 2 3 3 validation of the modified p extraction protocol to investigate the efficacy of bipy extraction on sludge bipy solutions with 0 1 0 2 gu et al 2016 0 4 and 0 6 2 2 bipyridine wt were used for vivianite p extraction from a sludge sample collected in the dewatering step of ejby mølle wwtp in november 2019 s l ratio 0 5 g 25 ml based on wet weight followed the procedures in fig s3 moreover the two reference vivianite materials the synthetic vivianite and the vivianite precipitate were extracted with a s l ratio of 0 01 g 25 ml to examine the efficacy of the modified p extraction protocol furthermore solid state 31p mas nmr spectroscopy was used to gain further insight into the phosphate species extracted by the bipy solution as well as to validate its efficiency for vivianite p and fe iii p extraction based on spin counting experiments c f section 2 4 2 3 4 analysis of sludge by the modified p extraction protocol the four sludge samples i e dg s dw s dg e and dw e were analyzed following the modified p extraction protocol fig s3 in triplicates with the averaged result reported moreover the sludge samples before and after bipy extraction were analyzed by pxrd to assess vivianite extraction for a comparison the sludge samples were also extracted using the original sequential p extraction protocol fig s3 paludan and jensen 1995 reitzel 2005 2 3 5 quantification of p in the different extracts

solution and boiled at 120 c for 1 h before p measurement by the molybdenum blue method the difference between tp and ortho p in these extracts is defined as non reactive p nrp c f table 1 total fe

500 mhz spectrometer japan equipped with an 11 7 t oxford magnet solid state 31p single pulse sp magic angle spinning mas nmr experiments were conducted using a 3 2 mm double resonance mas nmr probe zirconium oxide rotor and 15 khz spinning speed the 31p sp mas nmr spectra of the sludge samples were obtained with a 45 pulse of 1 4 µs acquisition time of 8 2 ms and 1000 scans the relaxation delays were optimized for each sludge sample and were 20 60 s a 31p sp mas nmr spectrum of struvite was used as an external reference for p quantification by spin counting described below using identical conditions except for a 300 s relaxation delay phosphoric acid 85 wt h3po4 was used as an external chemical shift reference δiso 31p 0 ppm 31p spin counting nmr experiments were employed to quantify the fe bound p fe p in the sludge samples staal et al 2019 briefly the amount of fe p was estimated as the difference between the tp content determined by icp oes and the p content determined from the quantitative 31p sp mas spectrum of the diamagnetic species in sludge as fe p cannot be detected in the standard nmr spectral window e g 500 to 500 ppm due to paramagnetic effects wang and nielsen 2020 the p species in the sludge samples were also investigated by liquid state 31p nmr p was extracted from the freeze dried sludge using a solution of 0 25 m naoh and 0 05 m ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta 99 sigma aldrich with a s l ratio of 1 g 20 ml 16 h 500 rpm room temperature based on the method from huang and tang 2015 given the high p concentration in the sludge extract the supernatant 0 6 ml filtered through a 0 45 µm cellulose acetate membrane filter was mixed with 0 1 ml deuterium oxide d2o eurisotop 99 9 to facilitate 2h locking and referencing for liquid state 31p nmr analysis huang and tang 2015 li et al 2018a liquid state 31p nmr spectra of the sludge extracts were recorded using a 5 mm royal probe with a 45 pulse 5 0 µs acquisition time of 0

performed first to obtain information about the bulk sample properties e g elemental composition and fe p ratio for the following discussion with identification of vivianite in the sludge by optical microscopy pxrd and sem eds the concentration of vivianite was determined by the modified p extraction protocol which was validated and used for sludge for the first time to our knowledge the results from the modified protocol were also compared with those from the original protocol paludan and jensen 1995 reitzel 2005 furthermore the quantification of vivianite p and fe iii p was confirmed by 31p spin counting nmr experiments the characterization method is illustrated in fig 3 3 1 characterization of the four sludge samples and identification of vivianite 3 1 1 elemental analysis of the sludge samples by icp oes to examine the concentrations of elements relevant to the p speciation in sludge p fe al mg ca and mn in the sludge samples prior to p extraction were quantified by icp oes the results are summarized in table 2 along with basic information of the sludge and the bulk fe p molar ratios derived from icp oes for both wwtps the elemental analysis showed that p fe and ca were the major elements 0 5 1 1 mmol g whereas mg and al were presented in lower concentrations 0 1 0 2 mmol g and mn was negligible 0 02 mmol g it is also clear that ejby mølle sludge had nearly twice as much p and ca as søndersø sludge whereas the fe contents were similar this resulted in a higher fe p ratio in søndersø sludge 1 1 as compared with ejby mølle sludge 0 7 which suggested a higher potential for vivianite formation in søndersø sludge since a higher fe p ratio favors vivianite fe p 1 5 formation in sewage sludge prot et al 2020 wilfert et al 2018 3 1 2 pxrd and optical microscopy analyses the crystalline minerals in the sludge samples were determined by pxrd as shown in fig 4 the three distinct reflections at 2θ 11 3 13 4 and 18 3 from vivianite as well as reflections from quartz sio2 sand were observed in the pxrd diffractograms of all samples no reflections from other phosphates or iron minerals such as struvite apatite and hematite were observed thus pxrd indicated that vivianite was the main crystalline phosphate and iron species present in the sludge samples similar results were observed in the digested sludge from a wwtp in netherland and one in finland prot et al 2019 the presence of vivianite in the form of its characteristic blue particles due to partial oxidation rothe et al 2016 was also visually confirmed by optical microscopy fig s5 3 1 3 sem eds analysis further insight into the chemical composition of different particles in the sludge was obtained from elemental mapping by sem eds particles which contained both fe and p were observed for all samples as evidenced by a strong overlap of fe p signals in yellow with circles in fig 5 a the molar fe p ratios of these yellow areas quantified by eds were in the range from 1 0 to 1 6 which was in excellent agreement with earlier reported eds values for vivianite particles in digested sludge fe p 1 1 1 7 wilfert et al 2016 and matched the observation of crystalline vivianite by pxrd c f fig 4 the fe p ratios of the vivianite particles were below the theoretical 1 5 which was ascribed to the partial oxidation of vivianite table s1 and or the substitution of fe ii by mg ii ca ii or mn ii in vivianite prot et al 2020 rothe et al 2016 salehin et al 2020 this was supported by the elemental analysis of the vivianite precipitate in which mg ca and mn were detected in addition to fe and p fig s2 and the total molar ratio of fe mg ca mn p was 1 5 fe p 1 3 the particle size 1 10 µm agreed with that of vivianite recovered from in sewer fe iii dosed digested sludge salehin et al 2020 albeit larger vivianite particles 20 150 µm has also been reported wilfert et al 2016 we ascribed this difference to variation in the chemical conditions e g temperature ph and solids retention time srt which can influence the particle size in sludge liu et al 2018 furthermore the possible vivianite particles with overlap of fe p signals were examined at higher magnification fig 5b left from dg e with fe p 1 1 images from other sludge samples were similar and not shown unlike the synthetic vivianite fig 5b right but similar to the vivianite precipitate fig 5b center vivianite particles in the sludge had an irregular shape indicative of an agglomerate of smaller particles which is characteristic to vivianite formed in sludge prot et al 2020 salehin et al 2020 3 2 p extraction by the modified extraction protocol 3 2 1 validation of the bipy step for vivianite extraction gu et al 2016 demonstrated that the bipy solution 0 2 2 2 bipyridine 0 1 m kcl had a high selectivity on vivianite p and it extracted negligible fe and phosphate from other fe and phosphate bearing minerals such as alpo4 fepo4 2h2o ca5 po4 3oh fes2 and feco3 in addition a 0 2 2 2 bipyridine solution was sufficient to extract vivianite in normal lake sediments where vivianite may account for about half of the tp gu et al 2016 in this study the concentration of 0 2 for 2 2 bipyridine in the bipy solution was also sufficient to extract vivianite from the sludge samples fig s6 for the two vivianite reference materials i e synthetic vivianite and vivianite precipitate it was observed that 70 of tp was extracted in the bipy step fe ii p and the remaining p was dissolved in the bd step fe iii p by using the modified p extraction protocol fig s7 and table s2 this indicated that the oxidized part of vivianite fe iii p can be separated from the ideal vivianite p fe ii p by the modified p extraction protocol thus a more accurate quantification of pure vivianite ideally as fe3 po4 2 8h2o can be achieved we noted that the fe p ratios determined by extraction and eds were in very good agreement c f table s2 this indicated efficient vivianite extraction as well as separation of vivianite p and fe iii p i e oxidized vivianite in the two vivianite reference materials c f blue and dark blue color in fig s2 in addition the sludge before and after the bipy extraction was analyzed by quantitative solid state 31p nmr spectroscopy fig s8 and table s3 it revealed that poly p of biological origin in the sludge was dissolved during the bipy step which was probably due to the high temperature applied in the extraction 50 c for 24 h c f fig s3 however this p fraction should not interfere with the quantification of vivianite p as it was not degraded to ortho p during the bipy step and only determined by the molybdenum blue method after wet oxidation i e included in nrp specifically ortho p was 6 4 0 1 mg g in the bipy extract and 7 6 0 0 mg g after wet oxidation this difference 1 2 mg g matched well with the loss of poly p 1 23 mg g during bipy extraction as estimated by quantitative solid state 31p nmr c f fig s8 3 2 2 quantification of the different p fractions in the sludge samples following validation of the modified p extraction protocol section 3 2 1 the different p fractions especially vivianite p and fe iii p in the sludge samples were extracted and quantified in addition the pxrd diffractograms of the four sludge samples before and after bipy extraction were recorded fig s9 vivianite was present in the original sludge but absent after bipy extraction indicating the complete extraction of vivianite in the bipy step by using the modified p extraction protocol the operational p speciation in the sludge samples determined by the modified p extraction protocol me is shown in fig 6 a it indicates that fe p i e the sum of vivianite p bipy p and fe iii p bd p accounted for the majority of tp in the sludge with søndersø sludge 72 73 higher than ejby mølle sludge 63 64 the higher proportion of fe p in søndersø sludge was in agreement with the higher fe p ratio observed in søndersø sludge compared with that in ejby mølle sludge 1 1 vs 0 7 table 2 furthermore 52 and 48 of tp were found as vivianite p bipy p in dg s and dw s respectively whereas only 26 and 16 of tp were vivianite p in dg e and dw e respectively this implied that søndersø sludge had a higher potential of vivianite formation than ejby mølle sludge in agreement with the observation that a higher fe p ratio favors vivianite formation in sewage sludge prot et al 2020 wilfert et al 2018 the determined vivianite p concentrations were consistent with previous studies for example 40 50 of tp at wwtp relying on fe dosing e g søndersø wwtp in this study whereas only 10 30 of tp at wwtp with ebpr e g ejby mølle wwtp in this study were bound in vivianite as quantified by mössbauer spectroscopy wilfert et al 2016 in contrast higher concentrations of fe iii p bd p which may include fe iii phosphate and phosphate adsorbed on fe iii hydr oxides were observed in dg e and dw e than in dg s and dw s 37 6 47 5 vs 20 6 24 8 this may be due to the higher concentration of p in the former sludge samples 1 vs 0 6 mmol g table 2 and thus more p adsorbed on fe iii hydr oxides it is noted that p bound to reducible mn iv could be disregarded in bd p as the mn content in the sludge samples was less than 2 of fe based on icp oes analysis table 2 the higher naoh p in dg e and dw e was probably due to the more significant phosphate adsorption on minerals given the much higher concentration of p in ejby mølle sludge than in søndersø sludge as described above in addition it could also result from the dissolution of unreacted fe iii p in the bd step e g incomplete extraction due to the high p content in ejby mølle sludge this was consistent with the slightly lower quantity of fe p estimated from extraction than that based on spin counting 5 10 lower c f table 4 and section 3 3 the sludge samples showed 12 20 of tp as nrp due to the extraction of biogenic p such as organic p and poly p in the h2o bipy bd and naoh extraction steps the hcl p 1 2 residue p 1 2 and humic p 2 5 c f fig 6a were all less than 5 and not discussed further table s4 a comparison of the digested and dewatered sludge revealed a lower vivianite p content in dewatered sludge than in digested sludge especially for the sludge from ejby mølle 16 vs 26 of tp fig 6a we ascribed the lower content of vivianite p in dewatered sludge to the partial oxidation of vivianite to fe iii p during the dewatering which was operated in open air this was consistent with the higher amounts of bd p determined in dewatered sludge than in digested sludge 25 of tp in dw s vs 21 of tp in dg s 48 of tp in dw e vs 38 of tp in dg e to examine the effect of bipy extraction on the other extraction steps the four sludge samples were also analyzed by the original p extraction protocol fig s3 for a comparison as fig 6a marked as oe shows bd p which represented phosphate bound to fe iii c f table 1 comprised 57 47 58 and 57 of tp in dg s dw s dg e and dw e respectively which all exceeded the bd p values obtained by the modified p extraction protocol with separate vivianite extraction before the bd step this indicated that some vivianite p e g the oxidized vivianite in the sludge was dissolved in the bd step using the original p extraction protocol remanent vivianite would then dissolve in naoh and be included in the naoh p thus the fe p fraction in sludge was underestimated using the original p extraction bd p as compared with the modified p extraction protocol bipy p bd p c f fig 6b this may explain the higher amount of naoh p determined by the original p extraction 6 9 21 6 than the values obtained from the modified p extraction 1 0 11 9 as shown in fig 6a the total fe p in the sludge i e the sum of vivianite p and fe iii p from the modified p extraction matched well with the fe p content estimated by the 31p spin counting nmr experiments table 4 in contrast the original p extraction method which only considers fe iii p resulted in the fe p values 6 35 lower than those from the modified p extraction method fig 6b thus the original extraction method underestimated the fe p content in sludge as some vivianite p was extracted in the subsequent naoh step which may also be the case for other sequential p extraction methods without a separate vivianite extraction step 3 2 3 elemental analysis of fe and p in the bipy extracts the fe and ortho p content in the bipy extract of the sludge probed vivianite dissolution in the bipy step c f table 3 the fe p ratios of dg s dw s dg e and dw e bipy extracts were 1 0 1 0 1 0 and 1 5 respectively the ratios were lower than the stoichiometry of vivianite fe p 1 5 and this was ascribed to partial degradation of biogenic p and or dissolution of other phosphate minerals e g ca p during the bipy extraction step 24 h 50 c for the two vivianite reference materials the fe p ratio of the bipy extract matched the fe p ratio from icp oes and are lower than the ideal 1 5 c f table 3 and fig s2 gu et al 2016 observed that less than 10 of phosphate extracted by the bipy solution was from ca p dissolved from the lake sediments furthermore the oxidation of in vivianite to strengite or lepidocrocite γ feo oh will result in a molar fe p ratio lower than 1 5 in the bipy extract moreover release of mg and ca substituted for fe in vivianite will also lower the fe p ratio below 1 5 which both icp oes and sem eds clearly showed for the vivianite precipitate c f section 3 1 3 and fig s2 thus further studies on the structure and chemical composition of vivianite are needed but beyond the scope of this work 3 3 solid

g ca organic and poly p species in the four sludge samples fig 7 the main resonance δiso 31p 15 to 12 ppm was observed in the 31p mas nmr spectra with the center of gravity at 1 2 ppm for søndersø sludge dg s and dw s and 2 6 ppm for ejby mølle sludge dg e and dw e a weaker resonance from poly p middle groups at δiso 31p 23 ppm which accounted for ca 6 17 of the total intensity was also observed for søndersø sludge the spinning sidebands were attributed to paramagnetic effects from the high content of fe species in sludge c f table 2 wang and nielsen 2020 in combination with the liquid state 31p nmr spectra which observed ortho p organic p and poly p in søndersø sludge and only ortho p in ejby mølle sludge fig s10 the main resonance in the 31p mas nmr spectra of dg s and dw s most likely was an overlap of ortho p δiso 31p 9 3 ppm orthophosphate monoesters δiso 31p 6 3 ppm orthophosphate diesters δiso 31p 2 5 to 1 0 ppm and poly p terminal p groups δiso 31p 4 ppm cade menun 2005 while those of dg e and dw e were mainly attributed to ortho p e g apatite mineral ca p at δiso 31p 2 6 ppm in agreement with δiso 31p being more negative for biogenic p such as organic p and poly p than inorganic ortho p huang and tang 2015 3 3 2 quantification of fe p by spin counting the amount of p in paramagnetic species in sludge was estimated by spin counting as the difference between the tp of sludge e g tp determined by icp oes and the diamagnetic p quantified by 31p mas nmr spectra fig 7 staal et al 2019 p bound to paramagnetic elements like fe and mn is invisible in 31p mas nmr spectra under the experimental conditions used wang and nielsen 2020 as confirmed by 31p mas nmr analysis of the two vivianite reference materials spectra not shown all p in paramagnetic species was assigned to fe p e g vivianite p and fe iii p a valid assumption as the mn content was nearly two orders of magnitude lower than fe table 2 it was estimated that the fe p content in dg s dw s dg e and dw e was 12 6 12 5 17 7 and 18 7 mg g respectively these values were very close to the contents of fe p obtained by the modified p extraction protocol i e sum of vivianite p and fe iii p table 4 in contrast the original p extraction method underestimated the fe p by 6 35 c f fig 6b thus 31p nmr spin counting experiments supported that the modified p extraction protocol was a reliable method to extract and quantify vivianite p and fe iii p in sludge 3 4 application of the modified p extraction protocol for vivianite quantification to ensure complete extraction of vivianite it is recommended that the concentration of 2 2 bipyridine in the bipy solution and s l ratio are assessed when the modified p extraction protocol is used on a new type of sample for example a sample with a high vivianite content may require a higher concentration of 2 2 bipyridine 0 2 and or a lower s l ratio 0 5 g 25 ml wet weight if the objective is only quantification of vivianite p a simplified extraction method consisting of the first two steps i e h2o for loosely bound p and p in porewater of wet samples and bipy extraction for vivianite p can be used thereby reducing the number of extraction steps from six to two and the experimental time to about 30 of the full protocol fig s3 3 5 future perspectives for vivianite quantification p recovery in the form of vivianite from wwtp is an emerging technology and the analytical techniques of vivianite are still under development prot et al 2020 even xas and mössbauer spectroscopy two advanced methods used for vivianite quantification deng et al 2020 li et al 2018b prot et al 2020 wilfert et al 2018 2016 bear limitations and inaccuracy due to the impurities commonly present in environmental samples and the vulnerability of vivianite to oxidation during sample collection storage and preparation for analysis prot et al 2020 salehin et al 2020 the modified p extraction protocol established in this study provides an accessible approach for vivianite quantification by in house analytic techniques which will facilitate the analysis of vivianite and optimization of p recovery in wwtp further investigation of vivianite formation in complex environments e g wastewater and sludge and its authentic structure and how does vivianite aggregate with its oxidation products as well as ca mg or mn impurities is expected in the future for better vivianite quantification no matter which type of analytical method is used 4 conclusions this study developed a modified p extraction protocol for quantification of vivianite in sewage sludge which only relies on conventional analytical equipment and provided detailed insight into the p speciation in the sludge samples the modified p extraction protocol was validated on sludge using sem eds pxrd 31p nmr spectroscopy and icp oes with synthetic vivianite and a vivianite precipitate from a wwtp as reference materials a higher proportion of p was bound to vivianite in the cpr wwtp 48 52 than in the c ebpr wwtp 16 26 fe bound phosphate fe p which was separated into two fractions vivianite p and fe iii p by the modified protocol was the dominant p in the sludge samples 72 73 of tp in the cpr wwtp and 63 64 of tp in the c ebpr wwtp in contrast the conventional protocol underestimated fe p by 6 35 a short p extraction protocol consisting of the first two steps is applicable if the objective is quantification of only vivianite thus the established protocol quantifies vivianite in sewage sludge thereby facilitating the link between vivianite

16782,the effects of the injection parameters on delivery of nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi to contaminated groundwater were investigated the first two nzvi injections gravity injection at low flow rates resulted in nzvi being poorly mobile and gave total cumulative mass recoveries at the monitoring wells of 1 07 2 43 nzvi reached some wells kdmw 3 mw 2 mw 4 and mw 7 earlier than the bromide tracer the dominant travel directions for nzvi and the bromide tracer were very different the nzvi transport characteristics suggested that targeted nzvi delivery requires preferential groundwater flow paths and local heterogeneity to be considered in the gravity injection tests the maximum nzvi concentrations and cumulative nzvi mass recoveries in the wells decreased markedly as the injected nzvi concentration and dose increased in the third and fourth tests in which nzvi was injected under pressure at high flow rates nzvi was effectively delivered to the wells despite the injected nzvi concentration and dose being high relatively high cumulative mass recoveries of 26 0 and 74 5 were found for the third and fourth injections respectively controlling the flow rate pressure and nzvi concentration and dose simply and effectively controlled nzvi mobility in the groundwater the colloidal and electrostatic characteristics of the nzvi particles were monitored and modeled and the results indicated that nzvi particles without derjaguin landau verwey overbeek energy barriers were successfully delivered to the target zone and that decreased magnetic attractive forces between nzvi particles caused by iron corrosion probably decreased the degree of nzvi particle aggregation and therefore contributed to nzvi being delivered to the target zone graphical abstract image graphical

contaminated aquifer and allowed to become distributed to areas containing pollutants or into which pollutants will spread successful remediation requires nzvi to be delivered effectively and distributed evenly in the target treatment zone numerous studies aimed at improving the poor mobility of nzvi have been performed in recent decades in many of these studies nzvi surfaces have been coated with a polymer e g polyacrylic acid paa or carboxymethyl cellulose or surfactants have been added to improve nzvi particle stability cohen and weisbrod 2018 dong et al 2017 jiemvarangkul et al 2011 klimkova et al 2011 saleh et al 2008 coated nzvi particles have been found to be more mobile than uncoated nzvi particles in laboratory scale column experiments he et al 2007 kocur et al 2013 saleh et al 2008 tiraferri and sethi 2009 but coated nzvi particles have been found to have limited mobilities traveling only 1 5 m in groundwater in field experiments busch et al 2015 chowdhury et al 2015 chuang et al 2016 johnson et al 2013 kocur et al 2014 luna et al 2015 zhang 2003 the mobilities of nzvi particles in an aquifer will be affected by various physical and chemical factors including

et al 2010 phenrat et al 2007 yin et al 2012 the effects of these factors on nzvi particle mobility have been evaluated in numerous studies however most of these studies involved nzvi mobility tests using laboratory scale columns or transport models crampon et al 2018 he et al 2009 jiemvarangkul et al 2011 li and prigiobbe 2020 several field scale studies have been performed but were focused on determining pollutant treatment efficiencies kocur et al 2016 phenrat et al 2019 wei et al 2010 a few systematic field studies of nzvi particle mobilities have been performed cohen and weisbrod 2018 elliott and zhang 2001 johnson et al 2013 kocur et al 2014 wei et al 2012 controlling the injection parameters e g nzvi concentration and dose and injection flow rate is one of the most effective ways of controlling nzvi mobility and delivery to the target zone kocur et al 2014 stated that most studies of the effects of different groundwater velocities on nzvi movement have been performed using laboratory scale columns with velocities between 15 and 100 m d he et al 2009 kanel et al 2007 phenrat et al 2009 which is much higher than pore velocities that are found in the field according to phenrat et al 2019 in field applications the injection concentration dose and injection flow rate of nzvi are interconnected and directly related to the contaminant concentrations contaminated area and contaminant degradation rates in other words if an nzvi injection concentration is determined to suit the contaminant concentrations and contaminant degradation rates the nzvi injection dose needs to be determined next to suit the contaminated area and the injection flow rate should be selected taking the travel distance of the injected nzvi into consideration however the effects of changes to the injection parameters on nzvi mobility have been assessed in very few studies in the study described here the mobilities of nzvi particles injected into an aquifer contaminated with the dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl trichloroethylene tce were investigated in the field this is a follow up of a previous publication in which the successful remediation of tce in this aquifer through a series of injections of nzvi particles was described ahn et al 2016 injecting nzvi at the site successfully removed 95 7 of the tce in the groundwater in 60 d without producing chlorinated intermediates the objectives of the study presented here were to assess the transport characteristics of nzvi particles injected using various injection parameters flow rates nzvi concentrations and nzvi doses to determine how nzvi delivery to the groundwater can be improved breakthrough curves btcs for a bromide tracer dissolved iron and nzvi particles were constructed using data acquired through extensive monitoring at wells the main parameters that were measured were the maximum nzvi concentration nzvi mass recovery and mean nzvi travel velocity the nzvi particles were characterized by determining the hydrodynamic diameters and zeta potentials of the nzvi particles and by estimating the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo energy values of the nzvi particles to the best of our knowledge this is the first time these variables have been monitored in detail under different nzvi injection conditions at a contaminated groundwater site 2 material and methods 2 1 site description the field tests were performed at a site at which the groundwater is contaminated with tce the site is the gangwon do road management office at the woosan industrial complex wonju korea the aquifer contains sedimentary and alluvial deposits 0 0 3 0 m deep above weathered zones 3 0 4 5 m deep there are fractured rocks below the aquifer fig 1 ten wells were installed around the pre existing well kdmw 3 to allow the bromide tracer and nzvi to be injected and monitored fig 1 nine monitoring wells mw 1 mw 9 were installed radially around an injection well iw each monitoring well was either 2 or 4 m from the iw the iw and mw 1 mw 8 had screens between 1 5 and 6 0 m below ground surface mw 9 which had screens between 6 0 and 15 0 m below ground surface was installed to allow contamination of the fractured rock layer to be evaluated groundwater flow meter analysis indicated that overall the groundwater flowed from south to north which was explained by the topography being higher in the south and lower in the north the mean hydraulic conductivity of the study area determined by performing slug tests was 5 14 10 4 cm s ahn et al 2016 the target zone for the delivery of nzvi was contaminated with tce which was in the form of a dnapl in the lower part of the iw and diffused throughout the study area a detailed history of pollution at the site and the hydrogeological characteristics of the site were published by ahn et al 2016 2 2 bromide tracer test bromide br as nabr 99 junsei chemical tokyo japan was used as a conservative tracer in multi well tracer tests a solution containing bromide at a concentration of 1333 3 mg l was injected into the iw at a flow rate of 1 23 l min for 0 33 d the bromide concentration in each sample was determined as soon as a sample was collected over a period of 10 d after the bromide had been injected the bromide concentration was determined using orion ise 9435 ion selective electrodes thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa calibrated using bromide solutions that had been analyzed using a dionex system 1500 ion chromatograph thermo fisher scientific 2 3 nzvi injection and monitoring the paa stabilized nzvi called nanofer 25s nanoiron company židlochovice czech republic was used in the tests paa is a weak anionic polyelectrolyte that combines with nzvi through chelation to the iron hydr oxide shell and improves the mobility of the nzvi nzvi was injected in four tests and the total mass of nzvi added was 30 75 kg dry weight table 1 different nzvi injection parameters were used in the different tests to attempt to successfully remediate the contaminated aquifer and to test the effects of different injection parameters on nzvi transport through the aquifer the injection parameters and procedures used are shown in table 1 a solution containing nzvi was supplied to the iw without pressure applied i e allowing gravity to feed the solution into the aquifer in the first two injection tests injection 1 and injection 2 in injection 1 and injection 2 a solution containing nzvi was injected into the iw by gravity on 4 may 2012 and 9 november 2012 respectively injection 1 was considered to be a preliminary test that was conducted at a nzvi concentration of 2 5 g l so as not to affect the second injection at the same well based on the results from the laboratory experiments and literature the nzvi concentration for injection 2 was double the concentration for injection 1 and the nzvi dose for injection 2 was 10 times higher than the dose for injection 1 to allow the effects of using different nzvi concentrations and doses on nzvi transport to be investigated injection 3 and injection 4 were made in pressurized injection mode to increase the amount of nzvi delivered through different wells from the well used for the first two injections injection 4 was performed to assess the effect of changing the injection flow rate the injection flow rate nzvi concentration and nzvi dose were higher for each injection than for the previous injection nzvi was injected to a depth of between 1 5 and 6 0 m after a single packer was installed 1 5 m from the surface systematic changes in the injection parameters were not available because only four nzvi injections were performed and because unexpected site condition changes interfered with execution of the injections groundwater samples were collected from 3 5 m below the ground surface preliminary groundwater monitoring was performed using wells established using a double packer before the study was performed and no marked differences were found between the tce anion and dissolved oxygen concentrations and ph values and oxidation reduction potentials at different depths in the aquifer each sample was collected after approximately three times the well volume of groundwater had been removed using a peristaltic pump barcelona et al 1985 each sample for dissolved iron analysis was passed through a 0 2 µm membrane filter and then quenched with 65 hno3 merck darmstadt germany each sample for total iron analysis was quenched with 65 hno3 without being filtered solid samples in groundwater were collected from each well for iron speciation analysis of the nzvi particles each solid in groundwater sample was subjected to solid liquid separation immediately after being collected all samples for analysis were collected in duplicate and transported to the laboratory at between 0 and 6 c in a cooler 2 4 chemical analyses each sample for total iron analysis was digested in 37 hcl merck then an aliquot of the solution was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min the dissolved and the toal iron concentrations in the samples were determined using an analyst 800 atomic absorption spectrometer perkinelmer waltham ma usa the iron concentration in the undigested sample was defined as dissolved iron and the iron concentration in the digested sample was defined as the total iron concentration the iron particle concentration was defined as the difference between the dissolved and total iron concentrations synchrotron based x ray absorption near edge structure analysis was performed to quantify the iron components zero valent iron magnetite green rust hematite goethite lepidocrocite and maghemite in the nzvi particles in groundwater the analyses were performed using the 8cnano x ray absorption fine structure beamline in the pohang accelerator laboratory in pohang korea data were acquired in the region of the fe k edge 7112 ev the contributions of the seven iron minerals to the total iron content of a nzvi sample were determined by linear combination fitting performed using demeter version 0 9 24 software the paa concentration in each water sample was determined from the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration in the water which was determined using a toc v total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu kyoto japan the hydrodynamic diameters and zeta potentials of the nzvi particles were determined using an elsz2000 zetasizer otsuka electronics osaka japan the hydrodynamic diameters of the particles were determined from the dynamic scattering of light at 633 nm the zeta potentials of the particles were estimated from the electrophoretic mobilities of the particles 2 5 evaluation of nzvi transport and aggregation the main transport parameters mean travel time mean travel velocity of the mass center and cumulative mass recovery for the materials the bromide tracer dissolved iron and nzvi particles were estimated by performing temporal moment analysis using the relevant concentrations determined from the btcs the normalized first temporal moment m 1 was calculated using eq 1 yu et al 1999 kim 2004 1 m 1 m 1 m 0 i 1 n t i c i t i 1 c i 1 2 t i 1 t i i 1 n c i c i 1 2 t i 1 t i in eq 1 m 0 and m 1 are the absolute zeroth moment and first moment respectively c i mg l and c i 1 mg l are the concentrations of the material injected into the well at sampling times t i d and t i 1 d respectively and m 1 is the mean breakthrough time the mean travel velocity v for the mass center of the injected material was calculated from the first temporal moment m 1 yu et al 1999 kim 2004 using eq 2 2 v z m 1 t s 2 where z m is the distance between the iw and monitoring well and t s d is the injection time for the material the cumulative mass recovery defined as the amount of recovered material to the amount of injected material ratio was calculated using eq 3 3 cumulative mass recovery q o u t m 0 q i n j c i n j t i n j 100 where m 0 is the absolute zeroth moment c i n j mg l is the initial concentration of the injected material t i n j d is the injection time for the material and q i n j l d and q o u t l d are the injection flow rate for the material and the groundwater pumping rate respectively at sampling time t i d the retardation factor of nzvi was calculated by dividing the mean travel velocity of the tracer by the mean travel velocity of nzvi the dlvo interaction energies of the particles which take into consideration electrical double layer repulsion and van der waals attraction were calculated using equations presented by gregory 1975 hunter 1992 and russel et al 1989 the extended dlvo model which takes the magnetic attractive force into consideration may have been more suitable for assessing the behaviors of the nzvi particles but it is not easy to produce a good estimate of the magnetic attractive force dependent on the type and degree of aging of iron particles this was shown in experiments performed by phenrat et al 2007 2008 who reported that the measured nzvi saturation magnetization ms required to calculate the maximum magnetic attraction force depended on the fe 0 fe3o4 content ratio of the particles which changed as the nzvi aged and that ms increased as the iron content and particle size increased the classic dlvo model was therefore used to assess the effects of the hydrodynamic particle diameter and zeta potential on nzvi particle aggregation the equations and parameters used are shown in section s1 of appendix a 3 results and discussion 3 1 nzvi transport the nzvi transport results for the gravity injection tests are shown in fig 2 injection 1 caused nzvi to reach all of the monitoring wells the closer a monitoring well was to the iw the earlier nzvi arrived nzvi generally stopped being supplied to the monitoring wells within 3 4 d of injection and the maximum nzvi concentrations at all of the monitoring wells except mw 7 were reached within 2 d the maximum nzvi concentration at mw 7 was reached on day 4 probably because this well was furthest from the iw and was situated off the main groundwater flow direction from the iw however the maximum nzvi concentration was reached earlier on day 2 at mw 8 which was the furthest well from the iw than at mw 7 this suggests that a there was a locally developed flow path toward the northeast this was corroborated by the maximum recovered concentration to injected concentration ratio cmax c0 for the tracer shown in fig 3 a being higher at mw 8 than at mw 7 the cumulative mass recoveries for the wells were 1 07 2 43 injection 2 gave nzvi btcs similar to those for injection 1 however the cumulative mass recoveries were 0 211 0 577 which were markedly lower than for injection 1 fig 2 the cmax c0 values for nzvi at the monitoring wells were 0 201 0 558 which were considered to be rather low fig 3c it has been suggested that most nzvi particles added to an aquifer become attached to other particles in the aquifer or form aggregates and are filtered out by the aquifer pores busch et al 2015 chuang et al 2016 kocur et al 2014 this would have caused most of the nzvi particles to stay within 2 m of the iw and have prevented the particles from reaching the monitoring wells this conclusion was supported by the estimate that 57 3 of the injected nzvi was consumed in terms of the nzvi reduction capacity through reactions with tce nitrate and dissolved oxygen during a 60 d treatment in a previous study ahn et al 2016 however it is also possible that a proportion of the nzvi was transported in channels other than the channels connecting the iw and monitoring wells and eventually migrated out of the target zone the limited nzvi particle mobilities found in the gravity injection tests led us to perform the pressure injection tests described below it is interesting to compare nzvi transport with transport of a conservative bromide tracer the cmax c0 values and mean velocities of travel between the iw and the monitoring wells were determined from the nzvi injection 2 and bromide tracer btcs fig s1 respectively and are shown in fig 3 the cmax c0 values indicated that the bromide tracer migrated more toward wells mw 2 mw 4 and mw 5 than the other monitoring wells fig 3a implying that wells mw 2 mw 4 and mw 5 were more hydraulically connected to the iw than were the other wells the bromide tracer was transported more effectively to well mw 2 northeast of the iw than to well mw 5 northwest of the iw however the mean travel velocity later called the travel velocity of the bromide tracer was highest for well mw 7 northwest of the iw which had a low cmax c0 value fig 3b this indicated that groundwater flowed through preferential paths within the target zone preferential flow paths could have been caused by irregularities in the aquifer as was found in laboratory and field experiments performed by kocur et al 2014 it is also interesting to examine the differences between the nzvi and bromide tracer travel velocities the bromide tracer travel velocity was highest for wells mw 5 and mw 7 northwest of the iw but the nzvi travel velocity was highest for well mw 2 northeast of the iw the retardation factors the bromide tracer to nzvi travel velocity ratios for transport between the iw and the wells were all 1 0 the retardation factors for wells kdmw 3 mw 2 mw 4 mw 5 and mw 7 were 0 663 0 257 0 752 0 987 and 0 986 respectively this implied that nzvi arrived earlier than the bromide tracer at the monitoring wells this could be explained by the presence of preferential flow paths at the site however it is also possible the higher injection flow rate of the bromide tracer 1 23 l min than the nzvi 0 87 l min caused the low retardation factors the higher injection flow rate for the bromide tracer could have caused the bromide tracer to have been transported through small connecting channels in addition to the main connecting channels through which nzvi was mainly transported this would have resulted in the bromide tracer having longer travel times than the nzvi between the iw and the monitoring wells 3 2 effects of the concentration and dose of injected nzvi on nzvi transport comparing the injection 1 and injection 2 btcs fig 2 allowed the effects of the concentration and dose of injected nzvi on nzvi transport to be evaluated this was because the nzvi concentration and dose were two and 10 times higher respectively for injection 2 than injection 1 table 1 the cmax c0 values and the cumulative nzvi mass recoveries derived from the btcs were compared the results confirmed that nzvi injected during injection 1 and injection 2 was transported to all of the monitoring wells the nzvi cmax c0 values were markedly lower for injection 2 than injection 1 for all of the monitoring wells except mw 5 the cmax c0 values for injection 1 and injection 2 were 0 263 0 467 and 0 201 0 558 respectively this led us to propose that increasing the nzvi concentration in the range we used 2 5 5 g l would decrease nzvi mobility it has been found that increasing the concentration of nanomaterial injected increases the collision efficiency between nanomaterial particles and between nanomaterial particles and the porous medium which will increase the nanomaterial particle size through aggregation and increase the injected particle to porous medium attachment efficiency considerably phenrat et al 2009 raychoudhury et al 2012 increasing the concentration of nanoparticles injected can potentially clog the pores of the porous medium and therefore decrease the permeability of the aquifer and redirect the groundwater flow in summary increasing the concentration of nanomaterials injected decreases the nanomaterial mobility ersenkal et al 2011 found in column experiments that increasing the nanoparticle stabilized with paa concentration decreased nanoparticle mobility however kasel et al 2013 and sun et al 2015 found that surface attachment sites on particles were rapidly occupied by nanomaterials injected at a high concentration and that this decreased the blocking effect and therefore increased the mobility of the nanomaterials in our study increasing the nzvi concentration injected decreased rather than increased nzvi mobility the cumulative mass recoveries at all of the monitoring wells on day 10 were 70 4 96 6 lower for injection 2 than injection 1 the cmax c0 values were not so dramatically lower for injection 2 than injection 1 fig 2 the cumulative mass recovery can be regarded as an indirect indicator of the effect of the nzvi dose increasing the nzvi dose by a factor of 10 decreased the cumulative mass recoveries much more than the cmax c0 values leading to the conclusion that both the concentration and dose of injected nzvi determined nzvi mobility 3 3 enhanced nzvi delivery through pressure injection before injection 3 was performed we hypothesized that increasing the injection flow rate would facilitate nzvi delivery in the aquifer nzvi slurry was therefore injected under pressure which increased the injection flow rate from 0 87 l min achieved during injection 2 to 1 l min during injection 3 to avoid clogging the aquifer pores and to minimize potential interferences by nzvi particles already deposited in the aquifer during injection 1 and injection 2 injection 3 was performed through well mw 1 which was 2 m southeast of the iw the cmax c0 values and cumulative mass recoveries indicated that the nzvi was transported to wells kdmw 3 mw 2 and mw 8 fig 4 a and 4 b marked changes in nzvi concentrations were not found at the other wells the maximum cumulative recovery was strongly increased to 21 6 the maximum cumulative recoveries for injection 1 and injection 2 were 2 42 and 0 577 respectively nzvi migrated most strongly to well mw 2 northeast of the iw and downstream of well mw 1 a higher nzvi injection flow rate was achieved during injection 4 which was performed through well mw 3 the injection flow rate was 50 higher than the injection flow rate achieved during injection 3 table 1 nzvi was transported to the iw and wells mw 4 mw 5 mw 6 and mw 7 fig 4 a and 4 b and migrated most strongly to well mw 7 northwest of the iw and downstream of mw 3 the nzvi concentration and dose were also approximately 50 higher for injection 4 than injection 3 table 1 it would be expected that increasing the concentration and dose of injected nzvi would have compromised the nzvi particle mobility as was observed for injection 2 for which the nzvi concentration and dose were two and 10 times higher respectively than for injection 1 however the total mass recovery of nzvi the total nzvi recovered at all of the monitoring wells was much higher for injection 4 74 5 than for injection 3 26 0 the nzvi mass recoveries achieved in injection 3 and injection 4 were compared taking into consideration the nzvi slurry was injected in different wells mw 1 for injection 3 and mw 3 for injection 4 dissolved iron in the nzvi injection tank containing the nzvi slurry was used as a tracer to take into account the different wells that were used for the different injections it was assumed that the dissolved iron btcs indicated the intrinsic hydrogeological characteristics of the flow paths from each injection well the cmax c0 values and mass recoveries for dissolved iron at the monitoring wells after injection 3 and injection 4 are shown in fig 4 c and 4 d the cmax c0 values and mass recoveries of nzvi were divided by the cmax c0 values and mass recoveries of dissolved iron for each monitoring well respectively and the results were called the normalized cmax c0 values and normalized mass recoveries of nzvi respectively these normalized values allowed the results for injection 3 and injection 4 to be compared the background dissolved iron concentration was 0 015 mg l which was negligible compared with the dissolved iron concentrations of 12 8 21 6 mg l caused by injecting nzvi slurry from the injection tank as shown in the inset in fig 4 c the sum of the normalized cmax c0 values was markedly higher for injection 4 1 23 than injection 3 0 235 the sum of the normalized cumulative masses of nzvi was also markedly higher for injection 4 8 58 than injection 3 2 36 the highest cumulative mass recovery of nzvi 38 1 was found for well mw 7 for injection 4 even though well mw 7 was the furthest monitoring well at 4 4 m from the injection well fig 4 b this indicated that nzvi was delivered relatively well in our study busch et al 2015 found a 12 recovery of carbon iron colloids stabilized with carboxymethyl cellulose 5 3 m from the injection point and kocur et al 2014 did not detect nzvi particles in wells 1 m from the injection well the maximum nzvi and dissolved iron concentrations occurred almost simultaneously in wells kdmw 3 mw 2 mw 4 mw 5 mw 6 mw 7 and mw 8 during injection 3 and injection 4 fig s2 this may indicate that the high injection flow rates used in injection 3 and injection 4 caused the nzvi particles to be transported at the advection velocity without retardation at least at the beginning of the transport process the btcs for paa which was used as a nzvi surface coating and was monitored by determining the doc concentrations followed similar trends to the nzvi btcs fig s2 the background doc concentration in the groundwater was 5 mg l which was very low compared with the doc concentrations caused by the paa the doc concentrations in the groundwater did not exceed the initial doc concentrations in the injected slurries even when the injection flow rate was as high as 1 or 1 5 l min this indicated that minimal detachment of paa from the nzvi particles occurred at the highest flow rates that were used meaning these flow rates favored enhanced nzvi delivery in summary increasing the injection flow rate facilitated delivery of nzvi injected at relatively high concentrations and doses even though using relatively high concentrations and doses is generally considered to disfavor nanoparticle delivery we therefore suggest that increasing the injection flow rate should be considered first when improved nzvi mobility is required 3 4 predicting the aggregation characteristics of nzvi particles in the groundwater the hydrodynamic diameters later simply called the diameters of the nzvi particles were measured to allow changes in the colloidal and aggregation properties of the nzvi particles during the delivery process to be assessed nzvi particles collected from the iw and well mw 2 on day 11 during injection 2 were analyzed the pristine nzvi particles suspended in deionized deoxygenated water had diameters 200 nm suspending the pristine nzvi particles in groundwater pumped from the iw markedly increased the diameters and 95 of the particles had diameters 500 nm and most of the particles had diameters of 1001 2000 nm this was attributed to nzvi particles forming aggregates in the presence of ions in the groundwater which had an ionic strength of 4 2 mm similar results were found in previous studies cohen et al 2018 kim et al 2015 petosa et al 2010 saleh et al 2008 the mean diameter of the particles delivered to well mw 2 and collected on day 11 was 1028 79 nm this was lower than the mean diameter of the particles collected from the iw on the same day 1574 58 nm two phenomena could have caused the particles in monitoring well mw 2 to be smaller than the particles in the iw 1 larger particles may have been retained filtered out by material in the aquifer and relatively small particles more readily transported to well mw 2 2 less aggregated particles may have been more readily transported than more aggregated particles to well mw 2 it was not possible to determine whether the first possible cause was important because the solid material in the aquifer was not analyzed the second possible cause could have been important if the magnetic attractive forces between the particles were decreased because the nzvi particles became corroded in the groundwater and or the zeta potentials of the nzvi particles were kept low in addition to the dlvo forces mentioned above the magnetic force regarded as a non dlvo force also plays a key role in nanoparticle aggregation tang and lo 2013 iron speciation data were used to predict changes in the magnetic attractive forces between the nzvi particles because such changes would strongly affect aggregation of the particles magnetic attractive forces between nzvi particles were considered to be proportional to the sum of the zero valent iron fe 0 and ferrous ferric fe ii iii hydr oxide magnetite and green rust contents of the particles the sum of the fe 0 and fe ⅱ ⅲ contents of the particles transported to well mw 2 on day 11 during injection 2 contributed 21 6 of the total iron content which was much lower than the contribution of 46 5 made by fe 0 and fe ⅱ ⅲ species for the particles collected at the iw fig 6 however the zeta potentials of the particles from the iw and well mw 2 also on day 11 during injection 2 were similar at 14 6 0 5 mv and 18 6 0 8 mv respectively we therefore concluded that the main cause of the particles being smaller in well mw 2 than the iw was the decrease in magnetic attractive forces caused by the marked losses of fe 0 and fe ii iii species from the nzvi particles the dlvo energy distribution is another indicator of the tendencies of nzvi particles to form aggregates the dlvo energy profiles of the nzvi particles under different conditions were calculated and are shown in fig 5 b pristine nzvi particles suspended in deionized deoxygenated water and in groundwater from the iw had energy barriers of 124 2 kbt and 31 6 kbt respectively the repulsive force was dominant for the nzvi particles in deionized deoxygenated water so the distances between particles required to maintain dispersibility without aggregation were 0 7 430 nm the nzvi particles in the iw groundwater required considerably smaller distances 1 2 20 nm between particles to maintain dispersibility without aggregation none of the particles recovered from the iw and well mw 2 on day 11 during injection 2 had energy barriers the disappearance of the energy barriers could not explain the presence of smaller particles in well mw 2 than the iw in summary the loss of fe 0 and fe ii iii species followed by the decrease in magnetic attractive forces between the nzvi particles during the transport process appeared to have contributed to the presence of smaller particles in well mw 2 than the iw the attachment of larger nzvi particles to the material in the aquifer was probably another contributing factor 4 conclusions the transport of nzvi particles injected to remediate tce contaminated groundwater was investigated the injection parameters were changed and the effects on delivery of paa stabilized nzvi to groundwater in monitoring wells and nzvi transport were assessed gravity injection of nzvi at a low injection flow rate gave low nzvi mobility in the groundwater increasing the concentration and dose of gravity injected nzvi caused the nzvi mobility to decrease markedly pressure injection of nzvi at high flow rates allowed effective nzvi delivery at a high concentration and dose to the target zone and this resulted in successful tce treatment at the site pressure injection gave a relatively even nzvi distribution in the target zone by delivering nzvi particles in directions other than the main groundwater flow direction that was governed by a natural gradient we concluded that a high injection flow rate within the range giving minimal detachment of the nzvi stabilizer decreased nzvi transport retardation associated with high nzvi concentrations and doses monitoring data for and calculations of the colloidal characteristics and iron speciation of the nzvi particles at the site indicated that the decrease in magnetic attractive forces between the nzvi particles caused by iron corrosion could have contributed to the increase in particle stability that facilitated nzvi transport declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

16782,the effects of the injection parameters on delivery of nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi to contaminated groundwater were investigated the first two nzvi injections gravity injection at low flow rates resulted in nzvi being poorly mobile and gave total cumulative mass recoveries at the monitoring wells of 1 07 2 43 nzvi reached some wells kdmw 3 mw 2 mw 4 and mw 7 earlier than the bromide tracer the dominant travel directions for nzvi and the bromide tracer were very different the nzvi transport characteristics suggested that targeted nzvi delivery requires preferential groundwater flow paths and local heterogeneity to be considered in the gravity injection tests the maximum nzvi concentrations and cumulative nzvi mass recoveries in the wells decreased markedly as the injected nzvi concentration and dose increased in the third and fourth tests in which nzvi was injected under pressure at high flow rates nzvi was effectively delivered to the wells despite the injected nzvi concentration and dose being high relatively high cumulative mass recoveries of 26 0 and 74 5 were found for the third and fourth injections respectively controlling the flow rate pressure and nzvi concentration and dose simply and effectively controlled nzvi mobility in the groundwater the colloidal and electrostatic characteristics of the nzvi particles were monitored and modeled and the results indicated that nzvi particles without derjaguin landau verwey overbeek energy barriers were successfully delivered to the target zone and that decreased magnetic attractive forces between nzvi particles caused by iron corrosion probably decreased the degree of nzvi particle aggregation and therefore contributed to nzvi being delivered to the target zone graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanoscale zero valent iron delivery transport injection parameter pressure injection flow rate 1 introduction nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi particles can effectively treat groundwater contaminated with chlorinated organic compounds such as trichloroethylene tce and metals such as chromium and arsenic in situ phenrat et al 2019 tang and lo 2013 nzvi is injected into the contaminated aquifer and allowed to become distributed to areas containing pollutants or into which pollutants will spread successful remediation requires nzvi to be delivered effectively and distributed evenly in the target treatment zone numerous studies aimed at improving the poor mobility of nzvi have been performed in recent decades in many of these studies nzvi surfaces have been coated with a polymer e g polyacrylic acid paa or carboxymethyl cellulose or surfactants have been added to improve nzvi particle stability cohen and weisbrod 2018 dong et al 2017 jiemvarangkul et al 2011 klimkova et al 2011 saleh et al 2008 coated nzvi particles have been found to be more mobile than uncoated nzvi particles in laboratory scale column experiments he et al 2007 kocur et al 2013 saleh et al 2008 tiraferri and sethi 2009 but coated nzvi particles have been found to have limited mobilities traveling only 1 5 m in groundwater in field experiments busch et al 2015 chowdhury et al 2015 chuang et al 2016 johnson et al 2013 kocur et al 2014 luna et al 2015 zhang 2003 the mobilities of nzvi particles in an aquifer will be affected by various physical and chemical factors including the nzvi particle properties e g shape size concentration electrochemical characteristics of the surfaces the groundwater composition and ionic strength the physical setting of the aquifer e g grain size moisture content pore size and groundwater flow direction and velocity and nzvi injection conditions e g nzvi injection flow rate concentration and dose and the viscosity of the solution petosa et al 2010 phenrat et al 2007 yin et al 2012 the effects of these factors on nzvi particle mobility have been evaluated in numerous studies however most of these studies involved nzvi mobility tests using laboratory scale columns or transport models crampon et al 2018 he et al 2009 jiemvarangkul et al 2011 li and prigiobbe 2020 several field scale studies have been performed but were focused on determining pollutant treatment efficiencies kocur et al 2016 phenrat et al 2019 wei et al 2010 a few systematic field studies of nzvi particle mobilities have been performed cohen and weisbrod 2018 elliott and zhang 2001 johnson et al 2013 kocur et al 2014 wei et al 2012 controlling the injection parameters e g nzvi concentration and dose and injection flow rate is one of the most effective ways of controlling nzvi mobility and delivery to the target zone kocur et al 2014 stated that most studies of the effects of different groundwater velocities on nzvi movement have been performed using laboratory scale columns with velocities between 15 and 100 m d he et al 2009 kanel et al 2007 phenrat et al 2009 which is much higher than pore velocities that are found in the field according to phenrat et al 2019 in field applications the injection concentration dose and injection flow rate of nzvi are interconnected and directly related to the contaminant concentrations contaminated area and contaminant degradation rates in other words if an nzvi injection concentration is determined to suit the contaminant concentrations and contaminant degradation rates the nzvi injection dose needs to be determined next to suit the contaminated area and the injection flow rate should be selected taking the travel distance of the injected nzvi into consideration however the effects of changes to the injection parameters on nzvi mobility have been assessed in very few studies in the study described here the mobilities of nzvi particles injected into an aquifer contaminated with the dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl trichloroethylene tce were investigated in the field this is a follow up of a previous publication in which the successful remediation of tce in this aquifer through a series of injections of nzvi particles was described ahn et al 2016 injecting nzvi at the site successfully removed 95 7 of the tce in the groundwater in 60 d without producing chlorinated intermediates the objectives of the study presented here were to assess the transport characteristics of nzvi particles injected using various injection parameters flow rates nzvi concentrations and nzvi doses to determine how nzvi delivery to the groundwater can be improved breakthrough curves btcs for a bromide tracer dissolved iron and nzvi particles were constructed using data acquired through extensive monitoring at wells the main parameters that were measured were the maximum nzvi concentration nzvi mass recovery and mean nzvi travel velocity the nzvi particles were characterized by determining the hydrodynamic diameters and zeta potentials of the nzvi particles and by estimating the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo energy values of the nzvi particles to the best of our knowledge this is the first time these variables have been monitored in detail under different nzvi injection conditions at a contaminated groundwater site 2 material and methods 2 1 site description the field tests were performed at a site at which the groundwater is contaminated with tce the site is the gangwon do road management office at the woosan industrial complex wonju korea the aquifer contains sedimentary and alluvial deposits 0 0 3 0 m deep above weathered zones 3 0 4 5 m deep there are fractured rocks below the aquifer fig 1 ten wells were installed around the pre existing well kdmw 3 to allow the bromide tracer and nzvi to be injected and monitored fig 1 nine monitoring wells mw 1 mw 9 were installed radially around an injection well iw each monitoring well was either 2 or 4 m from the iw the iw and mw 1 mw 8 had screens between 1 5 and 6 0 m below ground surface mw 9 which had screens between 6 0 and 15 0 m below ground surface was installed to allow contamination of the fractured rock layer to be evaluated groundwater flow meter analysis indicated that overall the groundwater flowed from south to north which was explained by the topography being higher in the south and lower in the north the mean hydraulic conductivity of the study area determined by performing slug tests was 5 14 10 4 cm s ahn et al 2016 the target zone for the delivery of nzvi was contaminated with tce which was in the form of a dnapl in the lower part of the iw and diffused throughout the study area a detailed history of pollution at the site and the hydrogeological characteristics of the site were published by ahn et al 2016 2 2 bromide tracer test bromide br as nabr 99 junsei chemical tokyo japan was used as a conservative tracer in multi well tracer tests a solution containing bromide at a concentration of 1333 3 mg l was injected into the iw at a flow rate of 1 23 l min for 0 33 d the bromide concentration in each sample was determined as soon as a sample was collected over a period of 10 d after the bromide had been injected the bromide concentration was determined using orion ise 9435 ion selective electrodes thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa calibrated using bromide solutions that had been analyzed using a dionex system 1500 ion chromatograph thermo fisher scientific 2 3 nzvi injection and monitoring the paa stabilized nzvi called nanofer 25s nanoiron company židlochovice czech republic was used in the tests paa is a weak anionic polyelectrolyte that combines with nzvi through chelation to the iron hydr oxide shell and improves the mobility of the nzvi nzvi was injected in four tests and the total mass of nzvi added was 30 75 kg dry weight table 1 different nzvi injection parameters were used in the different tests to attempt to successfully remediate the contaminated aquifer and to test the effects of different injection parameters on nzvi transport through the aquifer the injection parameters and procedures used are shown in table 1 a solution containing nzvi was supplied to the iw without pressure applied i e allowing gravity to feed the solution into the aquifer in the first two injection tests injection 1 and injection 2 in injection 1 and injection 2 a solution containing nzvi was injected into the iw by gravity on 4 may 2012 and 9 november 2012 respectively injection 1 was considered to be a preliminary test that was conducted at a nzvi concentration of 2 5 g l so as not to affect the second injection at the same well based on the results from the laboratory experiments and literature the nzvi concentration for injection 2 was double the concentration for injection 1 and the nzvi dose for injection 2 was 10 times higher than the dose for injection 1 to allow the effects of using different nzvi concentrations and doses on nzvi transport to be investigated injection 3 and injection 4 were made in pressurized injection mode to increase the amount of nzvi delivered through different wells from the well used for the first two injections injection 4 was performed to assess the effect of changing the injection flow rate the injection flow rate nzvi concentration and nzvi dose were higher for each injection than for the previous injection nzvi was injected to a depth of between 1 5 and 6 0 m after a single packer was installed 1 5 m from the surface systematic changes in the injection parameters were not available because only four nzvi injections were performed and because unexpected site condition changes interfered with execution of the injections groundwater samples were collected from 3 5 m below the ground surface preliminary groundwater monitoring was performed using wells established using a double packer before the study was performed and no marked differences were found between the tce anion and dissolved oxygen concentrations and ph values and oxidation reduction potentials at different depths in the aquifer each sample was collected after approximately three times the well volume of groundwater had been removed using a peristaltic pump barcelona et al 1985 each sample for dissolved iron analysis was passed through a 0 2 µm membrane filter and then quenched with 65 hno3 merck darmstadt germany each sample for total iron analysis was quenched with 65 hno3 without being filtered solid samples in groundwater were collected from each well for iron speciation analysis of the nzvi particles each solid in groundwater sample was subjected to solid liquid separation immediately after being collected all samples for analysis were collected in duplicate and transported to the laboratory at between 0 and 6 c in a cooler 2 4 chemical analyses each sample for total iron analysis was digested in 37 hcl merck then an aliquot of the solution was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min the dissolved and the toal iron concentrations in the samples were determined using an analyst 800 atomic absorption spectrometer perkinelmer waltham ma usa the iron concentration in the undigested sample was defined as dissolved iron and the iron concentration in the digested sample was defined as the total iron concentration the iron particle concentration was defined as the difference between the dissolved and total iron concentrations synchrotron based x ray absorption near edge structure analysis was performed to quantify the iron components zero valent iron magnetite green rust hematite goethite lepidocrocite and maghemite in the nzvi particles in groundwater the analyses were performed using the 8cnano x ray absorption fine structure beamline in the pohang accelerator laboratory in pohang korea data were acquired in the region of the fe k edge 7112 ev the contributions of the seven iron minerals to the total iron content of a nzvi sample were determined by linear combination fitting performed using demeter version 0 9 24 software the paa concentration in each water sample was determined from the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration in the water which was determined using a toc v total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu kyoto japan the hydrodynamic diameters and zeta potentials of the nzvi particles were determined using an elsz2000 zetasizer otsuka electronics osaka japan the hydrodynamic diameters of the particles were determined from the dynamic scattering of light at 633 nm the zeta potentials of the particles were estimated from the electrophoretic mobilities of the particles 2 5 evaluation of nzvi transport and aggregation the main transport parameters mean travel time mean travel velocity of the mass center and cumulative mass recovery for the materials the bromide tracer dissolved iron and nzvi particles were estimated by performing temporal moment analysis using the relevant concentrations determined from the btcs the normalized first temporal moment m 1 was calculated using eq 1 yu et al 1999 kim 2004 1 m 1 m 1 m 0 i 1 n t i c i t i 1 c i 1 2 t i 1 t i i 1 n c i c i 1 2 t i 1 t i in eq 1 m 0 and m 1 are the absolute zeroth moment and first moment respectively c i mg l and c i 1 mg l are the concentrations of the material injected into the well at sampling times t i d and t i 1 d respectively and m 1 is the mean breakthrough time the mean travel velocity v for the mass center of the injected material was calculated from the first temporal moment m 1 yu et al 1999 kim 2004 using eq 2 2 v z m 1 t s 2 where z m is the distance between the iw and monitoring well and t s d is the injection time for the material the cumulative mass recovery defined as the amount of recovered material to the amount of injected material ratio was calculated using eq 3 3 cumulative mass recovery q o u t m 0 q i n j c i n j t i n j 100 where m 0 is the absolute zeroth moment c i n j mg l is the initial concentration of the injected material t i n j d is the injection time for the material and q i n j l d and q o u t l d are the injection flow rate for the material and the groundwater pumping rate respectively at sampling time t i d the retardation factor of nzvi was calculated by dividing the mean travel velocity of the tracer by the mean travel velocity of nzvi the dlvo interaction energies of the particles which take into consideration electrical double layer repulsion and van der waals attraction were calculated using equations presented by gregory 1975 hunter 1992 and russel et al 1989 the extended dlvo model which takes the magnetic attractive force into consideration may have been more suitable for assessing the behaviors of the nzvi particles but it is not easy to produce a good estimate of the magnetic attractive force dependent on the type and degree of aging of iron particles this was shown in experiments performed by phenrat et al 2007 2008 who reported that the measured nzvi saturation magnetization ms required to calculate the maximum magnetic attraction force depended on the fe 0 fe3o4 content ratio of the particles which changed as the nzvi aged and that ms increased as the iron content and particle size increased the classic dlvo model was therefore used to assess the effects of the hydrodynamic particle diameter and zeta potential on nzvi particle aggregation the equations and parameters used are shown in section s1 of appendix a 3 results and discussion 3 1 nzvi transport the nzvi transport results for the gravity injection tests are shown in fig 2 injection 1 caused nzvi to reach all of the monitoring wells the closer a monitoring well was to the iw the earlier nzvi arrived nzvi generally stopped being supplied to the monitoring wells within 3 4 d of injection and the maximum nzvi concentrations at all of the monitoring wells except mw 7 were reached within 2 d the maximum nzvi concentration at mw 7 was reached on day 4 probably because this well was furthest from the iw and was situated off the main groundwater flow direction from the iw however the maximum nzvi concentration was reached earlier on day 2 at mw 8 which was the furthest well from the iw than at mw 7 this suggests that a there was a locally developed flow path toward the northeast this was corroborated by the maximum recovered concentration to injected concentration ratio cmax c0 for the tracer shown in fig 3 a being higher at mw 8 than at mw 7 the cumulative mass recoveries for the wells were 1 07 2 43 injection 2 gave nzvi btcs similar to those for injection 1 however the cumulative mass recoveries were 0 211 0 577 which were markedly lower than for injection 1 fig 2 the cmax c0 values for nzvi at the monitoring wells were 0 201 0 558 which were considered to be rather low fig 3c it has been suggested that most nzvi particles added to an aquifer become attached to other particles in the aquifer or form aggregates and are filtered out by the aquifer pores busch et al 2015 chuang et al 2016 kocur et al 2014 this would have caused most of the nzvi particles to stay within 2 m of the iw and have prevented the particles from reaching the monitoring wells this conclusion was supported by the estimate that 57 3 of the injected nzvi was consumed in terms of the nzvi reduction capacity through reactions with tce nitrate and dissolved oxygen during a 60 d treatment in a previous study ahn et al 2016 however it is also possible that a proportion of the nzvi was transported in channels other than the channels connecting the iw and monitoring wells and eventually migrated out of the target zone the limited nzvi particle mobilities found in the gravity injection tests led us to perform the pressure injection tests described below it is interesting to compare nzvi transport with transport of a conservative bromide tracer the cmax c0 values and mean velocities of travel between the iw and the monitoring wells were determined from the nzvi injection 2 and bromide tracer btcs fig s1 respectively and are shown in fig 3 the cmax c0 values indicated that the bromide tracer migrated more toward wells mw 2 mw 4 and mw 5 than the other monitoring wells fig 3a implying that wells mw 2 mw 4 and mw 5 were more hydraulically connected to the iw than were the other wells the bromide tracer was transported more effectively to well mw 2 northeast of the iw than to well mw 5 northwest of the iw however the mean travel velocity later called the travel velocity of the bromide tracer was highest for well mw 7 northwest of the iw which had a low cmax c0 value fig 3b this indicated that groundwater flowed through preferential paths within the target zone preferential flow paths could have been caused by irregularities in the aquifer as was found in laboratory and field experiments performed by kocur et al 2014 it is also interesting to examine the differences between the nzvi and bromide tracer travel velocities the bromide tracer travel velocity was highest for wells mw 5 and mw 7 northwest of the iw but the nzvi travel velocity was highest for well mw 2 northeast of the iw the retardation factors the bromide tracer to nzvi travel velocity ratios for transport between the iw and the wells were all 1 0 the retardation factors for wells kdmw 3 mw 2 mw 4 mw 5 and mw 7 were 0 663 0 257 0 752 0 987 and 0 986 respectively this implied that nzvi arrived earlier than the bromide tracer at the monitoring wells this could be explained by the presence of preferential flow paths at the site however it is also possible the higher injection flow rate of the bromide tracer 1 23 l min than the nzvi 0 87 l min caused the low retardation factors the higher injection flow rate for the bromide tracer could have caused the bromide tracer to have been transported through small connecting channels in addition to the main connecting channels through which nzvi was mainly transported this would have resulted in the bromide tracer having longer travel times than the nzvi between the iw and the monitoring wells 3 2 effects of the concentration and dose of injected nzvi on nzvi transport comparing the injection 1 and injection 2 btcs fig 2 allowed the effects of the concentration and dose of injected nzvi on nzvi transport to be evaluated this was because the nzvi concentration and dose were two and 10 times higher respectively for injection 2 than injection 1 table 1 the cmax c0 values and the cumulative nzvi mass recoveries derived from the btcs were compared the results confirmed that nzvi injected during injection 1 and injection 2 was transported to all of the monitoring wells the nzvi cmax c0 values were markedly lower for injection 2 than injection 1 for all of the monitoring wells except mw 5 the cmax c0 values for injection 1 and injection 2 were 0 263 0 467 and 0 201 0 558 respectively this led us to propose that increasing the nzvi concentration in the range we used 2 5 5 g l would decrease nzvi mobility it has been found that increasing the concentration of nanomaterial injected increases the collision efficiency between nanomaterial particles and between nanomaterial particles and the porous medium which will increase the nanomaterial particle size through aggregation and increase the injected particle to porous medium attachment efficiency considerably phenrat et al 2009 raychoudhury et al 2012 increasing the concentration of nanoparticles injected can potentially clog the pores of the porous medium and therefore decrease the permeability of the aquifer and redirect the groundwater flow in summary increasing the concentration of nanomaterials injected decreases the nanomaterial mobility ersenkal et al 2011 found in column experiments that increasing the nanoparticle stabilized with paa concentration decreased nanoparticle mobility however kasel et al 2013 and sun et al 2015 found that surface attachment sites on particles were rapidly occupied by nanomaterials injected at a high concentration and that this decreased the blocking effect and therefore increased the mobility of the nanomaterials in our study increasing the nzvi concentration injected decreased rather than increased nzvi mobility the cumulative mass recoveries at all of the monitoring wells on day 10 were 70 4 96 6 lower for injection 2 than injection 1 the cmax c0 values were not so dramatically lower for injection 2 than injection 1 fig 2 the cumulative mass recovery can be regarded as an indirect indicator of the effect of the nzvi dose increasing the nzvi dose by a factor of 10 decreased the cumulative mass recoveries much more than the cmax c0 values leading to the conclusion that both the concentration and dose of injected nzvi determined nzvi mobility 3 3 enhanced nzvi delivery through pressure injection before injection 3 was performed we hypothesized that increasing the injection flow rate would facilitate nzvi delivery in the aquifer nzvi slurry was therefore injected under pressure which increased the injection flow rate from 0 87 l min achieved during injection 2 to 1 l min during injection 3 to avoid clogging the aquifer pores and to minimize potential interferences by nzvi particles already deposited in the aquifer during injection 1 and injection 2 injection 3 was performed through well mw 1 which was 2 m southeast of the iw the cmax c0 values and cumulative mass recoveries indicated that the nzvi was transported to wells kdmw 3 mw 2 and mw 8 fig 4 a and 4 b marked changes in nzvi concentrations were not found at the other wells the maximum cumulative recovery was strongly increased to 21 6 the maximum cumulative recoveries for injection 1 and injection 2 were 2 42 and 0 577 respectively nzvi migrated most strongly to well mw 2 northeast of the iw and downstream of well mw 1 a higher nzvi injection flow rate was achieved during injection 4 which was performed through well mw 3 the injection flow rate was 50 higher than the injection flow rate achieved during injection 3 table 1 nzvi was transported to the iw and wells mw 4 mw 5 mw 6 and mw 7 fig 4 a and 4 b and migrated most strongly to well mw 7 northwest of the iw and downstream of mw 3 the nzvi concentration and dose were also approximately 50 higher for injection 4 than injection 3 table 1 it would be expected that increasing the concentration and dose of injected nzvi would have compromised the nzvi particle mobility as was observed for injection 2 for which the nzvi concentration and dose were two and 10 times higher respectively than for injection 1 however the total mass recovery of nzvi the total nzvi recovered at all of the monitoring wells was much higher for injection 4 74 5 than for injection 3 26 0 the nzvi mass recoveries achieved in injection 3 and injection 4 were compared taking into consideration the nzvi slurry was injected in different wells mw 1 for injection 3 and mw 3 for injection 4 dissolved iron in the nzvi injection tank containing the nzvi slurry was used as a tracer to take into account the different wells that were used for the different injections it was assumed that the dissolved iron btcs indicated the intrinsic hydrogeological characteristics of the flow paths from each injection well the cmax c0 values and mass recoveries for dissolved iron at the monitoring wells after injection 3 and injection 4 are shown in fig 4 c and 4 d the cmax c0 values and mass recoveries of nzvi were divided by the cmax c0 values and mass recoveries of dissolved iron for each monitoring well respectively and the results were called the normalized cmax c0 values and normalized mass recoveries of nzvi respectively these normalized values allowed the results for injection 3 and injection 4 to be compared the background dissolved iron concentration was 0 015 mg l which was negligible compared with the dissolved iron concentrations of 12 8 21 6 mg l caused by injecting nzvi slurry from the injection tank as shown in the inset in fig 4 c the sum of the normalized cmax c0 values was markedly higher for injection 4 1 23 than injection 3 0 235 the sum of the normalized cumulative masses of nzvi was also markedly higher for injection 4 8 58 than injection 3 2 36 the highest cumulative mass recovery of nzvi 38 1 was found for well mw 7 for injection 4 even though well mw 7 was the furthest monitoring well at 4 4 m from the injection well fig 4 b this indicated that nzvi was delivered relatively well in our study busch et al 2015 found a 12 recovery of carbon iron colloids stabilized with carboxymethyl cellulose 5 3 m from the injection point and kocur et al 2014 did not detect nzvi particles in wells 1 m from the injection well the maximum nzvi and dissolved iron concentrations occurred almost simultaneously in wells kdmw 3 mw 2 mw 4 mw 5 mw 6 mw 7 and mw 8 during injection 3 and injection 4 fig s2 this may indicate that the high injection flow rates used in injection 3 and injection 4 caused the nzvi particles to be transported at the advection velocity without retardation at least at the beginning of the transport process the btcs for paa which was used as a nzvi surface coating and was monitored by determining the doc concentrations followed similar trends to the nzvi btcs fig s2 the background doc concentration in the groundwater was 5 mg l which was very low compared with the doc concentrations caused by the paa the doc concentrations in the groundwater did not exceed the initial doc concentrations in the injected slurries even when the injection flow rate was as high as 1 or 1 5 l min this indicated that minimal detachment of paa from the nzvi particles occurred at the highest flow rates that were used meaning these flow rates favored enhanced nzvi delivery in summary increasing the injection flow rate facilitated delivery of nzvi injected at relatively high concentrations and doses even though using relatively high concentrations and doses is generally considered to disfavor nanoparticle delivery we therefore suggest that increasing the injection flow rate should be considered first when improved nzvi mobility is required 3 4 predicting the aggregation characteristics of nzvi particles in the groundwater the hydrodynamic diameters later simply called the diameters of the nzvi particles were measured to allow changes in the colloidal and aggregation properties of the nzvi particles during the delivery process to be assessed nzvi particles collected from the iw and well mw 2 on day 11 during injection 2 were analyzed the pristine nzvi particles suspended in deionized deoxygenated water had diameters 200 nm suspending the pristine nzvi particles in groundwater pumped from the iw markedly increased the diameters and 95 of the particles had diameters 500 nm and most of the particles had diameters of 1001 2000 nm this was attributed to nzvi particles forming aggregates in the presence of ions in the groundwater which had an ionic strength of 4 2 mm similar results were found in previous studies cohen et al 2018 kim et al 2015 petosa et al 2010 saleh et al 2008 the mean diameter of the particles delivered to well mw 2 and collected on day 11 was 1028 79 nm this was lower than the mean diameter of the particles collected from the iw on the same day 1574 58 nm two phenomena could have caused the particles in monitoring well mw 2 to be smaller than the particles in the iw 1 larger particles may have been retained filtered out by material in the aquifer and relatively small particles more readily transported to well mw 2 2 less aggregated particles may have been more readily transported than more aggregated particles to well mw 2 it was not possible to determine whether the first possible cause was important because the solid material in the aquifer was not analyzed the second possible cause could have been important if the magnetic attractive forces between the particles were decreased because the nzvi particles became corroded in the groundwater and or the zeta potentials of the nzvi particles were kept low in addition to the dlvo forces mentioned above the magnetic force regarded as a non dlvo force also plays a key role in nanoparticle aggregation tang and lo 2013 iron speciation data were used to predict changes in the magnetic attractive forces between the nzvi particles because such changes would strongly affect aggregation of the particles magnetic attractive forces between nzvi particles were considered to be proportional to the sum of the zero valent iron fe 0 and ferrous ferric fe ii iii hydr oxide magnetite and green rust contents of the particles the sum of the fe 0 and fe ⅱ ⅲ contents of the particles transported to well mw 2 on day 11 during injection 2 contributed 21 6 of the total iron content which was much lower than the contribution of 46 5 made by fe 0 and fe ⅱ ⅲ species for the particles collected at the iw fig 6 however the zeta potentials of the particles from the iw and well mw 2 also on day 11 during injection 2 were similar at 14 6 0 5 mv and 18 6 0 8 mv respectively we therefore concluded that the main cause of the particles being smaller in well mw 2 than the iw was the decrease in magnetic attractive forces caused by the marked losses of fe 0 and fe ii iii species from the nzvi particles the dlvo energy distribution is another indicator of the tendencies of nzvi particles to form aggregates the dlvo energy profiles of the nzvi particles under different conditions were calculated and are shown in fig 5 b pristine nzvi particles suspended in deionized deoxygenated water and in groundwater from the iw had energy barriers of 124 2 kbt and 31 6 kbt respectively the repulsive force was dominant for the nzvi particles in deionized deoxygenated water so the distances between particles required to maintain dispersibility without aggregation were 0 7 430 nm the nzvi particles in the iw groundwater required considerably smaller distances 1 2 20 nm between particles to maintain dispersibility without aggregation none of the particles recovered from the iw and well mw 2 on day 11 during injection 2 had energy barriers the disappearance of the energy barriers could not explain the presence of smaller particles in well mw 2 than the iw in summary the loss of fe 0 and fe ii iii species followed by the decrease in magnetic attractive forces between the nzvi particles during the transport process appeared to have contributed to the presence of smaller particles in well mw 2 than the iw the attachment of larger nzvi particles to the material in the aquifer was probably another contributing factor 4 conclusions the transport of nzvi particles injected to remediate tce contaminated groundwater was investigated the injection parameters were changed and the effects on delivery of paa stabilized nzvi to groundwater in monitoring wells and nzvi transport were assessed gravity injection of nzvi at a low injection flow rate gave low nzvi mobility in the groundwater increasing the concentration and dose of gravity injected nzvi caused the nzvi mobility to decrease markedly pressure injection of nzvi at high flow rates allowed effective nzvi delivery at a high concentration and dose to the target zone and this resulted in successful tce treatment at the site pressure injection gave a relatively even nzvi distribution in the target zone by delivering nzvi particles in directions other than the main groundwater flow direction that was governed by a natural gradient we concluded that a high injection flow rate within the range giving minimal detachment of the nzvi stabilizer decreased nzvi transport retardation associated with high nzvi concentrations and doses monitoring data for and calculations of the colloidal characteristics and iron speciation of the nzvi particles at the site indicated that the decrease in magnetic attractive forces between the nzvi particles caused by iron corrosion could have contributed to the increase in particle stability that facilitated nzvi transport declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

16783,as an important source of arsenic as pollution in mine drainage arsenopyrite undergoes redox and adsorption reactions with dissolved as which further affects the fate of as in natural waters this study investigated the interactions between dissolved as iii and arsenopyrite and the factors influencing the geochemical behavior of as including initial as iii concentration dissolved oxygen and ph the hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and hydroxyl radical oh generated from the interaction between fe ii on arsenopyrite surface and oxygen were found to facilitate the rapid oxidation of as iii and the production of as v in the reaction system increased with increasing initial as iii concentration an increase of ph from 3 0 to 7 0 led to a gradual decrease in the oxidation rate of as iii at ph 3 0 the presence of as iii accelerated the oxidation rate of arsenopyrite while at ph 5 0 and 7 0 as iii inhibited the oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite this work reveals the potential environmental process of the interaction between dissolved as iii and arsenopyrite and provides important implications for the prevention and control of as iii pollution in mine drainage graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords as iii active oxygen intermediate arsenopyrite synergistic oxidation 1 introduction arsenic as pollution in natural waters can cause serious human health problems ho et al 2021 huyen et al 2019 it has been estimated that over 150 millions of people in more than 70 countries may be at risk of as related diseases ravenscroft et al 2009 tabelin et al 2018 at the same time as pollution is becoming increasingly serious due to the growing demand for key metal resources including gold and copper park et al 2018a tabelin et al 2021 in natural environments as mainly comes from mining and metallurgy han et al 2003 arsenic released from excavated rocks due to natural weathering may contain more as iii than as v park et al 2018b yu et al 2007 while those from extractive metallurgy may mainly exist in the form of as v espitia and lapidus 2021 zheng et al 2020 the bioavailability reactivity toxicity and mobility of dissolved as vary with its chemical speciation couture et al 2013 jain and ali 2000 for example dissolved as iii has higher mobility and toxicity than dissolved as v jain and ali 2000 jang and dempsey 2008 therefore it is of great significance to study the migration and transformation of dissolved as in natural waters the speciation of as in waters is mainly controlled by its adsorption and redox reactions paikaray 2015 williams 2001 metal hydr oxides including fe or al hydr oxides have strong adsorption capacities for as and subsequently affect the oxidation of as iii and thus influence the fate of as iii v in the environment bostick and fendorf 2003 bostick et al 2003 morin and calas 2006 tabelin et al 2020a as is usually enriched in sulfide mineral deposits nordstrom 2002 and high concentrations of as were found in the pore waters of tailing piles acid mine drainage and rivers surrounding the mining area cheng et al 2009 kocourková et al 2011 sulfur containing minerals including fes2 fes zns and pbs can effectively adsorb and sequestrate as bostick and fendorf 2003 bostick et al 2003 the redox reactions of as iii v were also observed during their adsorption onto sulfide minerals the as iii oxidation on the surface of pbs may be caused by the oxidized sulfur species surface pb iv or oxygen bostick et al 2003 adsorbed as v can oxidize pyrite with the formation of as iii sun et al 2012 while adsorbed as iii may directly react with fes2 to produce feass and fe oh 3 bostick and fendorf 2003 or be oxidized by iron hydr oxides on the surface oxidation layer of fes2 kim and batchelor 2009 the adsorption and oxidation of as iii on arsenic containing iron sulfide minerals may also affect the release of structural as from these minerals however few studies have been specifically focused on the redox reaction between dissolved as iii and arsenic containing iron sulfide minerals which are a primary source of as pollution the redox mechanism of as iii on the surface of some iron sulfide minerals has not been fully understood the mechanism for the interaction between dissolved as iii and natural arsenic containing iron sulfide minerals needs to be further elucidated as reported dissolved as iii v released from pristine arsenic containing sulfide minerals can form secondary arsenic minerals on the surface of the parent minerals such as scorodite feaso4 2h2o which are important sinks of as under acidic conditions tabelin et al 2019 these dissolved as iii v can also be adsorbed on the surface of iron oxides such as schwertmannite goethite and akaganeite igarashi et al 2020 kocourková et al 2011 however the effect of dissolved as on the oxidation and release of as from the arsenic containing sulfide minerals has seldom been investigated our previous studies have shown that synthetic arsenian pyrite affects the fate of dissolved as iii v qiu et al 2017 2018 as the most common arsenic containing iron sulfide minerals arsenian pyrite and arsenopyrite have similar crystal structures li et al 2015 but arsenopyrite has a higher content of as in addition considering the low content of as in natural pyrite our previous study was focused on the effect of synthesized arsenian pyrite whose physicochemical properties may be somewhat different from those of natural arsenopyrite naveau et al 2007 xiu et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to further elucidate the interaction between dissolved as iii and natural arsenopyrite during the redox reaction of iron sulfide minerals reactive oxygen species ros play an important role hong et al 2018 guo et al 2020 qiu et al 2018 the ros including oh and h2o2 can be formed through the interaction between oxygen and fe ii at pyrite surface or between h2o and fe iii at the sulfur deficient sites borda et al 2003 nesbitt et al 1998 qiu et al 2018 sb iii and as iii can be rapidly oxidized to sb v and as v by oh and h2o2 on the surface of pyrite and the oxidation rate is significantly affected by the production rate of oh and h2o2 at different ph values kong et al 2015 qiu et al 2018 ros can also be produced in the process of natural arsenopyrite oxidation hong et al 2018 however the role of these ros in the interaction of natural arsenopyrite with as iii remains unclear large amounts of mineral particles and high concentrations of heavy metals such as arsenopyrite and as from the excessive discharge of wastewaters in the mining processing and the break of the tailings dam will cause serious pollution to the waters in or around the mining area hudson edwards et al 2005 kossoff et al 2014 this work investigated the possible reaction mechanism between dissolved as iii and natural arsenopyrite at different ph values the oh and h2o2 intermediates were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed in the reaction process as well clarification of the interaction process between as iii and arsenopyrite may help to better understand the migration and transformation process of as in natural waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials natural arsenopyrite was obtained from guangxi china hong et al 2018 the pretreatment process of the mineral is described in detail in the supporting information the main chemical components of the sample were characterized by x ray diffractometer xrd fig s1a fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis indicated the presence of trace oxides on the arsenopyrite surface fig s1b likely due to the slight oxidation in the washing and vacuum drying process the specific chemical composition of arsenopyrite is fe1 0as0 74s1 22 hong et al 2018 2 2 interaction between dissolved as iii and arsenopyrite distilled deionized water was boiled first and then purged with n2 99 999 for 1 h to remove dissolved oxygen which was then used in all experiments in the reaction system of dissolved as iii and arsenopyrite all experiments were performed at 25 c in a 500 ml five necked glass bottle under magnetic stirring for 60 h some field surveys have found that as concentrations vary from 1 μg l 1 to up to 22 000 mg l 1 in the pore waters of tailing piles acid mine drainage and rivers in or around the mining area cheng et al 2009 kocourková et al 2011 in this work the as iii concentration was controlled within 0 0 5 mmol l 1 to simulate as containing pore water specifically in a series of batch experiments in air atmosphere 0 15 g arsenopyrite powder and 0 15 ml of 10 mmol l 1 as iii naaso2 solution were added to a five necked glass bottle then distilled deionized water was added to the bottle to make a 300 ml reaction system containing 0 0 5 mmol l 1 as iii and 0 5 g l 1 arsenopyrite in order to study the effect of ph on the interaction between dissolved as iii and arsenopyrite in natural waters the ph was adjusted to 3 0 5 0 and 7 0 using 0 05 0 1 mol l 1 naoh and hcl oxygen works as a common oxidant and the ultimate electron acceptor for the redox reactions in nature therefore oxygen plays an important role in the geochemical cycle of many elements n2 99 999 was continuously pumped into the anoxic system to study the role of dissolved oxygen in the interaction between dissolved as iii and arsenopyrite the concentration of dissolved oxygen was measured to be lower than 0 1 ppm in the anoxic system about 20 ml of suspension was sampled at the predetermined time point and filtered with a 0 22 μm microporous membrane to collect the liquid phase and the solid phase a small amount of as might be adsorbed on the surface of the mineral during the reaction process qiu et al 2018 and the characterization and analysis of adsorbed as on arsenopyrite would facilitate further understanding of the interaction between dissolved as iii and arsenopyrite oh and po4 3 are commonly used for the desorption of as from iron sulfide minerals jackson and miller 2000 sun et al 2012 however the desorption was not conducted since the as in natural arsenopyrite crystals may be released under alkaline conditions craw et al 2003 and the desorption efficiency of as using po4 3 is rather low jackson and miller 2000 2 3 chemical analysis and characterization the concentration of dissolved fe and as was respectively measured using the 1 10 phenanthroline analytical method at 510 nm and the molybdenum blue method at 700 nm by an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer liu et al 2007 oscarson et al 1980 the dissolved total fe fe t and total as as t were obtained by reducing the dissolved fe iii to fe ii by hydroxylamine hydrochloride and oxidizing dissolved as iii to as v by potassium iodate respectively quantitative analysis of so4 2 so3 2 and s2o3 2 was performed using an ion chromatograph dionex ics 1100 the concentration of cumulative oh and instant h2o2 at predetermined time points was determined by the benzoic acid ba and n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd methods respectively mazellier et al 2001 zhang et al 2016 solid phase products were characterized by xrd and ftir valence states and speciation of fe as and s on the surface of the solid products were analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps the specific xps fe 2p 3 2 as 3d 5 2 and s 2p 3 2 spectral fitting process is presented in the supporting information 3 results 3 1 interaction between as iii and arsenopyrite fig 1 shows the concentrations of as fe and so4 2 in the systems of single as iii 0 25 mmol l 1 single arsenopyrite 0 5 g l 1 and mixture of arsenopyrite 0 5 g l 1 and as iii 0 25 mmol l 1 at ph 3 0 in air atmosphere fe3 s2o3 2 or so3 2 could not be detected in these reaction systems in the system of single as iii only a small amount of as v was formed fig 1a in the systems of single arsenopyrite and mixture of arsenopyrite and as iii the concentrations of dissolved as v as t fe ii and so4 2 gradually increased with reaction time and in the mixture system the concentrations of dissolved as v fe ii and so4 2 increased due to the presence of as iii fig 1 the solid products were further characterized after 60 h of reaction the xrd patterns and ftir spectra showed that the crystal structure of arsenopyrite had no obvious changes in both systems figs s1 and s2 the fitting results of xps fe 2p 3 2 as 3d 5 2 and s 2p 3 2 spectra are shown in fig 2 tables s1 and s2 after reaction the relative contents of total fe in the forms of fe iii o and fe iii ass total as in the forms of as iii o and as v o and total s in the forms of sn 2 so3 2 and so4 2 on arsenopyrite surface in the mixture system were higher than those in single systems these results indicated that the oxidation of arsenopyrite can be promoted by the presence of as iii the effect of initial as iii concentration on the interaction between as iii and arsenopyrite was further investigated with increasing initial as iii concentration 0 1 0 5 mmol l 1 the formation rates of dissolved as v fe ii and so4 2 in the system of mixture of arsenopyrite and as iii gradually increased and were higher than those in the system of single arsenopyrite figs 1 and 3 fig s3 shows the xrd patterns and ftir spectra of the solid products after reaction for 60 h compared with the single arsenopyrite system the mixture system had no newly formed components as well as no obvious change in the crystal structure of arsenopyrite these results further indicated that as iii promotes arsenopyrite oxidation in order to study the effect of ros on the interaction between as iii and arsenopyrite tert butanol tba 0 1 mol l 1 was used as a scavenger of oh and added to the reaction systems of single arsenopyrite 0 5 g l 1 and mixture of arsenopyrite 0 5 g l 1 and as iii 0 25 mmol l 1 at ph 3 0 in air atmosphere ryu et al 2013 fig 4 after the addition of tba the maximum concentration of dissolved as v significantly decreased from 104 1 to 19 7 μmol l 1 and 295 5 to 22 8 μmol l 1 in the single and mixture system respectively these results indicated the generation of oh in these reaction systems which promoted the formation of as v the concentrations of cumulative oh and instant h2o2 were further quantitatively measured in arsenopyrite 0 5 g l 1 suspension fig 5 as a result the concentration of cumulative oh gradually increased and that of instant h2o2 first increased to reach the maximum at 0 5 h and then decreased 3 2 effect of dissolved oxygen and ph the interaction between as iii 0 and 0 25 mmol l 1 and arsenopyrite 0 5 g l 1 was investigated in nitrogen atmosphere at ph 3 0 to clarify the effect of dissolved oxygen fig 6 the concentrations of as v fe ii and so4 2 in the systems of single arsenopyrite and mixture of arsenopyrite and as iii increased slowly with time in nitrogen atmosphere the maximum concentration of as v in the single system 14 3 μmol l 1 and mixture system 22 1 μmol l 1 was lower than that in air atmosphere 104 1 and 295 5 μmol l 1 respectively fig 6a in nitrogen atmosphere the concentrations of dissolved fe ii and so4 2 were 31 4 and 17 2 of those in air atmosphere in the single system while the percentages were 18 7 and 11 4 in the mixture system respectively fig 6b and c these results suggested that o2 can accelerate the oxidation of as iii and arsenopyrite the solid products were then characterized by xrd and ftir after reaction for 60 h in nitrogen atmosphere as a result the solid products obtained in nitrogen and air atmospheres exhibited no obvious difference in crystal structure fig s4 to clarify the effect of dissolved oxygen on the reactive oxygen intermediates the concentrations of oh and h2o2 generated in arsenopyrite suspension were also quantitatively detected in nitrogen atmosphere fig s5 the concentration of cumulative oh increased slowly with reaction time and the maximum level 2 1 μmol l 1 was much lower than that in air atmosphere 69 2 μmol l 1 figs 5 and s5 in nitrogen atmosphere the concentration of instant h2o2 showed no significant change over time and was significantly lower than that in air atmosphere as well these results suggested that o2 increases the generation of ros the effect of ph was further investigated by adjusting the ph to 5 0 and 7 0 in air atmosphere fig 7 at ph 5 0 only a small amount of as iii was oxidized in the system of single as iii the as v concentration in the system of single arsenopyrite increased first followed by slight decreases with reaction in the mixture system of arsenopyrite and as iii the as v concentration gradually increased first and then reached a plateau with reaction and the maximum as v concentration was higher than that in the system of single arsenopyrite fig 7a at ph 7 0 only a small amount of as iii was oxidized in the system of single as iii as well the as v concentration gradually increased with reaction in the systems of single arsenopyrite and mixture of arsenopyrite and as iii and the mixture system had a higher dissolved as v concentration due to the presence of as iii fig 7c the formation rate of as v gradually decreased when the ph was increased from 3 0 to 7 0 in the systems of single arsenopyrite and mixture of arsenopyrite and as iii figs 1a and 7a c the concentrations of as t in both systems gradually increased with reaction at ph 5 0 and 7 0 which was identical to the result at ph 3 0 figs 1b and 7b d fig s6a and b show the corresponding concentrations of fe ii and so4 2 released from arsenopyrite in the systems of single arsenopyrite and mixture of arsenopyrite and as iii at ph 5 0 the changing trend of the fe ii concentration was similar to that of as v concentration in both systems the maximum concentration of fe ii in the system of single arsenopyrite 56 5 μmol l 1 was higher than that in the mixture system 39 8 μmol l 1 fig s6a the concentration of so4 2 gradually increased with reaction in the mixture system the release rate of so4 2 in the system of single arsenopyrite was faster than that in the mixture system which was different from the results at ph 3 0 figs 1d and s6b at ph 7 0 fe2 was not detected in both systems the release rate of so4 2 in the single arsenopyrite system was faster than that in the mixture system which was consistent with the results at ph 5 0 fig s6c these results indicated that the oxidation of arsenopyrite was hindered by the presence of as iii at ph 5 0 and 7 0 the solid products were further characterized for the reaction systems at ph 5 0 and 7 0 after 60 h of reaction in air atmosphere no new component was observed as indicated by the xrd results fig 8 a and c in the ftir spectra the band at 490 cm 1 is owing to the fe o h bending vibration cornell and schwertmann 2003 the absorption peak at 816 cm 1 is attributed to the stretching vibration of as o in as o fe qiu et al 2017 fig 8b and d these results indicated that on the arsenopyrite surface ferric arsenate precipitate might be generated at ph 5 0 and iron hydr oxides were deposited at ph 5 0 and 7 0 the xps spectra of fe 2p 3 2 and as 3d 5 2 are shown in fig 9 and the fitting results are presented in table s2 at ph 5 0 and 7 0 the relative contents of fe in the forms of fe iii ass and fe iii o and as in the forms of as iii o and as v o on arsenopyrite were significantly higher than those at ph 3 0 in the mixture system table s2 in the xps spectra of s 2p 3 2 although the relative content of total high valence s in the forms of so3 2 and so4 2 at ph 5 0 and 7 0 was higher than that at ph 3 0 the signal intensity of s 2p 3 2 at ph 5 0 and 7 0 was significantly lower than that at ph 3 0 fig s7 and table s2 these results suggested that the oxidation degree of arsenopyrite surface at ph 5 0 and 7 0 was obviously enhanced compared with that at ph 3 0 the concentrations of cumulative oh and instant h2o2 generated in the reaction process of arsenopyrite suspension were also quantitatively detected at ph 5 0 and 7 0 fig 10 the concentration of cumulative oh gradually increased with reaction at ph 5 0 and 7 0 fig 10a in the ph range of 3 0 7 0 the concentration of cumulative oh decreased with increasing ph figs 5 and 10a the changing trends of instant h2o2 concentration with reaction time at ph 5 0 and 7 0 were consistent with those at ph 3 0 and the maximum concentration of instant h2o2 at ph 7 0 was significantly higher than that at ph 3 0 and 5 0 figs 5 and 10b 4 discussion 4 1 interaction mechanism between as iii and arsenopyrite in addition to the adsorption reaction the interactions between dissolved as iii and iron sulfide minerals also include redox reaction renock and voorhis 2017 the direct oxidation of dissolved as iii by oxygen is very slow amstaetter et al 2010 oscarson et al 1980 tallman and shaikh 1980 in this work only a small amount of as iii was oxidized by dissolved oxygen in the system of single as iii fig 1a the heterogeneous oxidation reaction of as iii on the surface of natural minerals is a key process for its rapid oxidation and has an important impact on the fate of as iii cheng et al 2009 many studies have indicated that ros are the main oxidant of as iii in the interaction between as iii and iron hydr oxides or iron sulfide minerals jeong et al 2010 ona nguema et al 2010 ros are mainly produced from sulfur deficient sites on iron sulfide mineral surface fenton like reactions or fenton reactions borda et al 2003 ona nguema et al 2010 qiu et al 2018 fe iii at the sulfur deficient sites can react with the adsorbed h2o to produce oh and h2o2 and fe ii on the mineral surface can react with o2 to produce h2o2 which can also be decomposed to produce oh hong et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 therefore the redox reaction between arsenopyrite and as iii can be attributed to the effect of ros produced from the interaction of fe iii on the sulfur deficient site with h2o or the oxidation of trace o2 0 1 ppm in nitrogen atmosphere eqs 1 8 and 10 13 in table s3 at ph 3 0 oh and h2o2 were detected in arsenopyrite suspension and the presence of oh trapping agent in the systems of single arsenopyrite and mixture of arsenopyrite and as iii would reduce the as v concentration respectively by 81 1 and 92 3 after reaction for 60 h in air atmosphere figs 4 and 5 therefore ros should be the main oxidant of arsenopyrite and as iii in the reaction system and the ros generation pathway could be summarized as follows fe ii on the surface of arsenopyrite reacts with o2 to produce h2o2 which can be further decomposed to produce oh fe iii at the sulfur deficient site reacts with h2o to produce oh the fe2 reacts with h2o2 to produce oh through fenton reaction eqs 7 10 in table s3 oh and h2o2 were determined in nitrogen atmosphere at ph 3 0 to further investigate the main formation pathway of these ros trace amounts of oh and h2o2 were detected in nitrogen atmosphere and the maximum concentration of cumulative oh in nitrogen atmosphere was only 3 0 of that in air atmosphere figs 5 and s5 furthermore in the systems of single arsenopyrite and mixture of arsenopyrite and as iii the as v concentration respectively decreased by 86 3 and 92 5 compared with that in air atmosphere fig 6a therefore the main pathway of ros generation in the presence of o2 was the reaction of fe ii with o2 on arsenopyrite surface to produce h2o2 which was further decomposed to generate oh the presence of as iii also affected the oxidation of arsenopyrite as reported as iii can directly oxidize troilite fes and pyrite fes2 accompanied by the oxidation of s and fe ii on the mineral surface as well as the reduction of as iii to form feass or as 0 phases under suboxic anoxic conditions bostick and fendorf 2003 renock and voorhis 2017 the electro adsorption of h at the oxide layers on the mineral surface can promote the reduction of adsorbed as iii through multiple proton electron transfer reactions renock and voorhis 2017 therefore direct oxidation of arsenopyrite by as iii may occur in nitrogen atmosphere in this work while no newly generated feass like or as 0 phase was detected in the xrd patterns and ftir spectra fig s4 a further analysis of the reduction products will facilitate the understanding about the interaction and mechanism between arsenopyrite and as iii in anoxic environments which will be investigated in the near future the adsorbed as v can undergo redox reaction with pyrite kim and batchelor 2009 sun et al 2012 as v can oxidize low valence s in pyrite to so4 2 sun et al 2012 to verify this process 0 25 mmol l 1 as v was added to arsenopyrite suspension in nitrogen atmosphere at ph 3 0 fig s8 the concentration of fe ii and so4 2 in the mixture system of arsenopyrite and as v was higher than that in the systems of single arsenopyrite and mixture of arsenopyrite and as iii after 60 h of reaction in nitrogen atmosphere figs 6 and s8 the formation of as v was due to the oxidation of as iii by ros as iii can accelerate the oxidation of arsenopyrite likely due to the catalysis effect especially in the presence of o2 eq 4 in table s3 therefore synergistic oxidation may occur between arsenopyrite and as iii in the presence of o2 both o2 and fe3 are comparatively strong oxidizers of arsenopyrite yu et al 2007 in this work the concentration of released so4 2 increased by 481 3 in air atmosphere compared with that in nitrogen atmosphere after 6 h of reaction in the system of single arsenopyrite at ph 3 0 fig 6c however in the system with the mixture of arsenopyrite and as v the so4 2 concentration only increased by 24 4 compared with that in the single system in nitrogen atmosphere fig s8b therefore compared with dissolved oxygen and fe iii as v worked as a weaker oxidant for arsenopyrite in this work sun et al 2012 4 2 effect of ph in the absence of as iii the oxidation rate of arsenopyrite at ph 5 0 was greater than that at ph 3 0 and 7 0 in the weathering of arsenopyrite in addition to o2 and ros fe3 is also the most common oxidant eqs 1 3 5 and 6 in table s3 in acidic solutions arsenopyrite was oxidized to release fe2 and the fe2 was subsequently oxidized to form fe3 which could further oxidize arsenopyrite to release fe2 and h rimstidt et al 1994 yu et al 2007 under circumneutral ph conditions the fe2 released from arsenopyrite was rapidly oxidized by o2 to form iron hydr oxides accompanied by a simultaneous release of h rimstidt et al 1994 yu et al 2007 an increase in ph from 3 0 to 5 0 led to an increase in the fe3 formation rate and then accelerated the subsequent oxidation of arsenopyrite however in the range of ph 5 0 7 0 the higher the ph was the faster of the oxidation rate of fe2 to iron hydr oxides would be which would slow down the oxidation of arsenopyrite in an acidic environment arsenopyrite will undergo an acid dissolution process and the mineral surface oxide layer is continuously dissolved cruz et al 2005 zhu et al 2014 therefore the relative contents of fe as and s in high valence state on the mineral surface at ph 3 0 in the system of single arsenopyrite were lower than those on the surface of pristine arsenopyrite with the increase of ph from 3 0 7 0 the as iii oxidation rate gradually decreased which could be attributed to the gradual decrease in the generation rate of oh figs 5 and 10 secondary minerals including scorodite as bearing iron hydroxide and amorphous iron arsenate were formed on the surface of arsenopyrite during the long term natural weathering in mining areas all over the world basu and schreiber 2013 filippi et al 2015 murciego et al 2011 these secondary as bearing minerals inhibit the further oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite and subsequent release of partial as from the mineral however scorodite and amorphous iron arsenate will be incongruently dissolved to form as bearing iron hydroxide leading to the release of partial as to the surrounding environment basu and schreiber 2013 filippi et al 2015 murciego et al 2011 as bearing iron hydroxides can stably exist under oxic and ph 4 6 conditions hindering arsenopyrite oxidation and limiting as mobility in tailing area and stream sediments basu and schreiber 2013 under neutral and alkaline conditions the oxidation of arsenopyrite will result in the formation of an fe rich coating on the mineral surface preventing the further oxidation of sulfide minerals asta et al 2013 these surface passivation layers as bearing iron hydroxide fe rich coating will block the contact between o2 and mineral surface thereby further impeding ros production zhang and yuan 2017 in this work the concentration of fe ii at ph 3 0 was higher than that at ph 5 0 and no fe2 was detected at ph 7 0 figs 1c and s6a the relative content of fe in the form of fe iii o at ph 5 0 and 7 0 was remarkably higher than that at ph 3 0 figs 2b and 9a b although the relative content of total high valence s in the forms of so3 2 and so4 2 at ph 5 0 and 7 0 was higher than that at ph 3 0 the xps s 2p 3 2 spectral signal was significantly lower than that at ph 3 0 figs 2f and s7 the ftir spectra also revealed the presence of iron hydr oxides on the mineral surface fig 8b and d therefore the oxidation of fe ii to iron hydr oxides led to a decrease in the formation rate of oh in the mixture system with the ph increasing from 3 0 7 0 eq 2 in table s3 the formation of secondary minerals affects the oxidation of arsenopyrite in the presence of as iii recent studies have suggested that iron hydr oxides such as hematite can catalyze as iii oxidation under acidic conditions tabelin et al 2019 in this study xps fe 2p 3 2 spectra showed that fe iii in the form of fe iii o exists on the surface of arsenopyrite at ph 3 0 7 0 indicating that iron hydr oxides may be generated on the mineral surface nesbitt et al 1995 therefore the formed iron hydr oxides may facilitate the oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite through catalyzing as iii oxidation to form as v in the reaction system however in the ph range of 3 0 7 0 the changes in the concentration of released so4 2 showed that the oxidation rate of arsenopyrite increased first and then decreased with increasing ph in the mixture system figs 1d and s6b c which may be ascribed to the formation of more iron hydr oxides on arsenopyrite at ph 5 0 and 7 0 than at ph 3 0 according to the results of xps s 2p 3 2 spectra fig s7 therefore the formation of secondary minerals hinders the oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite in the mixture system the initially added as iii would consume ros in the reaction system which also affects the oxidation process of arsenopyrite under different ph values conditions the concentration of cumulative oh in the mixture system of arsenopyrite and as iii was further quantitatively measured in air atmosphere fig s9 the concentration of cumulative oh increased gradually with reaction at different ph values and the cumulative oh concentration decreased in the presence of as iii figs 5 10 and s9 these results indicated that the initially added as iii consumed partial ros produced on arsenopyrite surface in the mixture system of arsenopyrite and as iii the oxidation and dissolution of arsenopyrite were directly influenced by dissolved oxygen ros fe3 and as v an increase in ph from 3 0 to 5 0 promoted the oxidation of fe2 to fe3 thereby accelerating the subsequent oxidation of arsenopyrite eq 3 in table s3 however a further increase of ph from 5 0 to 7 0 led to the precipitation of fe3 to iron hydr oxides slowing down the oxidation of arsenopyrite the concentrations of cumulative oh and as v at ph 3 0 were significantly higher than those at ph 5 0 and 7 0 figs 1 7 and s9 these results showed that the ros consumption by as iii has less influence on the oxidation process of arsenopyrite at ph 3 0 than at ph 5 0 and 7 0 therefore in this work the inhibition of as iii on the oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite at ph 5 0 and 7 0 may be attributed to the following reasons i the surface of arsenopyrite was covered by iron hydr oxides which hindered its further oxidation and production of ros and ii the initially added as iii consumed ros in the system adsorption reaction is one of the important reactions between as iii and iron sulfide minerals and has an important impact on the fate of as in natural waters paikaray 2015 at ph 10 0 the adsorption capacity of oxidized pyrite for as iii increases rapidly with increasing ph and then reaches equilibrium which is similar to the adsorption of as iii on iron hydr oxide surface jang and dempsey 2008 sun et al 2012 in the mixture system of as iii and arsenopyrite at ph 5 0 and 7 0 the presence of iron hydr oxides was detected on arsenopyrite surface fig 8b and d therefore in this work the relative content of as in the form of as iii o at ph 5 0 and 7 0 was significantly higher than that at ph 3 0 which may be partly due to the adsorption of as iii on arsenopyrite surface figs 2d 9c d and table s2 the detailed process and mechanism of adsorption reaction between arsenopyrite and as iii still require further study in the future 4 3 fate of as and environmental implications numerous gold mines contain high concentrations of as dummer et al 2015 haffert et al 2010 ono et al 2016 verplanck et al 2008 as gold is commonly encapsulated in as bearing sulfide mineral grains including pyrite chalcopyrite and arsenopyrite opiso et al 2021 tabelin et al 2020b the mineral must be pre oxidized to expose the encapsulated gold particles roasting alkaline leaching and bio oxidation are common metallurgy techniques in the roasting process of arsenopyrite some complex as bearing solid phases can be produced elemental as as4s4 as2s3 or as4o6 etc which have different solubilities and oxidation states in waste streams waste residue waste gas and waste water chakraborti and lynch 1983 walker et al 2015 when pretreated by alkaline leaching arsenopyrite will be oxidized to fe2o3 with the release of aso4 3 and so4 2 into the solution espitia and lapidus 2015 2021 different from the case in chemical leaching the release rate of as is faster than that of fe from arsenopyrite during the biological leaching and jarosite is more likely to be formed on the mineral surface which hinders its further oxidative dissolution deng et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 during the extraction of gold these as containing solids and liquids produced in the metallurgical process will be potentially transformed and transported to surface waters groundwaters soils sediments and air resulting in serious as pollution in the environment haffert et al 2010 walker et al 2015 therefore since arsenopyrite is one of the major as and gold bearing sulfide minerals its oxidation will significantly affect the migration transformation and fate of as deng et al 2017 there is a relatively high concentration of as in the pore waters of arsenic containing sulfide mineral tailings for instance the concentration of as reaches 250 mg l 1 in the pore water of mine tailings at the carnoulès mining site in southern france and it is up to 22 000 mg l 1 at berikul gold mine in siberia russia kocourková et al 2011 the oxidation rate of as iii is relatively slow in the homogeneous oxidation process which can be enhanced by the heterogeneous oxidation process on the mineral surface cheng et al 2009 the results of this study revealed that dissolved as iii could be rapidly oxidized by the ros generated on arsenopyrite surface and as iii oxidation could also be accelerated by arsenopyrite in the presence of dissolved oxygen dissolved as iii can also accelerate arsenopyrite oxidation and the oxidation rate increases with increasing initial as iii concentration at ph 3 0 but dissolved as iii has an inhibitory effect on the oxidation of arsenopyrite at ph 5 0 and 7 0 therefore these findings may provide new approaches for understanding the heterogeneous as iii oxidation in a mine drainage environment as well as improve the understanding on the source and sink of as in the waters of the mining area and surrounding area 5 conclusion in this study the effects of initial as iii concentration dissolved oxygen and ph on the interaction process between dissolved as iii and arsenopyrite were explored during this process ros oh and h2o2 are primarily produced by the interaction of fe ii with o2 on arsenopyrite surface which promotes the rapid oxidation of as iii and arsenopyrite the formation rate of as v increases with increasing initial as iii concentration the oxidation rate of dissolved as iii gradually decreases due to the formation of iron hydr oxides within the ph range from 3 0 to 7 0 during the interaction between as iii and arsenopyrite dissolved as iii also affects the weathering of arsenopyrite at ph 3 0 dissolved as iii can promote arsenopyrite oxidation and the oxidation rate increases with increasing initial as iii concentration synergistic oxidation of arsenopyrite and dissolved as iii occurs in the presence of oxygen due to the formation of ros the synergistic effect decreases with increasing ph from 3 0 to 5 0 and 7 0 due to the difference in the oxidation and dissolution process of

16783,as an important source of arsenic as pollution in mine drainage arsenopyrite undergoes redox and adsorption reactions with dissolved as which further affects the fate of as in natural waters this study investigated the interactions between dissolved as iii and arsenopyrite and the factors influencing the geochemical behavior of as including initial as iii concentration dissolved oxygen and ph the hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and hydroxyl radical oh generated from the interaction between fe ii on arsenopyrite surface and oxygen were found to facilitate the rapid oxidation of as iii and the production of as v in the reaction system increased with increasing initial as iii concentration an increase of ph from 3 0 to 7 0 led to a gradual decrease in the oxidation rate of as iii at ph 3 0 the presence of as iii accelerated the oxidation rate of arsenopyrite while at ph 5 0 and 7 0 as iii inhibited the oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite this work reveals the potential environmental process of the interaction between dissolved as iii and arsenopyrite and provides important implications for the prevention and control of as iii pollution in mine drainage graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords as iii active oxygen intermediate arsenopyrite synergistic oxidation 1 introduction arsenic as pollution in natural waters can cause serious human health problems ho et al 2021 huyen et al 2019 it has been estimated that over 150 millions of people in more than 70 countries may be at risk of as related diseases ravenscroft et al 2009 tabelin et al 2018 at the same time as pollution is becoming increasingly serious due to the growing demand for key metal resources including gold and copper park et al 2018a tabelin et al 2021 in natural environments as mainly comes from mining and metallurgy han et al 2003 arsenic released from excavated rocks due to natural weathering may contain more as iii than as v park et al 2018b yu et al 2007 while those from extractive metallurgy may mainly exist in the form of as v espitia and lapidus 2021 zheng et al 2020 the bioavailability reactivity toxicity and mobility of dissolved as vary with its chemical speciation couture et al 2013 jain and ali 2000 for example dissolved as iii has higher mobility and toxicity than dissolved as v jain and ali 2000 jang and dempsey 2008 therefore it is of great significance to study the migration and transformation of dissolved as in natural waters the speciation of as in waters is mainly controlled by its adsorption and redox reactions paikaray 2015 williams 2001 metal hydr oxides including fe or al hydr oxides have strong adsorption capacities for as and subsequently affect the oxidation of as iii and thus influence the fate of as iii v in the environment bostick and fendorf 2003 bostick et al 2003 morin and calas 2006 tabelin et al 2020a as is usually enriched in sulfide mineral deposits nordstrom 2002 and high concentrations of as were found in the pore waters of tailing piles acid mine drainage and rivers surrounding the mining area cheng et al 2009 kocourková et al 2011 sulfur containing minerals including fes2 fes zns and pbs can effectively adsorb and sequestrate as bostick and fendorf 2003 bostick et al 2003 the redox reactions of as iii v were also observed during their adsorption onto sulfide minerals the as iii oxidation on the surface of pbs may be caused by the oxidized sulfur species surface pb iv or oxygen bostick et al 2003 adsorbed as v can oxidize pyrite with the formation of as iii sun et al 2012 while adsorbed as iii may directly react with fes2 to produce feass and fe oh 3 bostick and fendorf 2003 or be oxidized by iron hydr oxides on the surface oxidation layer of fes2 kim and batchelor 2009 the adsorption and oxidation of as iii on arsenic containing iron sulfide minerals may also affect the release of structural as from these minerals however few studies have been specifically focused on the redox reaction between dissolved as iii and arsenic containing iron sulfide minerals which are a primary source of as pollution the redox mechanism of as iii on the surface of some iron sulfide minerals has not been fully understood the mechanism for the interaction between dissolved as iii and natural arsenic containing iron sulfide minerals needs to be further elucidated as reported dissolved as iii v released from pristine arsenic containing sulfide minerals can form secondary arsenic minerals on the surface of the parent minerals such as scorodite feaso4 2h2o which are important sinks of as under acidic conditions tabelin et al 2019 these dissolved as iii v can also be adsorbed on the surface of iron oxides such as schwertmannite goethite and akaganeite igarashi et al 2020 kocourková et al 2011 however the effect of dissolved as on the oxidation and release of as from the arsenic containing sulfide minerals has seldom been investigated our previous studies have shown that synthetic arsenian pyrite affects the fate of dissolved as iii v qiu et al 2017 2018 as the most common arsenic containing iron sulfide minerals arsenian pyrite and arsenopyrite have similar crystal structures li et al 2015 but arsenopyrite has a higher content of as in addition considering the low content of as in natural pyrite our previous study was focused on the effect of synthesized arsenian pyrite whose physicochemical properties may be somewhat different from those of natural arsenopyrite naveau et al 2007 xiu et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to further elucidate the interaction between dissolved as iii and natural arsenopyrite during the redox reaction of iron sulfide minerals reactive oxygen species ros play an important role hong et al 2018 guo et al 2020 qiu et al 2018 the ros including oh and h2o2 can be formed through the interaction between oxygen and fe ii at pyrite surface or between h2o and fe iii at the sulfur deficient sites borda et al 2003 nesbitt et al 1998 qiu et al 2018 sb iii and as iii can be rapidly oxidized to sb v and as v by oh and h2o2 on the surface of pyrite and the oxidation rate is significantly affected by the production rate of oh and h2o2 at different ph values kong et al 2015 qiu et al 2018 ros can also be produced in the process of natural arsenopyrite oxidation hong et al 2018 however the role of these ros in the interaction of natural arsenopyrite with as iii remains unclear large amounts of mineral particles and high concentrations of heavy metals such as arsenopyrite and as from the excessive discharge of wastewaters in the mining processing and the break of the tailings dam will cause serious pollution to the waters in or around the mining area hudson edwards et al 2005 kossoff et al 2014 this work investigated the possible reaction mechanism between dissolved as iii and natural arsenopyrite at different ph values the oh and h2o2 intermediates were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed in the reaction process as well clarification of the interaction process between as iii and arsenopyrite may help to better understand the migration and transformation process of as in natural waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials natural arsenopyrite was obtained from guangxi china hong et al 2018 the pretreatment process of the mineral is described in detail in the supporting information the main chemical components of the sample were characterized by x ray diffractometer xrd fig s1a fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis indicated the presence of trace oxides on the arsenopyrite surface fig s1b likely due to the slight oxidation in the washing and vacuum drying process the specific chemical composition of arsenopyrite is fe1 0as0 74s1 22 hong et al 2018 2 2 interaction between dissolved as iii and arsenopyrite distilled deionized water was boiled first and then purged with n2 99 999 for 1 h to remove dissolved oxygen which was then used in all experiments in the reaction system of dissolved as iii and arsenopyrite all experiments were performed at 25 c in a 500 ml five necked glass bottle under magnetic stirring for 60 h some field surveys have found that as concentrations vary from 1 μg l 1 to up to 22 000 mg l 1 in the pore waters of tailing piles acid mine drainage and rivers in or around the mining area cheng et al 2009 kocourková et al 2011 in this work the as iii concentration was controlled within 0 0 5 mmol l 1 to simulate as containing pore water specifically in a series of batch experiments in air atmosphere 0 15 g arsenopyrite powder and 0 15 ml of 10 mmol l 1 as iii naaso2 solution were added to a five necked glass bottle then distilled deionized water was added to the bottle to make a 300 ml reaction system containing 0 0 5 mmol l 1 as iii and 0 5 g l 1 arsenopyrite in order to study the effect of ph on the interaction between dissolved as iii and arsenopyrite in natural waters the ph was adjusted to 3 0 5 0 and 7 0 using 0 05 0 1 mol l 1 naoh and hcl oxygen works as a common oxidant and the ultimate electron acceptor for the redox reactions in nature therefore oxygen plays an important role in the geochemical cycle of many elements n2 99 999 was continuously pumped into the anoxic system to study the role of dissolved oxygen in the interaction between dissolved as iii and arsenopyrite the concentration of dissolved oxygen was measured to be lower than 0 1 ppm in the anoxic system about 20 ml of suspension was sampled at the predetermined time point and filtered with a 0 22 μm microporous membrane to collect the liquid phase and the solid phase a small amount of as might be adsorbed on the surface of the mineral during the reaction process qiu et al 2018 and the characterization and analysis of adsorbed as on arsenopyrite would facilitate further understanding of the interaction between dissolved as iii and arsenopyrite oh and po4 3 are commonly used for the desorption of as from iron sulfide minerals jackson and miller 2000 sun et al 2012 however the desorption was not conducted since the as in natural arsenopyrite crystals may be released under alkaline conditions craw et al 2003 and the desorption efficiency of as using po4 3 is rather low jackson and miller 2000 2 3 chemical analysis and characterization the concentration of dissolved fe and as was respectively measured using the 1 10 phenanthroline analytical method at 510 nm and the molybdenum blue method at 700 nm by an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer liu et al 2007 oscarson et al 1980 the dissolved total fe fe t and total as as t were obtained by reducing the dissolved fe iii to fe ii by hydroxylamine hydrochloride and oxidizing dissolved as iii to as v by potassium iodate respectively quantitative analysis of so4 2 so3 2 and s2o3 2 was performed using an ion chromatograph dionex ics 1100 the concentration of cumulative oh and instant h2o2 at predetermined time points was determined by the benzoic acid ba and n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd methods respectively mazellier et al 2001 zhang et al 2016 solid phase products were characterized by xrd and ftir valence states and speciation of fe as and s on the surface of the solid products were analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps the specific xps fe 2p 3 2 as 3d 5 2 and s 2p 3 2 spectral fitting process is presented in the supporting information 3 results 3 1 interaction between as iii and arsenopyrite fig 1 shows the concentrations of as fe and so4 2 in the systems of single as iii 0 25 mmol l 1 single arsenopyrite 0 5 g l 1 and mixture of arsenopyrite 0 5 g l 1 and as iii 0 25 mmol l 1 at ph 3 0 in air atmosphere fe3 s2o3 2 or so3 2 could not be detected in these reaction systems in the system of single as iii only a small amount of as v was formed fig 1a in the systems of single arsenopyrite and mixture of arsenopyrite and as iii the concentrations of dissolved as v as t fe ii and so4 2 gradually increased with reaction time and in the mixture system the concentrations of dissolved as v fe ii and so4 2 increased due to the presence of as iii fig 1 the solid products were further characterized after 60 h of reaction the xrd patterns and ftir spectra showed that the crystal structure of arsenopyrite had no obvious changes in both systems figs s1 and s2 the fitting results of xps fe 2p 3 2 as 3d 5 2 and s 2p 3 2 spectra are shown in fig 2 tables s1 and s2 after reaction the relative contents of total fe in the forms of fe iii o and fe iii ass total as in the forms of as iii o and as v o and total s in the forms of sn 2 so3 2 and so4 2 on arsenopyrite surface in the mixture system were higher than those in single systems these results indicated that the oxidation of arsenopyrite can be promoted by the presence of as iii the effect of initial as iii concentration on the interaction between as iii and arsenopyrite was further investigated with increasing initial as iii concentration 0 1 0 5 mmol l 1 the formation rates of dissolved as v fe ii and so4 2 in the system of mixture of arsenopyrite and as iii gradually increased and were higher than those in the system of single arsenopyrite figs 1 and 3 fig s3 shows the xrd patterns and ftir spectra of the solid products after reaction for 60 h compared with the single arsenopyrite system the mixture system had no newly formed components as well as no obvious change in the crystal structure of arsenopyrite these results further indicated that as iii promotes arsenopyrite oxidation in order to study the effect of ros on the interaction between as iii and arsenopyrite tert butanol tba 0 1 mol l 1 was used as a scavenger of oh and added to the reaction systems of single arsenopyrite 0 5 g l 1 and mixture of arsenopyrite 0 5 g l 1 and as iii 0 25 mmol l 1 at ph 3 0 in air atmosphere ryu et al 2013 fig 4 after the addition of tba the maximum concentration of dissolved as v significantly decreased from 104 1 to 19 7 μmol l 1 and 295 5 to 22 8 μmol l 1 in the single and mixture system respectively these results indicated the generation of oh in these reaction systems which promoted the formation of as v the concentrations of cumulative oh and instant h2o2 were further quantitatively measured in arsenopyrite 0 5 g l 1 suspension fig 5 as a result the concentration of cumulative oh gradually increased and that of instant h2o2 first increased to reach the maximum at 0 5 h and then decreased 3 2 effect of dissolved oxygen and ph the interaction between as iii 0 and 0 25 mmol l 1 and arsenopyrite 0 5 g l 1 was investigated in nitrogen atmosphere at ph 3 0 to clarify the effect of dissolved oxygen fig 6 the concentrations of as v fe ii and so4 2 in the systems of single arsenopyrite and mixture of arsenopyrite and as iii increased slowly with time in nitrogen atmosphere the maximum concentration of as v in the single system 14 3 μmol l 1 and mixture system 22 1 μmol l 1 was lower than that in air atmosphere 104 1 and 295 5 μmol l 1 respectively fig 6a in nitrogen atmosphere the concentrations of dissolved fe ii and so4 2 were 31 4 and 17 2 of those in air atmosphere in the single system while the percentages were 18 7 and 11 4 in the mixture system respectively fig 6b and c these results suggested that o2 can accelerate the oxidation of as iii and arsenopyrite the solid products were then characterized by xrd and ftir after reaction for 60 h in nitrogen atmosphere as a result the solid products obtained in nitrogen and air atmospheres exhibited no obvious difference in crystal structure fig s4 to clarify the effect of dissolved oxygen on the reactive oxygen intermediates the concentrations of oh and h2o2 generated in arsenopyrite suspension were also quantitatively detected in nitrogen atmosphere fig s5 the concentration of cumulative oh increased slowly with reaction time and the maximum level 2 1 μmol l 1 was much lower than that in air atmosphere 69 2 μmol l 1 figs 5 and s5 in nitrogen atmosphere the concentration of instant h2o2 showed no significant change over time and was significantly lower than that in air atmosphere as well these results suggested that o2 increases the generation of ros the effect of ph was further investigated by adjusting the ph to 5 0 and 7 0 in air atmosphere fig 7 at ph 5 0 only a small amount of as iii was oxidized in the system of single as iii the as v concentration in the system of single arsenopyrite increased first followed by slight decreases with reaction in the mixture system of arsenopyrite and as iii the as v concentration gradually increased first and then reached a plateau with reaction and the maximum as v concentration was higher than that in the system of single arsenopyrite fig 7a at ph 7 0 only a small amount of as iii was oxidized in the system of single as iii as well the as v concentration gradually increased with reaction in the systems of single arsenopyrite and mixture of arsenopyrite and as iii and the mixture system had a higher dissolved as v concentration due to the presence of as iii fig 7c the formation rate of as v gradually decreased when the ph was increased from 3 0 to 7 0 in the systems of single arsenopyrite and mixture of arsenopyrite and as iii figs 1a and 7a c the concentrations of as t in both systems gradually increased with reaction at ph 5 0 and 7 0 which was identical to the result at ph 3 0 figs 1b and 7b d fig s6a and b show the corresponding concentrations of fe ii and so4 2 released from arsenopyrite in the systems of single arsenopyrite and mixture of arsenopyrite and as iii at ph 5 0 the changing trend of the fe ii concentration was similar to that of as v concentration in both systems the maximum concentration of fe ii in the system of single arsenopyrite 56 5 μmol l 1 was higher than that in the mixture system 39 8 μmol l 1 fig s6a the concentration of so4 2 gradually increased with reaction in the mixture system the release rate of so4 2 in the system of single arsenopyrite was faster than that in the mixture system which was different from the results at ph 3 0 figs 1d and s6b at ph 7 0 fe2 was not detected in both systems the release rate of so4 2 in the single arsenopyrite system was faster than that in the mixture system which was consistent with the results at ph 5 0 fig s6c these results indicated that the oxidation of arsenopyrite was hindered by the presence of as iii at ph 5 0 and 7 0 the solid products were further characterized for the reaction systems at ph 5 0 and 7 0 after 60 h of reaction in air atmosphere no new component was observed as indicated by the xrd results fig 8 a and c in the ftir spectra the band at 490 cm 1 is owing to the fe o h bending vibration cornell and schwertmann 2003 the absorption peak at 816 cm 1 is attributed to the stretching vibration of as o in as o fe qiu et al 2017 fig 8b and d these results indicated that on the arsenopyrite surface ferric arsenate precipitate might be generated at ph 5 0 and iron hydr oxides were deposited at ph 5 0 and 7 0 the xps spectra of fe 2p 3 2 and as 3d 5 2 are shown in fig 9 and the fitting results are presented in table s2 at ph 5 0 and 7 0 the relative contents of fe in the forms of fe iii ass and fe iii o and as in the forms of as iii o and as v o on arsenopyrite were significantly higher than those at ph 3 0 in the mixture system table s2 in the xps spectra of s 2p 3 2 although the relative content of total high valence s in the forms of so3 2 and so4 2 at ph 5 0 and 7 0 was higher than that at ph 3 0 the signal intensity of s 2p 3 2 at ph 5 0 and 7 0 was significantly lower than that at ph 3 0 fig s7 and table s2 these results suggested that the oxidation degree of arsenopyrite surface at ph 5 0 and 7 0 was obviously enhanced compared with that at ph 3 0 the concentrations of cumulative oh and instant h2o2 generated in the reaction process of arsenopyrite suspension were also quantitatively detected at ph 5 0 and 7 0 fig 10 the concentration of cumulative oh gradually increased with reaction at ph 5 0 and 7 0 fig 10a in the ph range of 3 0 7 0 the concentration of cumulative oh decreased with increasing ph figs 5 and 10a the changing trends of instant h2o2 concentration with reaction time at ph 5 0 and 7 0 were consistent with those at ph 3 0 and the maximum concentration of instant h2o2 at ph 7 0 was significantly higher than that at ph 3 0 and 5 0 figs 5 and 10b 4 discussion 4 1 interaction mechanism between as iii and arsenopyrite in addition to the adsorption reaction the interactions between dissolved as iii and iron sulfide minerals also include redox reaction renock and voorhis 2017 the direct oxidation of dissolved as iii by oxygen is very slow amstaetter et al 2010 oscarson et al 1980 tallman and shaikh 1980 in this work only a small amount of as iii was oxidized by dissolved oxygen in the system of single as iii fig 1a the heterogeneous oxidation reaction of as iii on the surface of natural minerals is a key process for its rapid oxidation and has an important impact on the fate of as iii cheng et al 2009 many studies have indicated that ros are the main oxidant of as iii in the interaction between as iii and iron hydr oxides or iron sulfide minerals jeong et al 2010 ona nguema et al 2010 ros are mainly produced from sulfur deficient sites on iron sulfide mineral surface fenton like reactions or fenton reactions borda et al 2003 ona nguema et al 2010 qiu et al 2018 fe iii at the sulfur deficient sites can react with the adsorbed h2o to produce oh and h2o2 and fe ii on the mineral surface can react with o2 to produce h2o2 which can also be decomposed to produce oh hong et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 therefore the redox reaction between arsenopyrite and as iii can be attributed to the effect of ros produced from the interaction of fe iii on the sulfur deficient site with h2o or the oxidation of trace o2 0 1 ppm in nitrogen atmosphere eqs 1 8 and 10 13 in table s3 at ph 3 0 oh and h2o2 were detected in arsenopyrite suspension and the presence of oh trapping agent in the systems of single arsenopyrite and mixture of arsenopyrite and as iii would reduce the as v concentration respectively by 81 1 and 92 3 after reaction for 60 h in air atmosphere figs 4 and 5 therefore ros should be the main oxidant of arsenopyrite and as iii in the reaction system and the ros generation pathway could be summarized as follows fe ii on the surface of arsenopyrite reacts with o2 to produce h2o2 which can be further decomposed to produce oh fe iii at the sulfur deficient site reacts with h2o to produce oh the fe2 reacts with h2o2 to produce oh through fenton reaction eqs 7 10 in table s3 oh and h2o2 were determined in nitrogen atmosphere at ph 3 0 to further investigate the main formation pathway of these ros trace amounts of oh and h2o2 were detected in nitrogen atmosphere and the maximum concentration of cumulative oh in nitrogen atmosphere was only 3 0 of that in air atmosphere figs 5 and s5 furthermore in the systems of single arsenopyrite and mixture of arsenopyrite and as iii the as v concentration respectively decreased by 86 3 and 92 5 compared with that in air atmosphere fig 6a therefore the main pathway of ros generation in the presence of o2 was the reaction of fe ii with o2 on arsenopyrite surface to produce h2o2 which was further decomposed to generate oh the presence of as iii also affected the oxidation of arsenopyrite as reported as iii can directly oxidize troilite fes and pyrite fes2 accompanied by the oxidation of s and fe ii on the mineral surface as well as the reduction of as iii to form feass or as 0 phases under suboxic anoxic conditions bostick and fendorf 2003 renock and voorhis 2017 the electro adsorption of h at the oxide layers on the mineral surface can promote the reduction of adsorbed as iii through multiple proton electron transfer reactions renock and voorhis 2017 therefore direct oxidation of arsenopyrite by as iii may occur in nitrogen atmosphere in this work while no newly generated feass like or as 0 phase was detected in the xrd patterns and ftir spectra fig s4 a further analysis of the reduction products will facilitate the understanding about the interaction and mechanism between arsenopyrite and as iii in anoxic environments which will be investigated in the near future the adsorbed as v can undergo redox reaction with pyrite kim and batchelor 2009 sun et al 2012 as v can oxidize low valence s in pyrite to so4 2 sun et al 2012 to verify this process 0 25 mmol l 1 as v was added to arsenopyrite suspension in nitrogen atmosphere at ph 3 0 fig s8 the concentration of fe ii and so4 2 in the mixture system of arsenopyrite and as v was higher than that in the systems of single arsenopyrite and mixture of arsenopyrite and as iii after 60 h of reaction in nitrogen atmosphere figs 6 and s8 the formation of as v was due to the oxidation of as iii by ros as iii can accelerate the oxidation of arsenopyrite likely due to the catalysis effect especially in the presence of o2 eq 4 in table s3 therefore synergistic oxidation may occur between arsenopyrite and as iii in the presence of o2 both o2 and fe3 are comparatively strong oxidizers of arsenopyrite yu et al 2007 in this work the concentration of released so4 2 increased by 481 3 in air atmosphere compared with that in nitrogen atmosphere after 6 h of reaction in the system of single arsenopyrite at ph 3 0 fig 6c however in the system with the mixture of arsenopyrite and as v the so4 2 concentration only increased by 24 4 compared with that in the single system in nitrogen atmosphere fig s8b therefore compared with dissolved oxygen and fe iii as v worked as a weaker oxidant for arsenopyrite in this work sun et al 2012 4 2 effect of ph in the absence of as iii the oxidation rate of arsenopyrite at ph 5 0 was greater than that at ph 3 0 and 7 0 in the weathering of arsenopyrite in addition to o2 and ros fe3 is also the most common oxidant eqs 1 3 5 and 6 in table s3 in acidic solutions arsenopyrite was oxidized to release fe2 and the fe2 was subsequently oxidized to form fe3 which could further oxidize arsenopyrite to release fe2 and h rimstidt et al 1994 yu et al 2007 under circumneutral ph conditions the fe2 released from arsenopyrite was rapidly oxidized by o2 to form iron hydr oxides accompanied by a simultaneous release of h rimstidt et al 1994 yu et al 2007 an increase in ph from 3 0 to 5 0 led to an increase in the fe3 formation rate and then accelerated the subsequent oxidation of arsenopyrite however in the range of ph 5 0 7 0 the higher the ph was the faster of the oxidation rate of fe2 to iron hydr oxides would be which would slow down the oxidation of arsenopyrite in an acidic environment arsenopyrite will undergo an acid dissolution process and the mineral surface oxide layer is continuously dissolved cruz et al 2005 zhu et al 2014 therefore the relative contents of fe as and s in high valence state on the mineral surface at ph 3 0 in the system of single arsenopyrite were lower than those on the surface of pristine arsenopyrite with the increase of ph from 3 0 7 0 the as iii oxidation rate gradually decreased which could be attributed to the gradual decrease in the generation rate of oh figs 5 and 10 secondary minerals including scorodite as bearing iron hydroxide and amorphous iron arsenate were formed on the surface of arsenopyrite during the long term natural weathering in mining areas all over the world basu and schreiber 2013 filippi et al 2015 murciego et al 2011 these secondary as bearing minerals inhibit the further oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite and subsequent release of partial as from the mineral however scorodite and amorphous iron arsenate will be incongruently dissolved to form as bearing iron hydroxide leading to the release of partial as to the surrounding environment basu and schreiber 2013 filippi et al 2015 murciego et al 2011 as bearing iron hydroxides can stably exist under oxic and ph 4 6 conditions hindering arsenopyrite oxidation and limiting as mobility in tailing area and stream sediments basu and schreiber 2013 under neutral and alkaline conditions the oxidation of arsenopyrite will result in the formation of an fe rich coating on the mineral surface preventing the further oxidation of sulfide minerals asta et al 2013 these surface passivation layers as bearing iron hydroxide fe rich coating will block the contact between o2 and mineral surface thereby further impeding ros production zhang and yuan 2017 in this work the concentration of fe ii at ph 3 0 was higher than that at ph 5 0 and no fe2 was detected at ph 7 0 figs 1c and s6a the relative content of fe in the form of fe iii o at ph 5 0 and 7 0 was remarkably higher than that at ph 3 0 figs 2b and 9a b although the relative content of total high valence s in the forms of so3 2 and so4 2 at ph 5 0 and 7 0 was higher than that at ph 3 0 the xps s 2p 3 2 spectral signal was significantly lower than that at ph 3 0 figs 2f and s7 the ftir spectra also revealed the presence of iron hydr oxides on the mineral surface fig 8b and d therefore the oxidation of fe ii to iron hydr oxides led to a decrease in the formation rate of oh in the mixture system with the ph increasing from 3 0 7 0 eq 2 in table s3 the formation of secondary minerals affects the oxidation of arsenopyrite in the presence of as iii recent studies have suggested that iron hydr oxides such as hematite can catalyze as iii oxidation under acidic conditions tabelin et al 2019 in this study xps fe 2p 3 2 spectra showed that fe iii in the form of fe iii o exists on the surface of arsenopyrite at ph 3 0 7 0 indicating that iron hydr oxides may be generated on the mineral surface nesbitt et al 1995 therefore the formed iron hydr oxides may facilitate the oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite through catalyzing as iii oxidation to form as v in the reaction system however in the ph range of 3 0 7 0 the changes in the concentration of released so4 2 showed that the oxidation rate of arsenopyrite increased first and then decreased with increasing ph in the mixture system figs 1d and s6b c which may be ascribed to the formation of more iron hydr oxides on arsenopyrite at ph 5 0 and 7 0 than at ph 3 0 according to the results of xps s 2p 3 2 spectra fig s7 therefore the formation of secondary minerals hinders the oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite in the mixture system the initially added as iii would consume ros in the reaction system which also affects the oxidation process of arsenopyrite under different ph values conditions the concentration of cumulative oh in the mixture system of arsenopyrite and as iii was further quantitatively measured in air atmosphere fig s9 the concentration of cumulative oh increased gradually with reaction at different ph values and the cumulative oh concentration decreased in the presence of as iii figs 5 10 and s9 these results indicated that the initially added as iii consumed partial ros produced on arsenopyrite surface in the mixture system of arsenopyrite and as iii the oxidation and dissolution of arsenopyrite were directly influenced by dissolved oxygen ros fe3 and as v an increase in ph from 3 0 to 5 0 promoted the oxidation of fe2 to fe3 thereby accelerating the subsequent oxidation of arsenopyrite eq 3 in table s3 however a further increase of ph from 5 0 to 7 0 led to the precipitation of fe3 to iron hydr oxides slowing down the oxidation of arsenopyrite the concentrations of cumulative oh and as v at ph 3 0 were significantly higher than those at ph 5 0 and 7 0 figs 1 7 and s9 these results showed that the ros consumption by as iii has less influence on the oxidation process of arsenopyrite at ph 3 0 than at ph 5 0 and 7 0 therefore in this work the inhibition of as iii on the oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite at ph 5 0 and 7 0 may be attributed to the following reasons i the surface of arsenopyrite was covered by iron hydr oxides which hindered its further oxidation and production of ros and ii the initially added as iii consumed ros in the system adsorption reaction is one of the important reactions between as iii and iron sulfide minerals and has an important impact on the fate of as in natural waters paikaray 2015 at ph 10 0 the adsorption capacity of oxidized pyrite for as iii increases rapidly with increasing ph and then reaches equilibrium which is similar to the adsorption of as iii on iron hydr oxide surface jang and dempsey 2008 sun et al 2012 in the mixture system of as iii and arsenopyrite at ph 5 0 and 7 0 the presence of iron hydr oxides was detected on arsenopyrite surface fig 8b and d therefore in this work the relative content of as in the form of as iii o at ph 5 0 and 7 0 was significantly higher than that at ph 3 0 which may be partly due to the adsorption of as iii on arsenopyrite surface figs 2d 9c d and table s2 the detailed process and mechanism of adsorption reaction between arsenopyrite and as iii still require further study in the future 4 3 fate of as and environmental implications numerous gold mines contain high concentrations of as dummer et al 2015 haffert et al 2010 ono et al 2016 verplanck et al 2008 as gold is commonly encapsulated in as bearing sulfide mineral grains including pyrite chalcopyrite and arsenopyrite opiso et al 2021 tabelin et al 2020b the mineral must be pre oxidized to expose the encapsulated gold particles roasting alkaline leaching and bio oxidation are common metallurgy techniques in the roasting process of arsenopyrite some complex as bearing solid phases can be produced elemental as as4s4 as2s3 or as4o6 etc which have different solubilities and oxidation states in waste streams waste residue waste gas and waste water chakraborti and lynch 1983 walker et al 2015 when pretreated by alkaline leaching arsenopyrite will be oxidized to fe2o3 with the release of aso4 3 and so4 2 into the solution espitia and lapidus 2015 2021 different from the case in chemical leaching the release rate of as is faster than that of fe from arsenopyrite during the biological leaching and jarosite is more likely to be formed on the mineral surface which hinders its further oxidative dissolution deng et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 during the extraction of gold these as containing solids and liquids produced in the metallurgical process will be potentially transformed and transported to surface waters groundwaters soils sediments and air resulting in serious as pollution in the environment haffert et al 2010 walker et al 2015 therefore since arsenopyrite is one of the major as and gold bearing sulfide minerals its oxidation will significantly affect the migration transformation and fate of as deng et al 2017 there is a relatively high concentration of as in the pore waters of arsenic containing sulfide mineral tailings for instance the concentration of as reaches 250 mg l 1 in the pore water of mine tailings at the carnoulès mining site in southern france and it is up to 22 000 mg l 1 at berikul gold mine in siberia russia kocourková et al 2011 the oxidation rate of as iii is relatively slow in the homogeneous oxidation process which can be enhanced by the heterogeneous oxidation process on the mineral surface cheng et al 2009 the results of this study revealed that dissolved as iii could be rapidly oxidized by the ros generated on arsenopyrite surface and as iii oxidation could also be accelerated by arsenopyrite in the presence of dissolved oxygen dissolved as iii can also accelerate arsenopyrite oxidation and the oxidation rate increases with increasing initial as iii concentration at ph 3 0 but dissolved as iii has an inhibitory effect on the oxidation of arsenopyrite at ph 5 0 and 7 0 therefore these findings may provide new approaches for understanding the heterogeneous as iii oxidation in a mine drainage environment as well as improve the understanding on the source and sink of as in the waters of the mining area and surrounding area 5 conclusion in this study the effects of initial as iii concentration dissolved oxygen and ph on the interaction process between dissolved as iii and arsenopyrite were explored during this process ros oh and h2o2 are primarily produced by the interaction of fe ii with o2 on arsenopyrite surface which promotes the rapid oxidation of as iii and arsenopyrite the formation rate of as v increases with increasing initial as iii concentration the oxidation rate of dissolved as iii gradually decreases due to the formation of iron hydr oxides within the ph range from 3 0 to 7 0 during the interaction between as iii and arsenopyrite dissolved as iii also affects the weathering of arsenopyrite at ph 3 0 dissolved as iii can promote arsenopyrite oxidation and the oxidation rate increases with increasing initial as iii concentration synergistic oxidation of arsenopyrite and dissolved as iii occurs in the presence of oxygen due to the formation of ros the synergistic effect decreases with increasing ph from 3 0 to 5 0 and 7 0 due to the difference in the oxidation and dissolution process of

16784,the widespread use of nanoplastics inevitably leads to their increasing emission into constructed wetlands cws however little is known about the impacts of nanoplastics on nitrogen transformation in cws in this study the influence of polystyrene nanoparticles ps nps one of the most widely used plastics on the nitrogen transformation in cws was comprehensively investigated and the influential and toxic mechanism was evaluated through metagenomic analysis dna level and key enzyme activities protein level related to n transformation metabolism and antioxidant systems the results showed that over 97 of ps nps were retained in cws and the biofilm of sand was the main sink of ps nps exposure to 1 and 10 mg l ps nps suppressed the nitrogen transformation causing a certain degree of inhibition in tn removal especially in the relatively short term of the exposure experiment p 0 05 at the protein level 1 and 10 mg l ps nps negatively affect enzyme activities involved in denitrification nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase and electron transport system activity etsa in contrast 10 mg l of ps nps significantly suppressed the activities of nitrifying enzymes ammonia monooxygenase hydroxylamine dehydrogenase and nitrite oxidoreductase whereas 1 mg l ps nps showed no impacts on nitrifying enzymes metagenomic analysis further certified that ps nps restrained the relative abundances of genes involved in nitrogen transformation including nitrification and denitrification biochemical metabolisms the electron production electron transport and electron consumption processes it also indicated that ps nps could affect nitrogen transformation by reducing the abundance of genes for electron donor and atp production involved in carbon metabolism glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolism in our study the potential toxic mechanisms of ps nps attributed to over production of reactive oxygen species and variations of antioxidant systems in macrophytes and microorganisms these results provided valuable information for evaluating the impacts of ps nps on cws and arouse more attention to their impacts on the global geochemical nitrogen and carbon cycles graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords constructed wetland nanoplastics removal capacity nitrogen metabolism glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolism electron transfer systems antioxidant systems 1 introduction micro and nanoplastics are considered a global concern due to their ubiquitous pollution and toxicological risks triebskorn et al 2019 wright and kelly 2017 herein nanoplastics are defined as plastic particles with diameters smaller than either 100 nm or 1000 nm al sid cheikh et al 2018 the widespread direct utilization of nanoplastics for industrial purposes and indirect formation from large plastic litter pieces via prolonged abiotic and biotic factors inevitably result in their release into terrestrial and aquatic environments with most ending up in wastewater treatment plants wwtps shams et al 2020 sun et al 2019 nitrogen removal in wwtps has always been the focus of our attention especially in the past 40 years kuypers et al 2018 constructed wetlands cws are widely used and can efficiently remove nitrogen through the cooperation of microorganisms macrophytes and substrates through biological physical and chemical processes vymazal 2013 therefore the widespread use of nanoplastics inevitably results in their appearance in cws critically previous studies have revealed that nanoplastics can cause severe toxicity to macrophytes and microorganisms feng et al 2019 sun et al 2020 which leads to inhibition of nitrogen removal and the relative key microbial activities in cws yang et al 2020b almost all biochemical reactions in microbial metabolism require electron donors and energy support including metabolism pathways of nitrification and denitrification liu et al 2020 as for nitrification the electrons produced by the oxidation of nh 4 n are transferred to the terminal oxidase complex iv which generates a proton motive force to drive atp synthesis henning et al 1995 for denitrification the primary electron donor nadh and fadh2 and atp are produced by carbon source metabolism glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid tca cycle liu et al 2020 these electrons are indirectly transferred to nitrate reductase nar nitrite reductase nir nitric oxide reductases nor and nitrous oxide reductase nos via electron transfer systems including complex i complex ii quinone pools complex iii and cytochrome c su et al 2019 finally the denitrifying enzymes consume electrons to catalyze the reduction of no 3 n to n2 therefore according to the fate of electrons and atp the complete denitrification metabolism pathway could be divided into three steps namely electron production process electron transport process and electron consumption process berks et al 1995 meanwhile nitrogen transformation in cws occurs mainly via a series of biochemical reactions which are controlled by gene abundance dna level and enzyme activity protein level su et al 2019 however previous studies on the effects of nanoparticles nps on n transformation in wwtps mainly focused on the individual enzyme activities or individual functional gene abundances related to partial nitrification and denitrification processes to our knowledge only one study combined glycolysis and nitrogen metabolism at the gene level to reveal the effects of nps on n transformation in wwtps yang et al 2020a however to fully elucidate the influential mechanism of the effects of nps on n transformation it is reasonable and essential to analyze the nitrification and denitrification metabolism pathway independently from the protein and gene levels and combine the specific denitrification process with the glycolysis tricarboxylic acid tca cycle and electron transfer system there have not been any studies concerning the influential mechanism of nps to each step of n transformation metabolism in cws from protein and gene levels therefore to thoroughly reveal the influential mechanism of nanoplastics on n transformation in cws a comprehensive investigation of the overall n transformation metabolism at the enzyme and gene levels should be carried out nps can be intercepted and retained in cws by adsorption onto the biofilm and their distribution and fate affected pollutant removal huang et al 2017 thus to thoroughly study the toxicity mechanisms of nanoplastics to cws the interception capacity of nanoplastics in cws should be evaluated due to the limitation of separation and quantification methods of nanoplastics only one study on wwtps research field verified nanoplastics flux through pilot activated sludge process by labeling nanoplastics with rare metals frehland et al 2020 however it is a proxy method for the plastic itself and the disturbance of the metal label made it difficult to simultaneously explore the effect of nanoplastics on n transformation in cws previous studies have provided a nanoplastics quantitative method of cloud point extraction combined with thermal degradation via pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry py gc ms which has the characteristics of low limit of quantification and high recovery efficiency compared with other methods cai et al 2021 since the study on the interception ability of nanoplastics in cws is pivotal and still limited this study used py gc ms method for the first time to comprehensively reveal the interception capacity of nanoplastics in cws and the toxicity mechanisms of nanoparticles and provide theoretical basis and data support for the feasibility of removing nanoplastics in cws previous studies have revealed that nanoplastic induced reactive oxygen species ros caused toxicity to different organisms such as arabidopsis thaliana sun et al 2020 and cyanobacteria feng et al 2019 ros can damage cellular macromolecules resulting in membrane damage blocking of dna replication and loss of protein function johnson and hug 2019 thereby inhibiting n transformation in cws to overcome ros organisms in cws have developed robust antioxidant systems with antioxidant enzymes and non enzymatic compounds to achieve a redox balance johnson and hug 2019 pisoschi and pop 2015 however excess ros could significantly affect antioxidant systems there is only one previous study confirmed that ps nps have a negative effect on the macrophyte antioxidant enzymes in cws yang et al 2020b nevertheless to elucidate the mechanism by which nps affect the antioxidant system and thus the n transformation in cws it is essential to comprehensively evaluate the effects of nps on macrophytes and microorganisms and the causes of ros generation from both dna and protein level in our knowledge there have not been any comprehensive studies focused on the effects of nps on the antioxidant system therefore it is quite significant to analyze the antioxidant systems in cws and the causes of ros generation through the key antioxidant enzyme activities and the encoding genes of almost all related enzymes to reveal the toxicity mechanism of nanoparticles thus to further assess the influential and toxic mechanism of nanoplastics on nitrogen transformation in cws polystyrene nanoparticles ps nps one of the most widely used plastics scheurer and bigalke 2018 were used to conduct in our study considering the microplastics concentrations in the wastewater and environment simon et al 2018 nanoplastics concentration might be even higher thus 1 mg l was chosen as the conventional concentration in our study and 10 mg l as the potential high concentration caused by large scale industrial production to investigate the a fate and transport of ps nps in cws b effects of ps nps on nitrogen transformation and the influential mechanism of nps through overall n transformation metabolism at the gene and the enzyme levels c toxicity mechanism of n transformation through analyzing the antioxidant systems of macrophytes and microorganisms 2 material and methods 2 1 ps nps suspension and synthetic wastewater polystyrene nanoparticles 100 nm were purchased from tianjin baseline chromtech research centre tianjin china the ps suspensions were prepared with synthetic wastewater and then ultrasonicated at 250w and 40 khz for 20 min at 25 c prior to use as shown in fig s1 the monomer suspension of 100 nm ps nps in wastewater was detected by dynamic light scattering dls zen1600 malvern instruments malvern uk and no obvious aggregation was observed the composition of the ps nps was determined by ftir spectroscopy fig s2 the synthetic wastewater was designed to simulate the influents of wwtps according to actual water quality of influents in jiangsu province china sun et al 2016 briefly in theory the synthetic wastewater contained 200 mg l cod 30 mg l total nitrogen tn 20 mg l ammonia nitrogen nh 4 n 7 mg l nitrate nitrogen no 3 n and 4 mg l total phosphorus tp the specific compositions of synthetic wastewater were shown in the table s1 2 2 cw microcosms setup and sample collection the pilot scale vertical flow constructed wetlands vfcw were set up in the laboratory of southeast university in nanjing china the dimension of them was 0 20m 0 65m diameter height and pore volume was 5l the height of sand layer was 0 25m planted with iris pseudacorus i pseudacorus and the sectional view was shown in fig s3 three types of cws were established in our study the control without ps nps exposure vf1 with 1 mg l ps nps exposure and vf10 with 10 mg l ps nps exposure each cw was worked in sequencing batch mode with hydraulic retention time hrt of 3 days and the hydraulic load was 0 053 m d the synthetic wastewater evenly entered into the cws from the top within 15 min and discharged from the bottom within 15 min after approximately six months of preculture stable and high removal efficiencies of nutrients were obtained in fig 1 then wastewater containing ps nps was fed into cws to thoroughly study the influence of ps nps on the nitrogen transformation the entire formal experiment period was divided into period i 1 33 d period ii 34 66 d and period iii 67 99 d experiments all the effluent was collected and settled for 20 min for the detection of tn nh 4 n no 3 n and no 2 n at each hrt after ultrasonic dispersion 500 ml effluent was used for determining the ps nps concentration at the end of each period approximately 10 g sand was collected from the middle 10 20 cm of sand layer every three batches to conduct enzyme activities of n transformation electron transfer system activity and soil catalase scat activity assays furthermore antioxidant enzyme activities of the macrophytes superoxide dismutase sod catalase cat and peroxidase pod and malondialdehyde mda level were measured every three batches in the period i and period iii after the entire experiment 60 g sand was collected from three different sampling points in the middle sand layer conducted the real time qpcr and then mixed to conduct metagenomic and scanning electron microscope analysis 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 fate of ps nps and water quality determination analysis to determine the fate of ps nps in cws the effluent of cws were digested and examined by the method of triton x 45 tx 45 based cloud point extraction combined with py gc ms as mentioned in the previous study zhou et al 2019 the details of this method are described in text s1 and the standard curves for each test are shown in fig s4 to investigate ps nps adsorbed onto the biofilm of sand approximately 10 g sand was sampled after exposure experiment for scanning electron microscopy observation the water quality of each batch was analyzed including tn nh 4 n no 3 n and no 2 n according to the standard methods apha 2005 2 3 2 key enzyme activities of n transformation and electron transport system activity analysis to determine the effect of ps nps on n transformation at the protein level key enzyme activities of n transformation urease ure ammonia monooxygenase amo hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao nitrite oxidoreductase nxr nitrate reductase nar and nitrite reductase nir and electron transport system activity were measured at intervals and the procedure is described in text s2 2 3 3 antioxidant enzyme activities and lipid peroxidation analysis to investigate the influence of ps nps on antioxidant enzyme activities and oxidative damage the cat pod sod activities as well as the mda level of i pseudacorus and scat were measured at intervals as for plants a total of 0 1 g of fresh leaf segments from the same height of three macrophytes in the same cws were sampled and the details of measurement procedure are described in text s3 in addition scat activity was measured by scat kit nanjing jiancheng technology co china 2 3 4 metagenomic analysis 2 3 4 1 metagenome dna extraction and shotgun sequencing metagenome dna and shotgun sequencing total microbial genomic dna samples were extracted using the dneasy powersoil kit qiagen inc netherlands following the manufacturer s instructions and stored at 20 c prior to further assessment the quantity and quality of extracted dnas were detected by a nanodrop nd 1000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa and agarose gel electrophoresis respectively the extracted microbial dna was used for constructing metagenome shotgun sequencing libraries with insert sizes of 400 bp by using illumina truseq nano dna lt library preparation kit each library was sequenced by illumina hiseq x ten platform illumina usa with pe150 strategy 2 3 4 2 sequence analysis sequencing adapters were removed from sequencing reads using cutadapt v1 2 1 and then the procedural details from low quality reads to obtaining non redundant gene catalog are provided in text s4 the functional profiles of the non redundant genes were obtained by annotated against kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg databases by using diamond alignment algorithm buchfink et al 2015 the genes related to n transformation metabolism and antioxidant enzymes were identified by searching ko numbers in functional annotation results to perform quantitative comparative analysis relative abundances ras of genes were evaluated by a normalization strategy to normalize for gene length and sequencing depth salmon v1 1 0 castro et al 2021 shi et al 2020 and the specific calculation method is described in text s5 2 3 5 qpcr analysis to verify the metagenomics results the real time qpcr was performed on sand samples as the same batch of metagenomic sequencing these sand samples were collected from three different sampling points in each reactor the measured method refers to our previous study huang et al 2019 a list of the primers of the represented genes were shown in the table s2 the observed results were effective based on correlation coefficient of standard curve r 2 range from 0 9962 to 0 9981 the values were expressed as gene copies per gram sand 2 4 statistical analysis the statistically significant changes in nitrogen removal efficiencies effluent concentrations and qpcr results between reactors were analyzed by a one way analysis of variance anova with the lsd post hoc test spss 23 0 then to easily compare the nitrogen removal efficiencies and enzyme activities between the exposed groups and the control the results of the exposed groups were represented as a percentage compared with the corresponding control the significant changes of enzyme activities between results were determined by anova with a bootstrap method 95 bootstrap confidence intervals sample sizes n 1000 by python v3 8 5 the corresponding code was shown in text s6 the paired samples t test spss 23 0 was used to analyze the overall variation in the ras of genes statistically significant differential ras of one specific gene between two samples were analyzed by fisher s exact test stamp v2 1 3 furthermore an ordination was calculated to visualize differences in the n transformation enzyme activities among cws using 2 dimensional nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds plots generated using 250 iterations or reached the lowest 2d stress bray curtis distance metrics was used for nmds with monomds in the vegan package in r then a multivariant analysis of the similarity between enzyme activities was performed using anosim in the vegan package with bray curtis dissimilarity values the structure equation modeling was performed using amos 21 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 fate of ps nps in cws although microplastics have been detected in a variety of wwtps sun et al 2019 the fate of nanoplastics has not been explored especially in cws in this study a method of cloud point extraction combined with py gc ms was used to investigate the fate of ps nps in cws at the end of each period as shown in fig 2 with the influent of 1 mg l the effluent concentrations of ps nps in each period were measured as 12 78 1 50 ug l 21 28 1 37 ug l and 24 05 4 81 ug l respectively with the average removal efficiencies of 98 72 97 87 and 97 60 respectively meanwhile with the influent of 10 mg l the effluent concentrations of ps nps in each period were 25 65 3 14 ug l 70 39 1 87 ug l and 166 97 9 54 ug l respectively with the average removal efficiencies of 99 74 99 30 and 98 33 respectively the removal efficiencies of ps nps continuously decreased along the exposure time but more than 97 ps nps could retain and accumulate in the cws although there have not been other studies focused on the removal of nanoplastics in cws it has been reported that cws had an effective removal capacity of metal and non metallic nps huang et al 2017 schierz et al 2014 with removal efficiencies more than 90 the scanning electron microscope images fig s5 further proved that numerous nps adhered on the biofilm of sand which might negatively influence the growth and vitality of microbial cells wang and chen 2016 thus probably affecting nitrogen transformation in cws and the specific impact was described as follows 3 2 impact of ps nps on nitrogen removal performance as shown in fig 1 in the period of preculture the differences in the nitrogen removal performance between cws were reached steady state after exposure to ps nps the average tn effluent concentrations of vf1 and vf10 increased by 7 10 and 7 41 in the period i 4 86 and 6 06 in the period ii 4 11 and 3 72 in the period iii respectively compared with the control reactor p 0 05 fig s6 furthermore the most significant differences of effluent concentrations of exposed cws increased by 13 68 in vf1 and 15 12 in vf10 compared with the control were exhibited in the period i these indicated that both exposure concentrations of ps nps caused a certain degree of suppression in nitrogen removal especially in the relatively short term of the exposure experiment however it should be noted that the variations of less than 5 in the latter periods might be caused by the reactor to reactor differences in cws organic nitrogen is ammonified to nh 4 n then oxidized to no 2 n and no 3 n by nitrification process subsequently and ultimately reduced to n2 by denitrification process in fig 1 1 mg l ps nps had no obvious effects on nh 4 n transformation compared with the control throughout the whole experiment p 0 05 however under 10 mg l ps nps exposure the average nh 4 n removal efficiencies in each period decreased by 6 29 4 36 and 2 90 respectively and the average nh 4 n effluent concentrations increased by 7 35 4 43 and 2 58 respectively p 0 05 compared with control the most significant difference of effluent concentrations of vf10 increased by 13 36 was exhibited in the period i these demonstrated that 10 mg l ps nps caused acute inhibition of nh 4 n removal and also probably led to relatively long term suppression as for no 3 n and no 2 n 1 mg l ps nps suppressed no 3 n removal in each period by 6 21 9 84 and 11 65 respectively in comparison with the control 96 50 96 34 and 97 74 respectively p 0 05 the average no 3 n effluent concentrations under the 1 mg l exposure in each period 0 73 mg l 1 03 mg l and 1 07 mg l respectively were higher than those in the control 0 27 mg l 0 29 mg l and 0 18 mg l respectively p 0 05 and 1 mg l ps nps exposure caused the accumulations of no 2 n especially in a relatively short exposure fig 1 and fig s6 the results indicated that 1 mg l ps nps inhibited the denitrification process however 10 mg l ps nps exposure did not seem to cause significant accumulation of no 3 n and no 2 n which might be due to the inhibition of ammonia oxidation process thereby inhibiting the formation of no 2 n the specific explanation was further revealed based on the enzyme activity and metagenomic analysis of n transformation in the next section 3 3 impact of ps nps on key enzyme activities of n transformation and electron transport system activity the activities of key enzymes involved in ammonification nitrification and denitrification were measured throughout the entire experiment including urease ure ec 3 5 1 5 ammonia monooxygenase amo ec 1 14 99 39 hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao ec 1 7 2 6 nitrite oxidoreductase nxr ec 1 7 99 nitrate reductase nar ec 1 7 5 1 and nitrite reductase nir ec 1 7 2 1 as shown in fig 3 based on the above mentioned enzyme activities 2 dimensional nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds plots according to bray curtis dissimilarities was calculated an ordination to visualize any differences among the enzyme activities of the control vf1 and vf10 nmds plots illustrated that the enzyme activities exposed to any concentrations of ps nps were significantly different anosim r 0 207 0 p 0 05 which indicated that ps nps have significant impact on overall enzymes of n transformation specifically for ammonification the activity of ure catalyzing hydrolysis from organic nitrogen to inorganic nitrogen was quantified in fig 4 1 and 10 mg l ps nps caused severe inhibition of ure activities in the period ii 82 19 and 73 54 and the period iii 74 12 and 65 68 in comparison with the control p 0 05 respectively as for nitrification fig 5a amo catalyzes oxidation of nh 4 n to hydroxylamine n h 2 oh and hao catalyzes oxidation of n h 2 oh to no 2 n which was regarded as the ammonia oxidation process van kessel et al 2015 nxr is responsible for nitrite oxidation process catalyzing oxidation of no 2 n to no 3 n kuypers et al 2018 as illustrated in fig 4 1 mg l ps nps exposure had no significant influence on nitrifying enzymes throughout the entire experiment p 0 05 nevertheless 10 mg l ps nps exposure significantly restrained these enzyme activities especially amo and nxr compared with the control amo activities in each period significantly decreased to 80 90 75 01 and 74 55 respectively and nxr activities decreased to 63 61 61 95 and 80 60 respectively p 0 05 these results demonstrated that high concentration had negatively effects on nitrification which was consistent with the decline of nh 4 n removal efficiencies with respect to the denitrification fig 5b nar and nir catalyze reduction of no 3 n to no via consuming electrons from electron transfer systems as shown in fig 4 both 1 mg l and 10 mg l ps nps had significantly inhibitory effects on the activities of nar and nir during the whole experiment concretely nar activities in vf1 and vf10 decreased to 82 77 and 75 59 in the period i 68 82 and 65 51 in the period iii respectively p 0 05 the nir activities in vf1 and vf10 decreased to 65 32 and 57 59 69 97 and 54 84 77 98 and 69 74 in each period respectively p 0 05 these results indicated that both concentrations had negative effects on denitrifying enzymes thus affecting the denitrification process furthermore to further reveal the effects of nitrogen transformation under 10 mg l ps nps exposure the structure equation modeling was established based on the enzyme activities of n transformation and effluent concentrations of nh 4 n no 3 n and no 2 n in cws fig s7 it illustrated that amo activity had an obvious negative direct effect on nh 4 n effluent concentration p 0 05 which confirmed that the inhibition of amo activity would lead to the decrease of nh 4 n removal under exposure of ps nps in addition nh 4 n effluent concentration had a negative direct effect on no 2 n concentration which further confirmed that the accumulation of nh 4 n caused by inhibition of ammonia oxidation process led to almost no variation of no 2 n concentration in addition previous studies have confirmed that the crucial role of electron transport system activity etsa on denitrification and the decrease of etsa led to the inhibition of denitrification liu et al 2020 in fig 4 1 mg l and 10 mg l ps nps exposure caused the significant decrease of etsa especially at 10 mg l it indicated that ps nps remarkably inhibited the electron transport system thereby bringing negative influence on denitrification process in cws 3 4 impact of ps nps on n transformation metabolism to comprehensively investigate n transformation metabolism pathways in vf10 and the control metagenomic analysis which can provide a detailed classification and quantification of the metabolic processes was conducted fig 5 then seven representative genes were subjected to qpcr for verification of the metagenomics results the results of qpcr were shown in table s3 and fig s8 the fold changes of relative abundances ras by metagenomics positively linear correlated with the fold changes of gene copies by qpcr person s r 0 921 r 2 0 848 p 0 003 confirming that the ras of genes as assayed using metagenomics were reliable the ras of genes were considered significantly different between control and vf10 as the fold changes of relative abundances fc narg and p 0 05 the details for setting fc narg were described in text s7 3 4 1 impact of ps nps on metabolism pathways of nitrification the functional genes of nitrification including ammonia oxidation amoabc hao nitrite oxidation nxrab and complex iv coxabcd cyoabcd were quantified as shown in fig 5a under 10 mg l ps nps exposure the ras of nearly all related genes mentioned above declined except for amoa and coxd specifically 10 mg l ps nps significantly decreased amoc and hao abundance by nearly 50 and 60 compared with the control fold change amoc 0 51 fold change hao 0 66 p 0 05 the absolute abundance of hao was confirmed to be suppressed significantly by qpcr p 0 05 it indicated that ammonia oxidation metabolism was disrupted under ps nps stress for nitrite oxidation the ra of nxra encoding nxr was significantly inhibited in comparison with the control fold change 0 86 p 0 05 in addition complex iv cytochrome c oxidase ec 7 1 1 9 a terminal oxidase is also a key enzyme for ammonia oxidation and nitrite oxidation processes which transfers electrons to oxygen and generates proton motive force ultimately driving atp synthesis henning et al 1995 the ras of genes encoding complex iv were suppressed as a whole by 10 mg l ps nps paired samples t test p 0 05 therein 10 mg l ps nps significantly decreased ras of cyo abc by nearly 40 all fold changes fc narg p 0 05 and inhibited coxa by 16 8 fold change 0 83 p 0 05 furthermore a paired samples t test showed that ps nps significantly decreased the ras of genes related to ammonia oxidation amoabc hao coxabcd cyoabcd at the level of 0 1 p 0 096 and genes related to nitrite oxidation nxrab coxabcd cyoabcd at the level of 0 05 p 0 036 these results further indicated that ps nps reduced the abundance of key genes involved in ammonia oxidation and nitrite oxidation process thus could negatively affect the nitrification which was consistent with the inhibition of enzyme activities 3 4 2 impact of ps nps on metabolism pathways of denitrification the biochemical metabolism related to denitrification was divided into three steps namely the electron production process electron transport process and electron consumption process liu et al 2020 the ras of the genes related to these biochemical processes were shown in fig 5b 3 4 2 3 impact of ps nps on electron production process since glucose was the main carbon source in cws in our study the electron donor and atp mainly produced by glycolysis and tca cycle in carbon source metabolism as shown in fig 5b during the first stage of glycolysis although paired samples t test showed no significant difference between ras of genes in vf10 and the control p 0 05 five related genes glk pgi1 tal pgi pgi pmi and pfkc in vf10 were inhibited significantly compared with the control all fold changes fc narg p 0 05 therein as a pivotal gene certified in previous studies berks et al 1995 glk encodes glucokinase gk ec 2 7 1 2 catalyzing the first step in glycolysis metabolism glucose to glucose 6 phosphate ps nps significantly decreased the ra of glk by 14 5 fold change 0 85 p 0 05 it might directly impact the subsequent glycolysis process thus negatively affecting electron production process liu et al 2020 with respect to the next stage of glycolysis ps nps reduced six of nine related gene abundances and especially reduced the abundance of three genes gap2 gpml and pyk all fold changes fc narg p 0 05 therein pyk encodes pyruvate kinase pk ec 2 7 1 40 catalyzing the last step in glycolysis phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate which could produce atp though substrate level phosphorylation mazurek 2011 in addition pyruvate is a connection between glycolysis and tca cycle in microbial metabolism thus significant reduction in the abundance of pyk might negatively affect atp production and subsequent tca cycle as for tca cycle 10 mg l ps nps caused significant decrease of related gene abundances paired samples t test p 0 05 and therein seven related genes e g idh1 sucd sdhd etc were significantly suppressed all fold changes fc nar p 0 05 thus 10 mg l exposure inhibited tca cycle metabolism pathway among the related genes idh1 and mdh encode isocitrate dehydrogenase idh ec 1 1 1 42 and malate dehydrogenase mdh ec 1 1 1 37 respectively which are two critical enzymes to produce nadh in tca cycle mcreynolds and kitto 1970 ramakrishnan and martin 1955 thus the decrease of mdh and significant decrease of idh1 fold change 0 85 p 0 05 might inhibit the nadh production sdhd encoding complex ii succinate dehydrogenase ec 1 3 5 1 which catalyzes succinate oxidation in tca cycle and transfers electrons to quinone pool in the membrane through flavine adenine dinucleotide fadh2 cecchini 2003 was significantly inhibited in comparison with the control fold change 0 79 p 0 05 in addition the ras of genes encoding complex ii were suppressed by 10 mg l ps nps paired samples t test p 0 05 these results revealed ps nps might affect fadh2 production in tca cycle furthermore the ra of sucd encoding the succinyl coa synthase scs ec 6 2 1 5 which catalyzes the only reaction producing atp in tca cycle though substrate level phosphorylation was significantly inhibited in comparison with the control fold change 0 83 p 0 05 thus affecting atp production kaufman 1955 as we know electron donor nadh and fadh2 and energy support atp are essential for denitrification thus the ras of genes related to electron donor 11 genes in table s4 and atp production 14 genes in table s4 in carbon source metabolism glycolysis and tca cycle were analyzed through paired samples t test the results revealed that the related genes of electron donor and atp production significantly decreased all p 0 05 it indicated that the replication of key genes for electron donor and atp production involved in carbon metabolism were inhibited under ps nps exposure thus probably negatively affecting denitrification 3 4 2 4 impact of ps nps on electron transport process entering into electron transport system via transducing from nadh in complex i and fadh2 in complex ii the electrons are transferred to complex iii via the quinones and ultimately to cytochrome c in the periplasm wan et al 2016 thus the ras of genes encoding complex i complex ii and complex iii were quantified in fig 5b 10 mg l ps nps significantly caused the reduction in abundance of these genes as a whole paired samples t test p 0 05 and the abundances of five related genes mqcra potb nuoh nuol sdhd were reduced significantly fold changes fc nar p 0 05 furthermore ps nps obviously decreased the ras of genes related to complex i at the level of 0 1 p 0 073 and genes related to complex ii p 0 05 therefore these results revealed that electron transport system might be inhibited under the exposure of ps nps 3 4 2 5 impact of ps nps on electron consumption process during the electron consumption process fig 5b the ras of nearly all related genes declined under ps nps stress except for nirk furthermore the ras of genes involved in denitrification were suppressed paired samples t test p 0 05 concretely narghi and napabc respectively encode membrane bound nar and periplasmic nap dissimilatory nitrate reductases catalyzing reduction of no 3 n to no 2 n therein the abundance of narg and napc decreased significantly fold change narg 0 856 fold change napc 0 80 p 0 05 demonstrating that the transformation from no 3 n to no 2 n was blocked which was consistent with the results of enzymology the ra of nosz encoding nitrous oxide reductase nos for reduction of no to n2 were significantly inhibited as well fold change 0 82 p 0 05 the absolute abundances of narg and nosz was also confirmed to be significantly suppressed by qpcr p 0 05 therefore ps nps restrained the electron consumption within denitrification process by declining key gene abundances 3 5 impact of ps nps on antioxidant systems to comprehensively study the toxicity mechanism of nanoplastics on nitrogen transformation in cws the effects of nanoplastics on antioxidant systems of macrophytes and microorganisms were analyzed through the key antioxidant enzymes and the ras of genes encoding related antioxidant enzymes as for macrophytes malondialdehyde mda is the secondary peroxidation product of lipid peroxidation caused by oxidative damage and could be an indicator of ros sun et al 2020 as shown in fig s9 1 mg l and 10 mg l ps nps significantly increased the mda content along the exposure time in addition superoxide dismutase sod catalase cat and peroxidase pod are three of the best characterized ros defense mechanisms in plants sod can catalyze the dismutation of superoxide into hydrogen peroxide and oxygen and cat and pod can scavenge hydrogen peroxide johnson and hug 2019 in the period i the activities of these antioxidative enzymes increased especially at high concentration p 0 05 a sudden increase of ros could activate a set of protecting enzyme activities to maintain a redox balance imlay 2019 after a relatively long period of exposure 10 mg l ps nps significantly decreased sod and cat activities by nearly 20 compared with the control p 0 05 the reason might be excessive accumulation of ros surpassed the scavenging capacity or negatively influenced the synthesis of related protein hu et al 2018 these results indicated that ps nps could bring negative influence on antioxidant systems of macrophytes with respect to microorganisms in cws soil catalase scat can also convert hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water similar to the response of the antioxidant enzymes in plants scat activities were firstly induced and then inhibited under ps nps exposure p 0 05 fig s10 the results revealed that the antioxidant system in cws could be negatively affected due to excess nanoplastic induced ros excess ros can lead to deterioration of enzyme activities and abundances and suppress the electron transport thus inhibiting n transformation imlay 2003 in order to investigate the influence of antioxidant system on nitrogen removal under ps nps exposure the structure equation modeling was established based on the activities of antioxidant enzymes sod cat and scat nitrifying enzymes amo nxr denitrifying enzymes nar nir and tn effluent concentrations of vf1 and vf10 fig 6 showed that activities of sod cat and scat had obvious direct effects on nitrification process p 0 05 which further affecting the tn removal in addition cat and scat significantly influenced the denitrification process as well p 0 05 it revealed that antioxidant system variation caused by excess nanoplastic induced ros could directly affect nitrogen removal in table 1 fifteen antioxidative enzymes and their corresponding encoding genes were summarized referring to previous studies insel et al 2014 johnson and hug 2019 according to the kegg classification system the antioxidative enzymes were divided into seven classifications catalase peroxidase peroxiredoxin superoxide dismutase superoxide reductase glutaredoxins and thioredoxins after exposed to 10 mg l ps nps the ras of nearly all related genes encoding the enzymes mentioned above were significantly induced with 1 17 1 60 folds of the control p 0 05 furthermore paired samples t test indicated that the ras of genes involving in the antioxidative system were induced p 0 05 the reason could be that the replication of these genes involved in antioxidative system are activated responding to excess ros imlay 2019 these findings based on protein and gene level confirmed that excess ros and variations of antioxidant systems induced by ps nps might be one of the key toxicity mechanisms resulted in the deteriorative performances of nitrogen removal in cws this result raised a key question why ps nps produce excess ros the natural source of ros is environmental and endogenous imlay 2019 trachootham et al 2008 as for environmentally producing ros persistent environmental free radicals could be generated on ps under sunlight which transfer electrons to h2o o2 and induce a large amount of ros generation zhu et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 and peroxy radicals could be generated by ps under sunlight as well kiatkamjornwong et al 1999 with the respect to endogenous ros the main source was found to be the respiratory chain if oxygen collides with a reduced flavin in complex i and complex ii before transferring the electrons to next carrier the electron can hop from nadh fadh2 onto oxygen and produce ros thus the amount of ros production directly depends on the frequency of collisions with oxygen imlay 2003 in this study the significant inhibition of the ras of genes encoding complex i and complex ii p 0 05 led to a greater frequency of colliding with oxygen fig 5b thus producing more ros 3 6 environmental significance ps nps exposure caused a certain degree of inhibition in nitrogen transformation throughout the entire experiment meantime ps nps showed negative effects on the key enzyme activities and the ras of genes related to n transformation metabolism furthermore ps nps could negatively influence other microbe driven metabolism in cws such as carbon metabolism wetlands are termed nature s kidneys since they play inherent natural functions in improving water quality and maintaining regional ecological balance kennedy and mayer 2002 therefore excessive accumulation of nanoplastics could lead to the eutrophication of receiving waters from cws negatively influence the land water ecosystem and destroy the geochemical balance of multiple biogenic elements i e nitrogen carbon cycle therefore in addition to cws the negative impact of micro nanoplastics on the global geochemical nitrogen and carbon cycles should be given greater attention 4 conclusions in this study 1 and 10 mg l ps nps caused a certain degree of suppression in tn removal especially in the relatively short term of the exposure experiment p 0 05 in addition 1 mg l ps nps had negative effects on the key denitrifying enzyme activities and etsa while 10 mg l ps nps not only suppressed enzymes involved in denitrification and etsa but also had adverse effects on nitrifying enzymes ps nps reduced the ras of genes involved in nitrogen transformation including nitrification and denitrification biochemical metabolisms electron production process electron transport process and electron consumption process through metagenomic analysis the accumulation and retention of ps nps in the biofilm of cws might be the reason for the influence on n transformation a potential toxicity mechanism assessment revealed that negative effects on nitrogen transformation mainly attributed to antioxidant system variation caused by nanoplastic induced ros declaration of competing

16784,the widespread use of nanoplastics inevitably leads to their increasing emission into constructed wetlands cws however little is known about the impacts of nanoplastics on nitrogen transformation in cws in this study the influence of polystyrene nanoparticles ps nps one of the most widely used plastics on the nitrogen transformation in cws was comprehensively investigated and the influential and toxic mechanism was evaluated through metagenomic analysis dna level and key enzyme activities protein level related to n transformation metabolism and antioxidant systems the results showed that over 97 of ps nps were retained in cws and the biofilm of sand was the main sink of ps nps exposure to 1 and 10 mg l ps nps suppressed the nitrogen transformation causing a certain degree of inhibition in tn removal especially in the relatively short term of the exposure experiment p 0 05 at the protein level 1 and 10 mg l ps nps negatively affect enzyme activities involved in denitrification nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase and electron transport system activity etsa in contrast 10 mg l of ps nps significantly suppressed the activities of nitrifying enzymes ammonia monooxygenase hydroxylamine dehydrogenase and nitrite oxidoreductase whereas 1 mg l ps nps showed no impacts on nitrifying enzymes metagenomic analysis further certified that ps nps restrained the relative abundances of genes involved in nitrogen transformation including nitrification and denitrification biochemical metabolisms the electron production electron transport and electron consumption processes it also indicated that ps nps could affect nitrogen transformation by reducing the abundance of genes for electron donor and atp production involved in carbon metabolism glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolism in our study the potential toxic mechanisms of ps nps attributed to over production of reactive oxygen species and variations of antioxidant systems in macrophytes and microorganisms these results provided valuable information for evaluating the impacts of ps nps on cws and arouse more attention to their impacts on the global geochemical nitrogen and carbon cycles graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords constructed wetland nanoplastics removal capacity nitrogen metabolism glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolism electron transfer systems antioxidant systems 1 introduction micro and nanoplastics are considered a global concern due to their ubiquitous pollution and toxicological risks triebskorn et al 2019 wright and kelly 2017 herein nanoplastics are defined as plastic particles with diameters smaller than either 100 nm or 1000 nm al sid cheikh et al 2018 the widespread direct utilization of nanoplastics for industrial purposes and indirect formation from large plastic litter pieces via prolonged abiotic and biotic factors inevitably result in their release into terrestrial and aquatic environments with most ending up in wastewater treatment plants wwtps shams et al 2020 sun et al 2019 nitrogen removal in wwtps has always been the focus of our attention especially in the past 40 years kuypers et al 2018 constructed wetlands cws are widely used and can efficiently remove nitrogen through the cooperation of microorganisms macrophytes and substrates through biological physical and chemical processes vymazal 2013 therefore the widespread use of nanoplastics inevitably results in their appearance in cws critically previous studies have revealed that nanoplastics can cause severe toxicity to macrophytes and microorganisms feng et al 2019 sun et al 2020 which leads to inhibition of nitrogen removal and the relative key microbial activities in cws yang et al 2020b almost all biochemical reactions in microbial metabolism require electron donors and energy support including metabolism pathways of nitrification and denitrification liu et al 2020 as for nitrification the electrons produced by the oxidation of nh 4 n are transferred to the terminal oxidase complex iv which generates a proton motive force to drive atp synthesis henning et al 1995 for denitrification the primary electron donor nadh and fadh2 and atp are produced by carbon source metabolism glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid tca cycle liu et al 2020 these electrons are indirectly transferred to nitrate reductase nar nitrite reductase nir nitric oxide reductases nor and nitrous oxide reductase nos via electron transfer systems including complex i complex ii quinone pools complex iii and cytochrome c su et al 2019 finally the denitrifying enzymes consume electrons to catalyze the reduction of no 3 n to n2 therefore according to the fate of electrons and atp the complete denitrification metabolism pathway could be divided into three steps namely electron production process electron transport process and electron consumption process berks et al 1995 meanwhile nitrogen transformation in cws occurs mainly via a series of biochemical reactions which are controlled by gene abundance dna level and enzyme activity protein level su et al 2019 however previous studies on the effects of nanoparticles nps on n transformation in wwtps mainly focused on the individual enzyme activities or individual functional gene abundances related to partial nitrification and denitrification processes to our knowledge only one study combined glycolysis and nitrogen metabolism at the gene level to reveal the effects of nps on n transformation in wwtps yang et al 2020a however to fully elucidate the influential mechanism of the effects of nps on n transformation it is reasonable and essential to analyze the nitrification and denitrification metabolism pathway independently from the protein and gene levels and combine the specific denitrification process with the glycolysis tricarboxylic acid tca cycle and electron transfer system there have not been any studies concerning the influential mechanism of nps to each step of n transformation metabolism in cws from protein and gene levels therefore to thoroughly reveal the influential mechanism of nanoplastics on n transformation in cws a comprehensive investigation of the overall n transformation metabolism at the enzyme and gene levels should be carried out nps can be intercepted and retained in cws by adsorption onto the biofilm and their distribution and fate affected pollutant removal huang et al 2017 thus to thoroughly study the toxicity mechanisms of nanoplastics to cws the interception capacity of nanoplastics in cws should be evaluated due to the limitation of separation and quantification methods of nanoplastics only one study on wwtps research field verified nanoplastics flux through pilot activated sludge process by labeling nanoplastics with rare metals frehland et al 2020 however it is a proxy method for the plastic itself and the disturbance of the metal label made it difficult to simultaneously explore the effect of nanoplastics on n transformation in cws previous studies have provided a nanoplastics quantitative method of cloud point extraction combined with thermal degradation via pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry py gc ms which has the characteristics of low limit of quantification and high recovery efficiency compared with other methods cai et al 2021 since the study on the interception ability of nanoplastics in cws is pivotal and still limited this study used py gc ms method for the first time to comprehensively reveal the interception capacity of nanoplastics in cws and the toxicity mechanisms of nanoparticles and provide theoretical basis and data support for the feasibility of removing nanoplastics in cws previous studies have revealed that nanoplastic induced reactive oxygen species ros caused toxicity to different organisms such as arabidopsis thaliana sun et al 2020 and cyanobacteria feng et al 2019 ros can damage cellular macromolecules resulting in membrane damage blocking of dna replication and loss of protein function johnson and hug 2019 thereby inhibiting n transformation in cws to overcome ros organisms in cws have developed robust antioxidant systems with antioxidant enzymes and non enzymatic compounds to achieve a redox balance johnson and hug 2019 pisoschi and pop 2015 however excess ros could significantly affect antioxidant systems there is only one previous study confirmed that ps nps have a negative effect on the macrophyte antioxidant enzymes in cws yang et al 2020b nevertheless to elucidate the mechanism by which nps affect the antioxidant system and thus the n transformation in cws it is essential to comprehensively evaluate the effects of nps on macrophytes and microorganisms and the causes of ros generation from both dna and protein level in our knowledge there have not been any comprehensive studies focused on the effects of nps on the antioxidant system therefore it is quite significant to analyze the antioxidant systems in cws and the causes of ros generation through the key antioxidant enzyme activities and the encoding genes of almost all related enzymes to reveal the toxicity mechanism of nanoparticles thus to further assess the influential and toxic mechanism of nanoplastics on nitrogen transformation in cws polystyrene nanoparticles ps nps one of the most widely used plastics scheurer and bigalke 2018 were used to conduct in our study considering the microplastics concentrations in the wastewater and environment simon et al 2018 nanoplastics concentration might be even higher thus 1 mg l was chosen as the conventional concentration in our study and 10 mg l as the potential high concentration caused by large scale industrial production to investigate the a fate and transport of ps nps in cws b effects of ps nps on nitrogen transformation and the influential mechanism of nps through overall n transformation metabolism at the gene and the enzyme levels c toxicity mechanism of n transformation through analyzing the antioxidant systems of macrophytes and microorganisms 2 material and methods 2 1 ps nps suspension and synthetic wastewater polystyrene nanoparticles 100 nm were purchased from tianjin baseline chromtech research centre tianjin china the ps suspensions were prepared with synthetic wastewater and then ultrasonicated at 250w and 40 khz for 20 min at 25 c prior to use as shown in fig s1 the monomer suspension of 100 nm ps nps in wastewater was detected by dynamic light scattering dls zen1600 malvern instruments malvern uk and no obvious aggregation was observed the composition of the ps nps was determined by ftir spectroscopy fig s2 the synthetic wastewater was designed to simulate the influents of wwtps according to actual water quality of influents in jiangsu province china sun et al 2016 briefly in theory the synthetic wastewater contained 200 mg l cod 30 mg l total nitrogen tn 20 mg l

collection the pilot scale vertical flow constructed wetlands vfcw were set up in the laboratory of southeast university in nanjing china the dimension of them was 0 20m 0 65m diameter height and pore volume was 5l the height of sand layer was 0 25m planted with iris pseudacorus i pseudacorus and the sectional view was shown in fig s3 three types of cws were established in our study the control without ps nps exposure vf1 with 1 mg l ps nps exposure and vf10 with 10 mg l ps nps exposure each cw was worked in sequencing batch mode with hydraulic retention time hrt of 3 days and the hydraulic load was 0 053 m d the synthetic wastewater evenly entered into the cws from the top within 15 min and discharged from the bottom within 15 min after approximately six months of preculture stable and high removal efficiencies of nutrients were obtained in fig 1 then wastewater containing ps nps was fed into cws to thoroughly study the influence of ps nps on the nitrogen transformation the entire formal experiment period was divided into period i 1 33 d period ii 34 66 d and period iii 67 99 d experiments all the effluent was collected and settled for 20 min for the detection of tn nh 4 n no 3 n and no 2 n at each hrt after ultrasonic dispersion 500 ml effluent was used for determining the ps nps concentration at the end of each period approximately 10 g sand was collected from the middle 10 20 cm of sand layer every three batches to conduct enzyme activities of n transformation electron transfer system activity and soil catalase scat activity assays furthermore antioxidant enzyme activities of the macrophytes superoxide dismutase sod catalase cat and peroxidase pod and malondialdehyde mda level were measured every three batches in the period i and period iii after the entire experiment 60 g sand was collected from three different sampling points in the middle sand layer conducted the real time qpcr and then mixed to conduct metagenomic and scanning electron microscope analysis 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 fate of ps nps and water quality determination analysis to determine the fate of ps nps in cws the effluent of cws were digested and examined by the method of triton x 45 tx 45 based cloud point extraction combined with py gc ms as mentioned in the previous study zhou et al 2019 the details of this method are described in text s1 and the standard curves for each test are shown in fig s4 to investigate ps nps adsorbed onto the biofilm of sand approximately 10 g sand was sampled after exposure experiment for scanning electron microscopy observation the water quality of each batch was analyzed including tn nh 4 n no 3 n and no 2 n according to the standard methods apha 2005 2 3 2 key enzyme activities of n transformation and electron transport system activity analysis to determine the effect of ps nps on n transformation at the protein level key enzyme activities of n transformation urease ure ammonia monooxygenase amo hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao nitrite oxidoreductase nxr nitrate reductase nar and nitrite reductase nir and electron transport system activity were measured at intervals and the procedure is described in text s2 2 3 3 antioxidant enzyme activities and lipid peroxidation analysis to investigate the influence of ps nps on antioxidant enzyme activities and oxidative damage the cat pod sod activities as well as the mda level of i pseudacorus and scat were measured at intervals as for plants a total of 0 1 g of fresh leaf segments from the same height of three macrophytes in the same cws were sampled and the details of measurement procedure are described in text s3 in addition scat activity was measured by scat kit nanjing jiancheng technology co china 2 3 4 metagenomic analysis 2 3 4 1 metagenome dna extraction and shotgun sequencing metagenome dna and shotgun sequencing total microbial genomic dna samples were extracted using the dneasy powersoil kit qiagen inc netherlands following the manufacturer s instructions and stored at 20 c prior to further assessment the quantity and quality of extracted dnas were detected by a nanodrop nd 1000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa and agarose gel electrophoresis respectively the extracted microbial dna was used for constructing metagenome shotgun sequencing libraries with insert sizes of 400 bp by using illumina truseq nano dna lt library preparation kit each library was sequenced by illumina hiseq x ten platform illumina usa with pe150 strategy 2 3 4 2 sequence analysis sequencing adapters were removed from sequencing reads using cutadapt v1 2 1 and then the procedural details from low quality reads to obtaining non redundant gene catalog are provided in text s4 the functional profiles of the non redundant genes were obtained by annotated against kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg databases by using diamond alignment algorithm buchfink et al 2015 the genes related to n transformation metabolism and antioxidant enzymes were identified by searching ko numbers in functional annotation results to perform quantitative comparative analysis relative abundances ras of genes were evaluated by a normalization strategy to normalize for gene length and sequencing depth salmon v1 1 0 castro et al 2021 shi et al 2020 and the specific calculation method is described in text s5 2 3 5 qpcr analysis to verify the metagenomics results the real time qpcr was performed on sand samples as the same batch of metagenomic sequencing these sand samples were collected from three different sampling points in each reactor the measured method refers to our previous study huang et al 2019 a list of the primers of the represented genes were shown in the table s2 the observed results were effective based on correlation coefficient of standard curve r 2 range from 0 9962 to 0 9981 the values were expressed as gene copies per gram sand 2 4 statistical analysis the statistically significant changes in nitrogen removal efficiencies effluent concentrations and qpcr results between reactors were analyzed by a one way analysis of variance anova with the lsd post hoc test spss 23 0 then to easily compare the nitrogen removal efficiencies and enzyme activities between the exposed groups and the control the results of the exposed groups were represented as a percentage compared with the corresponding control the significant changes of enzyme activities between results were determined by anova with a bootstrap method 95 bootstrap confidence intervals sample sizes n 1000 by python v3 8 5 the corresponding code was shown in text s6 the paired samples t test spss 23 0 was used to analyze the overall variation in the ras of genes statistically significant differential ras of one specific gene between two samples were analyzed by fisher s exact test stamp v2 1 3 furthermore an ordination was calculated to visualize differences in the n transformation enzyme activities among cws using 2 dimensional nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds plots generated using 250 iterations or reached the lowest 2d stress bray curtis distance metrics was used for nmds with monomds in the vegan package in r then a multivariant analysis of the similarity between enzyme activities was performed using anosim in the vegan package with bray curtis dissimilarity values the structure equation modeling was performed using amos 21 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 fate of ps nps in cws although microplastics have been detected in a variety of wwtps sun et al 2019 the fate of nanoplastics has not been explored especially in cws in this study a method of cloud point extraction combined with py gc ms was used to investigate the fate of ps nps in cws at the end of each period as shown in fig 2 with the influent of 1 mg l the effluent concentrations of ps nps in each period were measured as 12 78 1 50 ug l 21 28 1 37 ug l and 24 05 4 81 ug l respectively with the average removal efficiencies of 98 72 97 87 and 97 60 respectively meanwhile with the influent of 10 mg l the effluent concentrations of ps nps in each period were 25 65 3 14 ug l 70 39 1 87 ug l and 166 97 9 54 ug l respectively with the average removal efficiencies of 99 74 99 30 and 98 33 respectively the removal efficiencies of ps nps continuously decreased along the exposure time but more than 97 ps nps could retain and accumulate in the cws although there have not been other studies focused on the removal of nanoplastics in cws it has been reported that cws had an effective removal capacity of metal and non metallic nps huang et al 2017 schierz et al 2014 with removal efficiencies more than 90 the scanning electron microscope images fig s5 further proved that numerous nps adhered on the biofilm of sand which might negatively influence the growth and vitality of microbial cells wang and chen 2016 thus probably affecting nitrogen transformation in cws and the specific impact was described as follows 3 2 impact of ps nps on nitrogen removal performance as shown in fig 1 in the period of preculture the differences in the nitrogen removal performance between cws were reached steady state after exposure to ps nps the average tn effluent concentrations of vf1 and vf10 increased by 7 10 and 7 41 in the period i 4 86 and 6 06 in the period ii 4 11 and 3 72 in the period iii respectively compared with the control reactor p 0 05 fig s6 furthermore the most significant differences of effluent concentrations of exposed cws increased by 13 68 in vf1 and 15 12 in vf10 compared with the control were exhibited in the period i these indicated that both exposure concentrations of ps nps caused a certain degree of suppression in nitrogen removal especially in the relatively short term of the exposure experiment however it should be noted that the variations of less than 5 in the latter periods might be caused by the reactor to reactor differences in cws organic nitrogen is ammonified to nh 4 n then oxidized to no 2 n and no 3 n by nitrification process subsequently and ultimately reduced to n2 by denitrification process in fig 1 1 mg l ps nps had no obvious effects on nh 4 n transformation compared with the control throughout the whole experiment p 0 05 however under 10 mg l ps nps exposure the average nh 4 n removal efficiencies in each period decreased by 6 29 4 36 and 2 90 respectively and the average nh 4 n effluent concentrations increased by 7 35 4 43 and 2 58 respectively p 0 05 compared with control the most significant difference of effluent concentrations of vf10 increased by 13 36 was exhibited in the period i these demonstrated that 10 mg l ps nps caused acute inhibition of nh 4 n removal and also probably led to relatively long term suppression as for no 3 n and no 2 n 1 mg l ps nps suppressed no 3 n removal in each period by 6 21 9 84 and 11 65 respectively in comparison with the control 96 50 96 34 and 97 74 respectively p 0 05 the average no 3 n effluent concentrations under the 1 mg l exposure in each period 0 73 mg l 1 03 mg l and 1 07 mg l respectively were higher than those in the control 0 27 mg l 0 29 mg l and 0 18 mg l respectively p 0 05 and 1 mg l ps nps exposure caused the accumulations of no 2 n especially in a relatively short exposure fig 1 and fig s6 the results indicated that 1 mg l ps nps inhibited the denitrification process however 10 mg l ps nps exposure did not seem to cause significant accumulation of no 3 n and no 2 n which might be due to the inhibition of ammonia oxidation process thereby inhibiting the formation of no 2 n the specific explanation was further revealed based on the enzyme activity and metagenomic analysis of n transformation in the next section 3 3 impact of ps nps on key enzyme activities of n transformation and electron transport system activity the activities of key enzymes involved in ammonification nitrification and denitrification were measured throughout the entire experiment including urease ure ec 3 5 1 5 ammonia monooxygenase amo ec 1 14 99 39 hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao ec 1 7 2 6 nitrite oxidoreductase nxr ec 1 7 99 nitrate reductase nar ec 1 7 5 1 and nitrite reductase nir ec 1 7 2 1 as shown in fig 3 based on the above mentioned enzyme activities 2 dimensional nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds plots according to bray curtis dissimilarities was calculated an ordination to visualize any differences among the enzyme activities of the control vf1 and vf10 nmds plots illustrated that the enzyme activities exposed to any concentrations of ps nps were significantly different anosim r 0 207 0 p 0 05 which indicated that ps nps have significant impact on overall enzymes of n transformation specifically for ammonification the activity of ure catalyzing hydrolysis from organic nitrogen to inorganic nitrogen was quantified in fig 4 1 and 10 mg l ps nps caused severe inhibition of ure activities in the period ii 82 19 and 73 54 and the period iii 74 12 and 65 68 in comparison with the control p 0 05 respectively as for nitrification fig 5a amo catalyzes oxidation of nh 4 n to hydroxylamine n h 2 oh and hao catalyzes oxidation of n h 2 oh to no 2 n which was regarded as the ammonia oxidation process van kessel et al 2015 nxr is responsible for nitrite oxidation process catalyzing oxidation of no 2 n to no 3 n kuypers et al 2018 as illustrated in fig 4 1 mg l ps nps exposure had no significant influence on nitrifying enzymes throughout the entire experiment p 0 05 nevertheless 10 mg l ps nps exposure significantly restrained these enzyme activities especially amo and nxr compared with the control amo activities in each period significantly decreased to 80 90 75 01 and 74 55 respectively and nxr activities decreased to 63 61 61 95 and 80 60 respectively p 0 05 these results demonstrated that high concentration had negatively effects on nitrification which was consistent with the decline of nh 4 n removal efficiencies with respect to the denitrification fig 5b nar and nir catalyze reduction of no 3 n to no via consuming electrons from electron transfer systems as shown in fig 4 both 1 mg l and 10 mg l ps nps had significantly inhibitory effects on the activities of nar and nir during the whole experiment concretely nar activities in vf1 and vf10 decreased to 82 77 and 75 59 in the period i 68 82 and 65 51 in the period iii respectively p 0 05 the nir activities in vf1 and vf10 decreased to 65 32 and 57 59 69 97 and 54 84 77 98 and 69 74 in each period respectively p 0 05 these results indicated that both concentrations had negative effects on denitrifying enzymes thus affecting the denitrification process furthermore to further reveal the effects of nitrogen transformation under 10 mg l ps nps exposure the structure equation modeling was established based on the enzyme activities of n transformation and effluent concentrations of nh 4 n no 3 n and no 2 n in cws fig s7 it illustrated that amo activity had an obvious negative direct effect on nh 4 n effluent concentration p 0 05 which confirmed that the inhibition of amo activity would lead to the decrease of nh 4 n removal under exposure of ps nps in addition nh 4 n effluent concentration had a negative direct effect on no 2 n concentration which further confirmed that the accumulation of nh 4 n caused by inhibition of ammonia oxidation process led to almost no variation of no 2 n concentration in addition previous studies have confirmed that the crucial role of electron transport system activity etsa on denitrification and the decrease of etsa led to the inhibition of denitrification liu et al 2020 in fig 4 1 mg l and 10 mg l ps nps exposure caused the significant decrease of etsa especially at 10 mg l it indicated that ps nps remarkably inhibited the electron transport system thereby bringing negative influence on denitrification process in cws 3 4 impact of ps nps on n transformation metabolism to comprehensively investigate n transformation metabolism pathways in vf10 and the control metagenomic analysis which can provide a detailed classification and quantification of the metabolic processes was conducted fig 5 then seven representative genes were subjected to qpcr for verification of the metagenomics results the results of qpcr were shown in table s3 and fig s8 the fold changes of relative abundances ras by metagenomics positively linear correlated with the fold changes of gene copies by qpcr person s r 0 921 r 2 0 848 p 0 003 confirming that the ras of genes as assayed using metagenomics were reliable the ras of genes were considered significantly different between control and vf10 as the fold changes of relative abundances fc narg and p 0 05 the details for setting fc narg were described in text s7 3 4 1 impact of ps nps on metabolism pathways of nitrification the functional genes of nitrification including ammonia oxidation amoabc hao nitrite oxidation nxrab and complex iv coxabcd cyoabcd were quantified as shown in fig 5a under 10 mg l ps nps exposure the ras of nearly all related genes mentioned above declined except for amoa and coxd specifically 10 mg l ps nps significantly decreased amoc and hao abundance by nearly 50 and 60 compared with the control fold change amoc 0 51 fold change hao 0 66 p 0 05 the absolute abundance of hao was confirmed to be suppressed significantly by qpcr p 0 05 it indicated that ammonia oxidation metabolism was disrupted under ps nps stress for nitrite oxidation the ra of nxra encoding nxr was significantly inhibited in comparison with the control fold change 0 86 p 0 05 in addition complex iv cytochrome c oxidase ec 7 1 1 9 a terminal oxidase is also a key enzyme for ammonia oxidation and nitrite oxidation processes which transfers electrons to oxygen and generates proton motive force ultimately driving atp synthesis henning et al 1995 the ras of genes encoding complex iv were suppressed as a whole by 10 mg l ps nps paired samples t test p 0 05 therein 10 mg l ps nps significantly decreased ras of cyo abc by nearly 40 all fold changes fc narg p 0 05 and inhibited coxa by 16 8 fold change 0 83 p 0 05 furthermore a paired samples t test showed that ps nps significantly decreased the ras of genes related to ammonia oxidation amoabc hao coxabcd cyoabcd at the level of 0 1 p 0 096 and genes related to nitrite oxidation nxrab coxabcd cyoabcd at the level of 0 05 p 0 036 these results further indicated that ps nps reduced the abundance of key genes involved in ammonia oxidation and nitrite oxidation process thus could negatively affect the nitrification which was consistent with the inhibition of enzyme activities 3 4 2 impact of ps nps on metabolism pathways of denitrification the biochemical metabolism related to denitrification was divided into three steps namely the electron production process electron transport process and electron consumption process liu et al 2020 the ras of the genes related to these biochemical processes were shown in fig 5b 3 4 2 3 impact of ps nps on electron production process since glucose was the main carbon source in cws in our study the electron donor and atp mainly produced by glycolysis and tca cycle in carbon source metabolism as shown in fig 5b during the first stage of glycolysis although paired samples t test showed no significant difference between ras of genes in vf10 and the control p 0 05 five related genes glk pgi1 tal pgi pgi pmi and pfkc in vf10 were inhibited significantly compared with the control all fold changes fc narg p 0 05 therein as a pivotal gene certified in previous studies berks et al 1995 glk encodes glucokinase gk ec 2 7 1 2 catalyzing the first step in glycolysis metabolism glucose to glucose 6 phosphate ps nps significantly decreased the ra of glk by 14 5 fold change 0 85 p 0 05 it might directly impact the subsequent glycolysis process thus negatively affecting electron production process liu et al 2020 with respect to the next stage of glycolysis ps nps reduced six of nine related gene abundances and especially reduced the abundance of three genes gap2 gpml and pyk all fold changes fc narg p 0 05 therein pyk encodes pyruvate kinase pk ec 2 7 1 40 catalyzing the last step in glycolysis phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate which could produce atp though substrate level phosphorylation mazurek 2011 in addition pyruvate is a connection between glycolysis and tca cycle in microbial metabolism thus significant reduction in the abundance of pyk might negatively affect atp production and subsequent tca cycle as for tca cycle 10 mg l ps nps caused significant decrease of related gene abundances paired samples t test p 0 05 and therein seven related genes e g idh1 sucd sdhd etc were significantly suppressed all fold changes fc nar p 0 05 thus 10 mg l exposure inhibited tca cycle metabolism pathway among the related genes idh1 and mdh encode isocitrate dehydrogenase idh ec 1 1 1 42 and malate dehydrogenase mdh ec 1 1 1 37 respectively which are two critical enzymes to produce nadh in tca cycle mcreynolds and kitto 1970 ramakrishnan and martin 1955 thus the decrease of mdh and significant decrease of idh1 fold change 0 85 p 0 05 might inhibit the nadh production sdhd encoding complex ii succinate dehydrogenase ec 1 3 5 1 which catalyzes succinate oxidation in tca cycle and transfers electrons to quinone pool in the membrane through flavine adenine dinucleotide fadh2 cecchini 2003 was significantly inhibited in comparison with the control fold change 0 79 p 0 05 in addition the ras of genes encoding complex ii were suppressed by 10 mg l ps nps paired samples t test p 0 05 these results revealed ps nps might affect fadh2 production in tca cycle furthermore the ra of sucd encoding the succinyl coa synthase scs ec 6 2 1 5 which catalyzes the only reaction producing atp in tca cycle though substrate level phosphorylation was significantly inhibited in comparison with the control fold change 0 83 p 0 05 thus affecting atp production kaufman 1955 as we know electron donor nadh and fadh2 and energy support atp are essential for denitrification thus the ras of genes related to electron donor 11 genes in table s4 and atp production 14 genes in table s4 in carbon source metabolism glycolysis and tca cycle were analyzed through paired samples t test the results revealed that the related genes of electron donor and atp production significantly decreased all p 0 05 it indicated that the replication of key genes for electron donor and atp production involved in carbon metabolism were inhibited under ps nps exposure thus probably negatively affecting denitrification 3 4 2 4 impact of ps nps on electron transport process entering into electron transport system via transducing from nadh in complex i and fadh2 in complex ii the electrons are transferred to complex iii via the quinones and ultimately to cytochrome c in the periplasm wan et al 2016 thus the ras of genes encoding complex i complex ii and complex iii were quantified in fig 5b 10 mg l ps nps significantly caused the reduction in abundance of these genes as a whole paired samples t test p 0 05 and the abundances of five related genes mqcra potb nuoh nuol sdhd were reduced significantly fold changes fc nar p 0 05 furthermore ps nps obviously decreased the ras of genes related to complex i at the level of 0 1 p 0 073 and genes related to complex ii p 0 05 therefore these results revealed that electron transport system might be inhibited under the exposure of ps nps 3 4 2 5 impact of ps nps on electron consumption process during the electron consumption process fig 5b the ras of nearly all related genes declined under ps nps stress except for nirk furthermore the ras of genes involved in denitrification were suppressed paired samples t test p 0 05 concretely narghi and napabc respectively encode membrane bound nar and periplasmic nap dissimilatory nitrate reductases catalyzing reduction of no 3 n to no 2 n therein the abundance of narg and napc decreased significantly fold change narg 0 856 fold change napc 0 80 p 0 05 demonstrating that the transformation from no 3 n to no 2 n was blocked which was consistent with the results of enzymology the ra of nosz encoding nitrous oxide reductase nos for reduction of no to n2 were significantly inhibited as well fold change 0 82 p 0 05 the absolute abundances of narg and nosz was also confirmed to be significantly suppressed by qpcr p 0 05 therefore ps nps restrained the electron consumption within denitrification process by declining key gene abundances 3 5 impact of ps nps on antioxidant systems to comprehensively study the toxicity mechanism of nanoplastics on nitrogen transformation in cws the effects of nanoplastics on antioxidant systems of macrophytes and microorganisms were analyzed through the key antioxidant enzymes and the ras of genes encoding related antioxidant enzymes as for macrophytes malondialdehyde mda is the secondary peroxidation product of lipid peroxidation caused by oxidative damage and could be an indicator of ros sun et al 2020 as shown in fig s9 1 mg l and 10 mg l ps nps significantly increased the mda content along the exposure time in addition superoxide dismutase sod catalase cat and peroxidase pod are three of the best characterized ros defense mechanisms in plants sod can catalyze the dismutation of superoxide into hydrogen peroxide and oxygen and cat and pod can scavenge hydrogen peroxide johnson and hug 2019 in the period i the activities of these antioxidative enzymes increased especially at high concentration p 0 05 a sudden increase of ros could activate a set of protecting enzyme activities to maintain a redox balance imlay 2019 after a relatively long period of exposure 10 mg l ps nps significantly decreased sod and cat activities by nearly 20 compared with the control p 0 05 the reason might be excessive accumulation of ros surpassed the scavenging capacity or negatively influenced the synthesis of related protein hu et al 2018 these results indicated that ps nps could bring negative influence on antioxidant systems of macrophytes with respect to microorganisms in cws soil catalase scat can also convert hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water similar to the response of the antioxidant enzymes in plants scat activities were firstly induced and then inhibited under ps nps exposure p 0 05 fig s10 the results revealed that the antioxidant system in cws could be negatively affected due to excess nanoplastic induced ros excess ros can lead to deterioration of enzyme activities and abundances and suppress the electron transport thus inhibiting n transformation imlay 2003 in order to investigate the influence of antioxidant system on nitrogen removal under ps nps exposure the structure equation modeling was established based on the activities of antioxidant enzymes sod cat and scat nitrifying enzymes amo nxr denitrifying enzymes nar nir and tn effluent concentrations of vf1 and vf10 fig 6 showed that activities of sod cat and scat had obvious direct effects on nitrification process p 0 05 which further affecting the tn removal in addition cat and scat significantly influenced the denitrification process as well p 0 05 it revealed that antioxidant system variation caused by excess nanoplastic induced ros could directly affect nitrogen removal in table 1 fifteen antioxidative enzymes and their corresponding encoding genes were summarized referring to previous studies insel et al 2014 johnson and hug 2019 according to the kegg classification system the antioxidative enzymes were divided into seven classifications catalase peroxidase peroxiredoxin superoxide dismutase superoxide reductase glutaredoxins and thioredoxins after exposed to 10 mg l ps nps the ras of nearly all related genes encoding the enzymes mentioned above were significantly induced with 1 17 1 60 folds of the control p 0 05 furthermore paired samples t test indicated that the ras of genes involving in the antioxidative system were induced p 0 05 the reason could be that the replication of these genes involved in antioxidative system are activated responding to excess ros imlay 2019 these findings based on protein and gene level confirmed that excess ros and variations of antioxidant systems induced by ps nps might be one of the key toxicity mechanisms resulted in the deteriorative performances of nitrogen removal in cws this result raised a key question why ps nps produce excess ros the natural source of ros is environmental and endogenous imlay 2019 trachootham et al 2008 as for environmentally producing ros persistent environmental free radicals could be generated on ps under sunlight which transfer electrons to h2o o2 and induce a large amount of ros generation zhu et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 and peroxy radicals could be generated by ps under sunlight as well kiatkamjornwong et al 1999 with the respect to endogenous ros the main source was found to be the respiratory chain if oxygen collides with a reduced flavin in complex i and complex ii before transferring the electrons to next carrier the electron can hop from nadh fadh2 onto oxygen and produce ros thus the amount of ros production directly depends on the frequency of collisions with oxygen imlay 2003 in this study the significant inhibition of the ras of genes encoding complex i and complex ii p 0 05 led to a greater frequency of colliding with oxygen fig 5b thus producing more ros 3 6 environmental significance ps nps exposure caused a certain degree of inhibition in nitrogen transformation throughout the entire experiment meantime ps nps showed negative effects on the key enzyme activities and the ras of genes related to n transformation metabolism furthermore ps nps could negatively influence other microbe driven metabolism in cws such as carbon metabolism wetlands are termed nature s kidneys since they play inherent natural functions in improving water quality and maintaining regional ecological balance kennedy and mayer 2002 therefore excessive accumulation of nanoplastics could lead to the eutrophication of receiving waters from cws negatively influence the land water ecosystem and destroy the geochemical balance of multiple biogenic elements i e nitrogen carbon cycle therefore in addition to cws the negative impact of micro nanoplastics on the global geochemical nitrogen and carbon cycles should be given greater attention 4 conclusions in this study 1 and 10 mg l ps nps caused a certain degree of suppression in tn removal especially in the relatively short term of the exposure experiment p 0 05 in addition 1 mg l ps nps had negative effects on the key denitrifying enzyme activities and etsa while 10 mg l ps nps not only suppressed enzymes involved in denitrification and etsa but also had adverse effects on nitrifying enzymes ps nps reduced the ras of genes involved in nitrogen transformation including nitrification and denitrification biochemical metabolisms electron production process electron transport process and electron consumption process through metagenomic analysis the accumulation and retention of ps nps in the biofilm of cws might be the reason for the influence on n transformation a potential toxicity mechanism assessment revealed that negative effects on nitrogen transformation mainly attributed to antioxidant system variation caused by nanoplastic induced ros declaration of competing
