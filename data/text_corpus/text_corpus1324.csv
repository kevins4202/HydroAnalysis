6620,there has been increasing emphasis by scholars in trying to understand how neighbors influence farmers decision making in australia historically there has always been strong anecdotal evidence of peer pressure on irrigators decisions to not sell permanent water entitlements this local pressure increased with the advent of the federal government into the murray darling basin water market to purchase permanent water for the environment from voluntary sellers from 2008 onwards selling permanent water entitlements is associated with perceptions about rural community decline this article formally tests whether a neighborhood effect can be detected in permanent water entitlement selling decisions using farm survey data across a number of years from the southern murray darling basin n 1462 we hypothesize that the more that an irrigator s neighbors sell permanant water in a given area the more likely that an individual irrigator will also sell permanant water given a decrease in social pressure irrigators locations were geocoded and locational characteristics regional socio economic characteristics land and water quality were linked to the survey data covering farm farmer and water trade characteristics there was significant evidence of a farmer neighborhood effect with higher likelihood of permanent water sales occurring in areas where more neighbors had sold permanent water holding other locational and spatial influences constant keywords water entitlement trading water markets farmers murray darling basin neighborhood effect 1 introduction water scarcity is a severe problem globally long term low water availability environmental problems water over allocation issues and predicted increased rainfall variability have prompted a series of water policy changes around the world many countries have introduced economic instruments to deal with water scarcity problems e g gomez et al 2017 rey et al 2018 and are considering implementing water markets in the future wheeler et al 2017b australia s murray darling basin mdb provides a classic example of the potential outcomes from water market adoption in the mdb several institutional changes were initiated from the 1990s onwards to facilitate water trading and the reallocation from consumptive water uses to environmental needs e g crase et al 2004 water trading is increasingly becoming an important farm management tool for irrigators to adapt to variable water resources and other changes wheeler 2014 in australia s water markets water trading takes commonly place with water entitlements i e ongoing right to exclusive access to a share of water and known otherwise as permanent water or water allocations i e specific volume of water allocated to water access entitlements in a given season and known otherwise as temporary water coag 2004 water entitlements also have different security levels 1 the security type describes the probability of the water being fully available in a given year high security hs water entitlements provide a highly reliable water supply usually full allocation 90 95 years out of 100 low and general security ls gs water entitlements provide a variable uncertain water supply 1 towards the end of the millennium drought 2001 02 2009 10 the federal government allocated aud 3 1 billion usd 2 4 billion 2018 exchange rate towards a water buyback program to buy water entitlements from willing irrigators and return water to the environment and aud 5 8 billion towards sustainable rural water use and irrigation infrastructure srwui projects dewha 2010 the water buyback program was the government s principal market based instrument deployed to produce water for environmental benefits in deteriorated sites in other words water previously allocated for consumptive uses is reallocated back to the environment to improve environmental outcomes 2 the buyback program was carried out as a multistage tendering system i e the government announces the funding for the tender round in a specific region and irrigators interested in selling submit a non binding expression of interest specifying the desired price the government assessed the offers according to several criteria such as the price the capacity to deliver the water to targeted environmental assets the priority of these assets and their water requirements 2 water buyback programs have also been implemented in a number of other countries such as the usa e g isé and sunding 1998 and spain e g calatrava and martínez granados 2018 recent changes in the australian policy environment have shifted the focus to recovering environmental water predominantly from infrastructure modernization projects and ending further water buybacks grafton and wheeler 2018 while this change is the slightly preferred option for many farmers and rural communities albeit many still would like buyback programs loch et al 2014 it is not cost effective in recovering environmental water as compared to the buyback program and may not meet long term sustainability aims of being able to flexibly respond to an uncertain and variable future climate furthermore infrastructure modernization may increase consumptive water usage and conversion to permanent agriculture and reduce return flows e g adamson and loch 2014 berbel et al 2015 crase and o keefe 2009 grafton et al 2018 wittwer and dixon 2013 loch and adamson 2015 there have been a variety of questions raised about why irrigators might sell their water and the corresponding regional impact environmental programs such as the water buyback program have been shown to be important adaptation strategies for irrigators to reduce debt during a drought grafton and wheeler 2018 considering the likelihood of future droughts understanding the determinants of irrigators participating in the water buyback program and in water markets in general and understanding what consequences this program might have is important for the overall success of future environmental programs a range of studies have analyzed the determinants of irrigators water trading decision making in australia and other countries isé and sunding 1998 and wheeler et al 2012 studied irrigators determinants to sell water entitlements to the government in the us and australia a key finding was that irrigators were likely to sell their water out of last resort circumstances i e debt death and divorce or for strategic reasons e g following farm investment plans other studies concluded that water entitlement trading is more likely to be based on long term considerations largely relating to farm characteristics e g bjornlund 2006 wheeler et al 2010 as compared to water allocation trading which is associated with short term considerations in response to seasonal fluctuations of prices or water availability e g loch et al 2012 giannoccaro et al 2016 zuo et al 2014 loch et al 2018 considered the impact of transaction costs on water markets in the southern mdb although most studies acknowledge that irrigators water entitlement trading behavior can be complex different across regions and dependent on a wide range of different factors none of the studies to date have considered the effect of neighbors decisions and other potential locational influences this is important as in australia anecdotal evidence suggests there is considerable social pressure on irrigators to not sell permanent water entitlements out of their area e g fenton 2006 over time research into farmers decision making has been influenced by various different disciplines e g economics sociology psychology and geography as well as their sub disciplines the impact of neighborhood effects on farmers choices is an increasingly assessed determinant in the empirical agricultural economics literature neighborhood effects may arise through information exchange or the influence of social norms holloway and lapar 2007 evidence for neighborhood effects have been shown in a number of areas such as technology adoption e g case 1992 weber 2012 pesticide use e g aida 2017 organic farming e g schmidtner et al 2012 various land use crop choices e g holloway et al 2002 yamano et al 2018 and farmland abandonment gellrich et al 2007 another set of the literature has increasingly focused on highlighting the importance of place and space on farmers decision making showing the relevance of other locational factors such as population density and distance to roads markets e g wu et al 2011 this article combines unique datasets of farm level survey data and a range of locational information to seek to answer whether irrigators water entitlement selling behavior is affected by 1 their neighbors water entitlement trading behavior and 2 various locational regional factors for example distance to cities and greater resource scarcity and deterioration in particular we hypothesize that the more neighbors in the irrigator s local area sell water entitlements the more likely that an irrigator will sell water entitlements as it is more socially acceptable holding everything else constant findings may contribute to a greater understanding of water trading adoption policies in other countries and to help refine current water policies in australia such as the basin wide consequences of subsidies for irrigation infrastructure upgrades e g grafton et al 2018 or future drought policies in australia e g zuo et al 2015 2 conceptual background neighborhood effects in water trading decision making the motivation for investigating a neighborhood effect amongst irrigators arose from anecdotal evidence in the mdb that showed severe social pressure from other farmers and the rural community on irrigators considering selling permanent water entitlements from their area e g irrigators were ostracized from the local pub e g fenton 2006 after water markets were formally introduced in the mdb irrigators initially showed concerns and distrust regarding water trading over time many irrigators started to perceive water trading as an important farm management tool wheeler 2014 social pressure on selling started to disappear for selling temporary water but the social pressure on selling permanent water entitlements continued and the uptake of water entitlement trading in general was slow because of the long term nature of this water right and the historical attachment to irrigators land in addition this local pressure increased with the advent of the government into the mdb water market to purchase water for the environment from 2008 onwards hence there has always been a strong influence of social norms pressure in the mdb that may lead to significant neighborhood effects influencing water selling the reasons for this social pressure and irrigators concerns about water sales are manifold often outward water trading is thought to be associated with reduced agricultural production economic activity and employment in some regions there are fears that permanent water entitlement sales which may lead to farm exits may threaten the viability of the local farming community and lead to increased infrastructure costs for remaining irrigators the impact of water reforms and water trading on rural communities is widely discussed in the literature e g alston and whittenbury 2014 wheeler et al 2014 although both theoretical and applied studies have found very little change in irrigation returns from reductions in water diversions connor et al 2014 kirby et al 2014 nwc 2012 furthermore it was shown that the government s water entitlement purchases resulted in reduced farm debt levels and many irrigators have used the proceeds from water sales to stay in business and improve on farm efficiency or prepare for retirement and did not terminate their water delivery rights e g wheeler and cheesman 2013 the broader farmer adoption literature confirms the impact of social pressure amongst farmers similar responses to changes in farming communities were found e g in the case of adopting technologies e g lynne 1995 or other conservation strategies e g ducros and watson 2002 social norms can cause social pressure which may ultimately prevent farmers to act according to their preferences burton 2004 in rural farming communities there is often a tendency to conform to behavioral norms which can affect farmers decision making e g platteau 2000 the utility derived from social conformity may direct farmers decision as much as or even more than profit considerations e g akerlof 1980 moser and barrett 2006 detecting social neighborhood effects is complex since there are three different types of social influences i e endogenous correlated and contextual influences manski 1993 and information diffusion is affected by certain characteristics of the local social structure i e group homogeneity participatory norms and leadership heterogeneity rogers 2003 thus an analysis of neighborhood effects from observed behavioral data needs to be taken cautiously a neighborhood effect on an adoption decision is also commonly explained with the theory of agglomeration economies particularly in studies investigating the adoption of organic farming and farm technologies in this case the clustering of farmers with similar practices or technologies provide several production advantages and thereby promote further adoption e g wollni and andersson 2014 however in the case of water trading adoption other reasons such as exchanging experience information and thereby making it socially acceptable are more likely to be relevant furthermore transaction cost theory can be related to a neighborhood adoption problem in water trading since transaction costs e g time spent on monitoring water market activity may decrease as water trading adoption increases loch et al 2018 water trading behavior research can learn from the broader adoption literature since water trading can be categorized as an adoption or adaptation strategy depending on the motives or forces behind the decision to trade water the literature on water trading behavior is evolving but so far has been focused on farm and farmers socio economic characteristics excluding potential social influences on irrigators water trading decision making behavior but as tisdell et al 2001 p iii concluded knowledge and understanding of the actions of other irrigators is generally strong among traders but weak among those water users who do not trade also wheeler et al 2017a found that peer influence was present within the southern mdb irrigation communities many irrigators said they cared about what other farmers thought furthermore tang et al 2016 showed that irrigators who are more connected to peers neighbors and other community stakeholders are more aware of water scarcity than those with less connections accordingly we seek to test the following hypothesis an increase in the number of irrigators who have sold water entitlements to the government in a community area is associated with an increased likelihood of an individual s water entitlement selling decision by making it more socially acceptable referred to as the neighborhood effect 3 data and methods 3 1 survey data and study area two datasets of irrigator surveys in the southern mdb includes irrigation districts in southern new south wales nsw northern victoria vic and south australia sa were used in this article n 1462 the mdb is australia s largest agricultural production area see fig 1 the southern mdb was selected as a case study as it is hydrologically linked and water markets have been formally in operation since the 1990s the irrigator surveys were conducted in 2010 11 3 the 2010 11 survey was conducted via telephone through computer assisted interviewing techniques 30 response rate or 37 including those who agreed to be surveyed at a later date but ended up not included as sample sizes were met and randomly selecting survey participants from farming lists wheeler et al 2012 3 n 931 and 2011 12 4 the 2011 12 mail out survey contacted the same list of irrigators from the 2010 11 survey as a follow up survey 63 response rate after removing those who had left farming comparisons were made of the survey results with other regional census and agricultural datasets e g from the australian bureau of statistics which confirmed that there seemed to be no non response bias and that the survey results were highly representative for the southern mdb e g zuo et al 2015 4 n 531 and collected farmer farm and water trading information for the previous farming seasons 2009 10 and 2010 11 respectively in each farming season approximately 10 of the irrigators surveyed sold water entitlements to the government there were very few sales to the government prior to our surveys which would influence our neighborhood analysis there was only small volumes of water sold at the start of the buyback program in 2008 relevant variables from the surveys are described in table 1 and were selected based on previous water entitlement trading behavior research to control for all potential influences wheeler et al 2012 irrigators address data was geocoded in a geographic information system gis using arcgis see fig 2 for irrigators locations address input and address reference data often lack in completeness and accuracy especially for rural areas which can cause geocoding errors or low geocoding accuracy levels i e locations are geocoded only at the postcode or street level without street number because of missing or incorrect information it also needs to be considered that in some cases the farm postal addresses may not exactly represent the location of the farm production area e g where farmland is dispersed over a large area 5 studies on farmland fragmentation in australia are rare and dated it was shown that the mean distances between homestead parcels and detached parcels ranged 12 50km depending on the area hill and smith 1977 5 or the farm homestead is not connected to the farm production hence not all farm locations from the surveys are exactly represented in gis and subsequent gis analysis must be undertaken with care furthermore this analysis incorporates additional locations of water entitlement sellers supplied by the department of the environment and energy doee this database provides a census of all water entitlement sellers to the water buyback program as at 2012 we incorporated the locations of those who had sold water entitlements to the government prior to 2011 and who had not participated in the above described surveys specifically for analyzing a neighborhood effect thus this data is only reflected in the neighborhood variable in our model analysis to provide for a more accurate representation of the irrigators neighborhoods and the neighbors selling decisions 3 2 spatial data and units 3 2 1 neighborhood variable size analyzing a potential neighborhood effect is a heterogeneous and complex aspect of farmers decision making holloway and lapar 2007 farmers neighborhood areas can be defined in various ways e g based on distances k nearest neighbors or defined zones exact information on the neighborhood size is typically not available and there exist various determining factors e g locational socio economic and cultural factors often studies do not elaborate in detail about the potential size of the neighborhood but rather make assumptions about its possible size thus the size of the neighborhood or the spatial weight matrix in spatial regression is often arbitrary which may result in biased model estimations holloway and lapar 2007 storm et al 2015 some adoption studies claim that farmers learn from other farmers who are closest to their farm fields e g palis et al 2005 in the case of water trading it may be more complex since this is a practice that cannot be physically observed and may thus require frequent contact and discussion in a wider network studies confirm that often farmers perceive their community wider than just the immediate neighborhood sligo and massey 2007 australia s vast land resources and the size of the study area in this article 471 427 km2 may also support wider community areas because australian farmers may have long distances to neighboring farms neighborhood sizes for the southern mdb also need to account for the different spatial patterns of irrigator locations fig 2 illustrates the clustered and dispersed pattern of irrigators locations clustering particularly occurs in vic and sa when compared to nsw which is a result of the historical developments of irrigation settlements in the southern mdb a neighborhood based on a cut off distance or on k nearest neighbors is less suitable in this article because of a dispersed distribution of irrigators across the study area and partly lower geocoding accuracy in rural areas thus it can be expected that neighborhood sizes in the southern mdb differ across regions as it was similarly suggested in other studies particularly for dispersed farm locations storm et al 2015 hence this article suggests that an irrigator s wider community area which may vary according to population sizes is the most suitable form to test for neighborhood effects in water trading decision making we employed zones which can be regarded as community areas by calculating the numbers of irrigators that had sold water entitlements per statistical area level 2 sa2 fig 2 following abs 2010 community areas are captured by sa2 which were built to represent a community that interacts together socially and economically sa2 vary in sizes according to population sizes and align with state boundaries the literature similarly suggests that if there are no socio cultural factors that define different neighborhood sizes then administrative boundaries such as defined by sa2 in this article are appropriate to specify the neighborhood e g holloway and lapar 2007 3 2 2 other locational and regional information a gis database was compiled by collecting secondary spatial data covering biophysical climate and socio economic information details and descriptive statistics are provided in table 1 csiro the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organization provided the soil texture data in soil layer 1 a horizon soil data was modelled from spot observations and is presented at a spatial resolution of approximately 1 1 km the proportions of sand silt and clay are the main determinants of field texture which can be used as a measure of the soil s water holding capacity csiro 2001 zones of high dryland salinity risk or hazard were identified from nlwra 2001 groundwater salinity from a bureau of meteorology bom composite dataset 1994 2009 bom 2014 and location of cities abs 2012 and the index of relative socio economic advantage and disadvantage irsad from the socio economic indexes for areas seifa abs 2013 from the australian bureau of statistics abs the socio economic index ranks areas according to relative socio economic advantage and disadvantage based on information from the five yearly census and is built on the basis of several variables relating to income education housing employment occupation and other a high score has a relatively high incidence of advantage and a relatively low incidence of disadvantage other regional information comprised water entitlement prices doe 2016 and seasonal water allocation levels 6 seasonal water allocations closing levels indicate the percentage of an irrigator s water entitlement available for use within a farming season depending on the water availability in the specific water resource to prevent water over allocation 6 nwc 2011 according to previous water entitlement trading behavior literature permanent water entitlement trading is more likely to be based on long term considerations largely relating to farm characteristics e g financial chararacteristics farm area farm type etc also when modelling water entitlement trading time variant variables need to be lagged to reflect long term issues thus depending on data availabilities time variant variables were lagged for the previous five years seasonal water allocation levels the previous census year socio economic index seifa or the previous year water entitlement prices also to avoid any potential reverse causality the spatial statistics for the locational regional variables were generated using arcgis and combined with the relevant survey data a 30 km buffer zone around the farm locations see fig 2 was used for calculating spatial statistics on the biophysical data to account for potentially dispersed farm areas and lower geocoding accuracy for some of the farm locations 3 3 methods the decision to sell water entitlements follows a discrete choice approach in which an irrigator decides to sell water entitlements to the government if the expected utility of selling outweighs the expected utility of not selling binary probit regression models of water entitlement selling were estimated 7 we considered multilevel mixed effects probit regression models the higher level being sa2 for binary outcomes to test the robustness of the ordinary probit regression models both two level random intercept and two level random intercept and coefficients models were tested multilevel models account for grouped or clustered within one sa2 data which may be correlated because of a common group level characteristic however for the intercept model there is not significant variability between the sa2s to favor a mixed effects probit regression while the estimation of random coefficients never converged 7 greene 2003 pp 663 669 y x β ε ε n 0 1 1 y 1 i f y 0 0 i f y 0 where y is the latent dependent variable that relates to the binary variable y 1 irrigator has sold water entitlements to the government 0 otherwise x is a vector of independent variables see table 1 β is a conformable parameter vector and ε the error term probit models were estimated for the survey years separately and combined pooled cross section using a year dummy to account for aggregate changes over the period e g wooldridge 2010 the model analysis expands some of the modelling in wheeler et al 2012 by combining the two survey years adding in census information on water entitlement selling to the federal government and adding in additional neighborhood and locational information we test whether accounting for neighborhood locational effects improves the outcome of a traditional water trading behavior model using the bayesian information criterion bic furthermore volumes megaliter ml of water entitlements sold to the government were estimated using a censored tobit model limited dependent variable model greene 2003 p 764 y i x i β ε i y i 0 i f y i 0 y i y i i f y i 0 2 i 1 2 n where y is the observed response variable y is the latent uncensored and unobservable response variable and 0 is the threshold value thus in our model analysis the tobit model treats farms for which no volumes of water entitlements sold were observed as left censored observations the model for the latent response variable is similar to ordinary least squares regression where y is the latent dependent variable volumes ml log of water entitlements sold x is a vector of independent variables see table 1 β is a conformable parameter vector and ε the error term we estimated the global moran s i statistic for the discrete choice dependent variable at different radius distances 30 100 km with an interval of 5 km which indicates potential neighborhood sizes with significant spatial clustering of water entitlement sales 8 the analysis required removing irrigators that had no neighbors within the specified distance range ten irrigators were identified to have no neighbors at distances 30km 8 the different radius distances were chosen given australian farm sizes and following the literature for example läpple and kelley 2014 tested 20 50 km the results of this analysis provide further insights into the existence and potential size of a neighborhood effect in the southern mdb and allowed the identification of clusters and outliers employing anselin s local moran s i measure anselin et al 2013 results suggest that water entitlement sales were spatially clustered at 40 km z score 2 16 and 90 km z score 3 64 this confirms that a relevant neighborhood size may vary across the regions in the southern mdb with a potential neighborhood radius distance of 40 km fixed distance fig a1 in the appendix shows the density surface and fig a2 shows the distribution of local clusters and outliers of water entitlement sales both figures help to identify regions river valleys with major clusters of irrigators having sold water entitlements to the government e g in sa s riverland and in river valleys across the vic nsw border smaller clusters were detected for example in northern nsw murray most of the spatial outliers i e irrigators having sold water were significantly surrounded by irrigators having not sold water were located in nsw and in some river valleys in vic furthermore we undertook spatial diagnostics tests with different spatial weight matrix sizes inverse spatial weight matrix with different distance bands however the discussion of the results focus on the probit and tobit models which capture the neighborhood effect through a zonal variable which was identified as the most suitable neighborhood size considering the described study areas characteristics and the dataset to be analyzed e g swinton 2002 4 results the results of the probit and tobit models for selling water entitlements to the government for both survey years and individually are summarized in table 2 the models performed well according to the results of the r2 and percentage of correct prediction at least 88 models had no serious multicollinearity issues e g no variance inflation factors above five mean 1 57 and no correlation coefficients among independent variables above 0 7 or below 0 7 and were estimated with robust standard errors clustered at the irrigator level for the two year probit model model results confirm a number of relationships between the decision to sell and various independent variable characteristics from the surveys as found in wheeler et al 2012 for example results confirm associations of those that sell water entitlements with lower education levels having a whole farm plan not using government agencies as an information source owning larger volumes of water entitlements and having previous lower seasonal water allocation levels in their area seasonal water allocation levels capture the effect of water scarcity and are highly significant confirming that irrigators who had experienced greater stress in terms of less water allocation levels in the past five years were more likely to sell water entitlements 9 as a robustness check we tested the seasonal allocation variable using one year lag and same year data model test results showed that the allocation variable with one year lag was also positive significant at the 0 01 level and the allocation variable with same year data was not significant this highlights the influence of past year long term conditions on water entitlement sales 9 moreover across all models smaller farm sizes showed a strong positive relationship with water entitlement sales smaller farms may have been more likely to change land uses or exit irrigation farming in the face of drought and other pressures also carrying over lower volumes of water from the previous season prompted water entitlement sales similarly suggesting some water sales were prompted by water scarcity issues or those irrigators had been selling their water allocations annually before selling water entitlements which resulted in lower carry over water model results of the discrete choice and volumes of water entitlements sold for both years do not differ substantially showing there is no two step decision process on the other hand modelling the survey years separately discrete choice showed a few differences e g being younger lower educated and a net seller of water allocations and having a higher percentage of income from off farm work increased the likelihood of selling in 2009 10 but not in 2010 11 4 1 locational regional variables 4 1 1 neighborhood effect of most interest to this article there was statistical positive evidence of a farmer neighborhood effect on the sale of water entitlements across all models results and after controlling for a range of other independent variables particularly the regional spatial variables thus holding other influences constant irrigators in areas where more neighbors had sold more water entitlements to the government were more likely to sell their water entitlements the variable neighbors sold this may be because there was an increased social acceptance to do so as described previously selling water has always been a controversial decision for irrigators to undertake in the mdb and our results do suggest a significant positive association between the number of water entitlement sales in a community area and an irrigator s individual decision to sell their water entitlements perhaps because they felt less social pressure not to sell this result was stronger in the combined and 2009 10 discrete choice models it was potentially less important if selling was socially accepted in the community for the decision on volumes of water entitlements and whether to sell in the later year however sample sizes vary for the different models furthermore model results for the information source dummy variable government agency suggest that having used the government as a main source of information was not associated with water entitlement sales which underpins that other sources of information experience are more important for an irrigator s decision to sell water entitlements the results of the spatial diagnostics tests suggest no spatial dependency for the spatial lag and spatial error of the data after a range of independent variables have been controlled for in the models thus the explicit measurement of a neighborhood effect is sufficient without spatial econometrics techniques as suggested in the literature the influence of neighborhood social effects on farmers decision making is difficult to detect from observed behavioral data hence results of this analysis provide the foundation and motivation for future research on neighborhood effects in water trading decision making which may involve farmer experiments and qualitative methods e g manski 1993 4 1 2 effects of other locational and regional information regression modelling also showed the following relationships with other locational characteristics a consistent result for all models was the impact of distance to cities where irrigators located further away from major and smaller cities were more likely to sell their water but at a decreasing rate as shown by the squared term in other words rural areas with increasing distances to markets and other services were associated with larger volumes of water entitlement sales but only until a certain distance point approximately 100 km which is the estimated turning point of this nonlinear relationship irrigated agriculture in more rural areas can be more cost intensive and disadvantaged for example in relation to access to infrastructure markets resources and services which may lead to water entitlement selling decisions hence the water buyback scheme may have provided an important farm management tool in response to various unfavorable conditions for irrigators within a certain distance range from cities greater than 5000 people on the other hand regional socio economic classifications seifa index were not found to be associated with water entitlement selling decisions thus results suggest no evidence that rural community decline is associated with higher water entitlement sales another strong finding amongst the assessed locational variables was a positive relationship between areas more affected by dryland salinity and irrigators water selling decisions confirming results in haensch et al 2016 dryland salinity indicates a poorer resource area because of the soil s lower capacity to produce high yielding crops or inefficient unsustainable irrigation practices which in the long term may encourage land use change or irrigation farming exit resulting in water sales similarly model results showed that the closer irrigators were located to the river murray s terminus to the sea i e the closer they were to key environmental issues from low river flows in the river murray the more likely they were to sell water entitlements to the government this result corresponds to previous findings that sa and vic irrigators were more likely to sell water entitlements to the government wheeler et al 2012 finally it was tested and found using bic values that accounting for neighborhood and locational information to explain the water entitlement selling decision significantly improved the explanatory power of a traditional economic water entitlement sales model as presented in wheeler et al 2012 thus overall results suggest that future research on water entitlement trading behavior may need to account for neighborhood and other locational effects as they explain a considerable part of water entitlement selling decisions 5 discussion from a policy planning point of view it is useful to elucidate the location and size of the neighborhood effect or in other words the externality associated with convincing one farmer within an area to adopt a preferred practice case 1992 when devising market access policies to increase the regional density of market participation public spending e g extension services can be optimally planned and policy prescriptions can be more precise and effective holloway and lapar 2007 it is suggested that spatial variations of water trading decisions should be considered and policies may need to be adjusted to a spatially flexible approach targeting different purposes in different areas e g broch et al 2013 a possible neighborhood effect on water entitlement trading decision making leads to several policy implications the first policy implication relates to the adoption of water trading internationally in the developing stages of water markets when it is the aim to promote water trading it can be useful to identify community neighborhood areas or groups in which farmers are likely to interact or where there is a lack of interaction identified areas can be targeted with tailored information programs as our model results have shown farmers may not be more likely to sell water if information was primarily sourced from the government thus encouraging social capital within farming communities by organizing participatory or farmer to farmer extension services which foster communication amongst farmers may be beneficial to provide a platform for irrigators to exchange experience and information on water trading particularly in the case of selling permanent water rights policy makers need to consider the social aspect of selling water in communities and recognize that some irrigators may not adopt water trading if it is against their values in this case it may take time and more resources e g identifying and targeting community leaders to promote water trading plans and policies which engage local communities are most likely to succeed hurlimann and march 2012 in australia results of this article can be useful for future water buyback and similar environmental programs in identifying areas where irrigators are potentially more likely to sell if environmental flows are needed from that area local extension services could also be adjusted to alleviate irrigators concerns about the future of their irrigation community and infrastructure the second policy implication focusses on the impact of water selling on rural community outcomes focusing on the australian experience but has relevance for other countries the impact of water entitlement selling on the farm and the wider community is a much discussed topic studies have analyzed the on farm socio economic impacts e g wheeler and cheesman 2013 plus the flow on effects of water buybacks for irrigation communities using both theoretical models e g grafton and jiang 2011 nwc 2012 wittwer and dixon 2013 and applied data e g connor et al 2014 kirby et al 2014 to date there is an increasing divergence between peer reviewed literature finding very little impact between water entitlement selling and rural decline versus community government funded economic consultancies e g rmcg 2016 finding considerable impact wheeler et al 2018 provide a summary of the quality of the water recovery economics impact evidence and this study provides additional regional level evidence of the lack of assocation between socio economic decline and water entitlement selling but given concerns that australia s water buyback program and investments in modernizing irrigation infrastructure are likely to lead to spatial planning and prioritization problems crossman et al 2010 there is a need to consider all potential consequences for farmers and communities the mdb water buyback and infrastructure programs provide a good example of where the planning of policy programs could have been improved economists have argued that programs should have been planned consecutively by spending most of the money on buying back permanent water first and foremost and then using some of the funds to reorganize restructure irrigation districts correspondingly grafton and wheeler 2018 at the same time more funding should have been directed towards more effective structural adjustment policies within local communities the productivity commission 2018 currently shows little money has been spent and has not been targeted to the most vulnerable communities this would have made infrastructure investments more effective in the long term it would have reduced some of the negative externalities of current programs and would have also allowed a greater use of more effective structural adjustments for rural communities finally policy implications which are drawn from neighborhood and other locational influences on water trading behavior are not necessarily limited to water management areas but are closely linked to other policy areas such as the need to implement climate change adaptation policies drought land management or farm exit programs 6 conclusion the findings of this study indicate the importance of neighborhood influences and other locational information on permanent water entitlement sales to the government in australia in particular there is evidence of a neighborhood effect on the permanent water entitlement selling decisions after controlling for a range of other potential influences irrigators were more likely to sell permanent water entitlements to the government if more irrigators in their community areas had sold permanent water to the federal water buyback program after controlling for a wide variety of specific farm locational and regional characteristics this neighborhood effect shows that previous social pressure not to sell water out of the region and an early distrust of irrigators regarding the water buyback program may have been alleviated through neighbors selling decisions where it is the objective to increase adoption of water markets it can be useful to target certain community areas and groups e g organizing participatory extension services which foster the communication amongst irrigators this result is based on the analysis of observed behavioral data and provides the foundation and motivation for further research on neighborhood effects in water trading decision making furthermore irrigators location in relation to major cities was a driver of water entitlement sales decisions showing a higher likelihood of selling the further away irrigators are located from cities until a certain distance point poorer land quality was also associated with higher permanent water sales but contrary to popular arguments relating rural decline to water entitlement sales modelling results showed that areas with lower socio economic classifications were not associated with the amount of water entitlements sold this supports other key findings in the literature that buyback of water is not associated with rural decline and hence should not be used as a reason to cap or stop further buyback of permanent water in favor of infrastructure modernization programs our results highlight the need for more spatial planning in regards to public programs and how in the mdb there should have been consecutive planning of the water buyback and irrigation infrastructure modernization programs i e using water buyback as the first main method of obtaining water for the environment and then consequently reorganizing irrigation districts infrastructure along with the implementation of effective structural adjustment policies to

6620,there has been increasing emphasis by scholars in trying to understand how neighbors influence farmers decision making in australia historically there has always been strong anecdotal evidence of peer pressure on irrigators decisions to not sell permanent water entitlements this local pressure increased with the advent of the federal government into the murray darling basin water market to purchase permanent water for the environment from voluntary sellers from 2008 onwards selling permanent water entitlements is associated with perceptions about rural community decline this article formally tests whether a neighborhood effect can be detected in permanent water entitlement selling decisions using farm survey data across a number of years from the southern murray darling basin n 1462 we hypothesize that the more that an irrigator s neighbors sell permanant water in a given area the more likely that an individual irrigator will also sell permanant water given a decrease in social pressure irrigators locations were geocoded and locational characteristics regional socio economic characteristics land and water quality were linked to the survey data covering farm farmer and water trade characteristics there was significant evidence of a farmer neighborhood effect with higher likelihood of permanent water sales occurring in areas where more neighbors had sold permanent water holding other locational and spatial influences constant keywords water entitlement trading water markets farmers murray darling basin neighborhood effect 1 introduction water scarcity is a severe problem globally long term low water availability environmental problems water over allocation issues and predicted increased rainfall variability have prompted a series of water policy changes around the world many countries have introduced economic instruments to deal with water scarcity problems e g gomez et al 2017 rey et al 2018 and are considering implementing water markets in the future wheeler et al 2017b australia s murray darling basin mdb provides a classic example of the potential outcomes from water market adoption in the mdb several institutional changes were initiated from the 1990s onwards to facilitate water trading and the reallocation from consumptive water uses to environmental needs e g crase et al 2004 water trading is increasingly becoming an important farm management tool for irrigators to adapt to variable water resources and other changes wheeler 2014 in australia s water markets water trading takes commonly place with water entitlements i e ongoing right to exclusive access to a share of water and known otherwise as permanent water or water allocations i e specific volume of water allocated to water access entitlements in a given season and known otherwise as temporary water coag 2004 water entitlements also have different security levels 1 the security type describes the probability of the water being fully available in a given year high security hs water entitlements provide a highly reliable water supply usually full allocation 90 95 years out of 100 low and general security ls gs water entitlements provide a variable uncertain water supply 1 towards the end of the millennium drought 2001 02 2009 10 the federal government allocated aud 3 1 billion usd 2 4 billion 2018 exchange rate towards a water buyback program to buy water entitlements from willing irrigators and return water to the environment and aud 5 8 billion towards sustainable rural water use and irrigation infrastructure srwui projects dewha 2010 the water buyback program was the government s principal market based instrument deployed to produce water for environmental benefits in deteriorated sites in other words water previously allocated for consumptive uses is reallocated back to the environment to improve environmental outcomes 2 the buyback program was carried out as a multistage tendering system i e the government announces the funding for the tender round in a specific region and irrigators interested in selling submit a non binding expression of interest specifying the desired price the government assessed the offers according to several criteria such as the price the capacity to deliver the water to targeted environmental assets the priority of these assets and their water requirements 2 water buyback programs have also been implemented in a number of other countries such as the usa e g isé and sunding 1998 and spain e g calatrava and martínez granados 2018 recent changes in the australian policy environment have shifted the focus to recovering environmental water predominantly from infrastructure modernization projects and ending further water buybacks grafton and wheeler 2018 while this change is the slightly preferred option for many farmers and rural communities albeit many still would like buyback programs loch et al 2014 it is not cost effective in recovering environmental water as compared to the buyback program and may not meet long term sustainability aims of being able to flexibly respond to an uncertain and variable future climate furthermore infrastructure modernization may increase consumptive water usage and conversion to permanent agriculture and reduce return flows e g adamson and loch 2014 berbel et al 2015 crase and o keefe 2009 grafton et al 2018 wittwer and dixon 2013 loch and adamson 2015 there have been a variety of questions raised about why irrigators might sell their water and the corresponding regional impact environmental programs such as the water buyback program have been shown to be important adaptation strategies for irrigators to reduce debt during a drought grafton and wheeler 2018 considering the likelihood of future droughts understanding the determinants of irrigators participating in the water buyback program and in water markets in general and understanding what consequences this program might have is important for the overall success of future environmental programs a range of studies have analyzed the determinants of irrigators water trading decision making in australia and other countries isé and sunding 1998 and wheeler et al 2012 studied irrigators determinants to sell water entitlements to the government in the us and australia a key finding was that irrigators were likely to sell their water out of last resort circumstances i e debt death and divorce or for strategic reasons e g following farm investment plans other studies concluded that water entitlement trading is more likely to be based on long term considerations largely relating to farm characteristics e g bjornlund 2006 wheeler et al 2010 as compared to water allocation trading which is associated with short term considerations in response to seasonal fluctuations of prices or water availability e g loch et al 2012 giannoccaro et al 2016 zuo et al 2014 loch et al 2018 considered the impact of transaction costs on water markets in the southern mdb although most studies acknowledge that irrigators water entitlement trading behavior can be complex different across regions and dependent on a wide range of different factors none of the studies to date have considered the effect of neighbors decisions and other potential locational influences this is important as in australia anecdotal evidence suggests there is considerable social pressure on irrigators to not sell permanent water entitlements out of their area e g fenton 2006 over time research into farmers decision making has been influenced by various different disciplines e g economics sociology psychology and geography as well as their sub disciplines the impact of neighborhood effects on farmers choices is an increasingly assessed determinant in the empirical agricultural economics literature neighborhood effects may arise through information exchange or the influence of social norms holloway and lapar 2007 evidence for neighborhood effects have been shown in a number of areas such as technology adoption e g case 1992 weber 2012 pesticide use e g aida 2017 organic farming e g schmidtner et al 2012 various land use crop choices e g holloway et al 2002 yamano et al 2018 and farmland abandonment gellrich et al 2007 another set of the literature has increasingly focused on highlighting the importance of place and space on farmers decision making showing the relevance of other locational factors such as population density and distance to roads markets e g wu et al 2011 this article combines unique datasets of farm level survey data and a range of locational information to seek to answer whether irrigators water entitlement selling behavior is affected by 1 their neighbors water entitlement trading behavior and 2 various locational regional factors for example distance to cities and greater resource scarcity and deterioration in particular we hypothesize that the more neighbors in the irrigator s local area sell water entitlements the more likely that an irrigator will sell water entitlements as it is more socially acceptable holding everything else constant findings may contribute to a greater understanding of water trading adoption policies in other countries and to help refine current water policies in australia such as the basin wide consequences of subsidies for irrigation infrastructure upgrades e g grafton et al 2018 or future drought policies in australia e g zuo et al 2015 2 conceptual background neighborhood effects in water trading decision making the motivation for investigating a neighborhood effect amongst irrigators arose from anecdotal evidence in the mdb that showed severe social pressure from other farmers and the rural community on irrigators considering selling permanent water entitlements from their area e g irrigators were ostracized from the local pub e g fenton 2006 after water markets were formally introduced in the mdb irrigators initially showed concerns and distrust regarding water trading over time many irrigators started to perceive water trading as an important farm management tool wheeler 2014 social pressure on selling started to disappear for selling temporary water but the social pressure on selling permanent water entitlements continued and the uptake of water entitlement trading in general was slow because of the long term nature of this water right and the historical attachment to irrigators land in addition this local pressure increased with the advent of the government into the mdb water market to purchase water for the environment from 2008 onwards hence there has always been a strong influence of social norms pressure in the mdb that may lead to significant neighborhood effects influencing water selling the reasons for this social pressure and irrigators concerns about water sales are manifold often outward water trading is thought to be associated with reduced agricultural production economic activity and employment in some regions there are fears that permanent water entitlement sales which may lead to farm exits may threaten the viability of the local farming community and lead to increased infrastructure costs for remaining irrigators the impact of water reforms and water trading on rural communities is widely discussed in the literature e g alston and whittenbury 2014 wheeler et al 2014 although both theoretical and applied studies have found very little change in irrigation returns from reductions in water diversions connor et al 2014 kirby et al 2014 nwc 2012 furthermore it was shown that the government s water entitlement purchases resulted in reduced farm debt levels and many irrigators have used the proceeds from water sales to stay in business and improve on farm efficiency or prepare for retirement and did not terminate their water delivery rights e g wheeler and cheesman 2013 the broader farmer adoption literature confirms the impact of social pressure amongst farmers similar responses to changes in farming communities were found e g in the case of adopting technologies e g lynne 1995 or other conservation strategies e g ducros and watson 2002 social norms can cause social pressure which may ultimately prevent farmers to act according to their preferences burton 2004 in rural farming communities there is often a tendency to conform to behavioral norms which can affect farmers decision making e g platteau 2000 the utility derived from social conformity may direct farmers decision as much as or even more than profit considerations e g akerlof 1980 moser and barrett 2006 detecting social neighborhood effects is complex since there are three different types of social influences i e endogenous correlated and contextual influences manski 1993 and information diffusion is affected by certain characteristics of the local social structure i e group homogeneity participatory norms and leadership heterogeneity rogers 2003 thus an analysis of neighborhood effects from observed behavioral data needs to be taken cautiously a neighborhood effect on an adoption decision is also commonly explained with the theory of agglomeration economies particularly in studies investigating the adoption of organic farming and farm technologies in this case the clustering of farmers with similar practices or technologies provide several production advantages and thereby promote further adoption e g wollni and andersson 2014 however in the case of water trading adoption other reasons such as exchanging experience information and thereby making it socially acceptable are more likely to be relevant furthermore transaction cost theory can be related to a neighborhood adoption problem in water trading since transaction costs e g time spent on monitoring water market activity may decrease as water trading adoption increases loch et al 2018 water trading behavior research can learn from the broader adoption literature since water trading can be categorized as an adoption or adaptation strategy depending on the motives or forces behind the decision to trade water the literature on water trading behavior is evolving but so far has been focused on farm and farmers socio economic characteristics excluding potential social influences on irrigators water trading decision making behavior but as tisdell et al 2001 p iii concluded knowledge and understanding of the actions of other irrigators is generally strong among traders but weak among those water users who do not trade also wheeler et al 2017a found that peer influence was present within the southern mdb irrigation communities many irrigators said they cared about what other farmers thought furthermore tang et al 2016 showed that irrigators who are more connected to peers neighbors and other community stakeholders are more aware of water scarcity than those with less connections accordingly we seek to test the following hypothesis an increase in the number of irrigators who have sold water entitlements to the government in a community area is associated with an increased likelihood of an individual s water entitlement selling decision by making it more socially acceptable referred to as the neighborhood effect 3 data and methods 3 1 survey data and study area two datasets of irrigator surveys in the southern mdb includes irrigation districts in southern new south wales nsw northern victoria vic and south australia sa were used in this article n 1462 the mdb is australia s largest agricultural production area see fig 1 the southern mdb was selected as a case study as it is hydrologically linked and water markets have been formally in operation since the 1990s the irrigator surveys were conducted in 2010 11 3 the 2010 11 survey was conducted via telephone through computer assisted interviewing techniques 30 response rate or 37 including those who agreed to be surveyed at a later date but ended up not included as sample sizes were met and randomly selecting survey participants from farming lists wheeler et al 2012 3 n 931 and 2011 12 4 the 2011 12 mail out survey contacted the same list of irrigators from the 2010 11 survey as a follow up survey 63 response rate after removing those who had left farming comparisons were made of the survey results with other regional census and agricultural datasets e g from the australian bureau of statistics which confirmed that there seemed to be no non response bias and that the survey results were highly representative for the southern mdb e g zuo et al 2015 4 n 531 and collected farmer farm and water trading information for the previous farming seasons 2009 10 and 2010 11 respectively in each farming season approximately 10 of the irrigators surveyed sold water entitlements to the government there were very few sales to the government prior to our surveys which would influence our neighborhood analysis there was only small volumes of water sold at the start of the buyback program in 2008 relevant variables from the surveys are described in table 1 and were selected based on previous water entitlement trading behavior research to control for all potential influences wheeler et al 2012 irrigators address data was geocoded in a geographic information system gis using arcgis see fig 2 for irrigators locations address input and address reference data often lack in completeness and accuracy especially for rural areas which can cause geocoding errors or low geocoding accuracy levels i e locations are geocoded only at the postcode or street level without street number because of missing or incorrect information it also needs to be considered that in some cases the farm postal addresses may not exactly represent the location of the farm production area e g where farmland is dispersed over a large area 5 studies on farmland fragmentation in australia are rare and dated it was shown that the mean distances between homestead parcels and detached parcels ranged 12 50km depending on the area hill and smith 1977 5 or the farm homestead is not connected to the farm production hence not all farm locations from the surveys are exactly represented in gis and subsequent gis analysis must be undertaken with care furthermore this analysis incorporates additional locations of water entitlement sellers supplied by the department of the environment and energy doee this database provides a census of all water entitlement sellers to the water buyback program as at 2012 we incorporated the locations of those who had sold water entitlements to the government prior to 2011 and who had not participated in the above described surveys specifically for analyzing a neighborhood effect thus this data is only reflected in the neighborhood variable in our model analysis to provide for a more accurate representation of the irrigators neighborhoods and the neighbors selling decisions 3 2 spatial data and units 3 2 1 neighborhood variable size analyzing a potential neighborhood effect is a heterogeneous and complex aspect of farmers decision making holloway and lapar 2007 farmers neighborhood areas can be defined in various ways e g based on distances k nearest neighbors or defined zones exact information on the neighborhood size is typically not available and there exist various determining factors e g locational socio economic and cultural factors often studies do not elaborate in detail about the potential size of the neighborhood but rather make assumptions about its possible size thus the size of the neighborhood or the spatial weight matrix in spatial regression is often arbitrary which may result in biased model estimations holloway and lapar 2007 storm et al 2015 some adoption studies claim that farmers learn from other farmers who are closest to their farm fields e g palis et al 2005 in the case of water trading it may be more complex since this is a practice that cannot be physically observed and may thus require frequent contact and discussion in a wider network studies confirm that often farmers perceive their community wider than just the immediate neighborhood sligo and massey 2007 australia s vast land resources and the size of the study area in this article 471 427 km2 may also support wider community areas because australian farmers may have long distances to neighboring farms neighborhood sizes for the southern mdb also need to account for the different spatial patterns of irrigator locations fig 2 illustrates the clustered and dispersed pattern of irrigators locations clustering particularly occurs in vic and sa when compared to nsw which is a result of the historical developments of irrigation settlements in the southern mdb a neighborhood based on a cut off distance or on k nearest neighbors is less suitable in this article because of a dispersed distribution of irrigators across the study area and partly lower geocoding accuracy in rural areas thus it can be expected that neighborhood sizes in the southern mdb differ across regions as it was similarly suggested in other studies particularly for dispersed farm locations storm et al 2015 hence this article suggests that an irrigator s wider community area which may vary according to population sizes is the most suitable form to test for neighborhood effects in water trading decision making we employed zones which can be regarded as community areas by calculating the numbers of irrigators that had sold water entitlements per statistical area level 2 sa2 fig 2 following abs 2010 community areas are captured by sa2 which were built to represent a community that interacts together socially and economically sa2 vary in sizes according to population sizes and align with state boundaries the literature similarly suggests that if there are no socio cultural factors that define different neighborhood sizes then administrative boundaries such as defined by sa2 in this article are appropriate to specify the neighborhood e g holloway and lapar 2007 3 2 2 other locational and regional information a gis database was compiled by collecting secondary spatial data covering biophysical climate and socio economic information details and descriptive statistics are provided in table 1 csiro the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organization provided the soil texture data in soil layer 1 a horizon soil data was modelled from spot observations and is presented at a spatial resolution of approximately 1 1 km the proportions of sand silt and clay are the main determinants of field texture which can be used as a measure of the soil s water holding capacity csiro 2001 zones of high dryland salinity risk or hazard were identified from nlwra 2001 groundwater salinity from a bureau of meteorology bom composite dataset 1994 2009 bom 2014 and location of cities abs 2012 and the index of relative socio economic advantage and disadvantage irsad from the socio economic indexes for areas seifa abs 2013 from the australian bureau of statistics abs the socio economic index ranks areas according to relative socio economic advantage and disadvantage based on information from the five yearly census and is built on the basis of several variables relating to income education housing employment occupation and other a high score has a relatively high incidence of advantage and a relatively low incidence of disadvantage other regional information comprised water entitlement prices doe 2016 and seasonal water allocation levels 6 seasonal water allocations closing levels indicate the percentage of an irrigator s water entitlement available for use within a farming season depending on the water availability in the specific water resource to prevent water over allocation 6 nwc 2011 according to previous water entitlement trading behavior literature permanent water entitlement trading is more likely to be based on long term considerations largely relating to farm characteristics e g financial chararacteristics farm area farm type etc also when modelling water entitlement trading time variant variables need to be lagged to reflect long term issues thus depending on data availabilities time variant variables were lagged for the previous five years seasonal water allocation levels the previous census year socio economic index seifa or the previous year water entitlement prices also to avoid any potential reverse causality the spatial statistics for the locational regional variables were generated using arcgis and combined with the relevant survey data a 30 km buffer zone around the farm locations see fig 2 was used for calculating spatial statistics on the biophysical data to account for potentially dispersed farm areas and lower geocoding accuracy for some of the farm locations 3 3 methods the decision to sell water entitlements follows a discrete choice approach in which an irrigator decides to sell water entitlements to the government if the expected utility of selling outweighs the expected utility of not selling binary probit regression models of water entitlement selling were estimated 7 we considered multilevel mixed effects probit regression models the higher level being sa2 for binary outcomes to test the robustness of the ordinary probit regression models both two level random intercept and two level random intercept and coefficients models were tested multilevel models account for grouped or clustered within one sa2 data which may be correlated because of a common group level characteristic however for the intercept model there is not significant variability between the sa2s to favor a mixed effects probit regression while the estimation of random coefficients never converged 7 greene 2003 pp 663 669 y x β ε ε n 0 1 1 y 1 i f y 0 0 i f y 0 where y is the latent dependent variable that relates to the binary variable y 1 irrigator has sold water entitlements to the government 0 otherwise x is a vector of independent variables see table 1 β is a conformable parameter vector and ε the error term probit models were estimated for the survey years separately and combined pooled cross section using a year dummy to account for aggregate changes over the period e g wooldridge 2010 the model analysis expands some of the modelling in wheeler et al 2012 by combining the two survey years adding in census information on water entitlement selling to the federal government and adding in additional neighborhood and locational information we test whether accounting for neighborhood locational effects improves the outcome of a traditional water trading behavior model using the bayesian information criterion bic furthermore volumes megaliter ml of water entitlements sold to the government were estimated using a censored tobit model limited dependent variable model greene 2003 p 764 y i x i β ε i y i 0 i f y i 0 y i y i i f y i 0 2 i 1 2 n where y is the observed response variable y is the latent uncensored and unobservable response variable and 0 is the threshold value thus in our model analysis the tobit model treats farms for which no volumes of water entitlements sold were observed as left censored observations the model for the latent response variable is similar to ordinary least squares regression where y is the latent dependent variable volumes ml log of water entitlements sold x is a vector of independent variables see table 1 β is a conformable parameter vector and ε the error term we estimated the global moran s i statistic for the discrete choice dependent variable at different radius distances 30 100 km with an interval of 5 km which indicates potential neighborhood sizes with significant spatial clustering of water entitlement sales 8 the analysis required removing irrigators that had no neighbors within the specified distance range ten irrigators were identified to have no neighbors at distances 30km 8 the different radius distances were chosen given australian farm sizes and following the literature for example läpple and kelley 2014 tested 20 50 km the results of this analysis provide further insights into the existence and potential size of a neighborhood effect in the southern mdb and allowed the identification of clusters and outliers employing anselin s local moran s i measure anselin et al 2013 results suggest that water entitlement sales were spatially clustered at 40 km z score 2 16 and 90 km z score 3 64 this confirms that a relevant neighborhood size may vary across the regions in the southern mdb with a potential neighborhood radius distance of 40 km fixed distance fig a1 in the appendix shows the density surface and fig a2 shows the distribution of local clusters and outliers of water entitlement sales both figures help to identify regions river valleys with major clusters of irrigators having sold water entitlements to the government e g in sa s riverland and in river valleys across the vic nsw border smaller clusters were detected for example in northern nsw murray most of the spatial outliers i e irrigators having sold water were significantly surrounded by irrigators having not sold water were located in nsw and in some river valleys in vic furthermore we undertook spatial diagnostics tests with different spatial weight matrix sizes inverse spatial weight matrix with different distance bands however the discussion of the results focus on the probit and tobit models which capture the neighborhood effect through a zonal variable which was identified as the most suitable neighborhood size considering the described study areas characteristics and the dataset to be analyzed e g swinton 2002 4 results the results of the probit and tobit models for selling water entitlements to the government for both survey years and individually are summarized in table 2 the models performed well according to the results of the r2 and percentage of correct prediction at least 88 models had no serious multicollinearity issues e g no variance inflation factors above five mean 1 57 and no correlation coefficients among independent variables above 0 7 or below 0 7 and were estimated with robust standard errors clustered at the irrigator level for the two year probit model model results confirm a number of relationships between the decision to sell and various independent variable characteristics from the surveys as found in wheeler et al 2012 for example results confirm associations of those that sell water entitlements with lower education levels having a whole farm plan not using government agencies as an information source owning larger volumes of water entitlements and having previous lower seasonal water allocation levels in their area seasonal water allocation levels capture the effect of water scarcity and are highly significant confirming that irrigators who had experienced greater stress in terms of less water allocation levels in the past five years were more likely to sell water entitlements 9 as a robustness check we tested the seasonal allocation variable using one year lag and same year data model test results showed that the allocation variable with one year lag was also positive significant at the 0 01 level and the allocation variable with same year data was not significant this highlights the influence of past year long term conditions on water entitlement sales 9 moreover across all models smaller farm sizes showed a strong positive relationship with water entitlement sales smaller farms may have been more likely to change land uses or exit irrigation farming in the face of drought and other pressures also carrying over lower volumes of water from the previous season prompted water entitlement sales similarly suggesting some water sales were prompted by water scarcity issues or those irrigators had been selling their water allocations annually before selling water entitlements which resulted in lower carry over water model results of the discrete choice and volumes of water entitlements sold for both years do not differ substantially showing there is no two step decision process on the other hand modelling the survey years separately discrete choice showed a few differences e g being younger lower educated and a net seller of water allocations and having a higher percentage of income from off farm work increased the likelihood of selling in 2009 10 but not in 2010 11 4 1 locational regional variables 4 1 1 neighborhood effect of most interest to this article there was statistical positive evidence of a farmer neighborhood effect on the sale of water entitlements across all models results and after controlling for a range of other independent variables particularly the regional spatial variables thus holding other influences constant irrigators in areas where more neighbors had sold more water entitlements to the government were more likely to sell their water entitlements the variable neighbors sold this may be because there was an increased social acceptance to do so as described previously selling water has always been a controversial decision for irrigators to undertake in the mdb and our results do suggest a significant positive association between the number of water entitlement sales in a community area and an irrigator s individual decision to sell their water entitlements perhaps because they felt less social pressure not to sell this result was stronger in the combined and 2009 10 discrete choice models it was potentially less important if selling was socially accepted in the community for the decision on volumes of water entitlements and whether to sell in the later year however sample sizes vary for the different models furthermore model results for the information source dummy variable government agency suggest that having used the government as a main source of information was not associated with water entitlement sales which underpins that other sources of information experience are more important for an irrigator s decision to sell water entitlements the results of the spatial diagnostics tests suggest no spatial dependency for the spatial lag and spatial error of the data after a range of independent variables have been controlled for in the models thus the explicit measurement of a neighborhood effect is sufficient without spatial econometrics techniques as suggested in the literature the influence of neighborhood social effects on farmers decision making is difficult to detect from observed behavioral data hence results of this analysis provide the foundation and motivation for future research on neighborhood effects in water trading decision making which may involve farmer experiments and qualitative methods e g manski 1993 4 1 2 effects of other locational and regional information regression modelling also showed the following relationships with other locational characteristics a consistent result for all models was the impact of distance to cities where irrigators located further away from major and smaller cities were more likely to sell their water but at a decreasing rate as shown by the squared term in other words rural areas with increasing distances to markets and other services were associated with larger volumes of water entitlement sales but only until a certain distance point approximately 100 km which is the estimated turning point of this nonlinear relationship irrigated agriculture in more rural areas can be more cost intensive and disadvantaged for example in relation to access to infrastructure markets resources and services which may lead to water entitlement selling decisions hence the water buyback scheme may have provided an important farm management tool in response to various unfavorable conditions for irrigators within a certain distance range from cities greater than 5000 people on the other hand regional socio economic classifications seifa index were not found to be associated with water entitlement selling decisions thus results suggest no evidence that rural community decline is associated with higher water entitlement sales another strong finding amongst the assessed locational variables was a positive relationship between areas more affected by dryland salinity and irrigators water selling decisions confirming results in haensch et al 2016 dryland salinity indicates a poorer resource area because of the soil s lower capacity to produce high yielding crops or inefficient unsustainable irrigation practices which in the long term may encourage land use change or irrigation farming exit resulting in water sales similarly model results showed that the closer irrigators were located to the river murray s terminus to the sea i e the closer they were to key environmental issues from low river flows in the river murray the more likely they were to sell water entitlements to the government this result corresponds to previous findings that sa and vic irrigators were more likely to sell water entitlements to the government wheeler et al 2012 finally it was tested and found using bic values that accounting for neighborhood and locational information to explain the water entitlement selling decision significantly improved the explanatory power of a traditional economic water entitlement sales model as presented in wheeler et al 2012 thus overall results suggest that future research on water entitlement trading behavior may need to account for neighborhood and other locational effects as they explain a considerable part of water entitlement selling decisions 5 discussion from a policy planning point of view it is useful to elucidate the location and size of the neighborhood effect or in other words the externality associated with convincing one farmer within an area to adopt a preferred practice case 1992 when devising market access policies to increase the regional density of market participation public spending e g extension services can be optimally planned and policy prescriptions can be more precise and effective holloway and lapar 2007 it is suggested that spatial variations of water trading decisions should be considered and policies may need to be adjusted to a spatially flexible approach targeting different purposes in different areas e g broch et al 2013 a possible neighborhood effect on water entitlement trading decision making leads to several policy implications the first policy implication relates to the adoption of water trading internationally in the developing stages of water markets when it is the aim to promote water trading it can be useful to identify community neighborhood areas or groups in which farmers are likely to interact or where there is a lack of interaction identified areas can be targeted with tailored information programs as our model results have shown farmers may not be more likely to sell water if information was primarily sourced from the government thus encouraging social capital within farming communities by organizing participatory or farmer to farmer extension services which foster communication amongst farmers may be beneficial to provide a platform for irrigators to exchange experience and information on water trading particularly in the case of selling permanent water rights policy makers need to consider the social aspect of selling water in communities and recognize that some irrigators may not adopt water trading if it is against their values in this case it may take time and more resources e g identifying and targeting community leaders to promote water trading plans and policies which engage local communities are most likely to succeed hurlimann and march 2012 in australia results of this article can be useful for future water buyback and similar environmental programs in identifying areas where irrigators are potentially more likely to sell if environmental flows are needed from that area local extension services could also be adjusted to alleviate irrigators concerns about the future of their irrigation community and infrastructure the second policy implication focusses on the impact of water selling on rural community outcomes focusing on the australian experience but has relevance for other countries the impact of water entitlement selling on the farm and the wider community is a much discussed topic studies have analyzed the on farm socio economic impacts e g wheeler and cheesman 2013 plus the flow on effects of water buybacks for irrigation communities using both theoretical models e g grafton and jiang 2011 nwc 2012 wittwer and dixon 2013 and applied data e g connor et al 2014 kirby et al 2014 to date there is an increasing divergence between peer reviewed literature finding very little impact between water entitlement selling and rural decline versus community government funded economic consultancies e g rmcg 2016 finding considerable impact wheeler et al 2018 provide a summary of the quality of the water recovery economics impact evidence and this study provides additional regional level evidence of the lack of assocation between socio economic decline and water entitlement selling but given concerns that australia s water buyback program and investments in modernizing irrigation infrastructure are likely to lead to spatial planning and prioritization problems crossman et al 2010 there is a need to consider all potential consequences for farmers and communities the mdb water buyback and infrastructure programs provide a good example of where the planning of policy programs could have been improved economists have argued that programs should have been planned consecutively by spending most of the money on buying back permanent water first and foremost and then using some of the funds to reorganize restructure irrigation districts correspondingly grafton and wheeler 2018 at the same time more funding should have been directed towards more effective structural adjustment policies within local communities the productivity commission 2018 currently shows little money has been spent and has not been targeted to the most vulnerable communities this would have made infrastructure investments more effective in the long term it would have reduced some of the negative externalities of current programs and would have also allowed a greater use of more effective structural adjustments for rural communities finally policy implications which are drawn from neighborhood and other locational influences on water trading behavior are not necessarily limited to water management areas but are closely linked to other policy areas such as the need to implement climate change adaptation policies drought land management or farm exit programs 6 conclusion the findings of this study indicate the importance of neighborhood influences and other locational information on permanent water entitlement sales to the government in australia in particular there is evidence of a neighborhood effect on the permanent water entitlement selling decisions after controlling for a range of other potential influences irrigators were more likely to sell permanent water entitlements to the government if more irrigators in their community areas had sold permanent water to the federal water buyback program after controlling for a wide variety of specific farm locational and regional characteristics this neighborhood effect shows that previous social pressure not to sell water out of the region and an early distrust of irrigators regarding the water buyback program may have been alleviated through neighbors selling decisions where it is the objective to increase adoption of water markets it can be useful to target certain community areas and groups e g organizing participatory extension services which foster the communication amongst irrigators this result is based on the analysis of observed behavioral data and provides the foundation and motivation for further research on neighborhood effects in water trading decision making furthermore irrigators location in relation to major cities was a driver of water entitlement sales decisions showing a higher likelihood of selling the further away irrigators are located from cities until a certain distance point poorer land quality was also associated with higher permanent water sales but contrary to popular arguments relating rural decline to water entitlement sales modelling results showed that areas with lower socio economic classifications were not associated with the amount of water entitlements sold this supports other key findings in the literature that buyback of water is not associated with rural decline and hence should not be used as a reason to cap or stop further buyback of permanent water in favor of infrastructure modernization programs our results highlight the need for more spatial planning in regards to public programs and how in the mdb there should have been consecutive planning of the water buyback and irrigation infrastructure modernization programs i e using water buyback as the first main

6621,a hybrid numerical finite differences and semi analytical empirical model has been developed to evaluate the spatial and time scale of chemical weathering along a fracture in quartz sandstones the model is based on the diffusion transport occurring from the bedrock mass toward the fracture walls driven by the sio2 concentration gradient between water in the bedrock pores high silica content and water flowing in the fracture low silica content because of molecular diffusion intergranular water becomes undersaturated with respect to silica this promotes dissolution of quartz at grain boundaries and results in a porosity profile decreasing from the fracture walls toward the rock interior bedrock individual grains are released and gradually removed by the water flowing into the fracture when a critical value of porosity is reached grain release threshold grt this process drastically increases the fracture enlargement rate the model outcomes establish a minimum time of 90 ka to reach the grt this time is independent of length aperture and dip of the fracture but is controlled by parameters such as the initial fracture aperture water temperature quartz grain size and initial bedrock porosity it is attested that the water flowing in the fracture remains undersaturated with respect to silica over very long timescales in the order of 105 years and over very long flow paths in turn this suggests that the extremely slow reaction between quartz and water is the key factor for the formation of subterranean karst like features in quartz sandstone otherwise silica saturation would be reached after short distances and deep weathering in this lithology would be prevented finally the model outcomes were compared to field data from the gran sabana caves venezuela and other quartz sandstone weathering landforms elsewhere showing that dissolution diffusion in the rock matrix is a reliable mechanism for the formation of these peculiar karst like features keywords quartz dissolution silicate karst permeability evolution quartz sandstone hydrology speleogenesis 1 introduction quartz is the most common mineral in the earth crust and because of its hardness and low chemical reactivity also represents the most common component of sedimentary rocks despite the low solubility at the earth s surface environmental conditions quartz rich rocks often display landforms that imply a significant role of dissolution and chemical weathering and many authors did not hesitate to use the term karst referring to this process martini 1979 jennings 1983 piccini 1995 wray 1997a eberhard and sharples 2013 wray and sauro 2017 one of the most renowned and spectacular examples of karst like features in quartz rich rocks is the peculiar landscape of the tepui table mountains in the gran sabana region venezuela guyana and brazil wray 2000 and references therein landforms such as sinkholes ponors shafts and large subterranean passages are interpreted as the result of weathering and erosion boosted by partial subsurface dissolution chalcraft and pye 1984 ghosh 1991 wray 1997b doerr 1999 sauro 2014 similar landforms and morphologies have been described in several quartz sandstone outcrops of the world wray and sauro 2017 like the sydney and kimberley regions of australia young 1988 wray 1995 the black reef quartzite of south africa martini 1979 mozambique aucamp and swart 1991 republic of chad mainguet 1972 niger and libya busche and erbe 1987 minas gerais mato grosso roraima and paranà states in brazil bret 1962 corrêa neto et al 1994 hardt et al 2013 the hunan region in china yang et al 2012 thailand wray 1997a the western european basins of poland and the czech republic vitek 1979 and in the united states mainly in colorado and alabama netoff and shroba 1993 the origin of these landforms was explained through a process called arenisation martini 2000 wray and sauro 2017 which indicates the mechanism of transforming hard granular rocks such as sandstones or granites into loose sand easily eroded and transported by running water arenisation is sometimes related to dissolution of carbonate cement adamovič et al 2013 or clay minerals in the matrix corrêa neto 2000 aubrecht et al 2011 2012 however arenisation is more crucial in quartz sandstone cemented by silica or characterized by interlocked syntaxial overgrowth structures where dissolution directly involves only the quartz grains crystal boundaries white et al 1966 chalcraft and pye 1984 pouylleau and seurin 1985 doerr 1999 piccini and mecchia 2009 similar processes of dissolution are supposed to be active also in deeply buried quartz sandstones having a great importance for the development of secondary porosity in hydrocarbon reservoirs hurst and bjorkum 1986 sauro et al 2014 martini 1984 suggested that dissolution along quartz grain boundaries is due to meteoric water circulating very slowly through the rock matrix advection the water would remain undersaturated with respect to sio2 and therefore chemically aggressive over a long distance because of the extremely slow dissolution kinetics of quartz rimstidt and barnes 1980 wray 1997b fluid advection however does not seem to be an effective mechanism for mass transport at least in the first phase of the process given the small size of intergranular pores in unaltered quartz sandstone garrels et al 1948 the solute transport from pores smaller than 1 µm in diameter is usually controlled by diffusion derjaguin and churaev 1986 aqueous diffusion in fact is generally the dominant transport mechanism within fluid bearing rocks where diffusion occurs along each mineral grain boundary interconnected by continuous fluid films garrels et al 1949 many authors low 1992 sposito 1992 renard and ortoleva 1997 demonstrated that a water film can be trapped in intergranular rock boundaries acting as a diffusion pathway for this reason pressure solution is a well studied mechanism able to enhance dissolution at grain contacts where solute transport through pores can lead to an effective mass transfer renard et al 1999 here we propose a model for the widening of a single fracture in pure quartz sandstones due to coupled processes of dissolution on grain surfaces and molecular diffusion in intergranular pores similar models were widely used to understand the evolution of primary fractures enlarged by pure dissolution in classical carbonate karst dreybrodt 1990 dreybrodt et al 1999 2005 palmer 2000 gabrovšek and dreybrodt 2001 or to evaluate the weathering rate of other lithologies along fractures steefel and lichtner 1998 the understanding of solutional weathering processes in quartz sandstones in epigenic conditions is also very important for the quantification of their contribution to the global silica cycle siever 1957 nonetheless the model only approximates natural conditions since the occurrence of clay minerals and or other silicates is not considered therefore its applicability is mainly related to almost pure quartz sandstones model results aim at understanding 1 the propagation of the arenisation process from the fracture into the rock matrix 2 the concentration of silica along the flow path 3 the fracture enlargement rate 4 the grain release rate 5 the changes in fracture hydraulic conductivity with time the main objective of this research is to evaluate if molecular diffusion through the rock porosity can actually trigger the subsurface weathering process explaining the formation and development of so impressive karst like features and cave systems in quartz sandstones and to quantify the time needed for this process to be an effective morphogenetic agent 2 theoretical background of the model 2 1 hydro geochemical framework the proposed model is inspired by the typical setting of a tabular mountain consisting of a pure quartz sandstone rock where subsurface weathering has produced the enlargement of vertical or steep fracture sets partially draining the local surface runoff to an outflow point on the external cliffs of the massif fig 1 in a quartz sandstone rock water is present in fractures and intergranular pores of the rock matrix the rock matrix is here described as the unfractured rock after ideally sorting out all the minor fractures tullborg and larson 2006 the intergranular pores are supposed to be water filled and the pore water saturated with respect to quartz because of the extremely long residence time 2 2 weathering stages in the model the long term effect of sio2 dissolution and solute transport is simplified in three stages of development fig 2 1 inception stage water filled flow if the water that flows through a fracture is silica undersaturated it dissolves quartz fig 2b and causes the transfer of solute molecules by diffusion from the intergranular pores triggering dissolution on quartz grain boundaries around the fracture fig 2c undersaturation occurs when the fracture connects a sinking point to an outflow and the aperture allows a fast advective flow in this stage the fracture enlarges only through the extremely slow dissolution of quartz grains on the fracture walls after a very long time the porosity of rock close to the fracture reaches a critical value grain release threshold grt some grains are disentangled and released and if the fracture has reached a sufficient aperture the water flow can wash these grains away fig 2d 2 fracture enlargement stage water filled flow as the fracture opening increases by release of quartz grains flow and advection rate increase too whereas the concentration of silica in the fracture water reduces the diffusion dissolution process propagates into the rock matrix maintaining roughly stable porosity and concentration profiles fig 2e 3 fracture enlargement stage free surface film flow when the infiltration flow rate becomes insufficient to fill the fracture the flowing water forms free surface films on the fracture walls even in this changed condition of flow the concentration gradient persists diffusion is active and the arenisation process continues fig 2f if the infiltration of water ends the fracture dries out and arenisation stops 2 3 quartz dissolution the model assumes a very simple chemical system where only pure quartz and pure water are present for quartz dissolution the simplified first order reaction proposed by rimstidt and barnes 1980 for dilute neutral to slightly acidic solutions in water is used 1 s i o 2 s 2 h 2 o l s i o 2 2 h 2 o h 4 s i o 4 a q where s i o 2 2 h 2 o represents all intermediate species between the solid and aqueous states at a given temperature the equilibrium constant of reaction 1 is 2 k eq a h 4 s i o 4 e q a s i o 2 a h 2 o 2 where a h 4 s i o 4 e q is the activity of h4sio4 at equilibrium i e at saturation when the reaction is not at equilibrium and in this case we represent the h4sio4 activity using the symbol a h 4 s i o 4 an activity quotient can be defined as q c a h 4 s i o 4 a s i o 2 a h 2 o 2 and the ratio q c k eq a h 4 s i o 4 a h 4 s i o 4 e q represents the saturation index the infiltration water at the inflow fig 1 is assumed to be undersaturated with respect to quartz whereas temperature is assumed to be constant in time and space throughout each simulation run on the base of the transition state theory the equilibrium constant of reaction 1 can be written as 3 k eq k dis k prec that assumes that the forward and backward rates occur as elementary reactions rimstidt and barnes 1980 described by the rate constants k dis and k prec mol m 2 s 1 for dissolution and precipitation respectively dove and crerar 1990 demonstrated that the rate of reaction 1 i e the number of moles of h4sio4 dissolved with a surface of reacting quartz of 1 m2 per second mol m 2 s 1 can be written as f dis k dis a s i o 2 a h 2 o 2 k prec a h 4 s i o 4 from eqs 2 and 3 k prec k dis a h 4 s i o 4 e q given that at equilibrium a s i o 2 s 1 0 and a h 2 o l 1 0 we have 4 f dis k dis 1 a h 4 s i o 4 a h 4 s i o 4 e q however it is more convenient to express the activities a dimensionless in terms of molality m mol kg 1 as shown in suppl mat the symbols m and m eq will be used instead of m h 4 s i o 4 and m h 4 s i o 4 e q eq 4 can then be written as 5 f dis k dis 1 m m eq and eq 5 will be used in the model according to rimstidt 1997 the model applies the following solubility function for quartz in pure water at the temperature range 0 300 c 6 log m eq 0 0254 1107 12 t 273 15 where t is the temperature of the solution in c whereas the dissolution rate constant k dis mol m 2 s 1 is 7 log k dis 0 7324 3705 12 t 273 15 2 4 solute transport mechanisms the model concerns two mechanisms of mass transport of aqueous h4sio4 diffusion in the rock matrix and advection along an open fracture as soon as the fracture forms a continuous flow path a transfer of solute molecules is supposed to start by diffusion driven by the concentration gradient from the water filled micropores to the water filled fracture diffusion through the aqueous phase in fact has long been thought as the dominant mode of solute transport in matrix micropores garrels et al 1949 diffusion transport initially only occurs in a very small fraction of rock pores surrounding the fracture norton and knapp 1977 measured the magnitude and distribution of the directional diffusion porosity in an unaltered quartz sandstone sample among many other samples of a variety of rocks finding that diffusion took place in a very small volume 0 081 of the total rock when the sample was oriented perpendicular to bedding being total porosity φ tot 4 11 with the aim to avoid too much complexity in the calculation the model does not consider the effect of the advection flow that would occur through the rock pores after the increase of porosity due to the diffusion dissolution process on the other hand along the fracture the mass transport is dominated by the advection of silica molecules at the mean fluid velocity and diffusion contribution to mass transport is negligible the model considers the characteristics of the advective flow along the fracture in both water filled and only partially wet conditions free surface films 3 model structure and sub domains dissolution and transport processes have to be both modelled from the very small scale of micropores in the rock matrix to the scale of the fracture length up to 1 km or more this different scale dependence and the different distribution in physical and chemical properties that characterize fracture and rock matrix are modelled by solving the transport equations using numerical finite differences in the fracture and a hybrid semi analytical empirical approach in the rock matrix this model therefore combines the microscale and macroscale descriptions of the system by splitting the computational routine into two sub models rock matrix and fracture fig s1 in supp mat the advective water flow in the single one dimensional fracture is simulated using a discretized numerical model where pathway distance l is divided in n i small segments that develop along the x axis starting from x 0 using the representative elementary volumes revs approach bachmat and bear 1987 each discrete i element is a rev within a rev all petrophysical and chemical properties are assumed to be constant uniform and smaller than the length scale of the phenomena the ratio between the hydraulic head h fig 1 and l gives the hydraulic gradient j a sketch with the geometrical characteristics used for modelling the fracture rock matrix system is shown in fig 3 in the rock matrix a fixed thickness p next to the fracture is simulated by dividing it in n j thin layers rock matrix revs these j elements parallel to the fracture walls develop along the z axis perpendicular to the planar fracture starting from z 0 fig 4 before starting the simulation it is necessary to set the values for the input parameters required and shared by both rock matrix and fracture sub models initial total porosity initial diffusion porosity critical diffusion or total porosity in the first layer at the fracture wall quartz grain initial size water temperature concentration of dissolved silica at the inflow length and initial breadth of fracture segments the simulation considers an initial condition t 0 where the fracture is continuous from the inflow x 0 to the outflow x l and has uniform initial aperture e 0 wider than the initial diameter of quartz grains δ 0 e 0 δ 0 otherwise the particles would not be carried away through the fracture the fracture width b is assumed to remain constant and much greater than the aperture b e 0 fig 3 in the first time step of simulation water with the concentration of silica c in infiltrates at the inflow point and fills the fracture the surface runoff flow rate that feeds the fracture q s is assumed constant over time and therefore the flow rate in the fracture can only be q s at this time water in all the micropores of the rock matrix is saturated with respect to quartz and the porosity of the rock matrix is uniform and equal to that of unaltered quartzite at the second time step a concentration profile forms along the fracture with silica concentrations increasing from x 0 to x l due to quartz dissolution from the walls and to diffusion of silica molecules from the rock matrix pores a step by step procedure of the model identifying input parameters and equations involved in a simulation run is presented in the flow chart of fig s1 in supp material migration of silica molecules by diffusion starts and the sub model rock matrix calculates 1 the volume of pores in the simulated thickness of rock matrix for all the possible conditions found in a segment of the fracture and the corresponding value of diffusion porosity in the first layer of grains fracture wall 2 the flux of silica molecules from the rock matrix to the fracture for all the possible conditions found in a segment at each time step of a simulation run the results of the sub model rock matrix are then combined with those of the sub model fracture in which for each segment i are calculated 1 the water flow parameters effective in the fracture 2 the concentration of silica 3 the state of the arenisation in the fracture i e if the grain release threshold grt has been exceeded depending on the porosity found at the walls of each segment 4 the enlargement of the fracture 3 1 modelling the rock matrix 3 1 1 weathered thickness of rock matrix the rock matrix sub model is based on field observations and empirical measurements from previous literature on quartz sandstone weathering martini 1984 mecchia and piccini 1999 piccini and mecchia 2009 wray and sauro 2017 weathering arenisation of the host rock is a commonly observed phenomenon in quartzite caves and the occurrence of a centimetric thickness estimated between 5 and 15 cm of friable rock on the walls of cave shafts has been frequently observed during the drilling of bolts into these rock walls wray and sauro 2017 and references therein the depth of the alteration zones increases with time up to a point when a first layer of grains is carried away by the water flow in the fracture from this time on the process evolves in a quasi stationary state the arenisation rate matches the wall retreatment rate due to grains release and a stable concentration and porosity profile forms in the rock matrix 3 1 2 molecular diffusion and reaction transport equations in quasi stationary state in the rock matrix sub model a quasi stationary state lichtner 1988 approach is adopted to approximate the fluid rock interaction and the mass transport in the rock matrix over geologic time spans in a stationary state the difference between the number of silica molecules that leave the rev and those that enter it is balanced by the number of molecules released by dissolution of quartz grains in the same rev fig 4 the time of pore enlargement evolution in a rev of rock matrix is described as a sequence of stationary states each representing concentration of silica porosity surface areas and quartz dissolution rate as functions of distance from the fracture wall fig 4 this approximation is acceptable due to the low kinetics of quartz dissolution at low temperature and the very low porosity of quartzite so that these properties change slowly compared to the time required to establish a stationary state under the steady state conditions quasi stationary state assumed for mass transport in the rock matrix the diffusion flux of h4sio4 molecules dissolved in water according to chemical reaction 1 can be expressed by fick s first law in its one dimensional form 8 f dif k dif ϕ c z where c z is the concentration gradient along the coordinate z in this equation the solute concentration c is given in mol m 3 ϕ φ dif τ 2 dimensionless is the ratio between diffusion porosity and the square of tortuosity τ see table 1 f dif is expressed in mol m 2 s 1 k dif m2 s 1 is the diffusion coefficient of dissolved silica h4sio4 assumed constant at a given temperature tortuosity τ decreases with increasing total porosity φ tot and to represent this relationship we use the empirical equation developed by weissberg 1963 see suppl mat equalising eq 5 to eq 8 and changing molality m mol kg 1 into concentration c mol m 3 the reaction transport equation in the rock matrix diffusion porosity is expressed as 9 k dif ϕ c z k dis 1 c c eq 3 1 3 initial porosity and porosity profile evolution for the purposes of this study we define as diffusion porosity φ dif the fraction of water filled connected pores where diffusion transport through the aqueous phase occurs a residual porosity φ res exists and represents the unconnected pores so that the total porosity φ tot is given by the sum φ dif φ res residual porosity represents most of total porosity in unaltered quartz sandstones in our model the unaltered or initial state of the rock is indicated using the subscript 0 i e φ tot 0 and φ dif 0 for initial total and initial diffusion porosity respectively the initial difference φ tot 0 φ dif 0 φ res is assumed to remain constant all over the arenisation process i e the pores initially not connected are not supposed to join the connected pore path during the weathering process while the interstitial water filled connected micropores are assumed to isolate single grains or groups of grains therefore in our model total porosity in a rock matrix layer j is 10 φ tot j φ dif j φ res where φ dif j is the diffusion porosity in the same layer at t 0 the porosity φ dif 0 is uniform all over the rock matrix when the fracture opens and fills with undersaturated water a silica concentration gradient forms between saturated water in rock matrix micropores and water in the opened fracture activating diffusion from the micropores to the fracture we assume that the weathering of quartz sandstone around the fracture starts in the first layer closest to the fracture the parameters concerning this layer are indicated with the subscript w the wall layer j 1 as soon as the concentration of silica inside the rock matrix micropores drops below the saturation point as a consequence the porosity in the wall layer increases φ dif w φ dif 0 and progressively a porosity profile develops inside the rock matrix up to a distance z max where porosity is the same of unaltered rock φ dif 0 when φ dif w reaches a critical value φ dif w c r the first layer of grains facing the fracture is removed by the flowing water we call this event grain release threshold grt from this time on we suppose that the porosity profile progresses inside the rock matrix at the same rate than the wall retreat details concerning the evolution of porosity profile and of pore volumes in the rock matrix are presented in suppl mat see eq s4 the following equation is adopted to describe diffusion porosity φ dif j along the z axis 11 φ dif j φ dif 0 φ dif w φ dif 0 e z u z the value u is set to 1 10 20 representing the hypothesized profile in agreement with field observations wray and sauro 2017 where the maximum depth of arenisation denoted by the symbol z max is found between 7 and 10 cm from the fracture wall the procedure for the calculation of porosity at the wall j 1 is given in the suppl mat at each time step of simulation the diffusion porosity profile in the rock matrix around each segment of the fracture evolves according to eq 11 in the model the slow and regular increase of porosity in the rock matrix close to the fracture is interrupted when the grt is reached from this moment the arenisation process advances indefinitely on in a quasi stationary state pointing out that equilibrium has been reached between the retreat rate of the fracture wall due to the grains removal and the rock weathering rate the model assumes that the process proceeds at the same time and in the same way at both parallel walls of the fracture the porosity profile is assumed not to change over time whereas the fracture enlarges an example of results derived from eq 11 is shown in fig 5 a where the continuous line represents the diffusion porosity profile when φ dif w φ dif w c r 3 1 4 silica concentration profile during the weathering process of the rock matrix next to the fracture a concentration profile forms and evolves in the layers of the rock matrix at t 0 the boundary conditions are z 0 c c i z z max c c eq but the concentration gradient is not expected to be linear the concentration c i in the fracture is known from the implementation of the sub model fracture an approximate value for the concentration in the first layer c w is calculated by assuming constant porosity in the rock matrix introducing a small error for the special case of constant porosity anikouchine 1967 found the following analytical solution valid under steady state conditions 12 c w c eq c i c eq e x p δ z k dis w c eq δ z k dif ϕ w where ϕ w φ dif w τ w 2 and k dis w k dis a m w the term a m w dimensionless is the reactive surface area effective in a unit area of the first layer parallel to the fracture plane see suppl mat the concentration c j in all the other layers can be calculated rearranging eq 9 13 c j c j 1 1 ϕ j ϕ j 1 c j 1 c j 2 k dis j 1 k dif 1 c j 1 c eq where ϕ j φ dif j τ j 2 and ϕ j 1 φ dif j 1 τ j 1 2 k dif k dif δ z and k dis j k dis a m j in the layer j 2 c j 1 c w and c j 2 c i an example of results derived from eq 13 is shown in fig 5b 3 1 5 results of sub model rock matrix at each step of a simulation run the following results of the sub model rock matrix will be used in the coupled sub model fracture the volume of pores in the thickness p of the rock matrix next to a segment i of the fracture v φ i m3 given by the sum of the pore volumes of the n j layers see suppl mat 14 v φ i j 1 j n j v φ j this value is computed for all the possible conditions found in the fracture the correct value for each segment in the fracture will then be identified by the fracture sub model and used in the same time step of the simulation run the volume of pores v φ i increases at each time step of simulation due to partial dissolution of quartz grains the diffusion porosity in the first layer of pores φ dif w i any diffusion porosity profile through the rock displays a unique value for φ dif w in fact a volume of quartz δ v φ dissolved from the rock matrix corresponds to a precise increase of porosity at the wall δ φ dif w the relationships between φ dif w and v φ are represented by a straight line whose slope and intercept are calculated by rock matrix sub model see suppl mat the flux of dissolved silica from the rock matrix to each segment of the fracture f m i mol m 2 s 1 calculated on the base of eq 8 the diffusion porosity φ dif resulting from chemical reaction varies within the weathered rock matrix thickness and the concentration gradient is not linear f m i can then be determined from the first layer of grains to the fracture 15 f m i k dif ϕ w c w c i where ϕ w φ dif w τ w 2 k dif k dif δ z the flux of silica by diffusion to the fracture should be balanced by the amount of silica dissolved in the weathered rock matrix although the model uses realistic values obtained by previous analytical studies this balance is not perfectly achieved due to the uncertainty of many parameters and to the simplified approach used in the model 3 2 modelling the fracture 3 2 1 advection in water filled fractures the flux of silica molecules mol m 2 s 1 by advection in a water filled fracture fig 2b e is f a v a c where c is the h4sio4 concentration mol m 3 and v a is the velocity of water m s 1 at each step of simulation the model selects the equation governing water flow among those proposed by louis 1974 by determining the flow regime turbulent vs laminar and the fracture roughness the roughness ω dimensionless is defined as the ratio between the height of the asperities and twice the fracture opening see fig 3 the equation includes the values of the opening e m in the given point the hydraulic gradient j dimensionless the kinematic viscosity of water μ m2 s 1 the reynolds number re dimensionless and the gravity acceleration g m s 2 details are given in the suppl mat the enlargement by dissolution of an ideal fracture with initially uniform aperture is more effective in the first tract where solute undersaturation is larger hence the aperture decreases towards the outflow point where the smallest opening will be found at t 0 the fracture is uniform and flow velocity is the same all over the fracture the flow rate can be calculated as 16 q a v a o u t e out b out where b out and e out m are the fracture width and aperture at the outflow respectively and v a o u t is the velocity of water at the outflow once the fracture evolves and is calculated using louis equations the procedure to calculate the increase of silica concentration in the fracture due to the flux of silica from the rock matrix f m i and by direct dissolution of the fracture walls f w i is presented in the suppl mat 3 2 2 advection in water films if the fracture aperture becomes too large the infiltration becomes insufficient to fill the fracture the flow switches to vadose conditions and water flows down the fracture forming a film on the walls fig 2f the transition from water filled to water film conditions is regulated by the inflow discharge versus the fracture enlargement see suppl mat for a detailed explanation all vertical films are naturally wavy carried downstream by ever increasing roll waves composed of liquid lumps flowing over a thin stable substrate however simplified assumptions can be made without significantly invalidating the results of simulations if we assume that the downward film completely wets the fracture surfaces by an uniform sheet of water laminar flow conditions can be applied according to nusselt s theory bird et al 1960 for smooth laminar flow on a surface the uniform film thickness e f m can be predicted as 17 e f 3 q f μ 2 b g c o s α 3 where α is the inclination measured from the vertical μ is the kinematic viscosity of water m2 s 1 and q f is the water discharge m3 s 1 in an unsaturated fracture that has to be divided by 2 if water flows down both the fracture walls a simplified calculation of the mean velocity of the water film is given by 18 v f q f 2 e f b free surface films are found in small aperture as well as in large aperture fractures depending on the available water discharge but the aperture does not directly control the flow rate dragila and wheatcraft 2001 the flux of silica molecules in the water film mol m 2 s 1 is thus given by 19 f f v f c where c is the h4sio4 concentration mol m 3 and v f is the velocity m s 1 of water and silica molecules in the film calculated according to eq 18 4 modelled scenarios a typical scenario inspired to a real setting described by several authors for the tepui table mountains gran sabana between venezuela and brazil where karst like features and caves in quartz sandstone are found doerr 1999 piccini and mecchia 2009 aubrecht et al 2012 has been defined to test the modelling results table 1 the precambrian mataui formation reid 1974 which forms the tepuis has the characteristics of an ideal quartz sandstone for which the model is designed these arenites are commonly made of more than 90 quartz showing the interlocked overgrowth grain structure implemented in the model fig 6 with initial grain sizes δ 0 ranging between 70 and 200 μm base value 100 μm sauro 2014 the model was also tested using ranges of values for those physical and chemical parameters that are variable in nature such as initial quartz grain size fracture aperture and width pathway length and hydraulic gradient water temperature and silica concentration infiltration rate or that are not well known such as diffusion and total porosity in pristine rock critical porosity that determines the disentanglement of quartz grains the time step size was optimized at each run to obtain the most reliable result the range of total porosity values in unaltered rock φ tot 0 was based on porosity from 1 5 to 6 9 measured on samples from the mataui quartzite formation sauro 2014 that agree with those of norton and knapp 1977 the model was tested with total porosity values ranging between 1 and 7 while initial effective porosity for quartz sandstones unaffected by weathering was set in the range 0 1 1 according to the findings of martini 1979 2000 the value φ tot w c r 20 is used in the base scenario as the critical total porosity when grt is reached at the fracture wall values of 15 and 25 were also tested values of e 0 between 100 μm and 1 mm were used in all scenarios to study the influence of the initial fracture aperture fractures with aperture as low as 50 μm have often been documented in these lithologies zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 and 50 1000 μm of e 0 are typically used also in models related to fracture karstification in carbonate rocks dreybrodt 1990 palmer 2000 the average physical and chemical characteristics of water found in the caves of the tepuis mecchia et al 2014 were considered suitable for the model acidic solutions ph 4 5 extremely low mineralisation average electrical conductivity of 15 μs cm 2 temperature range 15 25 c average sio2 concentration at the inflow c in 3 20 10 2 mol m 3 average concentration in stream water measured on the tepui plateaus in the base scenario the fracture is supposed to be fed by a stream with constant discharge of 15 l s 1 that consequently represents the maximum infiltration rate q s the aonda cave system explored in the auyan tepui piccini 1995 mecchia and piccini 1999 inspired a vertical fracture base scenario in which h 300 m while a percolating pathway l 1000 m long was assumed to connect many single fracture segments from inflow to outflow the base value for the percolating pathway is considered approximately three times longer than h because in real settings the water follows a complex and non linear path through the fracture system fig 1 since quartz sandstone thicknesses generally reach a few hundred meters and considering a steep fracture system that connects many single fractures percolating pathways no longer than l 5000 m were tested although the model focuses on a high hydraulic gradient fracture it could also simulate low hydraulic gradient systems and scenarios with inclined fractures were also tried up to the limit case of a gently dipping discontinuity however in this case not all assumptions of the model are acceptable because after the grt is reached the quartz grains cannot be washed away simply by gravity 5 results preliminary tests were carried out to assess the relevance of quartz dissolution on fracture walls alone neglecting the contribution from the diffusion dissolution by the rock matrix sub model the enlargement rate of the fracture achievable in the base scenario is extremely low 9 2 10 5 mm ka 1 some parameters lead to a faster rate for example a water temperature of t 27 c increases the rate to 2 5 10 4 mm ka 1 fig 7 but it is still insufficient to explain the formation of the large conduits observed in nature therefore in natural settings the contribution of both dissolution on the fracture walls and diffusion dissolution in the rock matrix must be considered the outcomes of the coupled sub models for the base scenario and the effect of the most crucial parameters tested for a range of possible values are presented in figs 8 16 to improve readability in the figures the main parameters are given in the following units 1 quartz grain size and the fracture aperture are in μm 2 concentration is in mg sio2 l 1 3 reference to time is in years or thousand years results for the variation of silica concentration along the fracture are shown in fig 8 for the base scenario with e 0 300 μm concentration of silica always increases from the inflow to the outflow and with time until the grt is achieved 149 ka in this case afterwards it abruptly drops nearly to the concentration level at the inflow in the example the highest concentration of dissolved silica reaches approximately 4 mg l 1 at the outflow at the grt time which is comparable with values found in the drippings from small fractures in the tepui caves mecchia et al 2014 the characteristics of the rock matrix during the arenisation process modelled for the base scenario e 0 300 μm are shown in fig 5 the changes in effective porosity from unaltered rock φ dif 0 0 1 to equilibrium in the arenisation profile φ dif w c r 16 calculated according to eq 11 are described in fig 5a fig 5b shows the shapes of dissolved silica concentration profiles in the rock matrix according to eqs 12 and 13 for concentrations of silica from 0 to 8 mg l 1 possibly found in the fracture the modelled concentration profile does not match exactly with the tail of the porosity curves since concentration reaches saturation at a depth of about 7 cm the flux of silica f m i from the matrix to the fracture is shown in fig 5c as a function of the diffusion porosity in the rock matrix and the concentration of silica in the fracture the graph shows that in the base scenario up to 2 105 mol m 2 s 1 400 mgsio2 m 2 a 1 of dissolved silica are transported by diffusion toward the fracture the effectiveness of the arenisation process in different scenarios can be emphasized by plotting the grt time as a function of different parameters in the base scenario initial fracture aperture of e 0 300 μm or others this type of graph is largely used in the following presentation of the modelling outcomes figs 9 13 it can be noted that grt time is strongly influenced by the initial aperture of the fracture two branches for the curve are observed for e 0 500 μm the grt is reached relatively fast between 80 and 110 ka while for e 0 300 μm a slight decrease in the fracture aperture determines grt times longer by tens of thousands of years in the base scenario an aperture of around 190 μm becomes critical fractures narrower than this critical aperture do not reach the grt in the 2 million years that represent the maximum modelled time fig 9a a poorly known but presumably important parameter used in the modelling is the critical porosity in the layer of grains that faces the fracture i e the maximum value above which the grains are moved out of the system restoring the equilibrium in fact the value φ tot w c r 20 used for the base scenario is not sufficiently supported by experimental evidence and could also be dependent on the water flow velocity in the fracture to verify the importance of this choice grt times obtained using φ tot w c r values of 15 20 and 25 have been compared fig 9b if a 15 total porosity was enough to free the grains from the rock matrix the grt would take place in 70 80 ka for fractures with e 0 between 400 and 1000 μm and a fracture with e 0 185 μm could still reach the grt after approximately 1 8 ma similar results can be obtained with higher values of φ tot w c r showing that this parameter is not the main control of the process in the expected ranges of threshold grain release porosity the influence of the initial effective porosity in the rock matrix is shown in fig 10 by comparing the results for φ dif 0 0 1 to 1 while using the base values for initial total porosity 4 and critical total porosity at the wall 20 the graph shows that the lower value for φ dif 0 reduces the time needed to reach the grt only slightly both at initial apertures of 300 500 and 1000 μm quartz grain size which in turn influences the reactive surface area also exerts an influence on arenisation especially in the narrower fractures fig 11 for example according to the modelling if the rock matrix is composed of grains with a size of 70 μm in a fracture with initial aperture e 0 300 μm base scenario the grt is reached after 128 ka while a grain size of 200 μm produces the same event at t b 224 ka the arenisation process is also temperature dependent because water temperature affects several parameters including the diffusion coefficient and the dissolution kinetics rate a water temperature of 7 c using e 0 300 μm and base values for all other parameters leads to a grt time of 320 ka while a warmer temperature t 27 c shortens this event to 79 ka fig 12 the base scenario with fracture length l 1000 and difference of elevation between inflow and outflow h 300 m represents an actual physical environment found in the tepui region but pathway length depth and hydraulic gradient can obviously assume a wide variety of values to test how these parameters affect the arenisation process the base scenario has been compared with scenarios having the same gradient but lengths from 10 m to 2000 m fig 13a and the same difference of elevation but lengths of 400 m and 5000 m fig 13b these scenarios can represent smaller or greater blocks in a quartz sandstone massif it is interesting to note the existence of a minimum value for grt time independent from length or slope of the fracture given the same water temperature grain size and rock matrix porosity fractures 10 m and 2000 m long require the same time to reach the grt if their initial aperture is e 0 600 μm however shorter and steeper fractures allow the development of the narrower fractures down to apertures as low as the quartz grain size once the grt is reached the steady state enlargement stage begins and the fracture widening follows a linear trend the enlargement rates during this phase are shown in fig 14 for the base scenario for t 17 c the graph shows an enlargement rate of approximately 1 78 mm ka 1 independent of the initial aperture of the fracture this enlargement rate is relatively fast since it would produce a subterranean conduit with a width of 1 m in about 560 ka after the grt time is reached faster or slower enlargement rates are found changing some parameters for example warmer water temperatures produce faster rates 4 27 mm ka 1 at t 27 c and cooler temperatures slower rates 0 69 mm ka 1 at t 7 c concentration of dissolved silica at the fracture outflow that can be interpreted for example as water dripping in a cave passage that intercepts the fracture can also give information on the reliability of the model in the base scenario of the model that considers a 0 12 mg l 1 concentration of silica at the inflow concentration nearly reaches the equilibrium solubility value with respect to quartz 8 66 mg l 1 at 17 c according to rimstidt 1997 only in fractures with initial opening e 0 190 μm whereas in fractures with 300 μm initial aperture it attains a maximum of 4 3 mg l 1 and only up to 0 23 mg l 1 in fractures with e 0 1 mm fig 15a these values are fully compatible with those measured in underground waters dripping from fractures ranging between 0 30 and 8 50 mg l 1 mecchia and piccini 1999 mecchia et al 2014 fig 15b shows the longer time required to reach the grt for coarser grain size and consequently the higher level of silica concentration reached in the fracture 6 discussion 6 1 significance for subsurface weathering and implications to the tepui mountains the tests carried out to evaluate the relevance of quartz dissolution on the fracture walls alone only fracture sub model clearly show that the enlargement rate is extremely low approximately 1 mm in 10 million years for the base scenario fig 7 even over very long geological time scales such as 100 million years during which the fracture should be continuously supplied by infiltrating water the formation of decimeter to meter scale conduits by mere direct quartz dissolution does not seem possible at least at the dissolution rate of the typical reaction between pure water and pure quartz in epigenic conditions on the other hand the model shows that diffusion driven arenisation is a feasible mechanism to achieve enlargement of fractures to the size of cave conduits observed in real environments such as those explored in the tepui region where fracture controlled shafts larger than 10 m are abundant piccini and mecchia 2009 an enlargement rate of about 1 8 mm ka 1 calculated for the base scenario after the grt is reached would allow the formation of a 1 m large conduit in about 560 ka for a fracture continuously fed by water from the surface however to reach the current size the wider conduits found in the tepui region would probably have required several million years as already inferred in piccini and mecchia 2009 a wide range of physical and chemical conditions would allow the arenisation of the rock matrix around the fractures the modelling shows that the arenisation process can be active along extensive fracture paths more than 5 km long if the initial fracture aperture is wide enough such as 1 mm fig 13b however the modelling has focused on the enlargement of steep fractures that cut through a quartz sandstone formation which is typically not more than a few hundred meters thick in the tepui region these sub vertical fractures generally intersect and feed a gently dipping layer having relatively high permeability in which wide cave conduits are found sauro 2014 fig 1 the sandy material produced by the arenisation process is supposed to be transported out of the system by water flowing in these conduits piping the flow velocity in the fracture is thus a key factor controlling solid transport however uncertainties affect the reliable prediction of particle transport in a fracture because of several reasons thus this process and the additional effect of mechanical erosion by fast running turbulent water in the fracture have not been considered in the model according to the model the fracture will enlarge following two major stages of evolution a inception by direct slow dissolution of the fracture walls while the porosity in matrix is developing a profile through diffusion and b steady state enlargement by grain release and porosity profile transfer the grt divides the two stages and is set at a certain degree of porosity of the first layer of rock matrix on the fracture wall in the inception stage the enlargement of the fracture is entirely due to direct dissolution on the fracture walls at a rate of approximately 0 075 mm ma 1 base scenario the water flow in the fracture is slow and laminar and water has a very low concentration of silica as usually found in the tepui region mecchia et al 2014 diffusion and dissolution arenisation develop in the rock matrix around the fracture contributing to increase the silica concentration in the fracture water the concentration along the fracture increases with time and distance from the inflow to the outflow until the grt is reached fig 15 depending on the aperture of the fracture silica concentration can still be very low at the outflow even after a long distance e g 1 km but can also approach saturation if the fracture is very narrow fig 15 silica concentrations close to saturation reported for drippings falling from tiny fractures on cave walls piccini and mecchia 2009 mecchia et al 2014 should represent the outflows of those narrower paths that are still far from reaching the grt fig 15 conversely the low concentrations of silica found in the streams running on the quartz sandstone plateaus and inside caves show that free running waters do not remain enough time in contact with the rock to be significant enriched in silica through the diffusion process the inception stage ends when the grt is reached at the outflow generally after several ten thousands of years from the opening of the fracture the model shows the existence of a minimum time to reach the grt being independent of length steepness and aperture of the fracture but controlled by parameters such as water temperature quartz grain size and also initial porosity in the rock matrix for the base scenario this minimum inception time lasts approximately 90 100 ka for fractures with initial aperture greater than 400 μm fractures narrower than a critical aperture around 190 200 μm for the base scenario do not reach the grt in the 2 million years that represent the longest modelled time achieving grain release at the outflow could probably require several million years and maybe the narrower fractures will never achieve this condition within a feasible geological time unless the pathway length is very short hence the fracture length and initial aperture represent the main controls for the time needed to reach the grt when the grt is reached the stationary stage begins while water still flows in a water filled fracture flow becomes fast and turbulent fig s6 in suppl mat whereas concentration of silica drops almost to the level of its value at the inflow fig 15 the enlargement of the fracture is now entirely dependent on grain release from fracture walls and transfer of the achieved porosity profile inside the fracture walls the rate of fracture enlargement constant in time mainly depends on water temperature and grain size in the rock matrix and is typically included in the range 0 7 4 3 mm ka 1 temperature range 7 27 c so that a 1 m large conduit can form in 230 1400 ka after the grt time the condition of saturation of the fracture can rapidly end if water infiltration rate is not sufficiently high so that air infiltrates the fracture and the water starts flowing as a free film on the fracture walls fig s5 in suppl mat however the process of arenisation can still go on maintaining approximately the same fracture enlargement rate if the flow keeps wetting the walls all year round 6 2 effect of environmental and petrological parameters on the process several authors martini 2000 piccini and mecchia 2009 wray and sauro 2017 and references therein have raised the question why karst landscapes in quartz sandstone are well developed only in specific geographical and geological settings the model presented here provides some interesting information for understanding which are the main environmental parameters that control the development of these weathering features it is clear from the simulation runs that one of the main input parameters controlling the effectiveness of the process is the water temperature fig 12 in cold and temperate regions of the world average temperature below 10 c the timing needed to reach the grt could be twice that required in tropical warm climatic conditions over 20 c this effect has certainly an impact on the distribution of these weathering landforms water availability is also extremely important since the model is considering a constant discharge at the inflow point an assumption that can be satisfied only in areas of the world with high amount of rainfall throughout the year this can happen only in regions like the guyana shield of south america wray 2000 meghalaya in india wray and sauro 2017 or the hunan province in china yang et al 2012 additionally modern relatively dry areas like the northern territories of australia show striking karstic weathering morphologies in quartz sandstone because they were affected by prolonged wetter climate conditions in the past chappell 1991 another parameter that certainly has a control on the degree of arenisation and fracture enlargement is the grain size of the quartz sandstone fractures in fine sandstones reach the grt faster than in coarse ones this implies a diversification of the weathering front development depending on petrological properties also but to a less degree depending on the primary diffusion porosity which can be related also to the presence of clays in the matrix sauro 2014 aubrecht et al 2019 furthermore given that the process acts along extended and complex interconnected fracture networks it is expected that highly fractured strata will reach higher degrees of porosity faster because of the merging of the diffusion dissolution fronts from different fractures through the rock matrix in any case the long times of inception before the stationary enlargement phase in the order of hundreds of thousands of years require specific environmental and petrological conditions coupled with stable geodynamic settings another important parameter controlling the process is the initial fracture aperture as shown by the model outcomes the wider is the original aperture the faster the grt is reached in several cases it has been observed that fractures enlarged by arenisation in quartz sandstones are mainly located on the border of plateaus piccini and mecchia 2009 sauro 2014 wray and sauro 2017 where horizontal tensional stress fields allow opening the fractures from the original few microns to millimeters or even more thus allowing for a faster and effective inception of the arenisation process in the interior of the plateaus where the fractures have an initial aperture in the order of a few microns the process will never reach the grt until scarp retreat and tension release force their aperture over a certain degree these factors have an important control on the development of geomorphic features at the local and regional scale controlling the scarp retreat rate of tabular massifs in quartz sandstone lithologies like the tepuis of south america or the famous table mountain in south africa 7 conclusions the modelling results are in good agreement with previous studies on weathering speleogenesis and water geochemistry in quartz sandstone environments piccini and mecchia 2009 sauro et al 2013 mecchia et al 2014 and clearly highlight the major environmental and petrographical factors controlling weathering processes in these lithologies in similar models applied to classical limestone karst dreybrodt et al 1999 the time needed to reach the stationary enlargement phase comparable to grt in this study depends on the initial fracture aperture covering the range between about 10 thousand and 10 million years according to our model this time range is circa 5 10 times shorter than in quartz sandstone karst in limestone karst the enlargement rate in a water filled fracture has been estimated to proceed at a rate of about 400 200 mm ka 1 dreybrodt et al 1999 approximately 200 times faster than in quartz sandstone karst according to our model these results confirm the slower weathering rates of quartz sandstone landscapes and suggest an age of several millions of years for cave systems in these lithologies however it must be highlighted that advection in the arenised rock matrix has not been included in our model advection surely takes place not only along the fracture but also in the arenised matrix layers when porosity exceeds a certain value and contributes to the transport of silica molecules this would affect the silica concentration profile in the rock matrix and change the flux of silica towards the fracture hence accelerating the arenisation process navarre sitchler et al 2009 thus it is probable that the timing of the process could be slightly overestimated in our model compared to real settings some emphasis should also be addressed on the likelihood that released grains clog the fracture which is not considered in our model in particular if their size is close to the initial fracture aperture this would reduce the water flow and the whole enlargement rate also the model does not consider how the mechanism of piping forces the exit of loose sand from the fracture system moreover the origin of the conduits in the gently dipping bed that is supposed to be intercepted by the sub vertical fractures is not dealt with in this paper because this could involve the presence of inception horizons with different mineralogical composition with respect to the quartz sandstone sauro 2014 our model only considers a single fracture from inflow to outflow but of course a three dimensional network of fractures is expected to exist in real environments finally some parameters such as the effective porosity in the matrix and its relationship with the total porosity during the arenisation process are poorly known and would require a better understanding also in relationship to the presence of clay minerals in the rock matrix aubrecht et al 2019 nonetheless the outcome of the modelling provides for the first time a reliable estimation of the time needed for the formation of karst like features along a fracture network in quartz sandstones it shows the effectiveness of arenisation as a geomorphic process for the formation of cave systems as well as widespread ruiniform landforms described in the tepui massifs and in other similar terrains worldwide acknowledgements we would like to thank marco antonellini for the useful suggestions on how to improve the original manuscript nicola tisato for the analyses of

6621,a hybrid numerical finite differences and semi analytical empirical model has been developed to evaluate the spatial and time scale of chemical weathering along a fracture in quartz sandstones the model is based on the diffusion transport occurring from the bedrock mass toward the fracture walls driven by the sio2 concentration gradient between water in the bedrock pores high silica content and water flowing in the fracture low silica content because of molecular diffusion intergranular water becomes undersaturated with respect to silica this promotes dissolution of quartz at grain boundaries and results in a porosity profile decreasing from the fracture walls toward the rock interior bedrock individual grains are released and gradually removed by the water flowing into the fracture when a critical value of porosity is reached grain release threshold grt this process drastically increases the fracture enlargement rate the model outcomes establish a minimum time of 90 ka to reach the grt this time is independent of length aperture and dip of the fracture but is controlled by parameters such as the initial fracture aperture water temperature quartz grain size and initial bedrock porosity it is attested that the water flowing in the fracture remains undersaturated with respect to silica over very long timescales in the order of 105 years and over very long flow paths in turn this suggests that the extremely slow reaction between quartz and water is the key factor for the formation of subterranean karst like features in quartz sandstone otherwise silica saturation would be reached after short distances and deep weathering in this lithology would be prevented finally the model outcomes were compared to field data from the gran sabana caves venezuela and other quartz sandstone weathering landforms elsewhere showing that dissolution diffusion in the rock matrix is a reliable mechanism for the formation of these peculiar karst like features keywords quartz dissolution silicate karst permeability evolution quartz sandstone hydrology speleogenesis 1 introduction quartz is the most common mineral in the earth crust and because of its hardness and low chemical reactivity also represents the most common component of sedimentary rocks despite the low solubility at the earth s surface environmental conditions quartz rich rocks often display landforms that imply a significant role of dissolution and chemical weathering and many authors did not hesitate to use the term karst referring to this process martini 1979 jennings 1983 piccini 1995 wray 1997a eberhard and sharples 2013 wray and sauro 2017 one of the most renowned and spectacular examples of karst like features in quartz rich rocks is the peculiar landscape of the tepui table mountains in the gran sabana region venezuela guyana and brazil wray 2000 and references therein landforms such as sinkholes ponors shafts and large subterranean passages are interpreted as the result of weathering and erosion boosted by partial subsurface dissolution chalcraft and pye 1984 ghosh 1991 wray 1997b doerr 1999 sauro 2014 similar landforms and morphologies have been described in several quartz sandstone outcrops of the world wray and sauro 2017 like the sydney and kimberley regions of australia young 1988 wray 1995 the black reef quartzite of south africa martini 1979 mozambique aucamp and swart 1991 republic of chad mainguet 1972 niger and libya busche and erbe 1987 minas gerais mato grosso roraima and paranà states in brazil bret 1962 corrêa neto et al 1994 hardt et al 2013 the hunan region in china yang et al 2012 thailand wray 1997a the western european basins of poland and the czech republic vitek 1979 and in the united states mainly in colorado and alabama netoff and shroba 1993 the origin of these landforms was explained through a process called arenisation martini 2000 wray and sauro 2017 which indicates the mechanism of transforming hard granular rocks such as sandstones or granites into loose sand easily eroded and transported by running water arenisation is sometimes related to dissolution of carbonate cement adamovič et al 2013 or clay minerals in the matrix corrêa neto 2000 aubrecht et al 2011 2012 however arenisation is more crucial in quartz sandstone cemented by silica or characterized by interlocked syntaxial overgrowth structures where dissolution directly involves only the quartz grains crystal boundaries white et al 1966 chalcraft and pye 1984 pouylleau and seurin 1985 doerr 1999 piccini and mecchia 2009 similar processes of dissolution are supposed to be active also in deeply buried quartz sandstones having a great importance for the development of secondary porosity in hydrocarbon reservoirs hurst and bjorkum 1986 sauro et al 2014 martini 1984 suggested that dissolution along quartz grain boundaries is due to meteoric water circulating very slowly through the rock matrix advection the water would remain undersaturated with respect to sio2 and therefore chemically aggressive over a long distance because of the extremely slow dissolution kinetics of quartz rimstidt and barnes 1980 wray 1997b fluid advection however does not seem to be an effective mechanism for mass transport at least in the first phase of the process given the small size of intergranular pores in unaltered quartz sandstone garrels et al 1948 the solute transport from pores smaller than 1 µm in diameter is usually controlled by diffusion derjaguin and churaev 1986 aqueous diffusion in fact is generally the dominant transport mechanism within fluid bearing rocks where diffusion occurs along each mineral grain boundary interconnected by continuous fluid films garrels et al 1949 many authors low 1992 sposito 1992 renard and ortoleva 1997 demonstrated that a water film can be trapped in intergranular rock boundaries acting as a diffusion pathway for this reason pressure solution is a well studied mechanism able to enhance dissolution at grain contacts where solute transport through pores can lead to an effective mass transfer renard et al 1999 here we propose a model for the widening of a single fracture in pure quartz sandstones due to coupled processes of dissolution on grain surfaces and molecular diffusion in intergranular pores similar models were widely used to understand the evolution of primary fractures enlarged by pure dissolution in classical carbonate karst dreybrodt 1990 dreybrodt et al 1999 2005 palmer 2000 gabrovšek and dreybrodt 2001 or to evaluate the weathering rate of other lithologies along fractures steefel and lichtner 1998 the understanding of solutional weathering processes in quartz sandstones in epigenic conditions is also very important for the quantification of their contribution to the global silica cycle siever 1957 nonetheless the model only approximates natural conditions since the occurrence of clay minerals and or other silicates is not considered therefore its applicability is mainly related to almost pure quartz sandstones model results aim at understanding 1 the propagation of the arenisation process from the fracture into the rock matrix 2 the concentration of silica along the flow path 3 the fracture enlargement rate 4 the grain release rate 5 the changes in fracture hydraulic conductivity with time the main objective of this research is to evaluate if molecular diffusion through the rock porosity can actually trigger the subsurface weathering process explaining the formation and development of so impressive karst like features and cave systems in quartz sandstones and to quantify the time needed for this process to be an effective morphogenetic agent 2 theoretical background of the model 2 1 hydro geochemical framework the proposed model is inspired by the typical setting of a tabular mountain consisting of a pure quartz sandstone rock where subsurface weathering has produced the enlargement of vertical or steep fracture sets partially draining the local surface runoff to an outflow point on the external cliffs of the massif fig 1 in a quartz sandstone rock water is present in fractures and intergranular pores of the rock matrix the rock matrix is here described as the unfractured rock after ideally sorting out all the minor fractures tullborg and larson 2006 the intergranular pores are supposed to be water filled and the pore water saturated with respect to quartz because of the extremely long residence time 2 2 weathering stages in the model the long term effect of sio2 dissolution and solute transport is simplified in three stages of development fig 2 1 inception stage water filled flow if the water that flows through a fracture is silica undersaturated it dissolves quartz fig 2b and causes the transfer of solute molecules by diffusion from the intergranular pores triggering dissolution on quartz grain boundaries around the fracture fig 2c undersaturation occurs when the fracture connects a sinking point to an outflow and the aperture allows a fast advective flow in this stage the fracture enlarges only through the extremely slow dissolution of quartz grains on the fracture walls after a very long time the porosity of rock close to the fracture reaches a critical value grain release threshold grt some grains are disentangled and released and if the fracture has reached a sufficient aperture the water flow can wash these grains away fig 2d 2 fracture enlargement stage water filled flow as the fracture opening increases by release of quartz grains flow and advection rate increase too whereas the concentration of silica in the fracture water reduces the diffusion dissolution process propagates into the rock matrix maintaining roughly stable porosity and concentration profiles fig 2e 3 fracture enlargement stage free surface film flow when the infiltration flow rate becomes insufficient to fill the fracture the flowing water forms free surface films on the fracture walls even in this changed condition of flow the concentration gradient persists diffusion is active and the arenisation process continues fig 2f if the infiltration of water ends the fracture dries out and arenisation stops 2 3 quartz dissolution the model assumes a very simple chemical system where only pure quartz and pure water are present for quartz dissolution the simplified first order reaction proposed by rimstidt and barnes 1980 for dilute neutral to slightly acidic solutions in water is used 1 s i o 2 s 2 h 2 o l s i o 2 2 h 2 o h 4 s i o 4 a q where s i o 2 2 h 2 o represents all intermediate species between the solid and aqueous states at a given temperature the equilibrium constant of reaction 1 is 2 k eq a h 4 s i o 4 e q a s i o 2 a h 2 o 2 where a h 4 s i o 4 e q is the activity of h4sio4 at equilibrium i e at saturation when the reaction is not at equilibrium and in this case we represent the h4sio4 activity using the symbol a h 4 s i o 4 an activity quotient can be defined as q c a h 4 s i o 4 a s i o 2 a h 2 o 2 and the ratio q c k eq a h 4 s i o 4 a h 4 s i o 4 e q represents the saturation index the infiltration water at the inflow fig 1 is assumed to be undersaturated with respect to quartz whereas temperature is assumed to be constant in time and space throughout each simulation run on the base of the transition state theory the equilibrium constant of reaction 1 can be written as 3 k eq k dis k prec that assumes that the forward and backward rates occur as elementary reactions rimstidt and barnes 1980 described by the rate constants k dis and k prec mol m 2 s 1 for dissolution and precipitation respectively dove and crerar 1990 demonstrated that the rate of reaction 1 i e the number of moles of h4sio4 dissolved with a surface of reacting quartz of 1 m2 per second mol m 2 s 1 can be written as f dis k dis a s i o 2 a h 2 o 2 k prec a h 4 s i o 4 from eqs 2 and 3 k prec k dis a h 4 s i o 4 e q given that at equilibrium a s i o 2 s 1 0 and a h 2 o l 1 0 we have 4 f dis k dis 1 a h 4 s i o 4 a h 4 s i o 4 e q however it is more convenient to express the activities a dimensionless in terms of molality m mol kg 1 as shown in suppl mat the symbols m and m eq will be used instead of m h 4 s i o 4 and m h 4 s i o 4 e q eq 4 can then be written as 5 f dis k dis 1 m m eq and eq 5 will be used in the model according to rimstidt 1997 the model applies the following solubility function for quartz in pure water at the temperature range 0 300 c 6 log m eq 0 0254 1107 12 t 273 15 where t is the temperature of the solution in c whereas the dissolution rate constant k dis mol m 2 s 1 is 7 log k dis 0 7324 3705 12 t 273 15 2 4 solute transport mechanisms the model concerns two mechanisms of mass transport of aqueous h4sio4 diffusion in the rock matrix and advection along an open fracture as soon as the fracture forms a continuous flow path a transfer of solute molecules is supposed to start by diffusion driven by the concentration gradient from the water filled micropores to the water filled fracture diffusion through the aqueous phase in fact has long been thought as the dominant mode of solute transport in matrix micropores garrels et al 1949 diffusion transport initially only occurs in a very small fraction of rock pores surrounding the fracture norton and knapp 1977 measured the magnitude and distribution of the directional diffusion porosity in an unaltered quartz sandstone sample among many other samples of a variety of rocks finding that diffusion took place in a very small volume 0 081 of the total rock when the sample was oriented perpendicular to bedding being total porosity φ tot 4 11 with the aim to avoid too much complexity in the calculation the model does not consider the effect of the advection flow that would occur through the rock pores after the increase of porosity due to the diffusion dissolution process on the other hand along the fracture the mass transport is dominated by the advection of silica molecules at the mean fluid velocity and diffusion contribution to mass transport is negligible the model considers the characteristics of the advective flow along the fracture in both water filled and only partially wet conditions free surface films 3 model structure and sub domains dissolution and transport processes have to be both modelled from the very small scale of micropores in the rock matrix to the scale of the fracture length up to 1 km or more this different scale dependence and the different distribution in physical and chemical properties that characterize fracture and rock matrix are modelled by solving the transport equations using numerical finite differences in the fracture and a hybrid semi analytical empirical approach in the rock matrix this model therefore combines the microscale and macroscale descriptions of the system by splitting the computational routine into two sub models rock matrix and fracture fig s1 in supp mat the advective water flow in the single one dimensional fracture is simulated using a discretized numerical model where pathway distance l is divided in n i small segments that develop along the x axis starting from x 0 using the representative elementary volumes revs approach bachmat and bear 1987 each discrete i element is a rev within a rev all petrophysical and chemical properties are assumed to be constant uniform and smaller than the length scale of the phenomena the ratio between the hydraulic head h fig 1 and l gives the hydraulic gradient j a sketch with the geometrical characteristics used for modelling the fracture rock matrix system is shown in fig 3 in the rock matrix a fixed thickness p next to the fracture is simulated by dividing it in n j thin layers rock matrix revs these j elements parallel to the fracture walls develop along the z axis perpendicular to the planar fracture starting from z 0 fig 4 before starting the simulation it is necessary to set the values for the input parameters required and shared by both rock matrix and fracture sub models initial total porosity initial diffusion porosity critical diffusion or total porosity in the first layer at the fracture wall quartz grain initial size water temperature concentration of dissolved silica at the inflow length and initial breadth of fracture segments the simulation considers an initial condition t 0 where the fracture is continuous from the inflow x 0 to the outflow x l and has uniform initial aperture e 0 wider than the initial diameter of quartz grains δ 0 e 0 δ 0 otherwise the particles would not be carried away through the fracture the fracture width b is assumed to remain constant and much greater than the aperture b e 0 fig 3 in the first time step of simulation water with the concentration of silica c in infiltrates at the inflow point and fills the fracture the surface runoff flow rate that feeds the fracture q s is assumed constant over time and therefore the flow rate in the fracture can only be q s at this time water in all the micropores of the rock matrix is saturated with respect to quartz and the porosity of the rock matrix is uniform and equal to that of unaltered quartzite at the second time step a concentration profile forms along the fracture with silica concentrations increasing from x 0 to x l due to quartz dissolution from the walls and to diffusion of silica molecules from the rock matrix pores a step by step procedure of the model identifying input parameters and equations involved in a simulation run is presented in the flow chart of fig s1 in supp material migration of silica molecules by diffusion starts and the sub model rock matrix calculates 1 the volume of pores in the simulated thickness of rock matrix for all the possible conditions found in a segment of the fracture and the corresponding value of diffusion porosity in the first layer of grains fracture wall 2 the flux of silica molecules from the rock matrix to the fracture for all the possible conditions found in a segment at each time step of a simulation run the results of the sub model rock matrix are then combined with those of the sub model fracture in which for each segment i are calculated 1 the water flow parameters effective in the fracture 2 the concentration of silica 3 the state of the arenisation in the fracture i e if the grain release threshold grt has been exceeded depending on the porosity found at the walls of each segment 4 the enlargement of the fracture 3 1 modelling the rock matrix 3 1 1 weathered thickness of rock matrix the rock matrix sub model is based on field observations and empirical measurements from previous literature on quartz sandstone weathering martini 1984 mecchia and piccini 1999 piccini and mecchia 2009 wray and sauro 2017 weathering arenisation of the host rock is a commonly observed phenomenon in quartzite caves and the occurrence of a centimetric thickness estimated between 5 and 15 cm of friable rock on the walls of cave shafts has been frequently observed during the drilling of bolts into these rock walls wray and sauro 2017 and references therein the depth of the alteration zones increases with time up to a point when a first layer of grains is carried away by the water flow in the fracture from this time on the process evolves in a quasi stationary state the arenisation rate matches the wall retreatment rate due to grains release and a stable concentration and porosity profile forms in the rock matrix 3 1 2 molecular diffusion and reaction transport equations in quasi stationary state in the rock matrix sub model a quasi stationary state lichtner 1988 approach is adopted to approximate the fluid rock interaction and the mass transport in the rock matrix over geologic time spans in a stationary state the difference between the number of silica molecules that leave the rev and those that enter it is balanced by the number of molecules released by dissolution of quartz grains in the same rev fig 4 the time of pore enlargement evolution in a rev of rock matrix is described as a sequence of stationary states each representing concentration of silica porosity surface areas and quartz dissolution rate as functions of distance from the fracture wall fig 4 this approximation is acceptable due to the low kinetics of quartz dissolution at low temperature and the very low porosity of quartzite so that these properties change slowly compared to the time required to establish a stationary state under the steady state conditions quasi stationary state assumed for mass transport in the rock matrix the diffusion flux of h4sio4 molecules dissolved in water according to chemical reaction 1 can be expressed by fick s first law in its one dimensional form 8 f dif k dif ϕ c z where c z is the concentration gradient along the coordinate z in this equation the solute concentration c is given in mol m 3 ϕ φ dif τ 2 dimensionless is the ratio between diffusion porosity and the square of tortuosity τ see table 1 f dif is expressed in mol m 2 s 1 k dif m2 s 1 is the diffusion coefficient of dissolved silica h4sio4 assumed constant at a given temperature tortuosity τ decreases with increasing total porosity φ tot and to represent this relationship we use the empirical equation developed by weissberg 1963 see suppl mat equalising eq 5 to eq 8 and changing molality m mol kg 1 into concentration c mol m 3 the reaction transport equation in the rock matrix diffusion porosity is expressed as 9 k dif ϕ c z k dis 1 c c eq 3 1 3 initial porosity and porosity profile evolution for the purposes of this study we define as diffusion porosity φ dif the fraction of water filled connected pores where diffusion transport through the aqueous phase occurs a residual porosity φ res exists and represents the unconnected pores so that the total porosity φ tot is given by the sum φ dif φ res residual porosity represents most of total porosity in unaltered quartz sandstones in our model the unaltered or initial state of the rock is indicated using the subscript 0 i e φ tot 0 and φ dif 0 for initial total and initial diffusion porosity respectively the initial difference φ tot 0 φ dif 0 φ res is assumed to remain constant all over the arenisation process i e the pores initially not connected are not supposed to join the connected pore path during the weathering process while the interstitial water filled connected micropores are assumed to isolate single grains or groups of grains therefore in our model total porosity in a rock matrix layer j is 10 φ tot j φ dif j φ res where φ dif j is the diffusion porosity in the same layer at t 0 the porosity φ dif 0 is uniform all over the rock matrix when the fracture opens and fills with undersaturated water a silica concentration gradient forms between saturated water in rock matrix micropores and water in the opened fracture activating diffusion from the micropores to the fracture we assume that the weathering of quartz sandstone around the fracture starts in the first layer closest to the fracture the parameters concerning this layer are indicated with the subscript w the wall layer j 1 as soon as the concentration of silica inside the rock matrix micropores drops below the saturation point as a consequence the porosity in the wall layer increases φ dif w φ dif 0 and progressively a porosity profile develops inside the rock matrix up to a distance z max where porosity is the same of unaltered rock φ dif 0 when φ dif w reaches a critical value φ dif w c r the first layer of grains facing the fracture is removed by the flowing water we call this event grain release threshold grt from this time on we suppose that the porosity profile progresses inside the rock matrix at the same rate than the wall retreat details concerning the evolution of porosity profile and of pore volumes in the rock matrix are presented in suppl mat see eq s4 the following equation is adopted to describe diffusion porosity φ dif j along the z axis 11 φ dif j φ dif 0 φ dif w φ dif 0 e z u z the value u is set to 1 10 20 representing the hypothesized profile in agreement with field observations wray and sauro 2017 where the maximum depth of arenisation denoted by the symbol z max is found between 7 and 10 cm from the fracture wall the procedure for the calculation of porosity at the wall j 1 is given in the suppl mat at each time step of simulation the diffusion porosity profile in the rock matrix around each segment of the fracture evolves according to eq 11 in the model the slow and regular increase of porosity in the rock matrix close to the fracture is interrupted when the grt is reached from this moment the arenisation process advances indefinitely on in a quasi stationary state pointing out that equilibrium has been reached between the retreat rate of the fracture wall due to the grains removal and the rock weathering rate the model assumes that the process proceeds at the same time and in the same way at both parallel walls of the fracture the porosity profile is assumed not to change over time whereas the fracture enlarges an example of results derived from eq 11 is shown in fig 5 a where the continuous line represents the diffusion porosity profile when φ dif w φ dif w c r 3 1 4 silica concentration profile during the weathering process of the rock matrix next to the fracture a concentration profile forms and evolves in the layers of the rock matrix at t 0 the boundary conditions are z 0 c c i z z max c c eq but the concentration gradient is not expected to be linear the concentration c i in the fracture is known from the implementation of the sub model fracture an approximate value for the concentration in the first layer c w is calculated by assuming constant porosity in the rock matrix introducing a small error for the special case of constant porosity anikouchine 1967 found the following analytical solution valid under steady state conditions 12 c w c eq c i c eq e x p δ z k dis w c eq δ z k dif ϕ w where ϕ w φ dif w τ w 2 and k dis w k dis a m w the term a m w dimensionless is the reactive surface area effective in a unit area of the first layer parallel to the fracture plane see suppl mat the concentration c j in all the other layers can be calculated rearranging eq 9 13 c j c j 1 1 ϕ j ϕ j 1 c j 1 c j 2 k dis j 1 k dif 1 c j 1 c eq where ϕ j φ dif j τ j 2 and ϕ j 1 φ dif j 1 τ j 1 2 k dif k dif δ z and k dis j k dis a m j in the layer j 2 c j 1 c w and c j 2 c i an example of results derived from eq 13 is shown in fig 5b 3 1 5 results of sub model rock matrix at each step of a simulation run the following results of the sub model rock matrix will be used in the coupled sub model fracture the volume of pores in the thickness p of the rock matrix next to a segment i of the fracture v φ i m3 given by the sum of the pore volumes of the n j layers see suppl mat 14 v φ i j 1 j n j v φ j this value is computed for all the possible conditions found in the fracture the correct value for each segment in the fracture will then be identified by the fracture sub model and used in the same time step of the simulation run the volume of pores v φ i increases at each time step of simulation due to partial dissolution of quartz grains the diffusion porosity in the first layer of pores φ dif w i any diffusion porosity profile through the rock displays a unique value for φ dif w in fact a volume of quartz δ v φ dissolved from the rock matrix corresponds to a precise increase of porosity at the wall δ φ dif w the relationships between φ dif w and v φ are represented by a straight line whose slope and intercept are calculated by rock matrix sub model see suppl mat the flux of dissolved silica from the rock matrix to each segment of the fracture f m i mol m 2 s 1 calculated on the base of eq 8 the diffusion porosity φ dif resulting from chemical reaction varies within the weathered rock matrix thickness and the concentration gradient is not linear f m i can then be determined from the first layer of grains to the fracture 15 f m i k dif ϕ w c w c i where ϕ w φ dif w τ w 2 k dif k dif δ z the flux of silica by diffusion to the fracture should be balanced by the amount of silica dissolved in the weathered rock matrix although the model uses realistic values obtained by previous analytical studies this balance is not perfectly achieved due to the uncertainty of many parameters and to the simplified approach used in the model 3 2 modelling the fracture 3 2 1 advection in water filled fractures the flux of silica molecules mol m 2 s 1 by advection in a water filled fracture fig 2b e is f a v a c where c is the h4sio4 concentration mol m 3 and v a is the velocity of water m s 1 at each step of simulation the model selects the equation governing water flow among those proposed by louis 1974 by determining the flow regime turbulent vs laminar and the fracture roughness the roughness ω dimensionless is defined as the ratio between the height of the asperities and twice the fracture opening see fig 3 the equation includes the values of the opening e m in the given point the hydraulic gradient j dimensionless the kinematic viscosity of water μ m2 s 1 the reynolds number re dimensionless and the gravity acceleration g m s 2 details are given in the suppl mat the enlargement by dissolution of an ideal fracture with initially uniform aperture is more effective in the first tract where solute undersaturation is larger hence the aperture decreases towards the outflow point where the smallest opening will be found at t 0 the fracture is uniform and flow velocity is the same all over the fracture the flow rate can be calculated as 16 q a v a o u t e out b out where b out and e out m are the fracture width and aperture at the outflow respectively and v a o u t is the velocity of water at the outflow once the fracture evolves and is calculated using louis equations the procedure to calculate the increase of silica concentration in the fracture due to the flux of silica from the rock matrix f m i and by direct dissolution of the fracture walls f w i is presented in the suppl mat 3 2 2 advection in water films if the fracture aperture becomes too large the infiltration becomes insufficient to fill the fracture the flow switches to vadose conditions and water flows down the fracture forming a film on the walls fig 2f the transition from water filled to water film conditions is regulated by the inflow discharge versus the fracture enlargement see suppl mat for a detailed explanation all vertical films are naturally wavy carried downstream by ever increasing roll waves composed of liquid lumps flowing over a thin stable substrate however simplified assumptions can be made without significantly invalidating the results of simulations if we assume that the downward film completely wets the fracture surfaces by an uniform sheet of water laminar flow conditions can be applied according to nusselt s theory bird et al 1960 for smooth laminar flow on a surface the uniform film thickness e f m can be predicted as 17 e f 3 q f μ 2 b g c o s α 3 where α is the inclination measured from the vertical μ is the kinematic viscosity of water m2 s 1 and q f is the water discharge m3 s 1 in an unsaturated fracture that has to be divided by 2 if water flows down both the fracture walls a simplified calculation of the mean velocity of the water film is given by 18 v f q f 2 e f b free surface films are found in small aperture as well as in large aperture fractures depending on the available water discharge but the aperture does not directly control the flow rate dragila and wheatcraft 2001 the flux of silica molecules in the water film mol m 2 s 1 is thus given by 19 f f v f c where c is the h4sio4 concentration mol m 3 and v f is the velocity m s 1 of water and silica molecules in the film calculated according to eq 18 4 modelled scenarios a typical scenario inspired to a real setting described by several authors for the tepui table mountains gran sabana between venezuela and brazil where karst like features and caves in quartz sandstone are found doerr 1999 piccini and mecchia 2009 aubrecht et al 2012 has been defined to test the modelling results table 1 the precambrian mataui formation reid 1974 which forms the tepuis has the characteristics of an ideal quartz sandstone for which the model is designed these arenites are commonly made of more than 90 quartz showing the interlocked overgrowth grain structure implemented in the model fig 6 with initial grain sizes δ 0 ranging between 70 and 200 μm base value 100 μm sauro 2014 the model was also tested using ranges of values for those physical and chemical parameters that are variable in nature such as initial quartz grain size fracture aperture and width pathway length and hydraulic gradient water temperature and silica concentration infiltration rate or that are not well known such as diffusion and total porosity in pristine rock critical porosity that determines the disentanglement of quartz grains the time step size was optimized at each run to obtain the most reliable result the range of total porosity values in unaltered rock φ tot 0 was based on porosity from 1 5 to 6 9 measured on samples from the mataui quartzite formation sauro 2014 that agree with those of norton and knapp 1977 the model was tested with total porosity values ranging between 1 and 7 while initial effective porosity for quartz sandstones unaffected by weathering was set in the range 0 1 1 according to the findings of martini 1979 2000 the value φ tot w c r 20 is used in the base scenario as the critical total porosity when grt is reached at the fracture wall values of 15 and 25 were also tested values of e 0 between 100 μm and 1 mm were used in all scenarios to study the influence of the initial fracture aperture fractures with aperture as low as 50 μm have often been documented in these lithologies zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 and 50 1000 μm of e 0 are typically used also in models related to fracture karstification in carbonate rocks dreybrodt 1990 palmer 2000 the average physical and chemical characteristics of water found in the caves of the tepuis mecchia et al 2014 were considered suitable for the model acidic solutions ph 4 5 extremely low mineralisation average electrical conductivity of 15 μs cm 2 temperature range 15 25 c average sio2 concentration at the inflow c in 3 20 10 2 mol m 3 average concentration in stream water measured on the tepui plateaus in the base scenario the fracture is supposed to be fed by a stream with constant discharge of 15 l s 1 that consequently represents the maximum infiltration rate q s the aonda cave system explored in the auyan tepui piccini 1995 mecchia and piccini 1999 inspired a vertical fracture base scenario in which h 300 m while a percolating pathway l 1000 m long was assumed to connect many single fracture segments from inflow to outflow the base value for the percolating pathway is considered approximately three times longer than h because in real settings the water follows a complex and non linear path through the fracture system fig 1 since quartz sandstone thicknesses generally reach a few hundred meters and considering a steep fracture system that connects many single fractures percolating pathways no longer than l 5000 m were tested although the model focuses on a high hydraulic gradient fracture it could also simulate low hydraulic gradient systems and scenarios with inclined fractures were also tried up to the limit case of a gently dipping discontinuity however in this case not all assumptions of the model are acceptable because after the grt is reached the quartz grains cannot be washed away simply by gravity 5 results preliminary tests were carried out to assess the relevance of quartz dissolution on fracture walls alone neglecting the contribution from the diffusion dissolution by the rock matrix sub model the enlargement rate of the fracture achievable in the base scenario is extremely low 9 2 10 5 mm ka 1 some parameters lead to a faster rate for example a water temperature of t 27 c increases the rate to 2 5 10 4 mm ka 1 fig 7 but it is still insufficient to explain the formation of the large conduits observed in nature therefore in natural settings the contribution of both dissolution on the fracture walls and diffusion dissolution in the rock matrix must be considered the outcomes of the coupled sub models for the base scenario and the effect of the most crucial parameters tested for a range of possible values are presented in figs 8 16 to improve readability in the figures the main parameters are given in the following units 1 quartz grain size and the fracture aperture are in μm 2 concentration is in mg sio2 l 1 3 reference to time is in years or thousand years results for the variation of silica concentration along the fracture are shown in fig 8 for the base scenario with e 0 300 μm concentration of silica always increases from the inflow to the outflow and with time until the grt is achieved 149 ka in this case afterwards it abruptly drops nearly to the concentration level at the inflow in the example the highest concentration of dissolved silica reaches approximately 4 mg l 1 at the outflow at the grt time which is comparable with values found in the drippings from small fractures in the tepui caves mecchia et al 2014 the characteristics of the rock matrix during the arenisation process modelled for the base scenario e 0 300 μm are shown in fig 5 the changes in effective porosity from unaltered rock φ dif 0 0 1 to equilibrium in the arenisation profile φ dif w c r 16 calculated according to eq 11 are described in fig 5a fig 5b shows the shapes of dissolved silica concentration profiles in the rock matrix according to eqs 12 and 13 for concentrations of silica from 0 to 8 mg l 1 possibly found in the fracture the modelled concentration profile does not match exactly with the tail of the porosity curves since concentration reaches saturation at a depth of about 7 cm the flux of silica f m i from the matrix to the fracture is shown in fig 5c as a function of the diffusion porosity in the rock matrix and the concentration of silica in the fracture the graph shows that in the base scenario up to 2 105 mol m 2 s 1 400 mgsio2 m 2 a 1 of dissolved silica are transported by diffusion toward the fracture the effectiveness of the arenisation process in different scenarios can be emphasized by plotting the grt time as a function of different parameters in the base scenario initial fracture aperture of e 0 300 μm or others this type of graph is largely used in the following presentation of the modelling outcomes figs 9 13 it can be noted that grt time is strongly influenced by the initial aperture of the fracture two branches for the curve are observed for e 0 500 μm the grt is reached relatively fast between 80 and 110 ka while for e 0 300 μm a slight decrease in the fracture aperture determines grt times longer by tens of thousands of years in the base scenario an aperture of around 190 μm becomes critical fractures narrower than this critical aperture do not reach the grt in the 2 million years that represent the maximum modelled time fig 9a a poorly known but presumably important parameter used in the modelling is the critical porosity in the layer of grains that faces the fracture i e the maximum value above which the grains are moved out of the system restoring the equilibrium in fact the value φ tot w c r 20 used for the base scenario is not sufficiently supported by experimental evidence and could also be dependent on the water flow velocity in the fracture to verify the importance of this choice grt times obtained using φ tot w c r values of 15 20 and 25 have been compared fig 9b if a 15 total porosity was enough to free the grains from the rock matrix the grt would take place in 70 80 ka for fractures with e 0 between 400 and 1000 μm and a fracture with e 0 185 μm could still reach the grt after approximately 1 8 ma similar results can be obtained with higher values of φ tot w c r showing that this parameter is not the main control of the process in the expected ranges of threshold grain release porosity the influence of the initial effective porosity in the rock matrix is shown in fig 10 by comparing the results for φ dif 0 0 1 to 1 while using the base values for initial total porosity 4 and critical total porosity at the wall 20 the graph shows that the lower value for φ dif 0 reduces the time needed to reach the grt only slightly both at initial apertures of 300 500 and 1000 μm quartz grain size which in turn influences the reactive surface area also exerts an influence on arenisation especially in the narrower fractures fig 11 for example according to the modelling if the rock matrix is composed of grains with a size of 70 μm in a fracture with initial aperture e 0 300 μm base scenario the grt is reached after 128 ka while a grain size of 200 μm produces the same event at t b 224 ka the arenisation process is also temperature dependent because water temperature affects several parameters including the diffusion coefficient and the dissolution kinetics rate a water temperature of 7 c using e 0 300 μm and base values for all other parameters leads to a grt time of 320 ka while a warmer temperature t 27 c shortens this event to 79 ka fig 12 the base scenario with fracture length l 1000 and difference of elevation between inflow and outflow h 300 m represents an actual physical environment found in the tepui region but pathway length depth and hydraulic gradient can obviously assume a wide variety of values to test how these parameters affect the arenisation process the base scenario has been compared with scenarios having the same gradient but lengths from 10 m to 2000 m fig 13a and the same difference of elevation but lengths of 400 m and 5000 m fig 13b these scenarios can represent smaller or greater blocks in a quartz sandstone massif it is interesting to note the existence of a minimum value for grt time independent from length or slope of the fracture given the same water temperature grain size and rock matrix porosity fractures 10 m and 2000 m long require the same time to reach the grt if their initial aperture is e 0 600 μm however shorter and steeper fractures allow the development of the narrower fractures down to apertures as low as the quartz grain size once the grt is reached the steady state enlargement stage begins and the fracture widening follows a linear trend the enlargement rates during this phase are shown in fig 14 for the base scenario for t 17 c the graph shows an enlargement rate of approximately 1 78 mm ka 1 independent of the initial aperture of the fracture this enlargement rate is relatively fast since it would produce a subterranean conduit with a width of 1 m in about 560 ka after the grt time is reached faster or slower enlargement rates are found changing some parameters for example warmer water temperatures produce faster rates 4 27 mm ka 1 at t 27 c and cooler temperatures slower rates 0 69 mm ka 1 at t 7 c concentration of dissolved silica at the fracture outflow that can be interpreted for example as water dripping in a cave passage that intercepts the fracture can also give information on the reliability of the model in the base scenario of the model that considers a 0 12 mg l 1 concentration of silica at the inflow concentration nearly reaches the equilibrium solubility value with respect to quartz 8 66 mg l 1 at 17 c according to rimstidt 1997 only in fractures with initial opening e 0 190 μm whereas in fractures with 300 μm initial aperture it attains a maximum of 4 3 mg l 1 and only up to 0 23 mg l 1 in fractures with e 0 1 mm fig 15a these values are fully compatible with those measured in underground waters dripping from fractures ranging between 0 30 and 8 50 mg l 1 mecchia and piccini 1999 mecchia et al 2014 fig 15b shows the longer time required to reach the grt for coarser grain size and consequently the higher level of silica concentration reached in the fracture 6 discussion 6 1 significance for subsurface weathering and implications to the tepui mountains the tests carried out to evaluate the relevance of quartz dissolution on the fracture walls alone only fracture sub model clearly show that the enlargement rate is extremely low approximately 1 mm in 10 million years for the base scenario fig 7 even over very long geological time scales such as 100 million years during which the fracture should be continuously supplied by infiltrating water the formation of decimeter to meter scale conduits by mere direct quartz dissolution does not seem possible at least at the dissolution rate of the typical reaction between pure water and pure quartz in epigenic conditions on the other hand the model shows that diffusion driven arenisation is a feasible mechanism to achieve enlargement of fractures to the size of cave conduits observed in real environments such as those explored in the tepui region where fracture controlled shafts larger than 10 m are abundant piccini and mecchia 2009 an enlargement rate of about 1 8 mm ka 1 calculated for the base scenario after the grt is reached would allow the formation of a 1 m large conduit in about 560 ka for a fracture continuously fed by water from the surface however to reach the current size the wider conduits found in the tepui region would probably have required several million years as already inferred in piccini and mecchia 2009 a wide range of physical and chemical conditions would allow the arenisation of the rock matrix around the fractures the modelling shows that the arenisation process can be active along extensive fracture paths more than 5 km long if the initial fracture aperture is wide enough such as 1 mm fig 13b however the modelling has focused on the enlargement of steep fractures that cut through a quartz sandstone formation which is typically not more than a few hundred meters thick in the tepui region these sub vertical fractures generally intersect and feed a gently dipping layer having relatively high permeability in which wide cave conduits are found sauro 2014 fig 1 the sandy material produced by the arenisation process is supposed to be transported out of the system by water flowing in these conduits piping the flow velocity in the fracture is thus a key factor controlling solid transport however uncertainties affect the reliable prediction of particle transport in a fracture because of several reasons thus this process and the additional effect of mechanical erosion by fast running turbulent water in the fracture have not been considered in the model according to the model the fracture will enlarge following two major stages of evolution a inception by direct slow dissolution of the fracture walls while the porosity in matrix is developing a profile through diffusion and b steady state enlargement by grain release and porosity profile transfer the grt divides the two stages and is set at a certain degree of porosity of the first layer of rock matrix on the fracture wall in the inception stage the enlargement of the fracture is entirely due to direct dissolution on the fracture walls at a rate of approximately 0 075 mm ma 1 base scenario the water flow in the fracture is slow and laminar and water has a very low concentration of silica as usually found in the tepui region mecchia et al 2014 diffusion and dissolution arenisation develop in the rock matrix around the fracture contributing to increase the silica concentration in the fracture water the concentration along the fracture increases with time and distance from the inflow to the outflow until the grt is reached fig 15 depending on the aperture of the fracture silica concentration can still be very low at the outflow even after a long distance e g 1 km but can also approach saturation if the fracture is very narrow fig 15 silica concentrations close to saturation reported for drippings falling from tiny fractures on cave walls piccini and mecchia 2009 mecchia et al 2014 should represent the outflows of those narrower paths that are still far from reaching the grt fig 15 conversely the low concentrations of silica found in the streams running on the quartz sandstone plateaus and inside caves show that free running waters do not remain enough time in contact with the rock to be significant enriched in silica through the diffusion process the inception stage ends when the grt is reached at the outflow generally after several ten thousands of years from the opening of the fracture the model shows the existence of a minimum time to reach the grt being independent of length steepness and aperture of the fracture but controlled by parameters such as water temperature quartz grain size and also initial porosity in the rock matrix for the base scenario this minimum inception time lasts approximately 90 100 ka for fractures with initial aperture greater than 400 μm fractures narrower than a critical aperture around 190 200 μm for the base scenario do not reach the grt in the 2 million years that represent the longest modelled time achieving grain release at the outflow could probably require several million years and maybe the narrower fractures will never achieve this condition within a feasible geological time unless the pathway length is very short hence the fracture length and initial aperture represent the main controls for the time needed to reach the grt when the grt is reached the stationary stage begins while water still flows in a water filled fracture flow becomes fast and turbulent fig s6 in suppl mat whereas concentration of silica drops almost to the level of its value at the inflow fig 15 the enlargement of the fracture is now entirely dependent on grain release from fracture walls and transfer of the achieved porosity profile inside the fracture walls the rate of fracture enlargement constant in time mainly depends on water temperature and grain size in the rock matrix and is typically included in the range 0 7 4 3 mm ka 1 temperature range 7 27 c so that a 1 m large conduit can form in 230 1400 ka after the grt time the condition of saturation of the fracture can rapidly end if water infiltration rate is not sufficiently high so that air infiltrates the fracture and the water starts flowing as a free film on the fracture walls fig s5 in suppl mat however the process of arenisation can still go on maintaining approximately the same fracture enlargement rate if the flow keeps wetting the walls all year round 6 2 effect of environmental and petrological parameters on the process several authors martini 2000 piccini and mecchia 2009 wray and sauro 2017 and references therein have raised the question why karst landscapes in quartz sandstone are well developed only in specific geographical and geological settings the model presented here provides some interesting information for understanding which are the main environmental parameters that control the development of these weathering features it is clear from the simulation runs that one of the main input parameters controlling the effectiveness of the process is the water temperature fig 12 in cold and temperate regions of the world average temperature below 10 c the timing needed to reach the grt could be twice that required in tropical warm climatic conditions over 20 c this effect has certainly an impact on the distribution of these weathering landforms water availability is also extremely important since the model is considering a constant discharge at the inflow point an assumption that can be satisfied only in areas of the world with high amount of rainfall throughout the year this can happen only in regions like the guyana shield of south america wray 2000 meghalaya in india wray and sauro 2017 or the hunan province in china yang et al 2012 additionally modern relatively dry areas like the northern territories of australia show striking karstic weathering morphologies in quartz sandstone because they were affected by prolonged wetter climate conditions in the past chappell 1991 another parameter that certainly has a control on the degree of arenisation and fracture enlargement is the grain size of the quartz sandstone fractures in fine sandstones reach the grt faster than in coarse ones this implies a diversification of the weathering front development depending on petrological properties also but to a less degree depending on the primary diffusion porosity which can be related also to the presence of clays in the matrix sauro 2014 aubrecht et al 2019 furthermore given that the process acts along extended and complex interconnected fracture networks it is expected that highly fractured strata will reach higher degrees of porosity faster because of the merging of the diffusion dissolution fronts from different fractures through the rock matrix in any case the long times of inception before the stationary enlargement phase in the order of hundreds of thousands of years require specific environmental and petrological conditions coupled with stable geodynamic settings another important parameter controlling the process is the initial fracture aperture as shown by the model outcomes the wider is the original aperture the faster the grt is reached in several cases it has been observed that fractures enlarged by arenisation in quartz sandstones are mainly located on the border of plateaus piccini and mecchia 2009 sauro 2014 wray and sauro 2017 where horizontal tensional stress fields allow opening the fractures from the original few microns to millimeters or even more thus allowing for a faster and effective inception of the arenisation process in the interior of the plateaus where the fractures have an initial aperture in the order of a few microns the process will never reach the grt until scarp retreat and tension release force their aperture over a certain degree these factors have an important control on the development of geomorphic features at the local and regional scale controlling the scarp retreat rate of tabular massifs in quartz sandstone lithologies like the tepuis of south america or the famous table mountain in south africa 7 conclusions the modelling results are in good agreement with previous studies on weathering speleogenesis and water geochemistry in quartz sandstone environments piccini and mecchia 2009 sauro et al 2013 mecchia et al 2014 and clearly highlight the major environmental and petrographical factors controlling weathering processes in these lithologies in similar models applied to classical limestone karst dreybrodt et al 1999 the time needed to reach the stationary enlargement phase comparable to grt in this study depends on the initial fracture aperture covering the range between about 10 thousand and 10 million years according to our model this time range is circa 5 10 times shorter than in quartz sandstone karst in limestone karst the enlargement rate in a water filled fracture has been estimated to proceed at a rate of about 400 200 mm ka 1 dreybrodt et al 1999 approximately 200 times faster than in quartz sandstone karst according to our model these results confirm the slower weathering rates of quartz sandstone landscapes and suggest an age of several millions of years for cave systems in these lithologies however it must be highlighted that advection in the arenised rock matrix has not been included in our model advection surely takes place not only along the fracture but also in the arenised matrix layers when porosity exceeds a certain value and contributes to the transport of silica molecules this would affect the silica concentration profile in the rock matrix and change the flux of silica towards the fracture hence accelerating the arenisation process navarre sitchler et al 2009 thus it is probable that the timing of the process could be slightly overestimated in our model compared to real settings some emphasis should also be addressed on the likelihood that released grains clog the fracture which is not considered in our model in particular if their size is close to the initial fracture aperture this would reduce the water flow and the whole enlargement rate also the model does not consider how the mechanism of piping forces the exit of loose sand from the fracture system moreover the origin of the conduits in the gently dipping bed that is supposed to be intercepted by the sub vertical fractures is not dealt with in this paper because this could involve the presence of inception horizons with different mineralogical composition with respect to the quartz sandstone sauro 2014 our model only considers a single fracture from inflow to outflow but of course a three dimensional network of fractures is expected to exist in real environments finally some parameters such as the effective porosity in the matrix and its relationship with the total porosity during the arenisation process are poorly known and would require a better understanding also in relationship to the presence of clay minerals in the rock matrix aubrecht et al 2019 nonetheless the outcome of the modelling provides for the first time a reliable estimation of the time needed for the formation of karst like features along a fracture network in quartz sandstones it shows the effectiveness of arenisation as a geomorphic process for the formation of cave systems as well as widespread ruiniform landforms described in the tepui massifs and in

6622,understanding energy exchange between the atmosphere and the earth s surface is crucial we observed the patterns of energy exchange between the atmosphere and a subalpine meadow in the qilian mountains northwest china over the period of 2014 to 2016 annual variations in energy exchange in study area exhibited drastic differences during time periods of frozen soil and non frozen soil specifically more than 80 and 28 of net radiation rn were converted to sensible heat h during the frozen and non frozen soil periods respectively whereas approximately 17 and 35 of rn were converted to latent heat le during the frozen and non frozen soil periods respectively the non frozen soil period was divided into the pre growth period the growth period and the post growth period the high bowe ratio β values of the pre growth period were 4 34 3 60 and 8 39 in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively in general rapid increases in rn during this period increased the values of h le and soil heat flux g the growth period was defined by a low β value that fluctuated between 0 3 and 0 4 the average β values for the post growth period during 2014 2015 and 2016 were 1 49 3 12 and 2 37 respectively the high decoupling coefficient ω for the growth period indicated that the contribution of rn to le was greater than that of vapor pressure deficit vpd the small value of ω during the other periods indicated that the effect of vpd on le dominated that of other factors the seasonal patterns of energy exchange showed that vegetation phenology is the major factor that affects energy partitioning significantly in the alpine meadow ecosystem in the qilian mountains the annual energy partitioning in the same ecosystem over 3 years was not constant and climate may be the main factor that influences interannual variations in energy exchange keywords energy balance subalpine meadow the qilian mountains sensible heat latent heat 1 introduction the qilian mountains are the water source of the arid hexi region in northwest china grasslands account for a large proportion of the area of the qilian mountains and are dominated by subalpine meadow ecosystems net radiation rn drives various physical and biological processes on the earth s surface eugster et al 2000 kellner 2001 sen 2004 sun et al 2006 reichstein et al 2007 wang et al 2010 coners et al 2016 such as evapotranspiration sensible heat flux soil heat flux and photosynthesis liu and chen 2000 baldocchi et al 2000 gu et al 2005 chen et al 2009 lei and yang 2010 zhang and zhao 2015 the partitioning of net radiation rn into latent heat le sensible heat h and soil heat g in an ecosystem varies with different types of vegetation wilson et al 2002 baldocchi 2003 rajan et al 2010 rodrigues et al 2014 jiang et al 2015 kool et al 2016 a lot of research has been conducted to investigate the energy partitioning in ecosystems with different types of vegetation using the eddy covariance observation system baldocchi et al 2000 reichstein et al 2007 chen et al 2009 swinburn et al 2009 lei and yang 2010 rajan et al 2015 scott et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 most of these research has been carried out in the growing season baldocchi et al 2000 wever et al 2002 hao et al 2007 swinburn et al 2009 scott et al 2016 some research focused on the whole year for instance gu et al 2005 and shang et al 2015 studied energy fluxes in a meadow ecosystem in the qinghai tibetan plateau in the whole year that was divided into the frozen soil period and the non frozen soil period the altitude of the meadow ecosystem in qinghai tibetan plateau is higher than that of qilian mountains and the type of meadow ecosystem is a little different between qinghai tibetan plateau and qilian mountains although energy fluxes of the meadow ecosystem qinghai tibetan plateau have been studied energy partitioning in subalpine meadows in the qilain mountains has not been examined especially the energy partitioning of the subalpine meadow in different periods of time whether energy partitioning into h and le keeps steady in the subalpine meadow is still unanswered energy partitioning varies with time and le is the dominant energy form compared to h during the growing season gu et al 2005 shang et al 2015 which is mainly affected by rn and vapor pressure deficit vpd the decoupling coefficient ω is commonly used to separate the effect of rn on the le from that of vpd a low value of ω corresponds to the relatively high influence of vpd on le otherwise rn exerts the dominant influence on le gu et al 2005 shang et al 2015 valentini et al 1995 reported a ω value of approximately 0 8 for a californian grassland in the pre growth period shang et al 2015 stated that an alpine grassland in maqu china presented a ω value of 0 79 from june to august however the ω values in the qilian mountains remain unknown thus whether rn or vpd strongly influences ecosystem evapotranspiration in this area during the period of vegetation growth remains unclear subalpine meadows in the qilian mountains are affected by human activities grazing is the main form of human activities in the region and has a long history gao et al 2015 which alters the vegetation composition of ecosystems roux et al 2003 changes in vegetation composition in turn result in variations in energy partitioning huang et al 2017 identifying the differences in energy partitioning under grazing and the non grazing conditions is a challenging issue a first step to resolve the issue is to measure the energy partitioning under non grazing condition we hypothesized that temporal variation in energy partitioning is driven by both vegetation phenology and freeze thaw dynamics at the site we characterized energy partitioning for both seasonal and inter annual scales the measurement of energy partitioning on multi year scale taking into account the difference of energy partitioning between the frozen soil period and the non frozen soil period is a novel aspect in this study the objectives of this study were to 1 characterize the patterns of seasonal variation in energy partitioning in a subalpine meadow under non grazing conditions 2 explore the inter annual stability of energy partitioning into h and le and 3 analyze the influence of rn and vpd on le during the growing season 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area was located in the tianlaochi catchment in the middle section of the qilian mountains 38 23 56 38 26 47 n 99 53 57 99 57 10 e fig 1 the area of the tianlaochi catchment was 12 8 km2 with the elevation ranging from 2660 to 4400 m above sea level the area has a typical alpine semi arid climate that has been characterized by long and cold winters and short and warm summers data collected over the period of 2011 to 2016 showed that the mean annual precipitation was 435 5 5 6 mm with 84 2 of precipitation falling over the period of may to september the annual mean temperature in the area ranged from 0 6 c to 2 0 c with mean temperatures of 13 1 c and 12 1 c in january and july respectively gao et al 2015 the soil in the experiment site was mountain grey cinnamon soil the vegetation community in the subalpine meadow mainly consisted of elymus nutans griseb carex siderosticta hance potentilla anserina stipa purpurea griseb herba taraxaci ranunculus japonicus thunb foeniculum vulgare imperata cylindrica ligusticum jeholense and polygonaceae grazing is the main human activities and main grazing animals are yaks and sheep in our study site grazing was severe before the year 2010 and height of plants of subalpine meadow during that time is very low 3 5 cm after the year 2010 grazing was forbidden and the grass began to recover when the experiments were initiated in the year 2014 grasses were recovered very well height of 12 68 cm in our experimental site we measured ecological characteristics of the vegetation community in six replications every year the lai was obtained by accupar lp80 li cor inc lincoln ne usa and height root depth and biomass were measured by a destructive method measured values were averaged across all three years the phenological and ecological characteristics of the vegetation community in the study area were shown in table 1 the landscape of the subalpine meadow in the study area was shown in fig 2 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 meteorological data a comprehensive weather station was set up at the experimental site in 2011 several meteorological variables were continuously monitored using different instruments table 2 measurements were recorded once every 30 min daily data were obtained by averaging or accumulating hourly data meteorological data were collected over the period of 2011 to 2016 2 2 2 flux measurements in 2013 the eddy covariance observation system for the measurement of h le and co2 fluxes was installed in the experimental site at 2 2 m above the ground a co2 h2o infrared analyzer li 7500 li cor inc lincoln ne usa and a three dimensional supersonic anemometer csat 3 campbell scientific inc ut usa were mounted on a horizontal bar that extended from a tower the observation site was surrounded by a fetch with a width of at least 1 km in all directions the co2 h2o sensor was installed downwind of the sonic anemometer the co2 h2o analyzer was calibrated once every 6 months short wave radiation rs from the sky and long wave radiation rl from the land surface were measured with a net radiometer cnr 1 kipp and zonen at 1 5 m above the ground g values were obtained using soil flux plates rebs bellevue wa usa rn was obtained by subtracting rs from rl and partitioned into h le and g by using the following equation 1 r n g h l e s where s is the storage term which can be neglected because its value is usually considerably smaller than the other components gu et al 2005 the energy balance ratio ebr was calculated as follows gu et al 1999 2 ebr le h r n g missing data due to instrument malfunction or power failure are unavoidable and are a universal problem in long term field measurements in addition data quality checks may generate additional gaps in the datasets due to the rejection of unreasonable and contaminated data there were about 3 values that are unreasonable and contaminated and data gaps were filled by linear interpolation using the preceding and following data data analysis showed that the 2014 2015 and 2016 datasets had good integrity flux quality was checked using a widely adopted overall flag system mauder and foken 2004 most of the discarded data mainly occurred during night a method that is similar to the lookup table method was used to fill gaps left by missing or discarded data falge et al 2001 which considered both covariation of fluxes with meteorological variables and the temporal autocorrelation of the fluxes reichstein et al 2007 2 3 data analysis ecosystem surface conductance gc was obtained using the penman monteith equation monteith and unsworth 1990 as follows 3 1 g c ρ c p d γ l e β δ γ 1 g a where d is the vpd kpa cp is the specific heat of air at a constant pressure mj m 2 c 1 γ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 ρ is the air density kg m 3 β is the bowe ratio which is h le δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve at the mean wet bulb temperature of the air kpa c 1 and ga is the air conductance s m 1 which can be calculated using eq 4 monteith and unsworth 1990 as follows 4 1 g a u u 2 6 2 u 0 67 where ga is the air conductance s m 1 u is the friction velocity m

saturation vapor pressure curve at the mean wet bulb temperature of the air kpa c 1 γ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 ga is the air conductance s m 1 and gc is the surface conductance mol m 2 s 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 energy budget closure according to measurements we calculated energy balance ratio ebr by eq 2 the mean ebr for 3 years was 0 75 item le h was underestimated when measured using the eddy covariance method our results fell in the median region of reported energy closures which ranged from 0 55 to 0 99 wilson et al 2002 the lack of energy balance closure from the eddy covariance method has received considerable attention stannard et al 1994 aubinet et al 2000 and has become an important test for the performance of the eddy covariance method anderson et al 1984 mahrt 1998 liu et al 2011 we did not attempt to find a specific explanation for energy imbalance due to several factors might have influenced the lack of energy closure wilson et al 2002 and compensation would be difficult the sensor might sometimes conflate and other types of energy might be present in the study area in addition to rn le h and g although the observation site was surrounded by a fetch with a width of at least 1 km the terrain exhibited uneven elevations in the range of 1 km in view of these factors the energy partitioning may be imbalanced 3 2 temporal variation patterns of energy components rn components included le h and g and the temporal variations in the three components were shown in fig 3 as shown in fig 3a le began to increase in late april and reached its maximum value in late july when high vegetation coverage and soil water brought about the high evapotranspiration le decreased in october when vegetation stopped growing and the soil was frozen le remained low until early april in the following year the seasonal patterns of rn le and g were similar to those of rs figs 3 5 given these similarities rn and rs were connected by contrast the seasonal pattern of h was different from that of the other parameters the mean and maximum values of h over the 3 years were 2 87 0 52 mj m 2 day 1 and 7 88 mj m 2 day 1 respectively some negative daily h values were observed in 2014 and 2015 as illustrated in fig 6b h increased during the first few months of the year peaked in late march and started to decrease and reached its minimum value whereas the maximum lai of vegetation was observed after this period h values started to increase again reached a second peak in october and decreased until the end of the year the value of the g component was slightly lower than that of the other two components over the 3 years fig 3c g values ranged from 8 0 mj m 2 day 1 to 4 0 mj m 2 day 1 and peaked in june when the vegetation lai was relatively small and rs was at the maximum fig 5 the temporal patterns of the three components could be affected by many factors such as time julian day climate vegetation and soil minderlein et al 2015 which first controlled the rn the seasonal variation pattern of rn was closely related to the timing of variations in solar elevation fig 5 the effects of the cloudy and rainy days on rl and rs resulted in frequent interseasonal fluctuations in rn fig 5 land surface featured that consisted of different vegetation soil effects and solar reflectance and incidence affected rn zhang et al 2016 eichelmann et al 2016 studied the partitioning of switchgrass stand on a commercial farm in southern ontario canada they found that h and le played an equal role in dispersing available energy in may and latent heat flux was approximately twice the magnitude of sensible heat flux during the midday hours then sensible heat flux increased and latent heat flux decreased slightly so that the two became comparable in magnitude again lemone 2007 suggested that the energy partitioning of available radiation into h and le was strongly influenced by changes in vegetation characteristics particularly vegetation phenology and these changes caused the dominance of h over le or that of le over h rodrigues et al 2014 our study showed that available radiation was dominated by le and h during the growing season and non growing season respectively fig 3 the switch in dominance had been remarkable for deciduous forests wilson et al 2002 takashi et al 2017 however some reports suggested grassland ecosystem also had the phenomenon because they had distinct phenological changes wever et al 2002 wagle et al 2014 it had been reported le dominated is controlled by soil moisture nevertheless soil moisture did not affect le in our study area during the growing season given that the soil water content of the study area approached field capacity the soil freezing thawing cycle may have critical effects on h during the non growing season gu et al 2005 energy partitioning exhibited distinct seasonal patterns fig 4 the value of le rn increased with increasing of rn which reached the maximum value of approximately 0 6 in july when lai was approximately 3 the h rn rate fluctuated during the non growing season and varied between 0 01 and 0 2 during the growing season its value reached the minimum value in july when most of the solar energy received by the ecosystem was consumed by evapotranspiration and then remained constant during the growing season the dominant component in the energy balance shifted from h to le the g rn ratio remained stable from the end of february until late october but dramatically decreased during the beginning of the frozen soil period from november to february of the following year the large reductions in the g rn ratio corresponded to periods when the daily average temperature of the 5 cm soil layer dropped below 0 c zhang et al 2016 studied the energy exchange over irrigated seed maize agroecosystems in a desert oasis region northwest china and found that le accounted for 67 5 of net radiation and h was 25 0 there was a little difference between zhang s results with our results and the difference might be caused by the differences of study systems and study area 3 3 temporal variations of meteorological variables the temporal variations exhibited by meteorological variables are shown in figs 5 and 6 the characteristic values of meteorological variables and significant differences are shown in table 3 the temporal variations in meteorological variables at different time scales are presented in figs 5 and 6 over the 3 year study period ta ranged from 23 22 c to 18 26 c rn ranged from 0 02 mj m 2 day 1 to 42 19 mj m 2 day 1 and rn was stable table 3 wang et al 2016 classified several stages during a year in the study area according to remarkable variation of ta surface soil in the qilian mountains has been undergoing freezing freezing melting and melting ren et al 2016 although there were noteworthy changes of meteorological variables inter annual variations in the study period were not significant except for swc at the depth of 5 and 10 cm see table 3 the combination of temperature and precipitation in the study area during the growing season table 1 promoted vegetation growth fig 7 which changed the pattern of the energy partitioning good vegetation growth results in high le whereas poor vegetation growth led to high h shang et al 2015 from figs 3 6 the results showed that the trends of ta ts and rh were related to rn le h and g therefore the partitioning of energy fluxes exerted a considerable influence on environmental factors 3 4 variations in energy fluxes during different periods given that energy partitioning patterns during different periods presented distinct differences we divided a year into four periods on the basis of ts5 values we first divided a year into two periods i e the frozen soil period ts5 0 c and the non frozen soil period ts5 0 c we further divided the non frozen period into three sub periods on the basis of bowe ratio β h le the pre growth period with β 1 the growth period with β 1 and the post growth period with β 1 the values of energy components and major meteorological variables distinctly changed over the four periods table 4 and more than 80 and 28 of rn were converted to h during the frozen and non frozen soil periods respectively about 17 and 35 of rn were converted into le during the frozen soil period and non frozen soil period respectively shang et al 2015 found that energy partitioning in a meadow ecosystem in the qinghai tibetan plateau showed distinct seasonal patterns and rn was mainly allocated to h during the winter season 56 by contrast during the wet season le contributed a high proportion of rn 63 the rn values that we recorded for the winter and wet seasons in the study area were 80 higher and 35 lower than those recorded by shang our different results may be attributed to the reduction in human activities and grazing in our study area during the wet season the daily mean values of rn and energy balance components were high during the growth period and were low during the frozen soil period table 4 the high value of the le rn ratio during the growth period suggests that le dominated whereas the high value of the h rn ratio during the frozen soil period suggests h dominated during the frozen soil periods in 2014 2015 and 2016 le was low with mean values of 0 78 1 11 and 0 35 mj m 2 day 1 respectively in 2014 2015 and 2016 h was high with mean values of 2 61 2 88 and 1 98 mj m 2 day 1 respectively moreover in 2014 2015 and 2016 g had small values of 0 24 0 12 and 0 88 mj m 2 day 1 respectively table 4 h and g rapidly increased as rn increased during the time leading up to the pre growth period rn was very low during the frozen soil period under climate warming the frozen soil period will shorten and increase rn therefore the annual pattern of energy exchange will change le and h exhibited the most drastic changes during the growth period specifically le rapidly increased and h decreased given the increase in precipitation and vegetation cover during this period le became the dominant component but h increased again during the post growth period as le and g rapidly decreased le at night was nearly 0 throughout the entirety of the measurement period 3 5 analysis of variations of available radiation and energy balance components the parameters that represent variations of available radiation and energy balance components include α β g c and ω the daily mean values of these parameters in four periods were shown in table 5 α was slightly higher during the frozen soil period than during the three other periods and negligibly changed over the four periods however the daily values of α changed from 0 38 to 0 54 gu et al 2005 found that daily α values for alpine meadows varied between 0 16 and 0 26 the high albedo in our study area may have protected grass species from high radiation during the study period low albedo values were observed in september when grass began to senesce after this period and until december albedo values gradually increased as the degree of dry land surface increased fig 8 β ranged from 0 1 to 19 throughout the entirety of the measurement period fig 8 the low β observed during the growth attributed to the dominance of le the high β values observed during the frozen soil period imply that h was dominant gc is related to le and the pattern of gc at different periods corresponded well to that of le see figs 6 and 9 during the growth period gc began to increase in april and peaked in late july the results indicated that sufficient water was available in the ecosystem when the soil froze in october the value of gc became extremely small rn and vpd affected le zhang et al 2016 and exerted various effects during different periods ω was used to separate the effect of vpd on le from that of rn gu et al 2005 we calculated the daily ω value by using eq 5 table 5 a high ω value suggested that rn had a dominant influence on le and a low ω value indicates that vpd has a strong influence on le jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 shang et al 2015 high ω value during the growth period indicated that the contribution of rn to le was greater than that of vpd the low values of ω during other periods suggested that vpd was dominant vegetation types in the study area have been transformed by human

6622,understanding energy exchange between the atmosphere and the earth s surface is crucial we observed the patterns of energy exchange between the atmosphere and a subalpine meadow in the qilian mountains northwest china over the period of 2014 to 2016 annual variations in energy exchange in study area exhibited drastic differences during time periods of frozen soil and non frozen soil specifically more than 80 and 28 of net radiation rn were converted to sensible heat h during the frozen and non frozen soil periods respectively whereas approximately 17 and 35 of rn were converted to latent heat le during the frozen and non frozen soil periods respectively the non frozen soil period was divided into the pre growth period the growth period and the post growth period the high bowe ratio β values of the pre growth period were 4 34 3 60 and 8 39 in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively in general rapid increases in rn during this period increased the values of h le and soil heat flux g the growth period was defined by a low β value that fluctuated between 0 3 and 0 4 the average β values for the post growth period during 2014 2015 and 2016 were 1 49 3 12 and 2 37 respectively the high decoupling coefficient ω for the growth period indicated that the contribution of rn to le was greater than that of vapor pressure deficit vpd the small value of ω during the other periods indicated that the effect of vpd on le dominated that of other factors the seasonal patterns of energy exchange showed that vegetation phenology is the major factor that affects energy partitioning significantly in the alpine meadow ecosystem in the qilian mountains the annual energy partitioning in the same ecosystem over 3 years was not constant and climate may be the main factor that influences interannual variations in energy exchange keywords energy balance subalpine meadow the qilian mountains sensible heat latent heat 1 introduction the qilian mountains are the water source of the arid hexi region in northwest china grasslands account for a large proportion of the area of the qilian mountains and are dominated by subalpine meadow ecosystems net radiation rn drives various physical and biological processes on the earth s surface eugster et al 2000 kellner 2001 sen 2004 sun et al 2006 reichstein et al 2007 wang et al 2010 coners et al 2016 such as evapotranspiration sensible heat flux soil heat flux and photosynthesis liu and chen 2000 baldocchi et al 2000 gu et al 2005 chen et al 2009 lei and yang 2010 zhang and zhao 2015 the partitioning of net radiation rn into latent heat le sensible heat h and soil heat g in an ecosystem varies with different types of vegetation wilson et al 2002 baldocchi 2003 rajan et al 2010 rodrigues et al 2014 jiang et al 2015 kool et al 2016 a lot of research has been conducted to investigate the energy partitioning in ecosystems with different types of vegetation using the eddy covariance observation system baldocchi et al 2000 reichstein et al 2007 chen et al 2009 swinburn et al 2009 lei and yang 2010 rajan et al 2015 scott et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 most of these research has been carried out in the growing season baldocchi et al 2000 wever et al 2002 hao et al 2007 swinburn et al 2009 scott et al 2016 some research focused on the whole year for instance gu et al 2005 and shang et al 2015 studied energy fluxes in a meadow ecosystem in the qinghai tibetan plateau in the whole year that was divided into the frozen soil period and the non frozen soil period the altitude of the meadow ecosystem in qinghai tibetan plateau is higher than that of qilian mountains and the type of meadow ecosystem is a little different between qinghai tibetan plateau and qilian mountains although energy fluxes of the meadow ecosystem qinghai tibetan plateau have been studied energy partitioning in subalpine meadows in the qilain mountains has not been examined especially the energy partitioning of the subalpine meadow in different periods of time whether energy partitioning into h and le keeps steady in the subalpine meadow is still unanswered energy partitioning varies with time and le is the dominant energy form compared to h during the growing season gu et al 2005 shang et al 2015 which is mainly affected by rn and vapor pressure deficit vpd the decoupling coefficient ω is commonly used to separate the effect of rn on the le from that of vpd a low value of ω corresponds to the relatively high influence of vpd on le otherwise rn exerts the dominant influence on le gu et al 2005 shang et al 2015 valentini et al 1995 reported a ω value of approximately 0 8 for a californian grassland in the pre growth period shang et al 2015 stated that an alpine grassland in maqu china presented a ω value of 0 79 from june to august however the ω values in the qilian mountains remain unknown thus whether rn or vpd strongly influences ecosystem evapotranspiration in this area during the period of vegetation growth remains unclear subalpine meadows in the qilian mountains are affected by human activities grazing is the main form of human activities in the region and has a long history gao et al 2015 which alters the vegetation composition of ecosystems roux et al 2003 changes in vegetation composition in turn result in variations in energy partitioning huang et al 2017 identifying the differences in energy partitioning under grazing and the non grazing conditions is a challenging issue a first step to resolve the issue is to measure the energy partitioning under non grazing condition we hypothesized that temporal variation in energy partitioning is driven by both vegetation phenology and freeze thaw dynamics at the site we characterized energy partitioning for both seasonal and inter annual scales the measurement of energy partitioning on multi year scale taking into account the difference of energy partitioning between the frozen soil period and the non frozen soil period is a novel aspect in this study the objectives of this study were to 1 characterize the patterns of seasonal variation in energy partitioning in a subalpine meadow under non grazing conditions 2 explore the inter annual stability of energy partitioning into h and le and 3 analyze the influence of rn and vpd on le during the growing season 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area was located in the tianlaochi catchment in the middle section of the qilian mountains 38 23 56 38 26 47 n 99 53 57 99 57 10 e fig 1 the area of the tianlaochi catchment was 12 8 km2 with the elevation ranging from 2660 to 4400 m above sea level the area has a typical alpine semi arid climate that has been characterized by long and cold winters and short and warm summers data collected over the period of 2011 to 2016 showed that the mean annual precipitation was 435 5 5 6 mm with 84 2 of precipitation falling over the period of may to september the annual mean temperature in the area ranged from 0 6 c to 2 0 c with mean temperatures of 13 1 c and 12 1 c in january and july respectively gao et al 2015 the soil in the experiment site was mountain grey cinnamon soil the vegetation community in the subalpine meadow mainly consisted of elymus nutans griseb carex siderosticta hance potentilla anserina stipa purpurea griseb herba taraxaci ranunculus japonicus thunb foeniculum vulgare imperata cylindrica ligusticum jeholense and polygonaceae grazing is the main human activities and main grazing animals are yaks and sheep in our study site grazing was severe before the year 2010 and height of plants of subalpine meadow during that time is very low 3 5 cm after the year 2010 grazing was forbidden and the grass began to recover when the experiments were initiated in the year 2014 grasses were recovered very well height of 12 68 cm in our experimental site we measured ecological characteristics of the vegetation community in six replications every year the lai was obtained by accupar lp80 li cor inc lincoln ne usa and height root depth and biomass were measured by a destructive method measured values were averaged across all three years the phenological and ecological characteristics of the vegetation community in the study area were shown in table 1 the landscape of the subalpine meadow in the study area was shown in fig 2 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 meteorological data a comprehensive weather station was set up at the experimental site in 2011 several meteorological variables were continuously monitored using different instruments table 2 measurements were recorded once every 30 min daily data were obtained by averaging or accumulating hourly data meteorological data were collected over the period of 2011 to 2016 2 2 2 flux measurements in 2013 the eddy covariance observation system for the measurement of h le and co2 fluxes was installed in the experimental site at 2 2 m above the ground a co2 h2o infrared analyzer li 7500 li cor inc lincoln ne usa and a three dimensional supersonic anemometer csat 3 campbell scientific inc ut usa were mounted on a horizontal bar that extended from a tower the observation site was surrounded by a fetch with a width of at least 1 km in all directions the co2 h2o sensor was installed downwind of the sonic anemometer the co2 h2o analyzer was calibrated once every 6 months short wave radiation rs from the sky and long wave radiation rl from the land surface were measured with a net radiometer cnr 1 kipp and zonen at 1 5 m above the ground g values were obtained using soil flux plates rebs bellevue wa usa rn was obtained by subtracting rs from rl and partitioned into h le and g by using the following equation 1 r n g h l e s where s is the storage term which can be neglected because its value is usually considerably smaller than the other components gu et al 2005 the energy balance ratio ebr was calculated as follows gu et al 1999 2 ebr le h r n g missing data due to instrument malfunction or power failure are unavoidable and are a universal problem in long term field measurements in addition data quality checks may generate additional gaps in the datasets due to the rejection of unreasonable and contaminated data there were about 3 values that are unreasonable and contaminated and data gaps were filled by linear interpolation using the preceding and following data data analysis showed that the 2014 2015 and 2016 datasets had good integrity flux quality was checked using a widely adopted overall flag system mauder and foken 2004 most of the discarded data mainly occurred during night a method that is similar to the lookup table method was used to fill gaps left by missing or discarded data falge et al 2001 which considered both covariation of fluxes with meteorological variables and the temporal autocorrelation of the fluxes reichstein et al 2007 2 3 data analysis ecosystem surface conductance gc was obtained using the penman monteith equation monteith and unsworth 1990 as follows 3 1 g c ρ c p d γ l e β δ γ 1 g a where d is the vpd kpa cp is the specific heat of air at a constant pressure mj m 2 c 1 γ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 ρ is the air density kg m 3 β is the bowe ratio which is h le δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve at the mean wet bulb temperature of the air kpa c 1 and ga is the air conductance s m 1 which can be calculated using eq 4 monteith and unsworth 1990 as follows 4 1 g a u u 2 6 2 u 0 67 where ga is the air conductance s m 1 u is the friction velocity m

saturation vapor pressure curve at the mean wet bulb temperature of the air kpa c 1 γ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 ga is the air conductance s m 1 and gc is the surface conductance mol m 2 s 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 energy budget closure according to measurements we calculated energy balance ratio ebr by eq 2 the mean ebr for 3 years was 0 75 item le h was underestimated when measured using the eddy covariance method our results fell in the median region of reported energy closures which ranged from 0 55 to 0 99 wilson et al 2002 the lack of energy balance closure from the eddy covariance method has received considerable attention stannard et al 1994 aubinet et al 2000 and has become an important test for the performance of the eddy covariance method anderson et al 1984 mahrt 1998 liu et al 2011 we did not attempt to find a specific explanation for energy imbalance due to several factors might have influenced the lack of energy closure wilson et al 2002 and compensation would be difficult the sensor might sometimes conflate and other types of energy might be present in the study area in addition to rn le h and g although the observation site was surrounded by a fetch with a width of at least 1 km the terrain exhibited uneven elevations in the range of 1 km in view of these factors the energy partitioning may be imbalanced 3 2 temporal variation patterns of energy components rn components included le h and g and the temporal variations in the three components were shown in fig 3 as shown in fig 3a le began to increase in late april and reached its maximum value in late july when high vegetation coverage and soil water brought about the high evapotranspiration le decreased in october when vegetation stopped growing and the soil was frozen le remained low until early april in the following year the seasonal patterns of rn le and g were similar to those of rs figs 3 5 given these similarities rn and rs were connected by contrast the seasonal pattern of h was different from that of the other parameters the mean and maximum values of h over the 3 years were 2 87 0 52 mj m 2 day 1 and 7 88 mj m 2 day 1 respectively some negative daily h values were observed in 2014 and 2015 as illustrated in fig 6b h increased during the first few months of the year peaked in late march and started to decrease and reached its minimum value whereas the maximum lai of vegetation was observed after this period h values started to increase again reached a second peak in october and decreased until the end of the year the value of the g component was slightly lower than that of the other two components over the 3 years fig 3c g values ranged from 8 0 mj m 2 day 1 to 4 0 mj m 2 day 1 and peaked in june when the vegetation lai was relatively small and rs was at the maximum fig 5 the temporal patterns of the three components could be affected by many factors such as time julian day climate vegetation and soil minderlein et al 2015 which first controlled the rn the seasonal variation pattern of rn was closely related to the timing of variations in solar elevation fig 5 the effects of the cloudy and rainy days on rl and rs resulted in frequent interseasonal fluctuations in rn fig 5 land surface featured that consisted of different vegetation soil effects and solar reflectance and incidence affected rn zhang et al 2016 eichelmann et al 2016 studied the partitioning of switchgrass stand on a commercial farm in southern ontario canada they found that h and le played an equal role in dispersing available energy in may and latent heat flux was approximately twice the magnitude of sensible heat flux during the midday hours then sensible heat flux increased and latent heat flux decreased slightly so that the two became comparable in magnitude again lemone 2007 suggested that the energy partitioning of available radiation into h and le was strongly influenced by changes in vegetation characteristics particularly vegetation phenology and these changes caused the dominance of h over le or that of le over h rodrigues et al 2014 our study showed that available radiation was dominated by le and h during the growing season and non growing season respectively fig 3 the switch in dominance had been remarkable for deciduous forests wilson et al 2002 takashi et al 2017 however some reports suggested grassland ecosystem also had the phenomenon because they had distinct phenological changes wever et al 2002 wagle et al 2014 it had been reported le dominated is controlled by soil moisture nevertheless soil moisture did not affect le in our study area during the growing season given that the soil water content of the study area approached field capacity the soil freezing thawing cycle may have critical effects on h during the non growing season gu et al 2005 energy partitioning exhibited distinct seasonal patterns fig 4 the value of le rn increased with increasing of rn which reached the maximum value of approximately 0 6 in july when lai was approximately 3 the h rn rate fluctuated during the non growing season and varied between 0 01 and 0 2 during the growing season its value reached the minimum value in july when most of the solar energy received by the ecosystem was consumed by evapotranspiration and then remained constant during the growing season the dominant component in the energy balance shifted from h to le the g rn ratio remained stable from the end of february until late october but dramatically decreased during the beginning of the frozen soil period from november to february of the following year the large reductions in the g rn ratio corresponded to periods when the daily average temperature of the 5 cm soil layer dropped below 0 c zhang et al 2016 studied the energy exchange over irrigated seed maize agroecosystems in a desert oasis region northwest china and found that le accounted for 67 5 of net radiation and h was 25 0 there was a little difference between zhang s results with our results and the difference might be caused by the differences of study systems and study area 3 3 temporal variations of meteorological variables the temporal variations exhibited by meteorological variables are shown in figs 5 and 6 the characteristic values of meteorological variables and significant differences are shown in table 3 the temporal variations in meteorological variables at different time scales are presented in figs 5 and 6 over the 3 year study period ta ranged from 23 22 c to 18 26 c rn ranged from 0 02 mj m 2 day 1 to 42 19 mj m 2 day 1 and rn was stable table 3 wang et al 2016 classified several stages during a year in the study area according to remarkable variation of ta surface soil in the qilian mountains has been undergoing freezing freezing melting and melting ren et al 2016 although there were noteworthy changes of meteorological variables inter annual variations in the study period were not significant except for swc at the depth of 5 and 10 cm see table 3 the combination of temperature and precipitation in the study area during the growing season table 1 promoted vegetation growth fig 7 which changed the pattern of the energy partitioning good vegetation growth results in high le whereas poor vegetation growth led to high h shang et al 2015 from figs 3 6 the results showed that the trends of ta ts and rh were related to rn le h and g therefore the partitioning of energy fluxes exerted a considerable influence on environmental factors 3 4 variations in energy fluxes during different periods given that energy partitioning patterns during different periods presented distinct differences we divided a year into four periods on the basis of ts5 values we first divided a year into two periods i e the frozen soil period ts5 0 c and the non frozen soil period ts5 0 c we further divided the non frozen period into three sub periods on the basis of bowe ratio β h le the pre growth period with β 1 the growth period with β 1 and the post growth period with β 1 the values of energy components and major meteorological variables distinctly changed over the four periods table 4 and more than 80 and 28 of rn were converted to h during the frozen and non frozen soil periods respectively about 17 and 35 of rn were converted into le during the frozen soil period and non frozen soil period respectively shang et al 2015 found that energy partitioning in a meadow ecosystem in the qinghai tibetan plateau showed distinct seasonal patterns and rn was mainly allocated to h during the winter season 56 by contrast during the wet season le contributed a high proportion of rn 63 the rn values that we recorded for the winter and wet seasons in the study area were 80 higher and 35 lower than those recorded by shang our different results may be attributed to the reduction in human activities and grazing in our study area during the wet season the daily mean values of rn and energy balance components were high during the growth period and were low during the frozen soil period table 4 the high value of the le rn ratio during the growth period suggests that le dominated whereas the high value of the h rn ratio during the frozen soil period suggests h dominated during the frozen soil periods in 2014 2015 and 2016 le was low with mean values of 0 78 1 11 and 0 35 mj m 2 day 1 respectively in 2014 2015 and 2016 h was high with mean values of 2 61 2 88 and 1 98 mj m 2 day 1 respectively moreover in 2014 2015 and 2016 g had small values of 0 24 0 12 and 0 88 mj m 2 day 1 respectively table 4 h and g rapidly increased as rn increased during the time leading up to the pre growth period rn was very low during the frozen soil period under climate warming the frozen soil period will shorten and increase rn therefore the annual pattern of energy exchange will change le and h exhibited the most drastic changes during the growth period specifically le rapidly increased and h decreased given the increase in precipitation and vegetation cover during this period le became the dominant component but h increased again during the post growth period as le and g rapidly decreased le at night was nearly 0 throughout the entirety of the measurement period 3 5 analysis of variations of available radiation and energy balance components the parameters that represent variations of available radiation and energy balance components include α β g c and ω the daily mean values of these parameters in four periods were shown in table 5 α was slightly higher during the frozen soil period than during the three other periods and negligibly changed over the four periods however the daily values of α changed from 0 38 to 0 54 gu et al 2005 found that daily α values for alpine meadows varied between 0 16 and 0 26 the high albedo in our study area may have protected grass species from high radiation during the study period low albedo values were observed in september when grass began to senesce after this period and until december albedo values gradually increased as the degree of dry land surface increased fig 8 β ranged from 0 1 to 19 throughout the entirety of the measurement period fig 8 the low β observed during the growth attributed to the dominance of le the high β values observed during the frozen soil period imply that h was dominant gc is related to le and the pattern of gc at different periods corresponded well to that of le see figs 6 and 9 during the growth period gc began to increase in april and peaked in late july the results indicated that sufficient water was available in the ecosystem when the soil froze in october the value of gc became extremely small rn and vpd affected le zhang et al 2016 and exerted various effects during different periods ω was used to separate the effect of vpd on le from that of rn gu et al 2005 we calculated the daily ω value by using eq 5 table 5 a high ω value suggested that rn had a dominant influence on le and a low ω value indicates that vpd has a strong influence on le jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 shang et al 2015 high ω value during the growth period indicated that the contribution of rn to le was greater than that of vpd the low values of ω during other periods suggested that vpd was dominant vegetation types in the study area have been transformed by human activities for example forests have been transformed into grasslands shrublands have been converted to grasslands and grasslands have been transformed in shrublands or forests changes in vegetation

infiltration and soil water content abril et al 1999 manzano et al 2000 these effects collectively influenced energy partitioning 4 conclusions 1 we characterized the patterns of temporal variation in the energy exchange between the subalpine meadow and the atmosphere in qilian mountains china the annual patterns of energy exchange showed clear distinctions during the frozen and non frozen soil

6623,determining how wells in fractured crystalline bedrock are interconnected is essential in defining contaminant flow paths and in interpreting water quality data from wells although various tracers and geophysical techniques have been used with success the high cost or logistics may restrict their implementation this study demonstrates a low cost technique for identifying fracture connections between wells by combining the dissolved oxygen alteration method doam with cross borehole hydraulic pumping tests following the alteration of the dissolved oxygen do profile in the observation well through bubbler aeration an interconnected well is pumped which results in changes in borehole flow in the aerated observation well the do profile in the observation well is monitored over time to characterize the changes in borehole flow and identify fractures that hydraulically connect to the pumping well the method was demonstrated at three test sites in storrs connecticut each site has two or three interconnecting wells in fractured crystalline bedrock and varying flow conditions the doam successfully identified interconnecting fractures in wells 15 84 m apart keywords borehole dilution testing cross borehole hydraulics fracture flow 1 introduction despite many advancements in methodologies for identifying fracture interconnections and preferential groundwater flow paths between bedrock wells there are still a number of limitations associated with each applied technique conventional tracer tests may involve injection of a tracer into one well and monitoring for the appearance of the tracer in a connecting well and despite some success chuang et al 2016 extensive dilution and limited detection often occurs due to fracture complexity and a long travel time geophysical approaches have included borehole radar methods singha et al 2000 dorn et al 2012 which use reflection and transmission of electromagnetic em waves to determine the lateral extent of fracture zones intersecting a borehole measurable distance from the borehole is primarily dependent on the electrical conductivity of the surrounding material singha et al 2000 and can range from 1 m e g mineralogic clay to around 30 m e g granite or gneiss similarly electrical resistivity tomography ert can be used to map complex hydraulic pathways between connecting boreholes successful ert may require preliminary information such as knowledge of fracture locations and potential understanding of fracture connectivity to constrain ert test design robinson et al 2015 sreeparvathy et al 2019 traditional hydraulic testing entailing the use of straddle packers to isolate individual fractures has been employed day lewis et al 2000 nakao et al 2000 and asymmetric dipole flow tests adfts have expanded on this method with the ability to test for multiple fracture connections between boreholes halihan et al 2005 while hydraulic tests can provide ample information about single and cross well fracture flow packer installation can be a limiting factor in implementation due to expense and logistical difficulty cross borehole hydraulic tests have also been combined with tracer techniques or flow velocity instrumentation marine 1980 bredehoeft and papadopulos 1965 sorey 1971 paillet et al 1987 paillet 2000 le borgne et al 2006a b le borgne et al 2007 paillet 2013 lo et al 2014 to identify alterations in vertical flow rate in a well in response to stressing a connected well borehole temperature alterations during pumping have been used to identify transmissive fractures establish a relationship between temperature variations with depth and borehole flow velocities and to infer fracture connectivity between wells klepikova et al 2014 while the approach advantageously does not entail the addition of a tracer to the flow system the methodology requires inverse modeling to identify how small temperature changes may be affected by flow another cross borehole hydraulic test approach has involved the use of flute liners to generate a pulse and monitor for the pressure response in a connected well persaud et al 2018 limitations associated with flute liner installation are typically related to expense in this study we demonstrate a cost effective approach to identify fracture connections between open crystalline bedrock wells by combining the dissolved oxygen alteration method doam with cross borehole hydraulic testing 1 1 dissolved oxygen alteration method the dissolved oxygen alteration method doam is a borehole dilution method originally developed for identifying transmissive fractures and characterizing flow and water quality in single wells chlebica and robbins 2013 vitale and robbins 2016 vitale and robbins 2017a b the original method involves aerating a well using a porous polypropylene bubbler connected to a compressed air tank then profiling dissolved oxygen do over time under ambient or induced flow conditions since background do concentrations in groundwater are low relative to the aerated well inflowing transmissive fractures are identified by the depths where do concentrations become diluted vertical movement is determined by movement of diluted low do water and by vertical shifts in the do profile over the timescales of testing it was determined that flow was the primary factor controlling changes in do concentrations in the well and that changes associated with biotic or abiotic reactions were negligible gas tracers are advantageous over liquid tracers since the injection of air into a well can be controlled to maintain the well s hydraulic head to prevent impacting flow conditions furthermore since the solubility of gases increase with increased pressure a gas concentration profile will increase with depth allowing vertical movement in the profile to be easily detected for these reasons the method has proven to be more sensitive than heat pulse flow meters for very low flow rates chlebica and robbins 2013 vitale and robbins 2017a and more sensitive than tracers that begin with a uniform concentration in the water column libby and robbins 2012 while other chemical tracers may have regulatory requirements on concentration and mass recovery due to their toxicity air injection does not making do an advantageous tracer for testing in drinking water wells there are potential limitations to the method associated with do solubility in very shallow wells or in wells with shallow fed fractures near surface aerated do concentrations may not differ greatly from naturally occurring do concentrations making dilution very difficult to identify it is also important to control aerated do concentrations at large depths high pressures since increased gas solubility can cause do to rise rapidly during aeration and may exceed the upper detection limits of the instrumentation this can generally be accommodated through a shortened bubbling duration for sites where this may present a concern the do sensor can be positioned above the bubbler during aeration to monitor concentrations at depth this aeration adjustment is described for site specific examples in this study the method can be successfully implemented with do concentrations below full saturation which reduces any risk associated with degassing as water flows vertically upward in the wellbore aerating to do concentrations below full saturation also reduces time spent on aeration other best practices include controlling air injection rates so there is no change in water level a rise in the water column will occur if air injection pressure is too high appropriate air injection pressure determined by the height of water overlying the bubbler that must be overcome to aerate the well in previous studies chlebica and robbins 2013 vitale and robbins 2016 vitale and robbins 2017a the doam has been applied to single well tests to quantify in well flow characteristics this study expands the doam by applying the technique to cross borehole hydraulic testing for identifying interconnecting fractures between crystalline bedrock wells with distances ranging from 15 to 84 m 2 method theory the method described here relies on the alteration of ambient flow conditions in an observation well in response to pumping a hydraulically connecting well it is assumed that changes in hydraulic head in each well are primarily due to pumping and that naturally occurring hydraulic head changes are negligible vertical flow in a well is controlled by hydraulic head differences between fractures pumping a connecting well will lower the hydraulic head in the connected fractures in the observation well the hydraulic head changes in these fractures alter in well vertical hydraulic gradients and flow conditions in the observations well to assess changes in flow ambient flow conditions must be known for comparison it is also valuable to have identified all transmissive fractures in each well even if they are not active under ambient flow conditions the originally developed doam chlebica and robbins 2013 can be applied to assess in well flow under ambient and single well pumping conditions after which cross well testing can be employed in this study interpretations of the doam application for cross well hydraulic tests assume quasi steady state over the duration of the tests when assessing cross well pumping do profiles the rate and direction of flow is compared to flow under ambient conditions a conceptual model is shown in fig 1 demonstrating how flow conditions in an observation well might change in response to pumping a connected well that contain two or three transmissive fractures and one or two connected fractures respectively flow changes in response to cross well pumping can vary widely depending on each fracture s transmissivity and change in head over the duration of testing the conceptual model provides a multi fracture connection example fig 1f j where connecting fractures are assumed to have similar transmissivities and changes in hydraulic head when analyzing flow profiles vertical flow changes within each active flow zone between transmissive fractures must be assessed specific to what is known about the well s fracture conditions in the do profiles estimates of flow rate are assessed by how much the profile has shifted vertically the flow conditions during cross well pumping are compared directly to ambient flow conditions to assess changes in hydraulic gradients between fractures and to infer which fractures are connected to the pumping well through a lowered hydraulic head it is critical to have identified transmissive fractures and ambient flow conditions prior to interpretation of cross well pumping data because although inflow is indicated very early in each test due to dilution outflow is inferred from vertical motion of the do profile over time knowledge of transmissive fracture depths and ambient or pumping in well flow conditions is necessary in identifying changes in flow in response to cross well pumping 3 site application cross well doam tests were implemented at three test sites at the university of connecticut in storrs connecticut all wells are drilled into the hebron gneiss rogers 1985 an interlayered dark gray schist and fine to medium grained calc silicate gneiss and overlaid by glacial till flow rates comparing ambient flow to cross well pumping flow were estimated using the method from chlebica and robbins 2013 3 1 site 1 beach hall this site is comprised of two connected open borehole wells sima 1 and sima 2 which are 15 2 cm in diameter and 91 m deep casing depth is 9 m for each well the wells are 27 m apart and flow is generally to the northeast from sima 1 to sima 2 with a hydraulic gradient of 0 12 downhole geophysical tests cagle 2005 and tracer studies libby and robbins 2012 chlebica and robbins 2013 have been performed on each well and transmissive fractures and in well flow conditions have been characterized table 1 sima 1 and 2 are known to be connected based on observed cross well drawdown during pumping tests cagle 2005 tracer testing has been unsuccessfully employed to determine how the two wells are interconnected by injecting salt cassanelli 2011 rhodamine libby 2012 and do chlebica 2013 into one well and monitoring for the tracer in the other well fracture complexity and dilution are likely responsible for the lack of tracer detection 3 1 1 beach hall methods although past studies cagle 2005 libby 2012 chlebica 2013 could not identify connection depth between sima 1 and sima 2 using tracers pumping tests in combination with tracers suggested that the connection likely occurs in the upper 30 m based on this testing at this site focused on the upper 30 m in each well to investigate the effectiveness of the doam in identifying interconnecting fractures the cross well profiles collected in the tests in this study were compared against the ambient profiles collected by chlebica and robbins 2013 since water levels in each well were consistent between tests dissolved oxygen profiles were collected at this site using an optical instrumentation northwest inw do sensor initial testing was conducted using sima 1 as the observation well after collecting a background do profile in sima 1 the bubbler was positioned at 30 m below top of casing and the well was aerated for 20 min a do profile was taken immediately following aeration a submersible pump franklin electric model 2445049004 was then positioned in sima 2 around 10 m below top of casing and pumped at a rate of 11 lpm drawdown was observed in sima 1 after 60 min profiles were collected 2 h and 3 5 h after drawdown began in sima 1 3 h and 4 5 h after aeration maximum drawdown during profiling in sima 1 was 3 cm and in sima 2 was 1 8 m increasing the horizontal hydraulic gradient between the wells to 0 19 from 0 12 the 4 5 hour pumping profile was then compared to the 5 5 hour ambient profile collected by chlebica and robbins 2013 to determine flow change in response to pumping after the water level in both wells recovered the procedure was reversed sima 2 was aerated at 30 5 m for 30 min and an aerated profile was collected the pump was positioned in sima 1 at 30 m and pumped at a rate of 11 lpm responsive drawdown began in sima 2 after 66 min a do profile collected 6 5 h after aeration was compared to a 5 5 hour ambient flow profile collected by chlebica and robbins 2013 maximum drawdown during profiling was 8 5 m in sima 1 and 0 3 m in sima 2 resulting in a horizontal hydraulic gradient of 0 19 toward sima 1 3 1 2 beach hall results and discussion fig 2 shows the do profiles for sima 1 under ambient flow conditions water flows into sima 1 at 16 m and then flows downward in the wellbore chlebica and robbins 2013 as indicated by dilution near 16 m and downward spreading of low do water in the cross well pumping test after 4 5 h a sharper decrease in do is observed at 16 m after 4 5 h of pumping compared to the 5 5 hour ambient profile there is still an apparent downward flow and possible dispersion indicated by downward spreading of low do below the 16 m fracture 0 03 lpm compared to 0 06 lpm ambient flow from table 1 this suggests that a downward hydraulic gradient likely still exists during cross well pumping or may be residual from ambient flow that occurs prior to the observation well s drawdown response to pumping the flow observations obtained from the cross well pumping do profiles indicate a decrease in the downward hydraulic gradient below 16 m and a stronger flow through component at the fracture inferring the 16 m fracture in sima 1 having a hydraulic connection to sima 2 the flow rates detected during this cross well pumping test are below the lower detection limit of most standard flowmeters emphasizing the sensitivity of the doam for this application the water level in sima 2 during this test and during chlebica and robbins 2013 corresponds to high water level ambient flow conditions table 1 with inflow at 11 and 13 m outflow at 44 m and vertically downward flow throughout the wellbore fig 3 shows the do profiles from sima 2 when comparing the ambient and cross well pumping profiles after 5 5 h there is no measurable change in flow below 23 m depth notably the apparent inflowing fracture at 23 m depth was not previously identified during ambient flow or single well pumping tests which may have been masked by low spatial resolution measurements compared to the ambient profile there is less dilution in do concentrations between 11 and 13 m in the cross well pumping profile there is also a lesser downward shifting in the do profile between 13 and 23 m during cross well pumping estimated flow rate of 0 14 lpm compared to 0 25 lpm ambient flow from chlebica and robbins 2013 this indicates that during cross well pumping the downward hydraulic gradient in this zone decreases due to a decreased hydraulic head in the 11 13 m inflowing fracture zone inferring a hydraulic connection to sima 1 in both tests the vertical resolution of measurements may have played a role in the observations and conclusions of the do profiles to verify the doam interpretation in sima 1 and sima 2 an inflatable plug cherne multi sized test ball was used in each well to isolate the connecting fracture while the opposite well was pumped in sima 1 the plug was positioned at 18 3 m and pressurized to ensure a seal the pump was positioned in the upper water column in sima 2 a drawdown response was observed in sima 1 after 60 min of pumping sima 2 pumping continued for an additional 60 min 120 total minutes of pumping resulting in a final drawdown of 27 cm in sima 1 after allowing water level to recover in both wells the plug was positioned in sima 2 at 18 3 m and sealed the pump was positioned in the upper water column of sima 1 a drawdown response was observed in sima 2 after 55 min pumping continued for an additional hour resulting in a total drawdown of 1 1 m in sima 2 the drawdown response to pumping while isolating the uppermost fractures confirmed the hydraulic connection of the 16 m fracture in sima 1 and the 11 13 m fracture zone in sima 2 and that interpretations of do profiles during cross well pumping tests were reliable in identifying these fracture connections this was further supported by hydraulic head measurements flahive 2017 which demonstrated that despite a water level difference of approximately 3 m between each well the hydraulic head of the uppermost fracture in sima 2 184 2 m amsl is similar to the water level in sima 1 184 4 m amsl 3 2 site 2 usgs branch of hydrogeophysics bgas three connected wells bgas 1 bgas 2 and bgas 3 are located at the usgs branch of hydrogeophysics office at the university s depot campus near storrs connecticut well dimensions are described in table 2 each well is cased through the overburden to bedrock brainerd and robbins 2004 performed tracer tests using uranine dye on bgas 1 and bgas 3 and identified transmissive fractures under single well pumping conditions flahive 2017 performed a single packer test to quantify fracture transmissivities water contributing fractures brainerd and robbins 2004 and their transmissivities flahive 2017 are also shown in table 2 phillips et al 2017 used various flow meters to quantify vertical flow in the wells the electromagnetic flow meter emfm and spinner flow meter sfm did not detect any vertical flow the heat pulse flow meter measured vertical flow in bgas 1 table 2 however the flow rate below the fractures at 15 and 40 m were below the lower detection limit of the mount sopris hpfm used lower limit of 0 11 lpm and the results do not account for volume loss between the downward 0 11 lpm flow below 30 m and the 0 04 lpm flow below 40 m the hpfm could not detect ambient flow in bgas 3 phillips et al 2017 3 2 1 usgs bgas methods to confirm depths of previously identified transmissive fractures brainerd and robbins 2004 phillips et al 2017 and to assess flow conditions the doam was applied to each well under ambient flow conditions and during single well pumping for bgas 1 a background profile of do was collected using a ysi sonde 6600 multimeter the bubbler was then positioned at the bottom of the well and the well was aerated for approximately 10 min an aerated profile of the well was then collected with the multimeter under ambient flow conditions profiles were collected in bgas 1 after 60 min 3 h 21 h and 45 h ambient transmissive inflowing and outflowing fractures and vertical flow directions were identified from the profiles the well was then re aerated and profiled a submersible pump franklin electric model 2445049004 was positioned near the top of the water column and pumped at 5 5 lpm for 20 min achieving a drawdown of 1 m after the water level recovered the well was profiled again and transmissive fractures were identified similarly the doam was applied to bgas 3 after collection of an aerated profile ambient profiles were collected after 2 5 h and 17 h to identify transmissive fractures and vertical flow direction for the pumping test after aeration the pump was positioned near the top of the water column and pumped at 5 5 lpm for 25 min achieving a drawdown of 1 m after water level recovered the well was profiled again and transmissive fractures were identified after identifying transmissive fractures and establishing single well flow conditions in bgas 1 and bgas 3 the cross well doam test was performed between bgas 1 observation well and bgas 2 pumping well and between bgas 3 observation well and bgas 2 pumping well bgas 1 and bgas 3 were aerated and profiled the pump was then positioned in bgas 2 and pumped at a rate of 5 5 lpm the water levels were monitored in all three wells drawdown was observed in bgas 1 and bgas 3 within 2 min of pumping while continuing to pump bgas 1 profiles were collected after 60 min drawdown 2 40 m and 3 h drawdown 3 74 m bgas 3 profiles were collected after 30 min drawdown 1 81 m and 2 5 h drawdown 3 27 m total drawdown in bgas 2 pumping well was 5 15 m 3 2 2 usgs bgas results and discussion under ambient flow conditions in bgas 1 fig 4 a the doam identified an inflowing fracture zone at 9 15 m and at the bottom of the well near 73 m evident from do dilution the fractures at 9 m and 15 m could not be distinguished individually using the doam as established in brainerd and robbins 2004 but rather appear as a combined zone of inflow vertical flow in the well is downward from 15 m to 40 m indicated by the downward spreading of low do water above 40 m flow was identified as vertically upward below 40 m shown by an increase in do from the upward shift in the profile these vertical flows converge at the outflowing 40 m fracture under single well pumping conditions fig 4b fractures at 30 m 40 m and 73 m were all inflowing although not evident in the do profile it is assumed that inflow continues at 9 15 m during the single well pumping test since the fracture is inflowing under ambient flow conditions evidence of inflow in this zone may have been masked during water level recovery with higher do concentrations from below moving upward this draws attention to the importance of assessing ambient flow conditions in addition to single well pumping conditions prior to advanced testing so transmissive fractures and flow conditions can be accurately characterized vertical flow throughout the well was upward toward the pump shown by the increase in do in the active flow zones between fractures transmissive fractures identified using the doam agree with those identified in brainerd and robbins 2004 except for the inflowing fracture at 73 m which was not previously identified the method employed by brainerd and robbins 2004 identified fractures by locating displacements in the uranine dye profile above and below each transmissive fracture the inability of brainerd and robbins 2004 to identify the 73 m fracture is likely due to its position at the bottom of the well the inability for various flowmeters to detect flow phillips et al 2017 is likely due to vertical flow rates below the detection limit of each instrument to determine which fractures in bgas 1 were hydraulically connected to bgas 2 during the cross well pumping test cross well pumping profiles in bgas 1 were compared to ambient flow profiles cross well pumping profiles fig 4c indicate inflow at 9 15 m and at 73 m converging to outflow at 30 m the change in flow pattern and reversal of flow direction in the 30 m fracture suggests a lowering of the hydraulic head in the 30 m fracture in bgas 1 during cross well pumping indicating a transmissive connection to bgas 2 although changes in the profile seem to indicate and upward flow between 30 m and 40 m the changes in do concentrations are small it is possible that a connection could also occur at 40 m since increases in do below that depth are more substantial a longer pumping duration or higher resolution measurements at this well depth could perhaps delineate this more clearly under ambient flow conditions in bgas 3 fig 5 a inflowing fractures occur at 9 m and 73 m evident by dilution of do concentrations vertical flow converges to an outflowing fracture at 30 m downward flow of diluted do above and upward shift of do concentrations below during the single well pumping test inflow occurred at 30 m and 73 m fig 5b similar to bgas 1 fig 4b although the do profile does not indicate inflow at 9 m while pumping it is assumed to be inflowing since inflow occurs under ambient flow conditions flow in the well was vertically upward toward the pump the doam identified the 30 m fracture in agreement with brainerd and robbins 2004 the fractures at 9 m and 73 m identified through the doam were likely unidentified by brainerd and robbins 2004 due to the technique used dissolved oxygen profiles indicate that flow direction in bgas 3 is maintained during cross well pumping between bgas 3 and bgas 2 however comparing the 2 5 hour ambient do profile to the 2 5 hour cross well pumping do profile fig 5c indicates an increase in flow rate during cross well pumping the diluted zone above 30 m migrates farther down the wellbore estimated downward flow of 0 12 lpm compared to 0 06 lpm ambient flow and below 30 m there is a greater upward shift in the do profile estimated upward flow of 0 24 lpm compared to 0 15 lpm ambient flow the increase in flow rate points to an increased hydraulic gradient throughout the wellbore by lowering the hydraulic head in the 30 m fracture inferring a transmissive connection to bgas 2 3 3 site 3 plant science and landscape architecture psla farm the psla farm has three bedrock pumping wells used for irrigation and four wells for monitoring water levels and water quality monitoring well 2 mw 2 exhibits a strong drawdown response during the pumping of pumping well 1 pw 1 mw 2 is 185 m deep and cased through the overburden down to 12 2 m pw 1 is 185 m deep and cased through the overburden down to 16 7 m both wells are 15 25 cm in diameter mw 2 and pw 1 are approximately 84 m apart allowing the assessment of cross well doam tests over a large distance 3 3 1 psla farm methods the doam was applied to mw 2 to characterize flow conditions under ambient conditions and during single well pumping after collecting a background do profile with the ysi sonde 6600 multimeter the bubbler was positioned at the bottom of the well and the well was aerated for 5 min due to the height of the water column above the bubbler a short bubbling duration was chosen to prevent aerated do concentrations at the bottom of the well from exceeding the upper concentration detection limit of the do sensor 70 mg l after collecting an aerated profile additional profiles were collected after 5 h and 25 h to characterize ambient flow conditions the well was re aerated and a do profile was collected the pump franklin electric model 2445049004 was then positioned approximately 7 5 m below the top of the water column and water was pumped at a rate of 5 5 lpm for 15 min until a drawdown of 6 m was achieved after water level recovery a post pumping do profile was collected to identify which fractures in mw 2 are transmissively connected to pw 1 do profiles in mw 2 were monitored while pw 1 was pumped after aerating and profiling mw 2 the pump in pw 1 was turned on from the pump control house at a rate of 56 lpm drawdown was observed in mw 2 within 5 min a do profile was collected 4 5 h after drawdown began during profiling drawdown in the observation well mw 2 was 4 4 5 5 m water levels in pw 1 were not accessible cross well pumping do profiles were then interpreted and compared to ambient in well flow downhole geophysical logging caliper gamma heat pulse flowmeter was employed to substantiate the findings of the doam fracture depths and in well flow conditions under ambient flow conditions and during cross well pumping the depth to water in mw 2 during the doam tests and during downhole logging were comparable at approximately 21 2 m below top of casing pw 1 was pumped at the same rate 56 lpm during both cross well pumping tests 3 3 2 psla farm results and discussion under ambient flow conditions fig 6 a there is upward vertical flow between 125 m and 185 m with inflow occurring near 185 m and outflow near 125 m flow conditions are indicated by increased do concentrations below 125 m there was no observed ambient flow above 125 m after 25 25 h during the single well pumping test fig 6b a drawdown of 6 m resulted in flow reversal in the 125 m fracture inflow was also observed at 185 m during the single well pumping test as expected vertical flow was upward toward the pump throughout the wellbore as indicated by the increase in do concentrations above each fracture during cross well pumping fig 6c the do profile shows little evidence of vertical flow between 125 m and 185 m over the pumping duration indicating a decrease in upward hydraulic gradient compared to ambient flow estimated to be 0 03 lpm fig 6a a longer pumping duration could indicate that upward flow is still present however substantially decreased from flow observed during ambient flow conditions this flow change can be achieved by lowering the hydraulic head in the 185 m fracture inferring that the 185 m fracture is hydraulically connected to the pumping well a diluted do zone is still observed near the bottom of the well suggesting that water may be flowing through the fracture to the pumping well above 125 m the water column within the casing falls downward in response to pumping which is indicated by the downward shift in the do profile which then flows out at 125 m this is indicated by the downward shift in the do profile the change from a stagnant water column under ambient flow conditions to downward flow during cross well pumping indicates an increase in downward hydraulic gradient above 125 m which can be achieved through lowering the hydraulic head in the 125 m fracture while flow conditions point toward both fractures having a hydraulic connection to pw 1 the hydraulic head in the 185 m fracture likely experience a larger decrease in hydraulic head to allow for the decreased hydraulic gradient between 125 and 185 m indicating a more transmissive connection the results from downhole geophysical logging are shown in table 3 under ambient flow conditions vertical flow was not detected with the heat pulse flow meter presumably due to flow rates below the detectability limit of the instrument the transmissive fracture at 185 m identified with the doam was not identified during geophysical logging possibly since instrumentation has physical limitations preventing measurement of the bottom 30 cm of the well during cross well pumping downward flows of 0 04 lpm were measured above the 125 m fracture using the heat pulse flowmeter although heat pulse flowmeter data are limited in scope measurements are consistent with observations made from the doam with consideration for low flow rates 4 conclusion this study has demonstrated the ability of the doam to identify interconnecting fractures between crystalline bedrock wells when combined with cross borehole hydraulic testing the method can be used over large distances and has been shown to characterize cross well flow conditions in environments with multiple interconnecting fractures the doam can be advantageous over heat pulse flowmeters due to its highly sensitive detection of low flow rates the low cost and ease of access to necessary equipment allows the doam to be employed independently which may be particularly beneficial for the initial stages of contaminant pathway studies or to provide preliminary information for executing more extensive fracture flow path characterization e g borehole radar ert hydraulic testing with packers or flute liners since dissolved oxygen acts conservatively over the timescales of testing the doam may be appropriate for quantitative modeling applications of conservative tracer tests quantitative modeling of doam profiles may be able to provide additional information such as precise changes in fracture hydraulic head and transmissivity to aid in identification of fracture connections particularly when multiple fractures may be connected and how an

6623,determining how wells in fractured crystalline bedrock are interconnected is essential in defining contaminant flow paths and in interpreting water quality data from wells although various tracers and geophysical techniques have been used with success the high cost or logistics may restrict their implementation this study demonstrates a low cost technique for identifying fracture connections between wells by combining the dissolved oxygen alteration method doam with cross borehole hydraulic pumping tests following the alteration of the dissolved oxygen do profile in the observation well through bubbler aeration an interconnected well is pumped which results in changes in borehole flow in the aerated observation well the do profile in the observation well is monitored over time to characterize the changes in borehole flow and identify fractures that hydraulically connect to the pumping well the method was demonstrated at three test sites in storrs connecticut each site has two or three interconnecting wells in fractured crystalline bedrock and varying flow conditions the doam successfully identified interconnecting fractures in wells 15 84 m apart keywords borehole dilution testing cross borehole hydraulics fracture flow 1 introduction despite many advancements in methodologies for identifying fracture interconnections and preferential groundwater flow paths between bedrock wells there are still a number of limitations associated with each applied technique conventional tracer tests may involve injection of a tracer into one well and monitoring for the appearance of the tracer in a connecting well and despite some success chuang et al 2016 extensive dilution and limited detection often occurs due to fracture complexity and a long travel time geophysical approaches have included borehole radar methods singha et al 2000 dorn et al 2012 which use reflection and transmission of electromagnetic em waves to determine the lateral extent of fracture zones intersecting a borehole measurable distance from the borehole is primarily dependent on the electrical conductivity of the surrounding material singha et al 2000 and can range from 1 m

traditional hydraulic testing entailing the use of straddle packers to isolate individual fractures has been employed day lewis et al 2000 nakao et al 2000 and asymmetric dipole flow tests adfts have expanded on this method with the ability to test for multiple fracture connections between boreholes halihan et al 2005 while hydraulic tests can provide ample information about single and cross well fracture flow packer installation can be a limiting factor in implementation due to expense and logistical difficulty cross borehole hydraulic tests have also been combined with tracer techniques or flow velocity instrumentation marine 1980 bredehoeft and papadopulos 1965 sorey 1971 paillet et al 1987 paillet 2000 le borgne et al 2006a b le borgne et al 2007 paillet 2013 lo et al 2014 to identify alterations in vertical flow rate in a well in response to stressing a connected well borehole temperature alterations during pumping have been used to identify transmissive fractures establish a relationship between temperature variations with depth and borehole flow velocities and to infer fracture connectivity between wells klepikova et al 2014 while the approach advantageously does not entail the addition of a tracer to the flow system the methodology requires inverse modeling to identify how small temperature changes may be affected by flow another cross borehole hydraulic test approach has involved the use of flute liners to generate a pulse and monitor for the pressure response in a connected well persaud et al 2018 limitations associated with flute liner installation are typically related to expense in this study we demonstrate a cost effective approach to identify fracture connections between open crystalline bedrock wells by combining the dissolved oxygen alteration method doam with cross borehole hydraulic testing 1 1 dissolved oxygen alteration method the dissolved oxygen alteration method doam is a borehole dilution method originally developed for identifying transmissive fractures and characterizing flow and water quality in single wells chlebica and robbins 2013 vitale and robbins 2016 vitale and robbins 2017a b the original method involves aerating a well using a porous polypropylene bubbler connected to a compressed air tank then profiling dissolved oxygen do over time under ambient or induced flow conditions since background do concentrations in groundwater are low relative to the aerated well inflowing transmissive fractures are identified by the depths where do concentrations become diluted vertical movement is determined by movement of diluted low do water and by vertical shifts in the do profile over the timescales of testing it was determined that flow was the primary factor controlling changes in do concentrations in the well and that changes associated with biotic or abiotic reactions were negligible gas tracers are advantageous over liquid tracers since the injection of air into a well can be controlled to maintain the well s hydraulic head to prevent impacting flow conditions furthermore since the solubility of gases increase with increased pressure a gas concentration profile will increase with depth allowing vertical movement in the profile to be easily detected for these reasons the method has proven to be more sensitive than heat pulse flow meters for very low flow rates chlebica and robbins 2013 vitale and robbins 2017a and more sensitive than tracers that begin with a uniform concentration in the water column libby and robbins 2012 while other chemical tracers may have regulatory requirements on concentration and mass recovery due to their toxicity air injection does not making do an advantageous tracer for testing in drinking water wells there are potential limitations to the method associated with do solubility in very shallow wells or in wells with shallow fed fractures near surface aerated do concentrations may not differ greatly from naturally occurring do concentrations making dilution very difficult to identify it is also important to control aerated do concentrations at large depths high pressures since increased gas solubility can cause do to rise rapidly during aeration and may exceed the upper detection limits of the instrumentation this can generally be accommodated through a shortened bubbling duration for sites where this may present a concern the do sensor can be positioned above the bubbler during aeration to monitor concentrations at depth this aeration adjustment is described for site specific examples in this study the method can be successfully implemented with do concentrations below full saturation which reduces any risk associated with degassing as water flows vertically upward in the wellbore aerating to do concentrations below full saturation also reduces time spent on aeration other best practices include controlling air injection rates so there is no change in water level a rise in the water column will occur if air injection pressure is too high appropriate air injection pressure determined by the height of water overlying the bubbler that must be overcome to aerate the well in previous studies chlebica and robbins 2013 vitale and robbins 2016 vitale and robbins 2017a the doam has been applied to single well tests to quantify in well flow characteristics this study expands the doam by applying the technique to cross borehole hydraulic testing for identifying interconnecting fractures between crystalline bedrock wells with distances ranging from 15 to 84 m 2 method theory the method described here relies on the alteration of ambient flow conditions in an observation well in response to pumping a hydraulically connecting well it is assumed that changes in hydraulic head in each well are primarily due to pumping and that naturally occurring hydraulic head changes are negligible vertical flow in a well is controlled by hydraulic head differences between fractures pumping a connecting well will lower the hydraulic head in the connected fractures in the observation well the hydraulic head changes in these fractures alter in well vertical hydraulic gradients and flow conditions in the observations well to assess changes in flow ambient flow conditions must be known for comparison it is also valuable to have identified all transmissive fractures in each well even if they are not active under ambient flow conditions the originally developed doam chlebica and robbins 2013 can be applied to assess in well flow under ambient and single well pumping conditions after which cross well testing can be employed in this study interpretations of the doam application for cross well hydraulic tests assume quasi steady state over the duration of the tests when assessing cross well pumping do profiles the rate and direction of flow is compared to flow under ambient conditions a conceptual model is shown in fig 1 demonstrating how flow conditions in an observation well might change in response to pumping a connected well that contain two or three transmissive fractures and one or two connected fractures respectively flow changes in response to cross well pumping can vary widely depending on each fracture s transmissivity and change in head over the duration of testing the conceptual model provides a multi fracture connection example fig 1f j where connecting fractures are assumed to have similar transmissivities and changes in hydraulic head when analyzing flow profiles vertical flow changes within each active flow zone between transmissive fractures must be assessed specific to what is known about the well s fracture conditions in the do profiles estimates of flow rate are assessed by how much the profile has shifted vertically the flow conditions during cross well pumping are compared directly to ambient flow conditions to assess changes in hydraulic gradients between fractures and to infer which fractures are connected to the pumping well through a lowered hydraulic head it is critical to have identified transmissive fractures and ambient flow conditions prior to interpretation of cross well pumping data because although inflow is indicated very early in each test due to dilution outflow is inferred from vertical motion of the do profile over time knowledge of transmissive fracture depths and ambient or pumping in well flow conditions is necessary in identifying changes in flow in response to cross well pumping 3 site application cross well doam tests were implemented at three test sites at the university of connecticut in storrs connecticut all wells are drilled into the hebron gneiss rogers 1985 an interlayered dark gray schist and fine to medium grained calc silicate gneiss and overlaid by glacial till flow rates comparing

been characterized table 1 sima 1 and 2 are known to be connected based on observed cross well drawdown during pumping tests cagle 2005 tracer testing has been unsuccessfully employed to determine how the two wells are interconnected by injecting salt cassanelli 2011 rhodamine libby 2012 and do chlebica 2013 into one well and monitoring for the tracer in the other well fracture complexity and dilution are likely responsible for the lack of tracer detection 3 1 1 beach hall methods although past studies cagle 2005 libby 2012 chlebica 2013 could not identify connection depth between sima 1 and sima 2 using tracers pumping tests in combination with tracers suggested that the connection likely occurs in the upper 30 m based on this testing at this site focused on the upper 30 m in each well to investigate the effectiveness of the doam in identifying interconnecting fractures the cross well profiles collected in the tests in this study were compared against the ambient profiles collected by chlebica and robbins 2013 since water levels in each well were consistent between tests dissolved oxygen profiles were collected at this site using an optical instrumentation northwest inw do sensor initial testing was conducted using sima 1 as the observation well after collecting a background do profile in sima 1 the bubbler was positioned at 30 m below top of casing and the well was aerated for 20 min a do profile was taken immediately following aeration a submersible pump franklin electric model 2445049004 was then positioned in sima 2 around 10 m below top of casing and pumped at a rate of 11 lpm drawdown was observed in sima 1 after 60 min profiles were collected 2 h and 3 5 h after drawdown began in sima 1 3 h and 4 5 h after aeration maximum drawdown during profiling in sima 1 was 3 cm and in sima 2 was 1 8 m increasing the horizontal hydraulic gradient between the wells to 0 19 from 0 12 the 4 5 hour pumping profile was then compared to the 5 5 hour ambient profile collected by chlebica and robbins 2013 to determine flow change in response to pumping after the water level in both wells recovered the procedure was reversed sima 2 was aerated at 30 5 m for 30 min and an aerated profile was collected the pump was positioned in sima 1 at 30 m and pumped at a rate of 11 lpm responsive drawdown began in sima 2 after 66 min a do profile collected 6 5 h after aeration was compared to a 5 5 hour ambient flow profile collected by chlebica and robbins 2013 maximum drawdown during profiling was 8 5 m in sima 1 and 0 3 m in sima 2 resulting in a horizontal hydraulic gradient of 0 19 toward sima 1 3 1 2 beach hall results and discussion fig 2 shows the do profiles for sima 1 under ambient flow conditions water flows into sima 1 at 16 m and then flows downward in the wellbore chlebica and robbins 2013 as indicated by dilution near 16 m and downward spreading of low do water in the cross well pumping test after 4 5 h a sharper decrease in do is observed at 16 m after 4 5 h of pumping compared to the 5 5 hour ambient profile there is still an apparent downward flow and possible dispersion indicated by downward spreading of low do below the 16 m fracture 0 03 lpm compared to 0 06 lpm ambient flow from table 1 this suggests that a downward hydraulic gradient likely still exists during cross well pumping or may be residual from ambient flow that occurs prior to the observation well s drawdown response to pumping the flow observations obtained from the cross well pumping do profiles indicate a decrease in the downward hydraulic gradient below 16 m and a stronger flow through component at the fracture inferring the 16 m fracture in sima 1 having a hydraulic connection to sima 2 the flow rates detected during this cross well pumping test are below the lower detection limit of most standard flowmeters emphasizing the sensitivity of the doam for this application the water level in sima 2 during this test and during chlebica and robbins 2013 corresponds to high water level ambient flow conditions table 1 with inflow at 11 and 13 m outflow at 44 m and vertically downward flow throughout the wellbore fig 3 shows the do profiles from sima 2 when comparing the ambient and cross well pumping profiles after 5 5 h there is no measurable change in flow below 23 m depth notably the apparent inflowing fracture at 23 m depth was not previously identified during ambient flow or single well pumping tests which may have been masked by low spatial resolution measurements compared to the ambient profile there is less dilution in do concentrations between 11 and 13 m in the cross well pumping profile there is also a lesser downward shifting in the do profile between 13 and 23 m during cross well pumping estimated flow rate of 0 14 lpm compared to 0 25 lpm ambient flow from chlebica and robbins 2013 this indicates that during cross well pumping the downward hydraulic gradient in this zone decreases due to a decreased hydraulic head in the 11 13 m inflowing fracture zone inferring a hydraulic connection to sima 1 in both tests the vertical resolution of measurements may have played a role in the observations and conclusions of the do profiles to verify the doam interpretation in sima 1 and sima 2 an inflatable plug cherne multi sized test ball was used in each well to isolate the connecting fracture while the opposite well was pumped in sima 1 the plug was positioned at 18 3 m and pressurized to ensure a seal the pump was positioned in the upper water column in sima 2 a drawdown response was observed in sima 1 after 60 min of pumping sima 2 pumping continued for an additional 60 min 120 total minutes of pumping resulting in a final drawdown of 27 cm in sima 1 after allowing water level to recover in both wells the plug was positioned in sima 2 at 18 3 m and sealed the pump was positioned in the upper water column of sima 1 a drawdown response was observed in sima 2 after 55 min pumping continued for an additional hour resulting in a total drawdown of 1 1 m in sima 2 the drawdown response to pumping while isolating the uppermost fractures confirmed the hydraulic connection of the 16 m fracture in sima 1 and the 11 13 m fracture zone in sima 2 and that interpretations of do profiles during cross well pumping tests were reliable in identifying these fracture connections this was further supported by hydraulic head measurements flahive 2017 which demonstrated that despite a water level difference of approximately 3 m between each well the hydraulic head of the uppermost fracture in sima 2 184 2 m amsl is similar to the water level in sima 1 184 4 m amsl 3 2 site 2 usgs branch of hydrogeophysics bgas three connected wells bgas 1 bgas 2 and bgas 3 are located at the usgs branch of hydrogeophysics office at the university s depot campus near storrs connecticut well dimensions are described in table 2 each well is cased through the overburden to bedrock brainerd and robbins 2004 performed tracer tests using uranine dye on bgas 1 and bgas 3 and identified transmissive fractures under single well pumping conditions flahive 2017 performed a single packer test to quantify fracture transmissivities water contributing fractures brainerd and robbins 2004 and their transmissivities flahive 2017 are also shown in table 2 phillips et al 2017 used various flow meters to quantify vertical flow in the wells the electromagnetic flow meter emfm and spinner flow meter sfm did not detect any vertical flow the heat pulse flow meter measured vertical flow in bgas 1 table 2 however the flow rate below the fractures at 15 and 40 m were below the lower detection limit of the mount sopris hpfm used lower limit of 0 11 lpm and the results do not account for volume loss between the downward 0 11 lpm flow below 30 m and the 0 04 lpm flow below 40 m the hpfm could not detect ambient flow in bgas 3 phillips et al 2017 3 2 1 usgs bgas methods to confirm depths of previously identified transmissive fractures brainerd and robbins 2004 phillips et al 2017 and to assess flow conditions the doam was applied to each well under ambient flow conditions and during single well pumping for bgas 1 a background profile of do was collected using a ysi sonde 6600 multimeter the bubbler was then positioned at the bottom of the well and the well was aerated for approximately 10 min an aerated profile of the well was then collected with the multimeter under ambient flow conditions profiles were collected in bgas 1 after 60 min 3 h 21 h and 45 h ambient transmissive inflowing and outflowing fractures and vertical flow directions were identified from the profiles the well was then re aerated and profiled a submersible pump franklin electric model 2445049004 was positioned near the top of the water column and pumped at 5 5 lpm for 20 min achieving a drawdown of 1 m after the water level recovered the well was profiled again and transmissive fractures were identified similarly the doam was applied to bgas 3 after collection of an aerated profile ambient profiles were collected after 2 5 h and 17 h to identify transmissive fractures and vertical flow direction for the pumping test after aeration the pump was positioned near the top of the water column and pumped at 5 5 lpm for 25 min achieving a drawdown of 1 m after water level recovered the well was profiled again and transmissive fractures were identified after identifying transmissive fractures and establishing single well flow conditions in bgas 1 and bgas 3 the cross well doam test was performed between bgas 1 observation well and bgas 2 pumping well and between bgas 3 observation well and bgas 2 pumping well bgas 1 and bgas 3 were aerated and profiled the pump was then positioned in bgas 2 and pumped at a rate of 5 5 lpm the water levels were monitored in all three wells drawdown was observed in bgas 1 and bgas 3 within 2 min of pumping while continuing to pump bgas 1 profiles were collected after 60 min drawdown 2 40 m and 3 h drawdown 3 74 m bgas 3 profiles were collected after 30 min drawdown 1 81 m and 2 5 h drawdown 3 27 m total drawdown in bgas 2 pumping well was 5 15 m 3 2 2 usgs bgas results and discussion under ambient flow conditions in bgas 1 fig 4 a the doam identified an inflowing fracture zone at 9 15 m and at the bottom of the well near 73 m evident from do dilution the fractures at 9 m and 15 m could not be distinguished individually using the doam as established in brainerd and robbins 2004 but rather appear as a combined zone of inflow vertical flow in the well is downward from 15 m to 40 m indicated by the downward spreading of low do water above 40 m flow was identified as vertically upward below 40 m shown by an increase in do from the upward shift in the profile these vertical flows converge at the outflowing 40 m fracture under single well pumping conditions fig 4b fractures at 30 m 40 m and 73 m were all inflowing although not evident in the do profile it is assumed that inflow continues at 9 15 m during the single well pumping test since the fracture is inflowing under ambient flow conditions evidence of inflow in this zone may have been masked during water level recovery with higher do concentrations from below moving upward this draws attention to the importance of assessing ambient flow conditions in addition to single well pumping conditions prior to advanced testing so transmissive fractures and flow conditions can be accurately characterized vertical flow throughout the well was upward toward the pump shown by the increase in do in the active flow zones between fractures transmissive fractures identified using the doam agree with those identified in brainerd and robbins 2004 except for the inflowing fracture at 73 m which was not previously identified the method employed by brainerd and robbins 2004 identified fractures by locating displacements in the uranine dye profile above and below each transmissive fracture the inability of brainerd and robbins 2004 to identify the 73 m fracture is likely due to its position at the bottom of the well the inability for various flowmeters to detect flow phillips et al 2017 is likely due to vertical flow rates below the detection limit of each instrument to determine which fractures in bgas 1 were hydraulically connected to bgas 2 during the cross well pumping test cross well pumping profiles in bgas 1 were compared to ambient flow profiles cross well pumping profiles fig 4c indicate inflow at 9 15 m and at 73 m converging to outflow at 30 m the change in flow pattern and reversal of flow direction in the 30 m fracture suggests a lowering of the hydraulic head in the 30 m fracture in bgas 1 during cross well pumping indicating a transmissive connection to bgas 2 although changes in the profile seem to indicate and upward flow between 30 m and 40 m the changes in do concentrations are small it is possible that a connection could also occur at 40 m since increases in do below that depth are more substantial a longer pumping duration or higher resolution measurements at this well depth could perhaps delineate this more clearly under ambient flow conditions in bgas 3 fig 5 a inflowing fractures occur at 9 m and 73 m evident by dilution of do concentrations vertical flow converges to an outflowing fracture at 30 m downward flow of diluted do above and upward shift of do concentrations below during the single well pumping test inflow occurred at 30 m and 73 m fig 5b similar to bgas 1 fig 4b although the do profile does not indicate inflow at 9 m while pumping it is assumed to be inflowing since inflow occurs under ambient flow conditions flow in the well was vertically upward toward the pump the doam identified the 30 m fracture in agreement with brainerd and robbins 2004 the fractures at 9 m and 73 m identified through the doam were likely unidentified by brainerd and robbins 2004 due to the technique used dissolved oxygen profiles indicate that flow direction in bgas 3 is maintained during cross well pumping between bgas 3 and bgas 2 however comparing the 2 5 hour ambient do profile to the 2 5 hour cross well pumping do profile fig 5c indicates an increase in flow rate during cross well pumping the diluted zone above 30 m migrates farther down the wellbore estimated downward flow of 0 12 lpm compared to 0 06 lpm ambient flow and below 30 m there is a greater upward shift in the do profile estimated upward flow of 0 24 lpm compared to 0 15 lpm ambient flow the increase in flow rate points to an increased hydraulic gradient throughout the wellbore by lowering the hydraulic head in the 30 m fracture inferring a transmissive connection to bgas 2 3 3 site 3 plant science and landscape architecture psla farm the psla farm has three bedrock pumping wells used for irrigation and four wells for monitoring water levels and water quality monitoring well 2 mw 2 exhibits a strong drawdown response during the pumping of pumping well 1 pw 1 mw 2 is 185 m deep and cased through the overburden down to 12 2 m pw 1 is 185 m deep and cased through the overburden down to 16 7 m both wells are 15 25 cm in diameter mw 2 and pw 1 are approximately 84 m apart allowing the assessment of cross well doam tests over a large distance 3 3 1 psla farm methods the doam was applied to mw 2 to characterize flow conditions under ambient conditions and during single well pumping after collecting a background do profile with the ysi sonde 6600 multimeter the bubbler was positioned at the bottom of the well and the well was aerated for 5 min due to the height of the water column above the bubbler a short bubbling duration was chosen to prevent aerated do concentrations at the bottom of the well from exceeding the upper concentration detection limit of the do sensor 70 mg l after collecting an aerated profile additional profiles were collected after 5 h and 25 h to characterize ambient flow conditions the well was re aerated and a do profile was collected the pump franklin electric model 2445049004 was then positioned approximately 7 5 m below the top of the water column and water was pumped at a rate of 5 5 lpm for 15 min until a drawdown of 6 m was achieved after water level recovery a post pumping do profile was collected to identify which fractures in mw 2 are transmissively connected to pw 1 do profiles in mw 2 were monitored while pw 1 was pumped after aerating and profiling mw 2 the pump in pw 1 was turned on from the pump control house at a rate of 56 lpm drawdown was observed in mw 2 within 5 min a do profile was collected 4 5 h after drawdown began during profiling drawdown in the observation well mw 2 was 4 4 5 5 m water levels in pw 1 were not accessible cross well pumping do profiles were then interpreted and compared to ambient in well flow downhole geophysical logging caliper gamma heat pulse flowmeter was employed to substantiate the findings of the doam fracture depths and in well flow conditions under ambient flow conditions and during cross well pumping the depth to water in mw 2 during the doam tests and during downhole logging were comparable at approximately 21 2 m below top of casing pw 1 was pumped at the same rate 56 lpm during both cross well pumping tests 3 3 2 psla farm results and discussion under ambient flow conditions fig 6 a there is upward vertical flow between 125 m and 185 m with inflow occurring near 185 m and outflow near 125 m flow conditions are indicated by increased do concentrations below 125 m there was no observed ambient flow above 125 m after 25 25 h during the single well pumping test fig 6b a drawdown of 6 m resulted in flow reversal in the 125 m fracture inflow was also observed at 185 m during the single well pumping test as expected vertical flow was upward toward the pump throughout the wellbore as indicated by the increase in do concentrations above each fracture during cross well pumping fig 6c the do profile shows little evidence of vertical flow between 125 m and 185 m over the pumping duration indicating a decrease in upward hydraulic gradient compared to ambient flow estimated to be 0 03 lpm fig 6a a longer pumping duration could indicate that upward flow is still present however substantially decreased from flow observed during ambient flow conditions this flow change can be achieved by lowering the hydraulic head in the 185 m fracture inferring that the 185 m fracture is hydraulically connected to the pumping well a diluted do zone is still observed near the bottom of the well suggesting that water may be flowing through the fracture to the pumping well above 125 m the water column within the casing falls downward in response to pumping which is indicated by the downward shift in the do profile which then flows out at 125 m this is indicated by the downward shift in the do profile the change from a stagnant water column under ambient flow conditions to downward flow during cross well pumping indicates an increase in downward hydraulic gradient above 125 m which can be achieved through lowering the hydraulic head in the 125 m fracture while flow conditions point toward both fractures having a hydraulic connection to pw 1 the hydraulic head in the 185 m fracture likely experience a larger decrease in hydraulic head to allow for the decreased hydraulic gradient between 125 and 185 m indicating a more transmissive connection the results from downhole geophysical logging are shown in table 3 under ambient flow conditions vertical flow was not detected with the heat pulse flow meter presumably due to flow rates below the detectability limit of the instrument the transmissive fracture at 185 m identified with the doam was not identified during geophysical logging possibly since instrumentation has physical limitations preventing measurement of the bottom 30 cm of the well during cross well pumping downward flows of 0 04 lpm were measured above the 125 m fracture using the heat pulse flowmeter although heat pulse flowmeter data are limited in scope measurements are consistent with observations made from the doam with consideration for low flow rates 4 conclusion this study has demonstrated the ability of the doam to identify interconnecting fractures between crystalline bedrock wells when combined with cross borehole hydraulic testing the method can be used over large distances and has been shown to characterize cross well flow conditions in environments with multiple interconnecting fractures the doam can be advantageous over heat pulse flowmeters due to its highly sensitive detection of low flow rates the low cost and ease of access to necessary equipment allows the doam to be employed independently which may be particularly beneficial for the initial stages of contaminant pathway studies or to provide preliminary information for executing more extensive fracture flow path characterization e g borehole radar ert hydraulic testing with packers or flute liners since dissolved oxygen acts conservatively over the timescales of testing the doam may be appropriate for quantitative modeling applications of conservative tracer tests quantitative modeling of doam profiles may be able to provide additional information such as precise changes in fracture hydraulic head and transmissivity to aid in identification of fracture connections particularly when multiple fractures may be connected and how an

6624,with the boom of hydropower industry it has never been more important than now to re assess approaches to a sustainable hydropower projects management we evaluated the environmental and economic costs and benefits namely environmental and economic effects of implementing different hydrology based environmental flow restrictions i e environmental flows scenarios at nine run of river power plants involving flow diversions located at pluvial nival and stable river reaches in spain for each scenario economic effects were inferred from energy production figures whereas environmental effects along the bypassed river reach came from the deviations of the ecologically meaningful flow attributes from the unaltered flow regime we found a linear inverse relationship between both effects which were the lowest for the pluvial type reaches imposing significantly low constant flows resulted into the highest energy production but at the highest environmental costs whereas the opposite happened when using more complex environmental flow methodologies which also imposed flow fluctuations and annual floods and restricted ramping rates the ecologically meaningful flow attributes were not similarly affected in all tested environmental flows scenarios we present a simple approach to define the environmental flow standards at run of river diversion schemes that guarantee the right balance between rivers conservation and energy production and which are valid for all rivers sharing similar flow regime patterns in such definition it is possible to address specific ecological goals by prioritizing the naturalness of certain key flow attributes keywords benefits costs flow regime hydrology based environmental flow methods river management river types 1 introduction the world faces an accelerating rate of population increase which among others is accompanied by an increase in the demand for energy and a great uncertainty about the consequences on global climate un 2017 consequently hydropower is being stimulated worldwide as a renewable energy source the present global hydroelectricity capacity is predicted to increase by 73 to about 1700 gw within the next 10 20 years by means of new hydropower developments the world bank 2014 as of march 2014 at least 3700 major dams with a capacity of 1 mw each were either planned or under construction primarily concentrated in developing countries and emerging economies of southeast asia south american and africa along with the balkans anatolia and the caucasus lehner et al 2011 zarfl et al 2015 winemiller et al 2016 however studies highlight that even such a dramatic expansion in hydropower capacity will be insufficient to compensate for the increasing electricity demand zarfl et al 2015 and that national and international benefits through hydroelectricity generation and sales will come with substantial environmental economic and social cost to society due to degradation of freshwater biodiversity and the ecosystem services under regulated flow regimes forslund 2009 within the hydropower industry there is growing pressure from environmental groups and natural resource managers to change reservoir releases from daily peaking to run of river operations on the basis of the assumption that downstream biological communities will improve under a more natural flow regime jager and bevelhimer 2007 bevelhimer et al 2015 an issue of major concern in recent years has been the potential of hydropower peaking operations to alter flows beyond the natural variations that occur over the course of a day to adapt to prices and demands i e hydropeaking moog 1993 additionally peaking operations usually require reservoir type projects with significant storage capacity which result into important environmental losses due to inundation of landscapes alterations in bio geochemical cycling and water temperature interruption of river s longitudinal connectivity and lack of major floods conversely hydropower generation through run of river operations utilize the flow of water within the natural range of the river thus varying the amount of power produced throughout the year depending on river discharge the fact that no or little reservoir impoundment is required and that the flow pattern of the river remains essentially unchanged reduces environmental impacts of these operating schemes paish 2002 bha 2005 however in many cases these projects also involve in stream or cross water diversions aimed at increasing the available power and or energy run of river diversion projects from now on egré and milewski 2002 flow diversion is typically achieved through small weirs that regulate water levels allowing the flow to be diverted down an artificial canal or penstock to a turbine before it is returned to the main channel downstream anderson et al 2015 the river stretch downstream from the diversion i e bypassed reach is severely depleted of water while the scheme is operating but has natural flows when it is not this alteration of flow regime affects the physical habitat along the bypassed reach with consequences for organisms and ecosystem functions and habitat connectivity biggs et al 2005 tockner et al 2000 the most effective and common mitigation measure in this case is to allow a fraction of the flow to run through the bypassed reach to ensure minimum ecological flows that maintain river habitats and existing land uses downstream the conservation of fluvial ecosystems is assigned a high global priority european commission wfd 2000 olson and dinerstein 2002 as stated above rivers used for hydropower production are strongly threatened by the modification of any of the streamflow s main components i e magnitude frequency duration timing and rate of change anderson et al 2015 bejarano et al 2017 which ultimately shape many of their fundamental ecological forms and processes poff et al 1997 thus environmental flows ef along regulated rivers are an essential tool for improving hydrological conditions and then mitigating associated adverse ecological and socio economic changes arthington et al 2006 a vast body of formal methodologies environmental flows methodologies efm now exists for addressing the environmental flow requirements of rivers see review by tharme 2003 desired geographical resolution and comprehensiveness the availability of data time and resources the elements of the system to be preserved and the water demands to be attended among others influence the methodology selected in each case it is so much so that no thorough systematic and generalizable methodology exists and the implementation of a given efm may result into a wide range of socio economic and environmental benefits and costs according to the uniqueness of every individual river system moreover assumptions on the ecological implications of stream flows prescribed by the most widespread efm such as those hydrologically based are neither of general applicability nor are they empirically proven poff et al 2010 we have little quantitative knowledge gained from individual study case experiences e g bejarano et al 2013 davies et al 2014 consequently several major challenges face the science of the environmental flows particularly developing ecologically grounded ef standards and transferring concepts techniques policies and individual case studies into the development of criteria at regional scales king and brown 2006 in this regard the eloha framework i e the ecological limits of hydrologic alteration poff et al 2010 recommends the classification of river segments within a region into distinctive flow regime types according to the similarities of their ecologically meaningful streamflow s components prior to the definition of ef as flow ecology quantitative relationships can be developed for the entire type based solely on data from a limited set of rivers of that type arthington et al 2006 poff et al 2006 olden et al 2012 any ef imposed along rivers used for hydropower is commonly seen by hydropower stakeholders as flow restrictions that reduce efficiency profitability and the ability to react to changes in electricity demand and price beilfuss 2010 most studies analyzing alternatives for optimizing plant operations with some consideration of environmental goals are restricted to reservoir projects characterized by peaking operations jager and smith 2008 many of those involving ef implementation focused on the economic impact of including low level minimum flow constraints sale et al 1982 cardwell et al 1996 few recent studies have used optimization models for the operation of one or a chain of schemes to evaluate whether more complex hydrological requirements of particular target species such as restricting ramping rates through turbines pérez díaz and wilhelmi 2010 niu and insley 2013 minimizing deviations from the natural flow regime shiau and wu 2004 homa et al 2005 or imposing a dynamic eco hydrograph chen et al 2015 li et al 2016 can provide ecological benefits without unduly affecting hydro production conversely the direct dependency of run of river schemes on river discharge to produce energy leads to limited maneuverability compared to large hydropower plants in order to cope with flow variability multiple hydraulic turbines of different sizes may be set up in the same plant apart from maintenance plant shutdowns and load allocation to different turbines the main decision variable for operation scheduling of run of river schemes comprising river diversions is water allocation to ef along the bypassed reach up to date efforts at such schemes have focused exclusively on maximizing the profit through the combination of an optimal design maintenance and operation scheduling bozorg haddad et al 2011 unfortunately and despite evidences of the significant ecological impacts santos et al 2006 abbasi and abbasi 2011 ecological requirements of rivers remain excluded from the optimization models at run of river diversion projects lange et al 2018 ef are defined through simple methods that ignore the tradeoff between ef allocation and energy production and they are usually implemented through fixed devices such as fish ladders that release constant discharge run of river plants account for 75 of the 3700 hydropower plants planned or under construction worldwide as of 2014 zarfl et al 2015 this is especially true in europe oceania and asia in europe financial subsidies and national renewable energy legislation are promoting them as opposed to large storage hydropower schemes as hydropower potential of larger rivers has already been exploited wagner et al 2015 there is therefore an urgent need to improve our understanding of the ecological impacts of these schemes and to incorporate such knowledge into planning and operation decisions in this paper we examine the tradeoffs between the energy production at several run of river hydropower plants involving in stream diversions in spain and the environmental changes along their bypassed river reaches when different ef restrictions derived from the use of different hydrology based efm are imposed we wonder whether these tradeoffs and the most critically affected ecologically meaningful flow attributes differ depending on 1 the applied environmental flow methodology efm and 2 the particular characteristics of each river s flow regime we ultimately aspire to produce applicable and generalizable results which serve as decision support tools by managers guaranteeing the sustainable operation of run of river diversion hydropower plants particularly this study sets an approach to evaluate the suitability of a specific ef scenario under particular targets for energy production and river ecological status 2 material and methods 2 1 study cases selection and description the study was developed in nine bypassed river reaches along their main channel between the intake and the return points of the flow fig 1 the flow was derived down to a un of river plant located at an artificial canal before it was returned to the main channel again in stream diversion selected reaches are located in the ebro river basin northeast spain fig 1 the ebro river basin is the largest catchment in spain it extends over 85 530 km2 17 3 of the spanish territory from wnw to ese until it reaches the mediterranean sea it is drained by the 910 km long ebro river fig 1 its location between the eurosiberian and mediterranean biogeographical regions makes it a heterogeneous basin in climatic geological and vegetation terms rivas martínez et al 2002 average annual rainfall is 656 mm although it ranges from 300 to 500 mm annually in the center to the 1500 2000 mm a year in the highest elevations of the catchment http www chebro es the basin is subjected to an intense exploitation of water resources there are 216 large storage dams i e height 15 m or impounding 3 million m3 https www icold cigb org gb dictionary dictionary asp many of them intended mainly for hydropower production and for irrigation and 209 run of river hydropower schemes http www chebro es three conditions prevailed in the selection of the study reaches first all river reaches should have a gauging station in the main channel either immediately upstream or downstream from the bypassed reach with consecutive recorded daily flows during a long enough period to represent the natural variability of the flow regime of the reach namely unaltered flow regime ua flow regime onwards castro 2006 marm 2011 table 1 data from the centre for hydrographic studies ministry of environment and public works spain the percentage of the upstream catchment area that is controlled by reservoirs was used to determine the degree of alteration of the flow marm 2011 table 1 for most stations we used a 30 year period of data with 10 of upstream regulated area table 1 second river reaches should represent the most characteristic flow regime types described for the basin namely pluvial nival and stable according to the seasonal fluctuation of the flow bejarano et al 2010 fig 1 nival types are characterized by a season spring or early summer of short and large high flows whereas pluvial types present bimodal hydrographs with winter and spring long lasting high flows nival types usually present a long low flow season during winter whereas low flows occur in summer in pluvial types stable types show very low values for maximum and minimum flow ratios and also for number of reversals of mean monthly flow values high flow season is usually long and occurs between winter and spring finally the third premise for reaches selection was that their mean annual flow should differ significantly between the reaches within each flow regime type fig 1 for the sake of simplicity and coherence of results we assumed a simple operating scheme for the nine run of river diversion plant locations once the ef was defined we assumed that the plant was able to turbine the natural flow in excess of the ef with two restrictions the maximum discharge capacity of the plant and turbines characteristics and the minimum technical operation flow of the turbines the minimum technical operation flow depends on the number size and type of turbines we assumed a common value of 30 of the plant maximum capacity q m a x of the power plant which is an average figure for a plant equipped with one turbine of francis type this is a conservative estimate since this value can be reduced by setting up multiple turbines of different sizes and an adequate scheduling algorithm we also assumed that maintenance operations can be performed during the period of the year where available flow does not reach the minimum technical operation flow 2 2 environmental effects computation we worked with 23 scenarios of daily flows characterizing the period of years selected for each study reach table 1 one scenario represented the unaltered flow regime ua flow regime see section 2 1 and table 1 for details whereas the remaining scenarios corresponded to the flow regimes resulting after imposing certain ef defined through different hydrology based efm in the plant s operating scheme efmi flow regimes onwards from i 1 to i 22 table 2 the 22 selected efm constitute approximately a third of the overall number of hydrology based methodologies and represent those most commonly used in spain and worldwide they were applied

en in the hydropower plant resulting from the implementation of different hydrology based efm in the absence of quantitative flow ecology relationships of general application poff and zimmerman 2010 davies et al 2014 and the difficulties to the access to data required to develop them within the framework of this study we based on the widespread qualitative understanding of the ecological implications of the 33 flow attributes characterizing the flow regime described by richter et al 1996 here so called ihaz from z 1 to z 33 flow attributes table 3 to assess the environmental effects of the implementation of the hydrology based efm the ihaz flow attributes allowed to characterize the magnitude frequency duration timing and rate of change of intra annual mean and extreme water conditions of the ua and all efm flow regimes from each river reach roughly whereas the availability and suitability of habitat and food for riverine plants and animals is linked to the magnitudes of the different mean high and low discharges their timing usually determines their effective use and also leads to behavioral mechanisms in organisms to adapt life stages to the environment the duration frequency and rates of change of flow events exacerbate or diminish stressful conditions which ultimately structure and balance riverine communities and limit invasions poff et al 1997 richter et al 1998 further details in table 3 much literature can be found on hydrological indices aimed at understanding hydrological processes in catchments e g sawicz et al 2011 euser et al 2013 peñas silva et al 2014 westerberg and mcmillan 2015 kuentz et al 2017 mcmillan et al 2017 addor et al 2018 and or the ecological processes led by the former e g richter et al 1996 1997 1998 clausen and biggs 2000 wood et al 2000 olden and poff 2003 mathews and richter 2007 gao et al 2009 monk et al 2007 kennard et al 2010 olden et al 2012 peñas et al 2016 in some of the reviewed articles much effort is devoted to devising the best set of indices which was adapted to their aims is uncorrelated and captures a broad range of desired hydrological ecological information well described in mcmillan et al 2017 whereas others simply select and make use of the already tested indices on our side we grounded on poff et al 1997 richter et al 1998 olden and poff 2003 and gao et al 2009 and assumed that the set of iha flow attributes adequately captures the majority of the information provided by the population of indices available for researchers that represents the majority of the flow components for all the stream types and that is ecologically relevant subsequently we quantified the deviation from the ua regime of each ihaz flow attribute characterizing each efmi flow regime el efmi ihaz by applying the eq 1 1 el efm i iha z iha z e f m i iha z u a 1 to simplify we averaged the el efmi ihaz calculated on those ihaz flow attributes characterizing the same to some extent regime characteristics and consequently that were highly inter correlated olden and poff 2003 gao et al 2009 n in eq 2 table 3 2 el efm i iha x n el efm i iha z n in this way we reduced from n 12 to n 3 the el efmi ihaz on the magnitude of monthly water conditions group 1 table 3 by averaging those referred to months characterized by high medium and low waters when the mean flow of a month was 0 5 times the mean annual flow we considered it as a low water month when it was between 0 5 and 1 5 times we considered it a medium water month and when it was 1 5 times it was classified as high water month table 3 similarly we reduced from n 10 to n 2 the el efmi ihaz on the magnitude and duration of annual extreme water conditions group 2 table 3 by averaging those referred to annual minima and maxima 1 3 7 30 and 90 day means attributes table 3 consequently the 33 el efmi ihaz computed on the original ihaz flow attributes were reduced to 16 el efmi ihax being ihax the final attributes from x 1 to x 16 which were used in the study and which are referred as flow attributes throughout the results and discussion sections of the manuscript table 3 thus el efmi ihax represented the environmental effects of each efmi on each ecologically relevant flow attribute additionally we quantified the deviation from the ua regime of each efm regime regardless the affected ihax flow attributes namely the general environmental effect el efmi to do this we first calculated the absolute value of each el efmi ihax and then obtained the el efmi as the sum of all of them equation 3 3 el efm i x 1 x 16 e l e f m i iha x el efmi ihax ranges between 1 and and informs on both the magnitude of the deviation from the unaltered state zero non effect situation and whether the effect involved an increase positive or decrease negative of whatever is being described by the particular ihax flow attributes el efmi does not focus on the effect on a specific flow attribute nor does it account the sign of the effect but in returns it provides a more global figure of the magnitude of the deviation from the unaltered state it can take any positive value being zero the non effect situation when the reader is not interested in the comparison with other sites beyond the ones studied here and in order to improve the visualization and interpretation of results we specifically propose to re scale the positive range of el efmi ihax and el efmi between 0 and 1 by normalizing it by the maximum positive effect of the studied samples this is done here in some figures and specified in their captions 2 3 economic effects computation to assess the economic effect en efmi we estimated the total energy produced in the analysed period at daily computation time step when imposing the efm flow regimes eefmi and when not e0 being the latter the maximum energy that it could be produced there was not energy production in the unaltered scenario eua energy production was estimated by simulating the operation of the plant at

environmental effects of implementing the different hydrology based efm en efmi el efmi differed significantly between methodologies and flow regime types furthermore we searched for significant differences between the environmental effects on each ihax flow attribute el efmi ihax for these aims we first developed simple linear regressions between the economic and environmental effects afterwards as data did not follow a normal distribution we carried out non parametric pairwise comparisons which allowed to test whether samples from different methodologies and flow types originated from the same distribution kruskal wallis tests with the h statistic legendre and legendre 2012 additionally we explored which ihax flow attributes significantly contributed to the variability of the values of the environmental effects resulting from the implementation of the different efm in different flow regime types for this aim we carried out principal component analyses pca jongman et al 1995 on the environmental effects of each efm el efmi ihax for all flow regime types finally we relied on our results to select the one or several efm that maximized the profitability of the run of river diversion power plant and minimized the environmental changes along the bypassed river reach for each analyzed flow regime type for this aim we ranked the economic en efmi and environmental el efmi ihax effects of each efm into four categories from low to medium high and very high effects and selected those methods that resulted into the lowest values for both considered effects in all analyses p values 0 05 were considered statistically significant 3 results 3 1 general environmental and economic effects the implementation of different hydrology based efm table 2 along analyzed river reaches resulted into different economic and environmental effects depending on the method and on the flow regime type en efmi and el efmi fig 2 a the r2 of the linear models fitting the en and el data were 0 48 for pluvial 0 37 for nival and 0 52 for stable flow regime types fig 2 the higher the economic effects the lower the environmental effects regardless the efm implemented however whereas the pluvial reaches showed the lowest economic and environmental effects the stable reaches showed the highest economic effects and the nival reaches the highest environmental effects differences statistically significant fig 2b the environmental and economic effects varied significantly depending on the efm as for the environmental effects when pooling all river types together the highest mean el efmi resulted for mat lm and mq methods followed by 7q10 and eco10 methods fig 3 a significantly high mean el efmi also appeared for the nival type reaches when applying the 10qma and 25qma methods fig 3c conversely the lowest mean el efmi for all river types pooled together appeared for abf and q75 methods fig 3a 30qma and carol for pluvial rva for nival and ngprp for nival and stable type reaches also resulted into low mean el efmi fig 3b c and d as for the economic effects when pooling all river types together it is remarkable the significantly low values for the mean en efmi obtained when applying the mq and mat closely followed by lm 7q10 and eco10 methods fig 3a 10qma also resulted into significantly low mean en efmi when restricting to the nival type reaches fig 3c the highest mean en efmi appeared for the pluvial type reaches when applying the rva method fig 3b and for the nival and stable type reaches when applying the abf and q75 methods fig 3c and d the stable flow types showed the highest standard deviations for both en efmi and el efmi corresponding to the 10 25 and 30qma ten and carol methods whereas the pluvial types showed the lowest standard deviations 3 2 environmental effects by flow attributes the general environmental effect resulting from the implementation of each hydrology based efm el efmi was broken down into the effects on the 16 ecologically relevant flow attributes el efmi ihax fig 4 and fig 5 in general the magnitude and sign of the environmental effects of any tested efm scenario significantly differed depending on the analyzed flow attribute the magnitude of monthly water conditions mmlw mmmw mmhw group 1 and the magnitude and duration of annual extremes mdemax mdemin group 2 decreased somewhat for all efm scenarios fig 4 being this pattern the least evident for the pluvial reaches to the right bottom in fig 5 conversely the base flow index mdbf group 2 increased in most efm scenarios fig 4 which was particularly evident for the nival flow regime reaches at the top of fig 5 no changes were registered for the number of zero flow days group 2 figs 4 and 5 the timing of annual extremes group 3 was the least affected regardless the efm implemented experiencing a slight increase for most efm fig 4 which was confirmed in the pca plot by the short arrows for the two attributes representing this group julian date of each annual 1 day maximum and 1 day minimum temax temin fig 5 with regard to the frequency and duration of high low flow pulses group 4 there were shorter but more frequent high pulses than in natural conditions in all river reaches for all efm scenarios number and mean duration of high pulses per year fhp dhp fig 4 which was particularly marked for the nival reaches at the top of fig 5 there were shorter and less frequent low pulses number and mean duration of low pulses per year flp dlp fig 4 for most efm scenarios but this pattern was less marked in pluvial reaches to the right in fig 5 finally environmental effects in terms of rates and frequency of changes in water conditions group 5 differed between flow regime types the rise and fall rates rr fr increased and the daily flow reversals frev slightly decreased for all efm scenarios except for eco10 and rva which showed opposing effects compared to the unaltered conditions fig 4 this was evidenced by the leftward trend of river reaches along the first pca axis being remarkable for the stable river reaches to the left of fig 5 half of the total variance of el efmi ihax data for all flow regime types was explained by the first two pca components fig 5 the first pca component mainly informed that certain efm scenarios have remarkably different effect on flow attributes from the groups 1 and 5 table 3 when comparing to the ua scenario the magnitude of monthly water conditions particularly for the medium water period and duration of annual minimum flows mmmw mdemin were significantly lower under the mq mat lm and somewhat also 7q10 eco10 10qma and ten scenarios to the left whereas the frequency of flow reversals frev were significantly lower and rates of flow change rr higher under the mq mat lm and 7q10 scenarios fig 5 frev was significantly higher and rr and fr lower under the rva scenario to the right fig 5 on the other hand the flow attributes from the group 4 were the attributes that contributed most to the second pca component fig 5 despite high pulses duration and frequency dhp fhp table 3 behaved similarly regardless the efm scenarios shorter but more frequent this component informed that this pattern was much more marked in the nival reaches at the top of the pca plot than in the stable in the middle and pluvial at the bottom of the pca fig 5 reaches 3 3 selection of the best environmental flow method the selection of the efm that increases the profitability of the power plant and decreases the environmental changes along the bypassed river reach for each analyzed flow regime type is based on the fig 6 see also annex 1 the extreme cases are the efm laying on the dark green and red cells of the en el matrix which had the lowest or highest en and el respectively the range of colors in between allows to select methodologies with intermediate values for both impacts see table 2 for details on the efm this figure fig 6 also helps to discern among flow regime types and flow attributes with respect to the pair en el most efm for the pluvial reaches resulted into lower en el pairs compared to the nival and stable reaches as the former tended to lay on greenish cells and the latter on yellowish orange and red cells for example q85 25qma 30qma abf carol 30qmm and rva minimized both the en and el values in the pluvial reaches but they should be observed carefully for the nival and stable reaches as they tended to cause high en especially in the stable reaches and high el for certain flow attributes 4 discussion although a general agreement exists in that environmental flows are a key tool ensuring the maintenance of ecological conditions of rivers no consensus has been reached yet on how to define them brisbane declaration 2007 the hydrological methods which are widely used for their validity for many rivers from large basins yield disparate results and set hydrological thresholds without ecological foundations on top of this is the lack of scientifically defensible and empirically testable flow ecology relationships poff et al 2010 which leads to the still uncertainty of the extent to which the flow regime of a river can be altered from natural for the purposes of hydropower generation while maintaining the ecosystem s integrity in this paper we have solved this obstacle by assuming that small deviations between the environmental and natural flow regimes will cause little ecological impacts poff and zimmerman 2010 this assumption is based on the idea that evolution has perfected the adaptation of the extant community to historical conditions and that any change is harmful to the ecosystem although this approach is widely refuted by sounded scientific literature e g richter et al 1996 1998 poff et al 1997 and in most cases involves the best option so far particularities of the fluvial ecosystem such as special requirements of target species or morphological characteristics which make reaches more or less resilient to impacts are not explicitly accounted reason why we take this opportunity to emphasize that ef will not be totally realistic and achievable until the variable nature of linkages between flow and ecology are fully understood and quantified tonkin et al 2014 decisions on the best operating schemes of hydropower plants often become tougher when a wide range of parties with opposing interests from hydropower industry agents to wild life campaigners and local community representatives want to play a role in influencing those petts and leach 2000 thus reaching an agreement involves considering simultaneously at least the environmental and the subsequent economic effects of the alternatives many studies have exclusively dealt with the economic harpman 1999 pérez díaz and wilhelmi 2010 guisández et al 2013 bozorg haddad et al 2011 or ecological richter and thomas 2007 costs and benefits of hydropower production multi disciplinary studies such as ours have the added value of emphasizing the linkages between the hydrology environment and economy unfortunately conclusions from the recent multi disciplinary studies aimed at optimizing the operation of one or multi reservoir systems are rarely valid for other cases beyond those where they were developed e g chen et al 2015 in them ecological constraints are represented by the flow requirements of a certain fish species obtained through habitat simulation models along the studied reaches additionally many decision variables can be accommodated to maximize power revenue for these cases which is not applicable to run of river schemes difficulties in accessing the sale prices of energy for the study periods which are highly dynamic in time according to electricity demands led us to make a major simplification when computing the energy costs and benefits fluctuation in the electricity price within a day and depending on months or seasons was not explicitly considered in this study conversely the profitability of the power plant was directly related to the energy production i e the less it produces the less it gains which eased calculations and totally fulfilled our purpose of stressing environmental and economic patterns however readers must keep in mind that we may have somewhat overrated economic costs of those timely variable efm allocating much water to ef when energy is sold cheap or undervalued those prescribing very little water for environmental purposes during periods when energy is more expensive additionally deeper economic analyses could be carried out in future studies for instance traditional indicators such as the net present value npv benefit and cost ratio or internal rate of return on investment irr would inform on the effects of the environmental flow requirements on both how much energy and how over time it is produced multi disciplinary approaches on costs and benefits of hydropower production require a more accurate and realistic economic evaluations and further research in this regard is needed our contribution stands out for having proved that environmental economic costs and benefits as well as the ecologically meaningful flow attributes affected and to what extent of hydropower production at run of river diversion schemes are highly dependent on both the type of flow regime characterizing the river reaches and the imposed ef standards the differences found among pluvial nival and stable reaches and similarities within the same flow type suggest that ecological goals and environmental flow standards can be set for many rivers simultaneously as long as they share the natural range of hydrological variation thus corroborating other authors suggestions on fluvial management at regional scale e g dyson et al 2003 arthington et al 2006 poff et al 2010 olden et al 2012 for example the highest energy production figures were reached at the lowest environmental costs in the pluvial river reaches and many of the commonly used hydrology based environmental flow methods guaranteed the right balance between both economic and environmental requirements in this river type on the contrary only ngprp and rva or ten and eco10 were the methods guaranteeing such balance in the nival or stable reaches respectively and it was at considerably higher economic and environmental costs unfortunately many run of river small hydropower plants are located at mountainous river reaches whose flow regimes are highly influenced by snowmelt namely nival regimes zarfl et al 2015 benejam et al 2016 but when possible our findings suggest that pluvial reaches should be considered first for a potential location of new run of river hydropower developments managing on a river by river basis is materially impossible therefore synthesizing our experience gained from several individual case studies into a scientific framework that guides management at a broader scale such as by flow regime types is feasible and can be very helpful in what refers to the variation of the environmental economic costs and benefits with the imposed ef requirements our results support the general thought that the simplest efm scenarios involving annual minimum flows such as mat lm and mq imply less environmental benefits and greater energy production however our results also show that low environmental costs were noticeable when although constant water releases were sufficiently higher e g q75 particularly along pluvial river reaches in permanent river reaches enough running water guarantees the usability of habitats by aquatic organisms by directly determining the wetted area i e depth and width of the river channel and average water velocity this is key to avoid fish stranding or eggs and macroinvertebrates desiccation and drift balance water temperature and dissolved oxygen and favor longitudinal connectivity between populations among others clarke et al 2008 similar to edwards et al 1999 and nyatsanza et al 2015 in these cases higher constant minimum flows along the bypassed reach went also inextricably with important reductions in power generation during peak demand lowering the value of hydropower such energy costs could be palliated to some extent by turbining the water destined for maintaining environmental flows at ecological power stations wu and chen 2018 which is being successfully carried out in norway france and china among others https www cleanpower no further we have proved that guaranteeing other flow attributes in addition to flow magnitude such as fluctuation high flows or smooth ramping rates by using more complex efm such as ngprp and rva see table 2 has significant environmental advantages but at a high cost for hydropower production purposes as other authors have already described harpman 1999 rheinheimer et al 2013 methods like these that respect to some extent the natural variability of the yearly hydrograph and the high flows when they naturally occur are ensuring the initiation of life cycle transitions in fish such as spawning egg hatching feeding reproduction or migration the seasonal sequence of flowering seed dispersal germination and seedling growth of riparian plants the emergence into an aerial adult stage and the diapauses of aquatic insects and the lateral connectivity hancock and bunn 1997 mahoney and rood 1998 freeman et al 2001 ideally and to put the tin lid on methods that also account the natural rates of change in river discharge at different time scales from hourly to seasonal rates improve seedling germination and the persistence of aquatic and riparian species which depend on slow receding or gradual seasonal changes of water table respectively rood et al 2003 stella et al 2010 finally when delving into the environmental effects it is useful from a management point of view to direct attention on the flow attributes which are linked to a predetermined objective in terms of the ecosystem s future condition king et al 1999 for this aim here provided information on distinct response patterns of key flow attributes according to the flow regime and under different ef requirements is essential for example if the objectives were directed at maximizing the production of a fish species for sport fishing efm that minimize the deviations from the naturalness of both the flow magnitude and rate of flow changes to guarantee aquatic habitat availability and avoid stranding respectively should be used to define environmental flows benejam et al 2016 casas mulet et al 2016 according to our results q85 uta and ngprp for the pluvial reaches and q75 q85 mm25 and rva for the stable reaches would meet these requirements resulting into low to moderate environmental and economic effects in nival reaches however only ngprp would achieve the best environmental economic balance for the flow attributes of interest but if the interest was on promoting plant colonization structuring the river channel morphology and favoring river floodplain connections managers should ensure minimal deviations of the magnitude duration and frequency of extreme discharges politti et al 2018 whereas this would be possible with most of the efm in the pluvial reaches and 10qma 25qma ten and eco10 in the stable reaches only ngprp and rva would be the best options in the stable reaches and they would imply moderate to high ecological and economic effects in this regard the reader should note that the reported environmental effects of efm which derived from the changes of the two flow attributes gathering information on the magnitude of extreme annual water conditions of various durations could have been attenuated or even gone unnoticed in some cases this is because whereas we distinguished between high and low flow events when averaging for the sake of simplicity of the study we did not consider natural or human imposed cycles of these events such as short cycles i e daily and weekly 1 3 and 7 day means or long cycles i e monthly and seasonal 30 and 90 day means however the length of the cycles has been shown to dampen or exacerbate their ecological consequences due to the level of sustained over time environmental stress and disturbance richter et al 1996 5 conclusions environmental and subsequent economic effects as well as the ecologically meaningful flow attributes affected and to what extent of imposing different hydrology based environmental flow requirements at run of river diversion hydropower plants were evaluated the effects significantly varied with the tested hydrology based environmental flow methods and the reaches flow regime attributes the most natural hydrological and hence environmental conditions were reached when the most complex efm were implemented at the expense of a significant decrease in energy production of the methods that implied constant flows only those that guaranteed high enough flows ensured good environmental conditions according to the reported deviations of the operating flow regimes from the natural flow regime our study warns that hydropower production at run of river diversion power plants is not free of the ecological impacts resulting from hydrological alteration along the downstream bypassed river reaches especially along nival and stable river types our study also evidences that multi disciplinary approaches are required to define the environmental flows standards that guarantee the right balance between fluvial ecosystem conservation and energy production that environmental flows at regional scales can be managed by circumscribing to all rivers sharing similar hydrological patterns and that specific ecological goals can be addressed by prioritizing the naturalness of certain key flow attributes here delivered solution oriented results to the hydropower industry are intended to facilitate decision making on the optimal water resource allocation unfortunately and in agreement with bernhardt et al 2006 we conclude that this goal represents a tremendous challenge which needs to be jointly faced by researchers and water managers acreman 2005 acknowledgments we

6624,with the boom of hydropower industry it has never been more important than now to re assess approaches to a sustainable hydropower projects management we evaluated the environmental and economic costs and benefits namely environmental and economic effects of implementing different hydrology based environmental flow restrictions i e environmental flows scenarios at nine run of river power plants involving flow diversions located at pluvial nival and stable river reaches in spain for each scenario economic effects were inferred from energy production figures whereas environmental effects along the bypassed river reach came from the deviations of the ecologically meaningful flow attributes from the unaltered flow regime we found a linear inverse relationship between both effects which were the lowest for the pluvial type reaches imposing significantly low constant flows resulted into the highest energy production but at the highest environmental costs whereas the opposite happened when using more complex environmental flow methodologies which also imposed flow fluctuations and annual floods and restricted ramping rates the ecologically meaningful flow attributes were not similarly affected in all tested environmental flows scenarios we present a simple approach to define the environmental flow standards at run of river diversion schemes that guarantee the right balance between rivers conservation and energy production and which are valid for all rivers sharing similar flow regime patterns in such definition it is possible to address specific ecological goals by prioritizing the naturalness of certain key flow attributes keywords benefits costs flow regime hydrology based environmental flow methods river management river types 1 introduction the world faces an accelerating rate of population increase which among others is accompanied by an increase in the demand for energy and a great uncertainty about the consequences on global climate un 2017 consequently hydropower is being stimulated worldwide as a renewable energy source the present global hydroelectricity capacity is predicted to increase by 73 to about 1700 gw within the next 10 20 years by means of new hydropower developments the world bank 2014 as of march 2014 at least 3700 major dams with a capacity of 1 mw each were either planned or under construction primarily concentrated in developing countries and emerging economies of southeast asia south american and africa along with the balkans anatolia and the caucasus lehner et al 2011 zarfl et al 2015 winemiller et al 2016 however studies highlight that even such a dramatic expansion in hydropower capacity will be insufficient to compensate for the increasing electricity demand zarfl et al 2015 and that national and international benefits through hydroelectricity generation and sales will come with substantial environmental economic and social cost to society due to degradation of freshwater biodiversity and the ecosystem services under regulated flow regimes forslund 2009 within the hydropower industry there is growing pressure from environmental groups and natural resource managers to change reservoir releases from daily peaking to run of river operations on the basis of the assumption that downstream biological communities will improve under a more natural flow regime jager and bevelhimer 2007 bevelhimer et al 2015 an issue of major concern in recent years has been the potential of hydropower peaking operations to alter flows beyond the natural variations that occur over the course of a day to adapt to prices and demands i e hydropeaking moog 1993 additionally peaking operations usually require reservoir type projects with significant storage capacity which result into important environmental losses due to inundation of landscapes alterations in bio geochemical cycling and water temperature interruption of river s longitudinal connectivity and lack of major floods conversely hydropower generation through run of river operations utilize the flow of water within the natural range of the river thus varying the amount of power produced throughout the year depending on river discharge the fact that no or little reservoir impoundment is required and that the flow pattern of the river remains essentially unchanged reduces environmental impacts of these operating schemes paish 2002 bha 2005 however in many cases these projects also involve in stream or cross water diversions aimed at increasing the available power and or energy run of river diversion projects from now on egré and milewski 2002 flow diversion is typically achieved through small weirs that regulate water levels allowing the flow to be diverted down an artificial canal or penstock to a turbine before it is returned to the main channel downstream anderson et al 2015 the river stretch downstream from the diversion i e bypassed reach is severely depleted of water while the scheme is operating but has natural flows when it is not this alteration of flow regime affects the physical habitat along the bypassed reach with consequences for organisms and ecosystem functions and habitat connectivity biggs et al 2005 tockner et al 2000 the most effective and common mitigation measure in this case is to allow a fraction of the flow to run through the bypassed reach to ensure minimum ecological flows that maintain river habitats and existing land uses downstream the conservation of fluvial ecosystems is assigned a high global priority european commission wfd 2000 olson and dinerstein 2002 as stated above rivers used for hydropower production are strongly threatened by the modification of any of the streamflow s main components i e magnitude frequency duration timing and rate of change anderson et al 2015 bejarano et al 2017 which ultimately shape many of their fundamental ecological forms and processes poff et al 1997 thus environmental flows ef along regulated rivers are an essential tool for improving hydrological conditions and then mitigating associated adverse ecological and socio economic changes arthington et al 2006 a vast body of formal methodologies environmental flows methodologies efm now exists for addressing the environmental flow requirements of rivers see review by tharme 2003 desired geographical resolution and comprehensiveness the availability of data time and resources the elements of the system to be preserved and the water demands to be attended among others influence the methodology selected in each case it is so much so that no thorough systematic and generalizable methodology exists and the implementation of a given efm may result into a wide range of socio economic and environmental benefits and costs according to the uniqueness of every individual river system moreover assumptions on the ecological implications of stream flows prescribed by the most widespread efm such as those hydrologically based are neither of general applicability nor are they empirically proven poff et al 2010 we have little quantitative knowledge gained from individual study case experiences e g bejarano et al 2013 davies et al 2014 consequently several major challenges face the science of the environmental flows particularly developing ecologically grounded ef standards and transferring concepts techniques policies and individual case studies into the development of criteria at regional scales king and brown 2006 in this regard the eloha framework i e the ecological limits of hydrologic alteration poff et al 2010 recommends the classification of river segments within a region into distinctive flow regime types according to the similarities of their ecologically meaningful streamflow s components prior to the definition of ef as flow ecology quantitative relationships can be developed for the entire type based solely on data from a limited set of rivers of that type arthington et al 2006 poff et al 2006 olden et al 2012 any ef imposed along rivers used for hydropower is commonly seen by hydropower stakeholders as flow restrictions that reduce efficiency profitability and the ability to react to changes in electricity demand and price beilfuss 2010 most studies analyzing alternatives for optimizing plant operations with some consideration of environmental goals are restricted to reservoir projects characterized by peaking operations jager and smith 2008 many of those involving ef implementation focused on the economic impact of including low level minimum flow constraints sale et al 1982 cardwell et al 1996 few recent studies have used optimization models for the operation of one or a chain of schemes to evaluate whether more complex hydrological requirements of particular target species such as restricting ramping rates through turbines pérez díaz and wilhelmi 2010 niu and insley 2013 minimizing deviations from the natural flow regime shiau and wu 2004 homa et al 2005 or imposing a dynamic eco hydrograph chen et al 2015 li et al 2016 can provide ecological benefits without unduly affecting hydro production conversely the direct dependency of run of river schemes on river discharge to produce energy leads to limited maneuverability compared to large hydropower plants in order to cope with flow variability multiple hydraulic turbines of different sizes may be set up in the same plant apart from maintenance plant shutdowns and load allocation to different turbines the main decision variable for operation scheduling of run of river schemes comprising river diversions is water allocation to ef along the bypassed reach up to date efforts at such schemes have focused exclusively on maximizing the profit through the combination of an optimal design maintenance and operation scheduling bozorg haddad et al 2011 unfortunately and despite evidences of the significant ecological impacts santos et al 2006 abbasi and abbasi 2011 ecological requirements of rivers remain excluded from the optimization models at run of river diversion projects lange et al 2018 ef are defined through simple methods that ignore the tradeoff between ef allocation and energy production and they are usually implemented through fixed devices such as fish ladders that release constant discharge run of river plants account for 75 of the 3700 hydropower plants planned or under construction worldwide as of 2014 zarfl et al 2015 this is especially true in europe oceania and asia in europe financial subsidies and national renewable energy legislation are promoting them as opposed to large storage hydropower schemes as hydropower potential of larger rivers has already been exploited wagner et al 2015 there is therefore an urgent need to improve our understanding of the ecological impacts of these schemes and to incorporate such knowledge into planning and operation decisions in this paper we examine the tradeoffs between the energy production at several run of river hydropower plants involving in stream diversions in spain and the environmental changes along their bypassed river reaches when different ef restrictions derived from the use of different hydrology based efm are imposed we wonder whether these tradeoffs and the most critically affected ecologically meaningful flow attributes differ depending on 1 the applied environmental flow methodology efm and 2 the particular characteristics of each river s flow regime we ultimately aspire to produce applicable and generalizable results which serve as decision support tools by managers guaranteeing the sustainable operation of run of river diversion hydropower plants particularly this study sets an approach to evaluate the suitability of a specific ef scenario under particular targets for energy production and river ecological status 2 material and methods 2 1 study cases selection and description the study was developed in nine bypassed river reaches along their main channel between the intake and the return points of the flow fig 1 the flow was derived down to a un of river plant located at an artificial canal before it was returned to the main channel again in stream diversion selected reaches are located in the ebro river basin northeast spain fig 1 the ebro river basin is the largest catchment in spain it extends over 85 530 km2 17 3 of the spanish territory from wnw to ese until it reaches the mediterranean sea it is drained by the 910 km long ebro river fig 1 its location between the eurosiberian and mediterranean biogeographical regions makes it a heterogeneous basin in climatic geological and vegetation terms rivas martínez et al 2002 average annual rainfall is 656 mm although it ranges from 300 to 500 mm annually in the center to the 1500 2000 mm a year in the highest elevations of the catchment http www chebro es the basin is subjected to an intense exploitation of water resources there are 216 large storage dams i e height 15 m or impounding 3 million m3 https www icold cigb org gb dictionary dictionary asp many of them intended mainly for hydropower production and for irrigation and 209 run of river hydropower schemes http www chebro es three conditions prevailed in the selection of the study reaches first all river reaches should have a gauging station in the main channel either immediately upstream or downstream from the bypassed reach with consecutive recorded daily flows during a long enough period to represent the natural variability of the flow regime of the reach namely unaltered flow regime ua flow regime onwards castro 2006 marm 2011 table 1 data from the centre for hydrographic studies ministry of environment and public works spain the percentage of the upstream catchment area that is controlled by reservoirs was used to determine the degree of alteration of the flow marm 2011 table 1 for most stations we used a 30 year period of data with 10 of upstream regulated area table 1 second river reaches should represent the most characteristic flow regime types described for the basin namely pluvial nival and stable according to the seasonal fluctuation of the flow bejarano et al 2010 fig 1 nival types are characterized by a season spring or early summer of short and large high flows whereas pluvial types present bimodal hydrographs with winter and spring long lasting high flows nival types usually present a long low flow season during winter whereas low flows occur in summer in pluvial types stable types show very low values for maximum and minimum flow ratios and also for number of reversals of mean monthly flow values high flow season is usually long and occurs between winter and spring finally the third premise for reaches selection was that their mean annual flow should differ significantly between the reaches within each flow regime type fig 1 for the sake of simplicity and coherence of results we assumed a simple operating scheme for the nine run of river diversion plant locations once the ef was defined we assumed that the plant was able to turbine the natural flow in excess of the ef with two restrictions the maximum discharge capacity of the plant and turbines characteristics and the minimum technical operation flow of the turbines the minimum technical operation flow depends on the number size and type of turbines we assumed a common value of 30 of the plant maximum capacity q m a x of the power plant which is an average figure for a plant equipped with one turbine of francis type this is a conservative estimate since this value can be reduced by setting up multiple turbines of different sizes and an adequate scheduling algorithm we also assumed that maintenance operations can be performed during the period of the year where available flow does not reach the minimum technical operation flow 2 2 environmental effects computation we worked with 23 scenarios of daily flows characterizing the period of years selected for each study reach table 1 one scenario represented the unaltered flow regime ua flow regime see section 2 1 and table 1 for details whereas the remaining scenarios corresponded to the flow regimes resulting after imposing certain ef defined through different hydrology based efm in the plant s operating scheme efmi flow regimes onwards from i 1 to i 22 table 2 the 22 selected efm constitute approximately a third of the overall number of hydrology based methodologies and represent those most commonly used in spain and worldwide they were applied either in their original form or with some degree of modification to improve transferability among hydrological regions and river ecotypes magdaleno 2009 tharme 2003 table 2 we were interested in the environmental costs and benefits referred as environmental effects onwards el along the bypassed reach of the selected rivers and the economic costs and benefits referred as economic effects onwards en in the hydropower plant resulting from the implementation of different hydrology based efm in the absence of quantitative flow ecology relationships of general application poff and zimmerman 2010 davies et al 2014 and the difficulties to the access to data required to develop them within the framework of this study we based on the widespread qualitative understanding of the ecological implications of the 33 flow attributes characterizing the flow regime described by richter et al 1996 here so called ihaz from z 1 to z 33 flow attributes table 3 to assess the environmental effects of the implementation of the hydrology based efm the ihaz flow attributes allowed to characterize the magnitude frequency duration timing and rate of change of intra annual mean and extreme water conditions of the ua and all efm flow regimes from each river reach roughly whereas the availability and suitability of habitat and food for riverine plants and animals is linked to the magnitudes of the different mean high and low discharges their timing usually determines their effective use and also leads to behavioral mechanisms in organisms to adapt life stages to the environment the duration frequency and rates of change of flow events exacerbate or diminish stressful conditions which ultimately structure and balance riverine communities and limit invasions poff et al 1997 richter et al 1998 further details in table 3 much literature can be found on hydrological indices aimed at understanding hydrological processes in catchments e g sawicz et al 2011 euser et al 2013 peñas silva et al 2014 westerberg and mcmillan 2015 kuentz et al 2017 mcmillan et al 2017 addor et al 2018 and or the ecological processes led by the former e g richter et al 1996 1997 1998 clausen and biggs 2000 wood et al 2000 olden and poff 2003 mathews and richter 2007 gao et al 2009 monk et al 2007 kennard et al 2010 olden et al 2012 peñas et al 2016 in some of the reviewed articles much effort is devoted to devising the best set of indices which was adapted to their aims is uncorrelated and captures a broad range of desired hydrological ecological information well described in mcmillan et al 2017 whereas others simply select and make use of the already tested indices on our side we grounded on poff et al 1997 richter et al 1998 olden and poff 2003 and gao et al 2009 and assumed that the set of iha flow attributes adequately captures the majority of the information provided by the population of indices available for researchers that represents the majority of the flow components for all the stream types and that is ecologically relevant subsequently we quantified the deviation from the ua regime of each ihaz flow attribute characterizing each efmi flow regime el efmi ihaz by applying the eq 1 1 el efm i iha z iha z e f m i iha z u a 1 to simplify we averaged the el efmi ihaz calculated on those ihaz flow attributes characterizing the same to some extent regime characteristics and consequently that were highly inter correlated olden and poff 2003 gao et al 2009 n in eq 2 table 3 2 el efm i iha x n el efm i iha z n in this way we reduced from n 12 to n 3 the el efmi ihaz on the magnitude of monthly water conditions group 1 table 3 by averaging those referred to months characterized by high medium and low waters when the mean flow of a month was 0 5 times the mean annual flow we considered it as a low water month when it was between 0 5 and 1 5 times we considered it a medium water month and when it was 1 5 times it was classified as high water month table 3 similarly we reduced from n 10 to n 2 the el efmi ihaz on the magnitude and duration of annual extreme water conditions group 2 table 3 by averaging those referred to annual minima and maxima 1 3 7 30 and 90 day means attributes table 3 consequently the 33 el efmi ihaz computed on the original ihaz flow attributes were reduced to 16 el efmi ihax being ihax the final attributes from x 1 to x 16 which were used in the study and which are referred as flow attributes throughout the results and discussion sections of the manuscript table 3 thus el efmi ihax represented the environmental effects of each efmi on each ecologically relevant flow attribute additionally we quantified the deviation from the ua regime of each efm regime regardless the affected ihax flow attributes namely the general environmental effect el efmi to do this we first calculated the absolute value of each el efmi ihax and then obtained the el efmi as the sum of all of them equation 3 3 el efm i x 1 x 16 e l e f m i iha x el efmi ihax ranges between 1 and and informs on both the magnitude of the deviation from the unaltered state zero non effect situation and whether the effect involved an increase positive or decrease negative of whatever is being described by the particular ihax flow attributes el efmi does not focus on the effect on a specific flow attribute nor does it account the sign of the effect but in returns it provides a more global figure of the magnitude of the deviation from the unaltered state it can take any positive value being zero the non effect situation when the reader is not interested in the comparison with other sites beyond the ones studied here and in order to improve the visualization and interpretation of results we specifically propose to re scale the positive range of el efmi ihax and el efmi between 0 and 1 by normalizing it by the maximum positive effect of the studied samples this is done here in some figures and specified in their captions 2 3 economic effects computation to assess the economic effect en efmi we estimated the total energy produced in the analysed period at daily computation time step when imposing the efm flow regimes eefmi and when not e0 being the latter the maximum energy that it could be produced there was not energy production in the unaltered scenario eua energy production was estimated by simulating the operation of the plant at the daily time step the basic data are net hydraulic head h n in m and average turbine efficiency η for an available daily discharge q d in m3 s 1 daily energy production e d in kwh is obtained through eq 4 4 e d 1 1000 γ q d h n h d η where γ is the specific weight of water in n m 3 h d is the number of hours per day 24 and 1 1000 is the factor to convert from wh to kwh net hydraulic head was assumed constant and was obtained from the plant description neglecting hydraulic losses average turbine efficiency was also assumed constant and equal to 0 85 available daily discharge q d is determined by comparison of the natural flow q n with the environmental flow q e and the plant maximum capacity q max and minimum flow acceptable in the turbine q min operating flows of the turbine

n e yi we calculated the en efmi by applying the eq 8 en efmi varies from 0 to 1 being zero the non effect situation 8 en efm i 1 e efm i e 0 2 4 data analysis we tested whether the economic and environmental effects of implementing the different hydrology based efm en efmi el efmi differed significantly between methodologies and flow regime types furthermore we searched for significant differences between the environmental effects on each ihax flow attribute el efmi ihax for these aims we first developed simple linear regressions between the economic and environmental effects afterwards as data did not follow a normal distribution we carried out non parametric pairwise comparisons which allowed to test whether samples from different methodologies and flow types originated from the same distribution kruskal wallis tests with the h statistic legendre and legendre 2012 additionally we explored which ihax flow attributes significantly contributed to the variability of the values of the environmental effects resulting from the implementation of the different efm in different flow regime types for this aim we carried out principal component analyses pca jongman et al 1995 on the environmental effects of each efm el efmi ihax for all flow regime types finally we relied on our results to select the one or several efm that maximized the profitability of the run of river diversion power plant and minimized the environmental changes along the bypassed river reach for each analyzed flow regime type for this aim we ranked the economic en efmi and environmental el efmi ihax effects of each efm into four categories from low to medium high and very high effects and selected those methods that resulted into the lowest values for both considered effects in all analyses p values 0 05 were considered statistically significant 3 results 3 1 general environmental and economic effects the implementation of different hydrology based efm table 2 along analyzed river reaches resulted into different economic and environmental effects depending on the method and on the flow regime type en efmi and el efmi fig 2 a the r2 of the linear models fitting the en and el data were 0 48 for pluvial 0 37 for nival and 0 52 for stable flow regime types fig 2 the higher the economic effects the lower the environmental effects regardless the efm implemented however whereas the pluvial reaches showed the lowest economic and environmental effects the stable reaches showed the highest economic effects and the nival reaches the highest environmental effects differences statistically significant fig 2b the environmental and economic effects varied significantly depending on the efm as for the environmental effects when pooling all river types together the highest mean el efmi resulted for mat lm and mq methods followed by 7q10 and eco10 methods fig 3 a significantly high mean el efmi also appeared for the nival type reaches when applying the 10qma and 25qma methods fig 3c conversely the lowest mean el efmi for all river types pooled together appeared for abf and q75 methods fig 3a 30qma and carol for pluvial rva for nival and ngprp for nival and stable type reaches also resulted into low mean el efmi fig 3b c and d as for the economic effects when pooling all river types together it is remarkable the significantly low values for the mean en efmi obtained when applying the mq and mat closely followed by lm 7q10 and eco10 methods fig 3a 10qma also resulted into significantly low mean en efmi when restricting to the nival type reaches fig 3c the highest mean en efmi appeared for the pluvial type reaches when applying the rva method fig 3b and for the nival and stable type reaches when applying the abf and q75 methods fig 3c and d the stable flow types showed the highest standard deviations for both en efmi and el efmi corresponding to the 10 25 and 30qma ten and carol methods whereas the pluvial types showed the lowest standard deviations 3 2 environmental effects by flow attributes the general environmental effect resulting from the implementation of each hydrology based efm el efmi was broken down into the effects on the 16 ecologically relevant flow attributes el efmi ihax fig 4 and fig 5 in general the magnitude and sign of the environmental effects of any tested efm scenario significantly differed depending on the analyzed flow attribute the magnitude of monthly water conditions mmlw mmmw mmhw group 1 and the magnitude and duration of annual extremes mdemax mdemin group 2 decreased somewhat for all efm scenarios fig 4 being this pattern the least evident for the pluvial reaches to the right bottom in fig 5 conversely the base flow index mdbf group 2 increased in most efm scenarios fig 4 which was particularly evident for the nival flow regime reaches at the top of fig 5 no changes were registered for the number of zero flow days group 2 figs 4 and 5 the timing of annual extremes group 3 was the least affected regardless the efm implemented experiencing a slight increase for most efm fig 4 which was confirmed in the pca plot by the short arrows for the two attributes representing this group julian date of each annual 1 day maximum and 1 day minimum temax temin fig 5 with regard to the frequency and duration of high low flow pulses group 4 there were shorter but more frequent high pulses than in natural conditions in all river reaches for all efm scenarios number and mean duration of high pulses per year fhp dhp fig 4 which was particularly marked for the nival reaches at the top of fig 5 there were shorter and less frequent low pulses number and mean duration of low pulses per year flp dlp fig 4 for most efm scenarios but this pattern was less marked in pluvial reaches to the right in fig 5 finally environmental effects in terms of rates and frequency of changes in water conditions group 5 differed between flow regime types the rise and fall rates rr fr increased and the daily flow reversals frev slightly decreased for all efm scenarios except for eco10 and rva which showed opposing effects compared to the unaltered conditions fig 4 this was evidenced by the leftward trend of river reaches along the first pca axis being remarkable for the stable river reaches to the left of fig 5 half of the total variance of el efmi ihax data for all flow regime types was explained by the first two pca components fig 5 the first pca component mainly informed that certain efm scenarios have remarkably different effect on flow attributes from the groups 1 and 5 table 3 when comparing to the ua scenario the magnitude of monthly water conditions particularly for the medium water period and duration of annual minimum flows mmmw mdemin were significantly lower under the mq mat lm and somewhat also 7q10 eco10 10qma and ten scenarios to the left whereas the frequency of flow reversals frev were significantly lower and rates of flow change rr higher under the mq mat lm and 7q10 scenarios fig 5 frev was significantly higher and rr and fr lower under the rva scenario to the right fig 5 on the other hand the flow attributes from the group 4 were the attributes that contributed most to the second pca component fig 5 despite high pulses duration and frequency dhp fhp table 3 behaved similarly regardless the efm scenarios shorter but more frequent this component informed that this pattern was much more marked in the nival reaches at the top of the pca plot than in the stable in the middle and pluvial at the bottom of the pca fig 5 reaches 3 3 selection of the best environmental flow method the selection of the efm that increases the profitability of the power plant and decreases the environmental changes along the bypassed river reach for each analyzed flow regime type is based on the fig 6 see also annex 1 the extreme cases are the efm laying on the dark green and red cells of the en el matrix which had the lowest or highest en and el respectively the range of colors in between allows to select methodologies with intermediate values for both impacts see table 2 for details on the efm this figure fig 6 also helps to discern among flow regime types and flow attributes with respect to the pair en el most efm for the pluvial reaches resulted into lower en el pairs compared to the nival and stable reaches as the former tended to lay on greenish cells and the latter on yellowish orange and red cells for example q85 25qma 30qma abf carol 30qmm and rva minimized both the en and el values in the pluvial reaches but they should be observed carefully for the nival and stable reaches as they tended to cause high en especially in the stable reaches and high el for certain flow attributes 4 discussion although a general agreement exists in that environmental flows are a key tool ensuring the maintenance of ecological conditions of rivers no consensus has been reached yet on how to define them brisbane declaration 2007 the hydrological methods which are widely used for their validity for many rivers from large basins yield disparate results and set hydrological thresholds without ecological foundations on top of this is the lack of scientifically defensible and empirically testable flow ecology relationships poff et al 2010 which leads to the still uncertainty of the extent to which the flow regime of a river can be altered from natural for the purposes of hydropower generation while maintaining the ecosystem s integrity in this paper we have solved this obstacle by assuming that small deviations between the environmental and natural flow regimes will cause little ecological impacts poff and zimmerman 2010 this assumption is based on the idea that evolution has perfected the adaptation of the extant community to historical conditions and that any change is harmful to the ecosystem although this approach is widely refuted by sounded scientific literature e g richter et al 1996 1998 poff et al 1997 and in most cases involves the best option so far particularities of the fluvial ecosystem such as special requirements of target species or morphological characteristics which make reaches more or less resilient to impacts are not explicitly accounted reason why we take this opportunity to emphasize that ef will not be totally realistic and achievable until the variable nature of linkages between flow and ecology are fully understood and quantified tonkin et al 2014 decisions on the best operating schemes of hydropower plants often become tougher when a wide range of parties with opposing interests from hydropower industry agents to wild life campaigners and local community representatives want to play a role in influencing those petts and leach 2000 thus reaching an agreement involves considering simultaneously at least the environmental and the subsequent economic effects of the alternatives many studies have exclusively dealt with the economic harpman 1999 pérez díaz and wilhelmi 2010 guisández et al 2013 bozorg haddad et al 2011 or ecological richter and thomas 2007 costs and benefits of hydropower production multi disciplinary studies such as ours have the added value of emphasizing the linkages between the hydrology environment and economy unfortunately conclusions from the recent multi disciplinary studies aimed at optimizing the operation of one or multi reservoir systems are rarely valid for other cases beyond those where they were developed e g chen et al 2015 in them ecological constraints are represented by the flow requirements of a certain fish species obtained through habitat simulation models along the studied reaches additionally many decision variables can be accommodated to maximize power revenue for these cases which is not applicable to run of river schemes difficulties in accessing the sale prices of energy for the study periods which are highly dynamic in time according to electricity demands led us to make a major simplification when computing the energy costs and benefits fluctuation in the electricity price within a day and depending on months or seasons was not explicitly considered in this study conversely the profitability of the power plant was directly related to the energy production i e the less it produces the less it gains which eased calculations and totally fulfilled our purpose of stressing environmental and economic patterns however readers must keep in mind that we may have somewhat overrated economic costs of those timely variable efm allocating much water to ef when energy is sold cheap or undervalued those prescribing very little water for environmental purposes during periods when energy is more expensive additionally deeper economic analyses could be carried out in future studies for instance traditional indicators such as the net present value npv benefit and cost ratio or internal rate of return on investment irr would inform on the effects of the environmental flow requirements on both how much energy and how over time it is produced multi disciplinary approaches on costs and benefits of hydropower production require a more accurate and realistic economic evaluations and further research in this regard is needed our contribution stands out for having proved that environmental economic costs and benefits as well as the ecologically meaningful flow attributes affected and to what extent of hydropower production at run of river diversion schemes are highly dependent on both the type of flow regime characterizing the river reaches and the imposed ef standards the differences found among pluvial nival and stable reaches and similarities within the same flow type suggest that ecological goals and environmental flow standards can be set for many rivers simultaneously as long as they share the natural range of hydrological variation thus corroborating other authors suggestions on fluvial management at regional scale e g dyson et al 2003 arthington et al 2006 poff et al 2010 olden et al 2012 for example the highest energy production figures were reached at the lowest environmental costs in the pluvial river reaches and many of the commonly used hydrology based environmental flow methods guaranteed the right balance between both economic and environmental requirements in this river type on the contrary only ngprp and rva or ten and eco10 were the methods guaranteeing such balance in the nival or stable reaches respectively and it was at considerably higher economic and environmental costs unfortunately many run of river small hydropower plants are located at mountainous river reaches whose flow regimes are highly influenced by snowmelt namely nival regimes zarfl et al 2015 benejam et al 2016 but when possible our findings suggest that pluvial reaches should be considered first for a potential location of new run of river hydropower developments managing on a river by river basis is materially impossible therefore synthesizing our experience gained from several individual case studies into a scientific framework that guides management at a broader scale such as by flow regime types is feasible and can be very helpful in what refers to the variation of the environmental economic costs and benefits with the imposed ef requirements our results support the general thought that the simplest efm scenarios involving annual minimum flows such as mat lm and mq imply less environmental benefits and greater energy production however our results also show that low environmental costs were noticeable when although constant water releases were sufficiently higher e g q75 particularly along pluvial river reaches in permanent river reaches enough running water guarantees the usability of habitats by aquatic organisms by directly determining the wetted area i e depth and width of the river channel and average water velocity this is key to avoid fish stranding or eggs and macroinvertebrates desiccation and drift balance water temperature and dissolved oxygen and favor longitudinal connectivity between populations among others clarke et al 2008 similar to edwards et al 1999 and nyatsanza et al 2015 in these cases higher constant minimum flows along the bypassed reach went also inextricably with important reductions in power generation during peak demand lowering the value of hydropower such energy costs could be palliated to some extent by turbining the water destined for maintaining environmental flows at ecological power stations wu and chen 2018 which is being successfully carried out in norway france and china among others https www cleanpower no further we have proved that guaranteeing other flow attributes in addition to flow magnitude such as fluctuation high flows or smooth ramping rates by using more complex efm such as ngprp and rva see table 2 has significant environmental advantages but at a high cost for hydropower production purposes as other authors have already described harpman 1999 rheinheimer et al 2013 methods like these that respect to some extent the natural variability of the yearly hydrograph and the high flows when they naturally occur are ensuring the initiation of life cycle transitions in fish such as spawning egg hatching feeding reproduction or migration the seasonal sequence of flowering seed dispersal germination and seedling growth of riparian plants the emergence into an aerial adult stage and the diapauses of aquatic insects and the lateral connectivity hancock and bunn 1997 mahoney and rood 1998 freeman et al 2001 ideally and to put the tin lid on methods that also account the natural rates of change in river discharge at different time scales from hourly to seasonal rates improve seedling germination and the persistence of aquatic and riparian species which depend on slow receding or gradual seasonal changes of water table respectively rood et al 2003 stella et al 2010 finally when delving into the environmental effects it is useful from a management point of view to direct attention on the flow attributes which are linked to a predetermined objective in terms of the ecosystem s future condition king et al 1999 for this aim here provided information on distinct response patterns of key flow attributes according to the flow regime and under different ef requirements is essential for example if the objectives were directed at maximizing the production of a fish species for sport fishing efm that minimize the deviations from the naturalness of both the flow magnitude and rate of flow changes to guarantee aquatic habitat availability and avoid stranding respectively should be used to define environmental flows benejam et al 2016 casas mulet et al 2016 according to our results q85 uta and ngprp for the pluvial reaches and q75 q85 mm25 and rva for the stable reaches would meet these requirements resulting into low to moderate environmental and economic effects in nival reaches however only ngprp would achieve the best environmental economic balance for the flow attributes of interest but if the interest was on promoting plant colonization structuring the river channel morphology and favoring river floodplain connections managers should ensure minimal deviations of the magnitude duration and frequency of extreme discharges politti et al 2018 whereas this would be possible with most of the efm in the pluvial reaches and 10qma 25qma ten and eco10 in the stable reaches only ngprp and rva would be the best options in the stable reaches and they would imply moderate to high ecological and economic effects in this regard the reader should note that the reported environmental effects of efm which derived from the changes of the two flow attributes gathering information on the magnitude of extreme annual water conditions of various durations could have been attenuated or even gone unnoticed in some cases this is because whereas we distinguished between high and low flow events when averaging for the sake of simplicity of the study we did not consider natural or human imposed cycles of these events such as short cycles i e daily and weekly 1 3 and 7 day means or long cycles i e monthly and seasonal 30 and 90 day means however the length of the cycles has been shown to dampen or exacerbate their ecological consequences due to the level of sustained over time environmental stress and disturbance richter et al 1996 5 conclusions environmental and subsequent economic effects as well as the ecologically meaningful flow attributes affected and to what extent of imposing different hydrology based environmental flow requirements at run of river diversion hydropower plants were evaluated the effects significantly varied with the tested hydrology based environmental flow methods and the reaches flow regime attributes the most natural hydrological and hence environmental conditions were reached when the most complex efm were implemented at the expense of a significant decrease in energy production of the methods that implied constant flows only those that guaranteed high enough flows ensured good environmental conditions according to the reported deviations of the operating flow regimes from the natural flow regime our study warns that hydropower production at run of river diversion power plants is not free of the ecological impacts resulting from hydrological alteration along the downstream bypassed river reaches especially along nival and stable river types our study also evidences that multi disciplinary approaches are required to define the environmental flows standards that guarantee the right balance between fluvial ecosystem conservation and energy production that environmental flows at regional scales can be managed by circumscribing to all rivers sharing similar hydrological patterns and that specific ecological goals can be addressed by prioritizing the naturalness of certain key flow attributes here delivered solution oriented results to the hydropower industry are intended to facilitate decision making on the optimal water resource allocation unfortunately and in agreement with bernhardt et al 2006 we conclude that this goal represents a tremendous challenge which needs to be jointly faced by researchers and water managers acreman 2005 acknowledgments we
