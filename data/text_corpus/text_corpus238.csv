possible adverse effects on ecosystems this study investigated the presence and characterization of bitumen and rubber in the baseflow and stormwater of a dense urban area namely tehran where there is high vehicle traffic and a dense network of roads the results can help better understand the emission and transport of tire and bitumen particles in the environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area tehran the capital of iran has a population of 8 8 million an area of 730 km2 and a population density of 12 000 persons km2 it is located in a semi arid region between the alborz mountain range in the north and the kavir plain in the south 51 e 35 n at altitudes of 900 to 1700 m above sea level the climate of tehran province varies from hot and dry in the south to cold and semi humid in the mountains the long term average annual rainfall of the city varies between 150 and 400 mm from south to north city land uses include residential 28 8 commercial 35 8 industrial 11 6 green space 17 1 and barren lands 6 7 dehghani et al 2017 for stormwater management tehran is divided into three sub basins i e west and northwest central and east and southeast the abuzar channel is one of the two main channels that drain the eastern and southeastern parts of tehran covering a drainage area of approximately 520 km2 of which almost half is within the city limits fig 1 the channels span 140 km in total and the sampling station was located near the end of the channel with an average width of 7 m and a height of 4 m the basin is heavily urbanized and populated and experiences high traffic from both light and heavy vehicles as well as motorcycles with over 20 million daily trips estimated from 4 million vehicles and 3 million motorcycles in tehran nasrabadi et al 2022 the length of this channel and its tributaries is about 140 km finally the collected water passes through agricultural lands in the south of tehran where it is used for irrigation and the remaining water enters the band ali khan protected wetland and then the namak salt lake located in kavir national park which are areas with unique ecological values 2 2 sampling four rainfall events and baseflow for three passes were sampled from october 22 2019 to november 10 2020 sampling was carried out using 4 l metal buckets at each event samples were taken at intervals of 30 60 min with regard to the rainfall intensity runoff turbidity and water flow passing through the channel at each sampling the runoff height passing through the channel was measured and recorded for the baseflow the sampling interval was 60 min at the end of each sampling activity the samples were immediately transferred to the laboratory and kept at 4 c to prevent the growth of organisms until use in analyses table 1 shows the information of sampling activities for rainfall events r and baseflow b 2 3 extraction of rubber and bitumen particles 2 3 1 separation of tire and bitumen particles in the laboratory the samples were passed through stainless steel filters with sizes of 500 300 and 37 μm then each filter was washed with 500 ml distilled water next the container holding the washing water and the sample was placed in an oven at 60 c which is lower than the softening temperature of aged bitumen to reach a volume of 100 ml miró et al 2015 mirwald et al 2022 hydrogen peroxide 30 was used to digest the degradable organic matters e g bacteria and algae in the samples jiang et al 2019 nuelle et al 2014 thus depending on the organic matter content 0 10 20 or 20 50 ml of hydrogen peroxide 30 was added to the samples and the temperature of the samples was kept at 50 c using a heater after digestion of organic matters and complete evaporation of hydrogen peroxide and water zinc chloride solution ρ 1 7 1 75 g ml was used for density based separation for this purpose 15 ml of zinc chloride solution was added to the dry sample which was then transferred to a 15 ml glass tube and centrifuged at a speed of 4000 rpm for 30 min ziajahromi et al 2017 2020 this process was repeated three times for 500 and 300 500 μm samples to separate the rubber and bitumen particles for 37 μm samples because of the large volume of mineral particles the process was repeated 5 times then the contents of the glass tube were filtered on a 37 μm stainless steel filter using a vacuum pump and the excess salt was washed with distilled water petroody et al 2020 2 3 2 separation of non plastic particles non plastic particles were identified by adding 5 ml rose bengal solution 0 2 mg ml to the particles remaining on the filter the mixture was kept for 5 min at room temperature to complete the reaction then the mixture was filtered using the vacuum filtration setup the residue was rinsed with distilled water and dried at 50 c for 15 min non plastic particles such as natural fibers e g cotton were colored pink while the color of synthetic fibers did not change ziajahromi et al 2017 2020 2 3 3 quality assurance and quality control during sampling and testing double distilled water and a cotton lab coat were used to prevent contamination of the samples all samples were analyzed under a hood and after each step the samples were covered with aluminum foil to prevent possible airborne contamination nuelle et al 2014 in all stages each device was washed three times with distilled water and dried before use new metal buckets were used at each sampling to prevent possible contamination at each round of sampling a control sample containing distilled water was used and processed similar to runoff samples no tire or bitumen contamination was observed in the control samples to check the counting accuracy 15 filters were selected randomly and recount was conducted by stereo microscope no deviation was observed in the number of particles 2 3 4 tire and bitumen particle analysis microscopic and spectral analysis ftir and μraman the morphology and classification of tire and bitumen wear particles were investigated with a stereo microscope equipped with a camera kern ozl 45 kecam 10 mp camera the initial separation of the particles was done with sharp and pointed forceps so that the tire particles due to their elastic properties would return to their original shape after compression the bitumen particles however have adhesive properties and do not return to their original state after compression järlskog et al 2020 2021 to increase the tests reliability the melting test was done by mounting some of the analyzed tire and bitumen particles on a glass and placing them in an oven at a temperature above softening temperature section 2 3 3 the morphology of the tire particles was not affected at the raised temperature while the bitumen particles were softened and their size expanded in total 4166 and 191 tire and bitumen particles respectively were counted at the stormwater events and base flows one percent of them were spectrally analyzed using a micro raman spectrometer at laser wavelengths of 785 nm confocal raman microscope labram hr evolution horiba and fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy fourier transform infrared spectroscopy avatar thermo labspec6 software was used to identify micro raman spectrums and omnic software was used to identify ftir spectrums 2 4 statistical analysis data normality was assessed by shapiro wilk normality test homogeneity of variances was assessed by leven test and differences in microplastic size between events were evaluated by kruskal wallis non parametric test at a significance level of 0 05 spss20 software was used for statistical analyses 3 results and discussion 3 1 tire and bitumen particles in rainfall and baseflow events the average numbers mean standard deviation n sr 23 n b 9 of tire particles counted in rainfall and baseflow events were 20 4 5 7 range 3 3 60 5 particles l and 1 5 0 7 range 0 5 3 particles l respectively while the average numbers of bitumen particles observed in rainfall and base flow events were 21 4 10 1 range 3 5 73 particles l and 2 8 1 6 range 0 8 6 5 particles l respectively fig 2 considering the normality of data sig 0 318 and the inhomogeneity of variances sig 0 003 the difference in particle size between tire and bitumen in rainfall events was found to be statistically significant sig 0 297 the concentration of tire and bitumen particles in this study may have been influenced by the features of catchment the climatic conditions such as amount intensity and duration of rainfall liu et al 2019 and the size of the collected particles in a similar study by järlskog et al 2020 2021 they found in two catchments in the central part of gothenburg city that the number of tire and bitumen particles was influenced by the area diurnal traffic load amount and intensity of rainfall number of dry days before sampling and the amount of rainfall between two sampling times in each catchment in the present study particles 37 μm were collected while kreider et al 2010 showed that twp 37 μm can occupy a large percentage in addition zncl2 solution can separate tire and bitumen particles with a density 1 7 1 75 g ml while the density of twps new trwp carbon black and styrene butadiene rubber have been reported as 1 13 1 16 g ml 0 94 2 5 g ml 1 8 g ml and 0 94 1 04 g ml respectively klöckner et al 2019 knight et al 2020 kovochich et al 2021 rhodes et al 2012 sommer et al 2018 estimated a density of 1 26 g ml for trwp on the other hand kreider et al 2010 reported the mass of mineral particles in rp and unused tp equal to 53 and 16 respectively thus considering that the density of mineral particles equals 2 6 g ml the density of trwp can be higher as evidenced by recent reports järlskog et al 2020 klöckner et al 2019 unice et al 2019 the current study used a higher density for separation than the density used by leads and weinstein 2019 and ziajahromi et al 2020 table 2 3 2 comparison of tire and bitumen particles size tire and bitumen particles with a size of 37 300 μm were the most abundant in the rainfall events and the baseflow fig 3 this is consistent with studies of kreider et al 2010 kole et al 2017 leads and weinstein 2019 and järlskog et al 2020 2021 kreider et al 2010 found that the size distribution of rp varied from 4 to 265 μm with a peak of 25 μm but twp had a two dimensional distribution with a size range of 4 to 350 μm with two peaks of 5 and 25 μm in another study on the particle size distribution of tire wear and bitumen particles in an urban area järlskog et al 2021 found that particles between 20 and 100 μm in size were more abundant than particles 100 μm in size therefore further attention to tire and bitumen particles smaller than 37 μm is needed in future studies 3 3 effect of flow on load and size of tire and bitumen particles the most abundant concentration of tire and bitumen particles was those 37 300 μm in size in both rainfall events and the baseflow fig 5 the main reason for this is related to the origin of tire and bitumen particles in urban areas where wearing between car tires and road surface produces a lot of small size tire and bitumen particles the second rainfall event r2 with a peak of 79 2 m3 s 1 passed the highest numbers of tire and bitumen particles equal to 4 791 600 and 5 781 600 particles respectively fig 4 high flowrate may indicate more widespread and higher intensity rainfall in the upstream of the catchment which in itself not only increases the number of tire and bitumen particles but also has a direct effect on the severe turbulence flow in the catchment at the baseflow or after the stormwater calmed down the turbulence decreases and denser tire and bitumen particles can settle in the path in the next rainfall event with a sharp increase in turbulence these particles are washed out from the catchment surface and transferred downstream thus as lange et al found in their study on 9 rainfall events the concentrations of tire and bitumen particles are related to the peak intensity of rainfall they observed the maximum peak of rainfall in the events of 1 5 1 mm h and 9 8 8 mm h respectively moreover in these events the concentrations of tire and bitumen particles were higher than other events most probably because of the high intensity of rainfall which could re suspend the settled and accumulated particles on the catchment surface lange et al 2021 in addition the results of smyth et al 2021 studies revealed that the peak intensity of rainfall is related to human microplastics except fibers in urban stormwater an increase in rainfall intensity may also move the particles deposited on the asphalt and enter them into the stormwater 3 4 structural analysis of tire and bitumen microplastics the tire and bitumen particles 500 μm and new bitumen particles as control sample were analyzed by ftir atr fig 6a the control sample was taken from crumbs of tires used in passenger cars and identified as styrene butadiene rubber sbr fig 6b which corresponds to the original composition of tire tread grigoratos and martini 2014 sirisinha et al 2020 the peak of 1695 cm 1 and 1030 cm 1 are respectively associated with carbonyl compounds c o and sulfoxide s o compounds which are present in the aging process of bitumen feng et al 2016 liu et al 2021 marsac et al 2014 mirwald et al 2022 the spectrums of several tire wear particles were similar to the control sample while the spectrums of some samples did not match any polymer in the ftir library this is in line with the findings of researchers who discovered the presence of a small amount of pristine and pure twp particles in the environment grigoratos and martini 2014 kreider et al 2010 selbes et al 2015 sommer et al 2018 wagner et al 2018 the particles 500 μm could not be analyzed by ftir atr biginagwa et al 2016 leads and weinstein 2019 so the polymer type was identified by μraman spectroscopy the spectrums of tire particles have two main peaks in the wavelength of 1320 cm 1 and 1580 cm 1 which represent the two main peaks of carbon black fig 6c bokobza et al 2013 gillibert et al 2022 the composition of tires depends on the standards the specific formula of the company and the rating and type of use but the approximate mass percentages of the main compounds are 1 basic ingredients e g polybutadiene styrene butadiene natural rubber 40 50 2 filler e g carbon black silica 30 35 3 softener e g oil resin 15 4 vulcanization agents e g sulfur zinc oxide 2 5 and 5 additives 5 10 sommer et al 2018 therefore carbon black which is added as a filler to improve tire properties accounts for a large percentage of its mass kole et al 2017 3 5 the annual tire wear and particles emission two methods were used to estimate the amount of annual tire wear and particle emissions in tehran the first method utilized the copert model ntziachristos and boulter 2003 and mileage data from tehran air quality control to estimate emission factors and tire wear khazini et al 2023 on the other hand the second method estimated tire wear and particles emissions by multiplying the weight loss and number of tires kole et al 2017 table 3 presents the amount of tire wear as the main source of tire particles emission to the environment for light vehicles heavy vehicles and motorcycles in tehran while the most of abundant size of tire wear particles was 37 300 μm khazini et al 2023 considered a high share of the total particles to be 10 μm table 3 which was not analyzed in the present study and should be considered in future studies while the amount of tire wear was calculated as 0 24 kg cap yr in tehran it is extremely higher in developed countries such as the united states with 4 7 kg cap yr kole et al 2017 mostly because of the higher car per capita and mileage in developed countries compared to tehran these figures present the importance of tire wear as a main source of microplastics while usually no management practice is applied for tire particles control or for prohibiting their entrance to the environment reducing tire and bitumen particles in the environment requires both short term and long term strategies short term strategies include treating urban surface runoff making wear resistant tires using artificial intelligence to control traffic and vehicle speed and expanding the use of public transportation long term strategies include expanding the use of air taxis changing road pavement structure and using lighter materials in car manufacturing a combination of these strategies along with technological innovation infrastructure development and changes in behavior and culture will be necessary to make meaningful progress in reducing the amount of tire and bitumen particles released into the environment 4 conclusion in recent years the source and emission of tire and bitumen particles as important and growing contaminations in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems have been considered by several researchers while urban stormwater runoff is known as a main source of tire and bitumen emission to the environment there is a lack of knowledge about the concentrations and characteristics of these particles in stormwater runoff examination of tire and bitumen particles in stormwater runoff of tehran showed that their frequency varies in rainfall events factors affecting the number of wear particles of tires and bitumen in urban areas are varied and include the type of tire the use of the car vehicle speeds infrastructures such as the type of asphalt used and many other factors the size of tire and bitumen particles in urban areas is affected by various mechanisms in this study tire and bitumen particles in the sizes of 37 300 μm 300 500 μm and 500 5000 μm were investigated the results showed that most of the tire and bitumen particles observed were in the sizes of 37 300 μm this is consistent with studies of kreider et al the results of which indicated more tire particles were observed in smaller sizes furthermore the study of the frequency of tire and bitumen particles in harvested discharge showed that the highest frequency range minimum maximum corresponds to the second rainfall event r2 with the maximum discharge this shows that the intensity of rainfall and consequently the velocity of runoff can have a direct effect on the number of tire and bitumen particles the current findings support the claim that urban stormwater runoff especially in cities with a high population density and much activity such as the metropolis of tehran is an important source of tire and bitumen particles from human activities industries vehicles and other factors and their release into the environment which is eventually transferred to aquatic and terrestrial environments and can have destructive effects on receiving environments credit authorship contribution statement afshin mahjoub conceptualization writing

the temperature of the samples was kept at 50 c using a heater after digestion of organic matters and complete evaporation of hydrogen peroxide and water zinc chloride solution ρ 1 7 1 75 g ml was used for density based separation for this purpose 15 ml of zinc chloride solution was added to the dry sample which was then transferred to a 15 ml glass tube and centrifuged at a speed of 4000 rpm for 30 min ziajahromi et al 2017 2020 this process was repeated three times for 500 and 300 500 μm samples to separate the rubber and bitumen particles for 37 μm samples because of the large volume of mineral particles the process was repeated 5 times then the contents of the glass tube were filtered on a 37 μm stainless steel filter using a vacuum pump and the excess salt was washed with distilled water petroody et al 2020 2 3 2 separation of non plastic particles non plastic particles were identified by adding 5 ml rose bengal solution 0 2 mg ml to the particles remaining on the filter the mixture was kept for 5 min at room temperature to complete the reaction then the mixture was filtered using the vacuum filtration setup the residue was rinsed with distilled water and dried at 50 c for 15 min non plastic particles such as natural fibers e g cotton were colored pink while the color of synthetic fibers did not change ziajahromi et al 2017 2020 2 3 3 quality assurance and quality control during sampling and testing double distilled water and a cotton lab coat were used to prevent contamination of the samples all samples were analyzed under a hood and after each step the samples were covered with aluminum foil to prevent possible airborne contamination nuelle et al 2014 in all stages each device was washed three times with distilled water and dried before use new metal buckets were used at each sampling to prevent possible contamination at each round of sampling a control sample containing distilled water was used and processed similar to runoff samples no tire or bitumen contamination was observed in the control samples to check the counting accuracy 15 filters were selected randomly and recount was conducted by stereo microscope no deviation was observed in the number of particles 2 3 4 tire and bitumen particle analysis microscopic and spectral analysis ftir and μraman the morphology and classification of tire and bitumen wear particles were investigated with a stereo microscope equipped with a camera kern ozl 45 kecam 10 mp camera the initial separation of the particles was done with sharp and pointed forceps so that the tire particles due to their elastic properties would return to their original shape after compression the bitumen particles however have adhesive properties and do not return to their original state after compression järlskog et al 2020 2021 to increase the tests reliability the melting test was done by mounting some of the analyzed tire and bitumen particles on a glass and placing them in an oven at a temperature above softening temperature section 2 3 3 the morphology of the tire particles was not affected at the raised temperature while the bitumen particles were softened and their size expanded in total 4166 and 191 tire and bitumen particles respectively were counted at the stormwater events and base flows one percent of them were spectrally analyzed using a micro raman spectrometer at laser wavelengths of 785 nm confocal raman microscope labram hr evolution horiba and fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy fourier transform infrared spectroscopy avatar thermo labspec6 software was used to identify micro raman spectrums and omnic software was used to identify ftir spectrums 2 4 statistical analysis data normality was assessed by shapiro wilk normality test homogeneity of variances was assessed by leven test and differences in microplastic size between events were evaluated by kruskal wallis non parametric test at a significance level of 0 05 spss20 software was used for statistical analyses 3 results and discussion 3 1 tire and bitumen particles in rainfall and baseflow events the average numbers mean standard deviation n sr 23 n b 9 of tire particles counted in rainfall and baseflow events were 20 4 5 7 range 3 3 60 5 particles l and 1 5 0 7 range 0 5 3 particles l respectively while the average numbers of bitumen particles observed in rainfall and base flow events were 21 4 10 1 range 3 5 73 particles l and 2 8 1 6 range 0 8 6 5 particles l respectively fig 2 considering the normality of data sig 0 318 and the inhomogeneity of variances sig 0 003 the difference in particle size between tire and bitumen in rainfall events was found to be statistically significant sig 0 297 the concentration of tire and bitumen particles in this study may have been influenced by the features of catchment the climatic conditions such as amount intensity and duration of rainfall liu et al 2019 and the size of the collected particles in a similar study by järlskog et al 2020 2021 they found in two catchments in the central part of gothenburg city that the number of tire and bitumen particles was influenced by the area diurnal traffic load amount and intensity of rainfall number of dry days before sampling and the amount of rainfall between two sampling times in each catchment in the present study particles 37 μm were collected while kreider et al 2010 showed that twp 37 μm can occupy a large percentage in addition zncl2 solution can separate tire and bitumen particles with a density 1 7 1 75 g ml while the density of twps new trwp carbon black and styrene butadiene rubber have been reported as 1 13 1 16 g ml 0 94 2 5 g ml 1 8 g ml and 0 94 1 04 g ml respectively klöckner et al 2019 knight et al 2020 kovochich et al 2021 rhodes et al 2012 sommer et al 2018 estimated a density of 1 26 g ml for trwp on the other hand kreider et al 2010 reported the mass of mineral particles in rp and unused tp equal to 53 and 16 respectively thus considering that the density of mineral particles equals 2 6 g ml the density of trwp can be higher as evidenced by recent reports järlskog et al 2020 klöckner et al 2019 unice et al 2019 the current study used a higher density for separation than the density used by leads and weinstein 2019 and ziajahromi et al 2020 table 2 3 2 comparison of tire and bitumen particles size tire and bitumen particles with a size of 37 300 μm were the most abundant in the rainfall events and the baseflow fig 3 this is consistent with studies of kreider et al 2010 kole et al 2017 leads and weinstein 2019 and järlskog et al 2020 2021 kreider et al 2010 found that the size distribution of rp varied from 4 to 265 μm with a peak of 25 μm but twp had a two dimensional distribution with a size range of 4 to 350 μm with two peaks of 5 and 25 μm in another study on the particle size distribution of tire wear and bitumen particles in an urban area järlskog et al 2021 found that particles between 20 and 100 μm in size were more abundant than particles 100 μm in size therefore further attention to tire and bitumen particles smaller than 37 μm is needed in future studies 3 3 effect of flow on load and size of tire and bitumen particles the most abundant concentration of tire and bitumen particles was those 37 300 μm in size in both rainfall events and the baseflow fig 5 the main reason for this is related to the origin of tire and bitumen particles in urban areas where wearing between car tires and road surface produces a lot of small size tire and bitumen particles the second rainfall event r2 with a peak of 79 2 m3 s 1 passed the highest numbers of tire and bitumen particles equal to 4 791 600 and 5 781 600 particles respectively fig 4 high flowrate may indicate more widespread and higher intensity rainfall in the upstream of the catchment which in itself not only increases the number of tire and bitumen particles but also has a direct effect on the severe turbulence flow in the catchment at the baseflow or after the stormwater calmed down the turbulence decreases and denser tire and bitumen particles can settle in the path in the next rainfall event with a sharp increase in turbulence these particles are washed out from the catchment surface and transferred downstream thus as lange et al found in their study on 9 rainfall events the concentrations of tire and bitumen particles are related to the peak intensity of rainfall they observed the maximum peak of rainfall in the events of 1 5 1 mm h and 9 8 8 mm h respectively moreover in these events the concentrations of tire and bitumen particles were higher than other events most probably because of the high intensity of rainfall which could re suspend the settled and accumulated particles on the catchment surface lange et al 2021 in addition the results of smyth et al 2021 studies revealed that the peak intensity of rainfall is related to human microplastics except fibers in urban stormwater an increase in rainfall intensity may also move the particles deposited on the asphalt and enter them into the stormwater 3 4 structural analysis of tire and bitumen microplastics the tire and bitumen particles 500 μm and new bitumen particles as control sample were analyzed by ftir atr fig 6a the control sample was taken from crumbs of tires used in passenger cars and identified as styrene butadiene rubber sbr fig 6b which corresponds to the original composition of tire tread grigoratos and martini 2014 sirisinha et al 2020 the peak of 1695 cm 1 and 1030 cm 1 are respectively associated with carbonyl compounds c o and sulfoxide s o compounds which are present in the aging process of bitumen feng et al 2016 liu et al 2021 marsac et al 2014 mirwald et al 2022 the spectrums of several tire wear particles were similar to the control sample while the spectrums of some samples did not match any polymer in the ftir library this is in line with the findings of researchers who discovered the presence of a small amount of pristine and pure twp particles in the environment grigoratos and martini 2014 kreider et al 2010 selbes et al 2015 sommer et al 2018 wagner et al 2018 the particles 500 μm could not be analyzed by ftir atr biginagwa et al 2016 leads and weinstein 2019 so the polymer type was identified by μraman spectroscopy the spectrums of tire particles have two main peaks in the wavelength of 1320 cm 1 and 1580 cm 1 which represent the two main peaks of carbon black fig 6c bokobza et al 2013 gillibert et al 2022 the composition of tires depends on the standards the specific formula of the company and the rating and type of use but the approximate mass percentages of the main compounds are 1 basic ingredients e g polybutadiene styrene butadiene natural rubber 40 50 2 filler e g carbon black silica 30 35 3 softener e g oil resin 15 4 vulcanization agents e g sulfur zinc oxide 2 5 and 5 additives 5 10 sommer et al 2018 therefore carbon black which is added as a filler to improve tire properties accounts for a large percentage of its mass kole et al 2017 3 5 the annual tire wear and particles emission two methods were used to estimate the amount of annual tire wear and particle emissions in tehran the first method utilized the copert model ntziachristos and boulter 2003 and mileage data from tehran air quality control to estimate emission factors and tire wear khazini et al 2023 on the other hand the second method estimated tire wear and particles emissions by multiplying the weight loss and number of tires kole et al 2017 table 3 presents the amount of tire wear as the main source of tire particles emission to the environment for light vehicles heavy vehicles and motorcycles in tehran while the most of abundant size of tire wear particles was 37 300 μm khazini et al 2023 considered a high share of the total particles to be 10 μm table 3 which was not analyzed in the present study and should be considered in future studies while the amount of tire wear was calculated as 0 24 kg cap yr in tehran it is extremely higher in developed countries such as the united states with 4 7 kg cap yr kole et al 2017 mostly because of the higher car per capita and mileage in developed countries compared to tehran these figures present the importance of tire wear as a main source of microplastics while usually no management practice is applied for tire particles control or for prohibiting their entrance to the environment reducing tire and bitumen particles in the environment requires both short term and long term strategies short term strategies include treating urban surface runoff making wear resistant tires using artificial intelligence to control traffic and vehicle speed and expanding the use of public transportation long term strategies include expanding the use of air taxis changing road pavement structure and using lighter materials in car manufacturing a combination of these strategies along with technological innovation infrastructure development and changes in behavior and culture will be necessary to make meaningful progress in reducing the amount of tire and bitumen particles released into the environment 4 conclusion in recent years the source and emission of tire and bitumen particles as important and growing contaminations in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems have been considered by several researchers while urban stormwater runoff is known as a main source of tire and bitumen emission to the environment there is a lack of knowledge about the concentrations and characteristics of these particles in stormwater runoff examination of tire and bitumen particles in stormwater runoff of tehran showed that their frequency varies in rainfall events factors affecting the number of wear particles of tires and bitumen in urban areas are varied and include the type of tire the use of the car vehicle speeds infrastructures such as the type of asphalt used and many other factors the size of tire and bitumen particles in urban areas is affected by various mechanisms in this study tire and bitumen particles in the sizes of 37 300 μm 300 500 μm and 500 5000 μm were investigated the results showed that most of the tire and bitumen particles observed were in the sizes of 37 300 μm this is consistent with studies of kreider et al the results of which indicated more tire particles were observed in smaller sizes furthermore the study of the frequency of tire and bitumen particles in harvested discharge showed that the highest frequency range minimum maximum corresponds to the second rainfall event r2 with the maximum discharge this shows that the intensity of rainfall and consequently the velocity of runoff can have a direct effect on the number of tire and bitumen particles the current findings support the claim that urban stormwater runoff especially in cities with a high population density and much activity such as the metropolis of tehran is an important source of tire and bitumen particles from human activities industries vehicles and other factors and their release into the environment which is eventually transferred to aquatic and terrestrial environments and can have destructive effects on receiving environments credit authorship contribution statement afshin mahjoub conceptualization writing

1191,topsoil loss is a widespread environmental concern causing adverse impacts on natural and human systems severe weather accompanied with human activities can exacerbate this issue degrading soil health and consequently accelerating global and regional food insecurity erosion impairs soil physical and chemical properties such as infiltration rate water holding capacity loss of nutrients including soil carbon and nitrogen although temporal properties of a rainfall event have meaningful implications spatial heterogeneity of a rainfall contributes substantially and cannot be overlooked therefore in this study we investigated soil loss using weather radar nexrad data we developed extreme rainfall er scenarios and land use practices nomgt s0 s1 s2 and s3 and evaluated the watershed response we found that grazing can manifold soil loss and if accompanied with extreme rainfalls soil loss accelerates impacting different subbasins each time our results suggest that spatial heterogeneity of ers can be more significant in individual extreme rainfalls however over a year soil moisture and type of the management practices grazing and farming could contribute more to topsoil loss we classified watershed subbasins into different classes of soil loss severity to determine the soil loss hotspots soil loss can go as high as 350 ton ha yr under the ers land use practices can increase erosion by 3600 slight increase in rainfall concentration s1 can put vulnerable subbasins in extremely severe class 150 ton ha yr under moderate increase in the rainfall concentration s2 more subbasins fall into extremely severe category yielding approximately 200 ton ha yr under high increase in rainfall concentration s3 almost all the subbasins fall into the extremely severe class yielding 200 ton ha yr we found that in vulnerable subbasins up to 10 increase in concentration ratio index ci can increase annual soil loss up to 75 single er can generate up to 35 of annual soil loss under one er event soil loss hotspot subbasins can lose up to 160 ton ha day 32 and 80 increase in rainfall amount for an er event can increase soil loss by 94 and 285 respectively the results also reveal that grazing and farming can be responsible for up 50 of soil loss our findings indicate the importance of site specific managements to mitigate soil loss and all the consequences our study can help in better soil loss management implementation insights of our study may also help in water quality control and flood mitigation planning efforts keywords soil loss erosion radar extreme rainfall grazing swat data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil erosion is a common form of land degradation which can lead to decrease in crop productivity and increase in flood possibility admas et al 2022 borrelli et al 2017 pimentel and burgess 2013 it is a location dependent widespread environmental hazard caused by water runoff xie et al 2011 it exports nutrients which impairs river water quality and aquatic ecosystem habitat and it causes and helps growing the dead zone in water bodies such as gulf of mexico inamdar et al 2018 q wang et al 2021a water induced erosion comprises 56 of world soil loss which cause almost 10 million ha agricultural land each year to be out of food production chain pimentel 2006 this vulnerability could be tied in increasing precipitation intensities and make the regions more erosion prone borrelli et al 2021 erosion prone parts of a watershed can be costly for the ecosystem and the environment identifying these areas are critical to introduce effective management practices conservation practices in agriculture which often referred as best management practices bmps are techniques and guidelines to improve water quality and agricultural productivity and to mitigate soil erosion and nutrient loss briak et al 2019 panagos et al 2015 zhou et al 2016 bmps implementation however can be expensive many studies have been focused on bmps to mitigate soil erosion however site specific bmps are imperative for effective soil conservation admas et al 2022 determining the proper location for bmps can also be challenging additionally the unequivocal consequences of the warming climate can expose lands to extreme rainfalls ers at regional and global scales more frequent ers generate high peak discharges quickly and create floods that can wash away soil active layer especially in growing season another associated risk is sediment deposition it affects the storage and hydropower generation capacity of the reservoirs s dutta 2016 ers one main associated risk is topsoil loss scientific community now have robust confidence on increasing trends on ers and more prominent intensification fischer et al 2013 fischer and knutti 2014 pendergrass and hartmann 2014 pfahl et al 2017 which is supported by robust agreement among them in theory model results and observational data fischer and knutti 2016 guerreiro et al 2018 hoerling et al 2016 markonis et al 2019 moustakis et al 2021 papalexiou and montanari 2019 many others also reported the rise in frequency of extreme rainfalls including kang et al 2009 stone et al 2005 kang et al 2009 stone et al 2005 groisman et al 2012 studied the changes in intensity of heavy precipitation in the central us and they reported significant increase in the frequency of very heavy rainfall and extreme precipitation events 40 increase groisman et al 2012 westra et al 2014 investigated short duration ers and concluded increase in magnitude and frequency of flash floods while emphasizing on local scale thermodynamic effects westra et al 2014 moustakias et al 2021 have studied er events over the us and concluded that a 20 year rainfall would became a 7 year rainfall on most part of the us moustakis et al 2021 1 increase in rainfall amount will increase the soil erosion up to 1 7 at multiple locations pruski and nearing 2002 in southeast us observed changes in very heavy precipitation has increased 27 walsh et al 2014a for each degree of world temperature increase the current most er events are likely to double myhre et al 2019 runoff has a direct relation to erosion with the increase in frequency of heavy precipitations soil health and functionality can be significantly degraded parajuli et al in 2016 and yasarer et al in 2017 studied the impact of climate change on sediment yield and concluded that the frequency of extreme rainfall events would increase in the future and that these changes would affect soil erosion and consequently crop productivity in multiple ways parajuli et al 2016 l mw yasarer et al 2017 in agricultural regions going through rapid land use change climate variability national resource conservation policies and socioeconomic developments can contribute to soil health aghsaei et al 2020 de oliveira serrão et al 2022 subhasri dutta and sen 2018 schiefer et al 2013 thus it is essential to understand sediment response to changing climate for preventing flood and drought and for soil conservation and water resource management borrelli et al 2021 zan xu et al 2021 a few important problems with soil erosion modeling are result uncertainties non linear relation within parameters and upscaling difficulties de vente and poesen 2005 although modeling obstacles accompanied with recent changes in climate impose challenges to our understanding of erosion process ongoing advances in technology e g data science can offer decent solutions for example soil erosion models have recently started using geospatial analysis tools in soil conservation and management practices panagos et al 2015b here we incorporate weather radar technology to capture spatially small scale hydrologic extremes stream and rain gauges networks are often limited in capturing spatial variability of rainfall alexander et al 2020 lengfeld et al 2020 katie price et al 2014 weather radar technology can efficiently capture ers especially short time less than a day ers and is more accurate in smaller watersheds gao et al 2020 lengfeld et al 2020 k price et al 2011 sexton et al 2010 additionally in comparison to in situ gauge hydrologic extremes are captured more than almost 1000 times by radar stations lengfeld et al 2020 even though scientists have recommended many water management approaches to mitigate climate change impacts most of them don t offer local solutions kang et al 2009 modeling soil erosion cannot be up or downscaled in 2004 vente et al studied the soil erosion scale issues and they concluded that soil erosion at one scale cannot be applied for other scales de vente and poesen 2005 there is also a lack of knowledge on spatial distribution of the models pandey et al 2021 borrelli et al 2021 carried out a global review and statistical analysis study included 3030 modeling reports from 126 countries and concluded that spatial aspect in less than half of one of the most common used models was concern borrelli et al 2021 thus it is crucial to study the soil erosion on finer scales the relationship between soil loss and ers is underrepresented and there is a lack of understanding it admas et al 2022 c lu et al 2020 parajuli et al 2016 xu et al 2021 x c zhang and nearing 2005 there is no uniform conclusion adopted by the scientific community and lack of understanding caused by lack of quantitative studies specially at the regional scale points out the gap therefore this study aims to address the understanding of interaction between soil erosion and er spatial variation our objectives are i to investigate erosion from land under land use management and ers by using weather radar data and ii to find hotspots for soil loss in this regard we couple stage iv radar data with hydrologic modeling under variety of weather and management scenarios the result of this study can be applied in agro ecosystem resiliency research and bmp implementation decision making as well as flood mitigation and water quality planning sediment process studies also offer understanding of microplastic processes in aquatic environments waldschläger et al 2022 2 materials and methods 2 1 method and data collection 2 1 1 method we incorporated geospatial hydrological modeling to achieve the objectives the required data including weather radar and land use data were obtained and utilized in soil and water assessment tool swat jeff arnold 1994 the radar data were manipulated and converted to swat suitable format the model then was calibrated for discharge and sediment after sensitivity analysis for parametrization for detailed information please refer to makhtoumi et al 2020 then the scenarios were developed considering future weather conditions and practiced human activities in the watershed the model was run under the scenarios and finally the output results were statistically and spatially analyzed following sections describes the steps fig 1 shows the framework diagram 2 1 2 spatial data swat incorporates spatial and temporal data neitsch et al 2011 three types of spatial data are soil land use and elevation data gridded gnatsgo gridded national soil survey geographic database is used that allows up 5 soil horizons to be modeled with 10 m resolution soilsurvey 2019 the land use data is nlcd2019 and is obtained from multi resolution land characteristics mrlc consortiums dewitz 2021 see supporting information si for the detail 2 1 3 hydro meteorological and sediment data precipitation temperature solar radiation wind speed and humidity are the input data which swat require at daily scale neitsch et al 2011 for the last four in situ gauge station data were obtained for precipitation however we used three types of data stage iv nexrad radar klazura and imy 1993 multi radar multi sensor mrms j zhang et al 2016 and in situ rain gauge data the stage iv qpe data from 2016 to end of 2021 obtained from nws website and used for scenario development for the purpose of extreme rainfall studies a high spatial 1 km and temporal 5 min resolution of reanalysis mrms was developed for the period of 2001 to 2011 j zhang et al 2016 which is used for calibration and validation in this study the national weather service nws operates the us nexrad next generation radar weather radar network which includes 160 high resolution s band doppler weather radars the network was installed in late 1980 s comprising of wsr 88ds weather surveillance radar 1988 doppler for detailed description see the si according to price et al 2014 rain gauge and radar data nexrad were the best options available for hydrologic modeling katie price et al 2014 tobin and bennett 2009 radar data is better in simulating daily stream flow and its frequency with more pronounced differences in smaller catchments k price et al 2011 additionally for small catchments higher rain station density results in better output especially in sediment fluxes chaplot 2005 masih et al 2011 gridded version of nexrad which seamless dataset is better than ground based weather stations also it has higher accuracy in capturing weather conditions in small watershed gao et al 2020 gao et al 2017 jayakrishnan 2001 moon et al 2004 therefore we used the stage iv qpe for the scenario development and the mrms reanalysis for watershed hydrology and sediment processes modeling the streamflow sediment discharge and sediment concentrations data were collected from the national water dashboard of the us geological survey usgs the usgs site close to the outlet of the watershed that considered as the monitoring point for all variables is usgs 07277700 see the si for more detail 2 2 study area hickahala creek watershed hcw is in northwestern mississippi approximately 50 km south of memphis tn it is one of mississippi river basin subwatersheds it encompasses 3 huc 12 080302040401 to 3 with the drainage area of 312 km2 the main river stream is called hickahala creek and is a tributary of the coldwater river upstream of arkabutla reservoir hcw is located between the 91 and 88 7 and latitudes 34 and 34 88 hcw hillsides are prone to erosion when there isn t or less natural vegetable cover this sediments are deposited in the channels or drained into arkabutla reservoir and decrease the flood carrying capacity making the region prone to flooding under ers biedenharn et al 2004 the main land use is pasture 43 and the second main is forest deciduous 23 mrlc consortium 2019 agricultura land use is third with 14 of the hcw area the main

are irrigated usda nass 2007 collins and flaya comprise the main soil cover they both are silty texture and prone to erosion of any type if left bare hcw s climate is the humid subtropical characterized by temperate winter and hot summer temporal heterogeneity of the rainfall makes northwestern ms subject to drought and flood destructive thunderstorms are expected for average period of two months each year annual mean temperature is 15 4 c the lowest temperature recorded is 22 2 c in january and the highest recorded is 41 1 c in august average annual rainfall ranges from 1371 mm to 1423 mm the wettest month is may and the driest is october fig 2 shows the study area including the elevation map land use map and all station locations 2 3 model simulation and performance evaluation 2 3 1 hydrology soil and water assessment tool revised version known as swat was used jeff arnold 1994 it is a process based and semi distributed for river basin scale j g arnold et al 1998 fortran language with 300 subroutines are used to model different parts of hydrological and biogeochemical processes on the surface and under the ground jg arnold et al 2011 it is efficient and can be used for short and long term impact studies with good computational effectiveness de oliveira serrão et al 2022 it allows to split the watershed into small parts of unique combination of soil land use and slope known hydrologic response unit hru and uses the properties of hrus for the operation j g arnold et al 2012 gassman et al 2007 this feature allows sediment loss and transport to be modeled at hru level which results in quite good details neitsch et al 2011 for details about equations used see makhtoumi et al 2020 edivaldo serrao et al in recent study concluded that swat is a good estimator in hydro sedimentological parameters that can be utilized for decision making applications de oliveira serrão et al 2022 prabhanjan et al 2015 zx xu et al 2009 zan xu et al 2021 the model is capable of detecting erosion prone parts of the watershed subhasri dutta and sen 2018 and uses subbasin properties as the main source of soil erosion subhasri dutta and sen 2018 in watershed delineation process when defining the hru we used 5 threshold for all three features i e land use soil and slope this set up created 2146 hrus and 30 subbasins see the si for the detailed land use soil horizons and other input data 2 3 2 sediment simulation in swat occurs in two phases land phase and routing phase neitsch et al 2011 at hru level sediment loss is calculated and along with water and other nutrients is regulated into the main channel at subbasin level makhtoumi et al 2020 water and sediment routing is determined in the second phase where in stream processes are simulated j g arnold et al 2012 swat uses the modified usle wischmeier and smith 1965 1978 which utilizes the rainfall energy factor instead of a runoff factor this enhances the sediment yield prediction because runoff is a function of antecedent moisture condition and rainfall energy it gets rid of the delivery ratio and individual storm events can be studied neitsch et al 2011 usle is widely used in modeling sediment loss and it is used in determining sediment yield responses to extreme rainfall events feng et al 2015 zan xu et al 2021 swat takes 4 main factors into account when modeling soil loss soil erodibility cover and management effect support practice factor for specific practices such as counter tillage strip cropping and terrace steepness effect and the rock percentage in the first soil layer neitsch et al 2011 the following is the equation used neitsch et al 2011 1 sed 11 8 q surf q peak area hru 0 56 k usle c usle p usle ls usle cfrg where sed is the sediment yield ton q surf is the surface runoff mm h2o ha and is calculated using the curve number equation q peak is the peak runoff rate m3 s calculated by the rational method area hru is the area of the hru ha k usle is the usle soil erodibility factor ton m2 m3 ton cm and is based on soil type based primarily on of silt sand and organic matter and soil structure and saturated hydraulic conductivity c usle is the usle cover and management factor p usle is the usle support practice factor ls usle is the usle topographic factor and cfrg is the coarse fragment factor detailed explanation of the parameters as well as related data tables can be

calibration we evaluated accuracy of the model output via graphical comparison and statistical metrics j g arnold et al 2012 gassman et al 2007 to calibrate the model we used combination of manual and auto calibration d moriasi et al 2012 we carried out calibration and validation using split sample strategy d moriasi et al 2012 and latin hypercube sampling latin hypercube sampling is considered more advantageous than monte carlo the former makes sure the whole range of a given parameter is sampled while the later performs random sampling which could result in samples clustered in one part of the parameter range to parametrize we carried out a sensitivity analysis sa j g arnold et al 2012 saltelli et al 2004 and then utilized the sequential uncertainty fitting version algorithm sufi2

temperature and mean daily temperature the total number of heat units needed to bring a crop to maturity can be calculated neitsch et al 2011 for forest or range the start of the growing season is the time when the buds start developing and the end of the growing season is the time when the plant seeds reach maturity neitsch et al 2011 we used specific dates rather than heat units to reduce the uncertainty since when using heat units we can t know if the application of fertilizer or pesticide scheduled is on a rainy day or not and if it does coincide significant amount of nutrient would be transported with surface runoff neitsch et al 2011 2 4 1 management operation in this study scenarios include management operation under different weather condition main management operations are farming soybean corn crop rotation irrigation fertilizer application and grazing the scheduling management operation were selected based on several studies cao et al 2018 her et al 2016 c lu et al

index was in normal range 2 4 1 3 irrigation in terms of irrigation we tried two options auto irrigation and manual irrigation although the later allows to implement major growth stages of crop development we used auto irrigation based on soil water content irrigation is challenging to schedule and in reality there isn t a fixed time for irrigation and farmers irrigate based on soil water content allen et al 1998 y chen et al 2017 2018 kebede et al 2014 the irrigation amount for corn and soybean are 3100 and 2800 m3ha 1 respectively massey et al 2017 lindsey mw yasarer et al 2020 based

of ers under warming climate verma et al 2015 q wang et al 2021a south and southeastern us receives maximum rain during summer and most of the ers occurs in this time fig 5 the er changes in south us has rose 27 in last few decades mondal et al 2020 walsh et al 2014b this changes for mississippi river basin can increase 17 in rainfall and 32 in runoff in flash flood producing ers dougherty and rasmussen 2021 studies also indicate that the total annual precipitation for the region won t change groisman et al 2012 to account for these changes we developed the weather scenarios as follows in this study we have five scenarios one is with historical rainfall but without any management operations nomgt and one is with the scheduled management operations and historical rainfall s0 baseline and the other three are with both the management operations and intensified rainfalls s1 s2 s3 table 4 shows the scenario details three types of extreme rainfall scenarios for s1 s2 s3 were developed by changing the rainfall concentration indices while the total annual rainfall kept constant these indices were used to characterize the spatial and temporal distribution of the er events y lu et al 2019 zan xu et al 2021 we obtained the stage iv qpe data for the years 2016 to 2021 and analyzed this data to determine the base year for further scenario development to select a base year as a representative year that could account for the changes in rainfall behavior in the region we used daily rainfall concentration index ci abolverdi et al 2016 martin vide 2004 and the monthly rainfall concentration pci indices de luis et al 2001 oliver 1980 tables 3 and 4 show the results the following are the eqs 2 7 used to calculate the indices 2 pci 100 i 1 12 p i 2 i 1 12 p i 2 where p i is the monthly rainfall amount of month i pci ranges from around 8 to 100 if annual rainfall of a given year is concentrated in a single month pci becomes 100 and if the rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year then the pci equals to a value around 8 y lu et al 2019 oliver 1980 pci values that are 10 indicates a uniform distribution pci values between 10 and 15 indicates moderate seasonal concentration pci values between 15 and 20 indicate quite irregularity in the rainfall event distribution where rainfall occurs only in a few months and pci values 20 shows substantial rainfall concentration our pci result show that most of the years from 2016 to 2021 falls moderate concentration class and only year 2017 falls in slightly below 10 the daily concentration index ci eqs 3 7 is used to evaluate the contribution of individual er events to i e variation of proportion of daily rainfall compared to the cumulative precipitation of the year li et al 2011 it can be used to quantitatively assess the largest ers relative or percentage contribution brooks and carruthers 1953 to calculate ci the daily rainfall values should be classified based on class limits contribution of the classes to the annual rainfall amount is associated with the exponential curve called normalized rainfall curve jolliffe and hope 1996 the curve can be determined as eq 3 fitting the values of x i y i martin vide 2004 the equation can generate polygonal line known as concentration curve or lorenz curve and widely used in many area w chen et al 2015 coscarelli and caloiero 2012 vélez et al 2019 wheeler and shaw 1994 zubieta et al 2017 after determining the classes the number of rainy days and corresponding amount of rain for each class is calculated then the accumulated percentage of precipitation days x and the associative accumulated percentage of precipitation y are calculated then curve is derived 3 y x exp b 100 x a 4 lna x i 2 ln y i x i x i ln x i x i 2 ln x i x i x i ln y i n x i 2 x i 2 5 b n x i ln y i x i ln x i n x i ln x i x i ln y i n x i 2 x i 2 6 s 5000 0 100 y 7 ci s 5000 where a and b are regression coefficients by the least square method n is the number of classes with non zero frequency s is the area enclosed by the bisector of the quadrant and the curve ci is the fraction of s and ranges from 0 to 1 the larger the area the higher the ci indicating greater concentration degree and the greater ci means more rainfall occur in fewer days our result for the stage iv qpe data from 2016 to 2021 shows that the ci for hcw ranges approximately from 0 6 to 0 7 with 2017 being the highest table 3 based on table 3 and to ensure that the changes in the scenario rainfall events are within the acceptable range we accepted the year 2021 as the base year for scenario development this was because 2021 has the second to the highest ci and third in the annual rainfall amount it also has the highest amount of one day precipitation 146 57 mm in june 200 yrs return period among the six year 2016 2021 using eq 8 and 9 we created rainfall values for scenario s1 s2 s3 this method makes sure that the total annual rainfall would stay constant while four top highest rainy days become more intensified rainfall events zan xu et al 2021 we concentrated 3 6 and 9 of the cumulative precipitation of the year to top 4 daily precipitations in the base year 2021 eq 9 was applied to the rest of the days to lower the rainfall amount corresponding each day fig 4 left panel shows the developed rainfall series as scenarios 8 r ii r i i 5 365 c 1 c j 1 r j 9 r

in the base year i 1 2 3 4 and j 5 6 7 365 table 4 shows ci and pci and the percentage of increases for ci as well as the concentration ratio corresponding each scenario 3 results and discussion hydrological simulation of hcw indicated that for streamflow the most sensitive parameters were cnop runoff curve number esco soil evaporation rchrg dp aquafer recharge and sol awc soil moisture hcw is located in outcrop region where sparta sand aquifer is exposed at the surface unconfined thus the groundwater table is close to the surface and facilitates transmission loss making rchrg dp responsive mckee and hays 2002 the model indicates that the most influential land use change that controls soil loss is grazing this result was expected but the sensitivity was remarkably high the grazing parameters bio eat daily consumed biomass bio trmp daily trampled biomass and manure kg daily deposited manure are the most sensitive ones throughout sediment parametrization and modeling chiang et al 2010 park et al 2017 the second responsive process for soil loss was sediment routing process including parameters such as spcon spexp and prf aghsaei et al 2020 razad et al 2021 third sensitive process was soil loss from land surface where parameters such as usle k usle c usle p and sol rock play role see the si for parameters definition halecki et al 2018 calibration for both streamflow and sediment were challenging and the satisfactory metrics were at the lower side of the acceptable range this can be due to small size of hcw hcw drains inly 312km2 and there is no upstream inlet this makes the amount of daily discharge sometimes 1 cms indicating some degree of intermittency reynolds et al 2015 on the other hand there were days when both streamflow and sediment discharge were high figs 3 4 this implies that hcw is flash flood prone and easily eroded biedenharn et al 2004 dougherty and rasmussen 2021 streamflow and sediment yield were calculated for the base year to investigate the effect of extreme rainfall events on soil loss from land surface we divided hcw into 30 subbasins huc14 to spatially investigate the characteristics of ers and further divided each subbasin s underlying surface condition land use soil and slope into hrus since there is no major reservoir in hcw that could interfere with the transport processes of suspended sediment we were able to study the upland sediment concentration heimann et al 2011 fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of the agricultural and pasture management practices within hcw the distributions indicate land use irregularity among subbasins however subbasins located on the south of hcw indicate more management operations usda nass 2009 initial analysis shows that adding the management operation farming and grazing increases the surface runoff average upland sediment yield and in stream sediment change by 8 3 1206 and 1397 respectively soil erosion at hcw was originally high however appropriate management practices were implemented to mitigate the erosion biedenharn et al 2004 h c w i t mdeq 2009 although the measures controlled the soil loss and the deterioration at some degree recent emergent weather and climate irregularities appose another threat to the soil crop production and livestock hcw drains into lake arkabutla and therefore can endanger many economic opportunities soil loss can inflict both on site and off site costs here we mainly study the on site consequences to do so we analyzed different water and sediment variable under the scenarios we compared the variables under nomgt no management s0 with management but no change in rainfall s1 3 er concentration s2 6 er concentration and s3 9 er concentration s0 is our baseline scenario we presented the result in annual scale and extreme rainfall event scale therefore this section is divided into three sub sections as follows annual scale extreme rainfall event scale and annual vs event scale soil loss 3 1 annual scale soil loss according to the in situ gauge data mean annual flow discharge at the monitoring point is 2122 cms and the mean annual sediment discharge is 102 974 metric ton or 3 3 ton per hectare fig 7 shows the annual spatial distribution of rainfall water yield sediment yield sediment concentration in the reaches soil available water content and et for each subbasin we used stage iv radar data with 4 km resolution and it allows us to see how much rainfall occurs in each subbasin fig 7a indicates that under all scenarios annual rainfall ranges from 1560 to 1720 mm subbasins located at the north receives more rainfall subbasins 5 6 7 16 15 2 and 4 than subbasins at the south of the watershed subbasins 23 22 and 27 spatial distribution difference between s0 and s1 and between s1 s2 and s3 are interesting our weather scenario development model redistributes rainfall to subbasins 5 6 7 under s1 c 3 however as c concentration ratio increases s2 and the s3 more annual rainfall goes to subbasin 16 since subbasin 16 is heavily grazed fig 6a this subbasin can be more vulnerable to soil degradation due to high erosion ritchie et al 1978 swat mechanism to allocate rainfall to each subbasin creates uncertainties if averaging methods such as thiessen polygon is used it might help distributing rainfall amount smoother however it will create unrealistic rainfall records for some of the points this could lead to error in finding the soil erosion hotspots zeiger and hubbart 2017 on the other hand if fine gridded data such as nexrad stage iv or mrms is applied it might assign two different rainfall amounts to neighboring subbasins where they in reality received approximately the same amount of rain this is due to the swat mechanism that assign rainfall from stations whichever is the closes to the centroid of the subbasin zeiger and hubbart 2017 annual water yield wyld q surface q lateral q groundwater transmission loss distribution is different than that of rainfall neitsch et al 2011 it shows clear trend from nomgt scenario to s3 fig 7b it indicates that underlying conditions on the watershed surface has bigger contribution to wyld than precipitation makhtoumi et al 2020 comparing nomgt to s0 where the difference is only management practices in s0 indicates that grazing and farming soybean corn yields more surface runoff which could increase the risk of flood parajuli et al 2016 park et al 2017 subbasins 6 and 16 are reflects 8 5 and 11 2 increase in wyld when the management practices are added the increases rise further for most of the subbasins as the concentration c increases zan xu et al 2021 figure 7c presents the mean daily soil water content swc throughout the watershed swc ranges from 130 in subbasin 17 to around 300 mm in subbasin 3 comparing nomgt to s0 reveals that the added management slightly increases the soil s water holding capacity park et al 2017 comparing swc distribution to rainfall and wyld indicates that subbasins that received more rainfall and produced more wyld generally north part of hcw have less water holding capacity than subbasins located at the south increasing ci is associated with less swc throughout hcw this means more severe rainfall will deteriorate the infiltration rate and water holding capacity of the soil which could lead to drought or flood gavahi et al 2022 ho hagemann et al 2015 wasko and nathan 2019 wasko et al 2021 figure 7d presents evapotranspiration et distribution for the scenarios et decreases when adding the management operations s0 or severe rainfalls s1 s2 s3 vázquez et al 2020 and yang et al 2016 also reported the same results vázquez et al 2020 yang et al 2016 et ranges from 600 to 830 mm throughout the subbasins under different scenarios the lowest et values are under s3 and the highest et amounts are under nomgt scenario comparing nomgt and s0 reveals that practicing grazing 44 area and farming 14 area in the watershed decreases et the highest ets occurs in subbasins 15 22 23 and it decreases 15 12 and 14 respectively when the grazing and farming added subbasin 7 under all scenarios had high et this is due to the irrigation the model doesn t allow swc would fall below a set threshold and irrigates cultivated crop land use therefore et stays higher than many other subbasins despite scenario changes y chen et al 2018 verstraeten et al 2008 changing the land use nomgt to s0 inflicts bigger change than increasing rainfall ci makhtoumi et al 2020 figure 7e shows the annual soil loss distribution it indicates that both the management operations and ers exacerbate the topsoil loss admas et al 2022 halecki et al 2018 zan xu et al 2021 l mw yasarer et al 2017 x c zhang and nearing 2005 topsoil loss under the scenarios ranges from 0 to above 350 ton ha the lower range associated with nomgt and baseline s0 as the rainfall ci increase the erosion worsens throughout the watershed with more erosion for some subbasins subbasins 15 16 9 10 and 23 hcw is in coldwater river watershed and it is considered impaired due to siltation m d o e q mdeq 2003 the amount of sediment load was almost 5 times higher than other north mississippi watersheds mchenry et al 1977 hcw is in mississippi valley loess plains mvlp in 2002 simon et al studied sediment transport in mvlp and reported annual sediment yield topsoil loss ranges from 90 ton ha to 3650 ton ha simon et al 2001 based on these studies in the region we classified topsoil loss in hcw as follows low 10 ton ha moderate 10 to 40 ton ha severe 40 to 90 ton ha very severe 90 to 150 and extremely severe 150 ton ha t chen et al 2011 lemma et al 2019 simon et al 2001 see the si for details before adding any management operations nomgt most of the subbasins are in the low class except subbasins 6 7 16 22 where they fall in the lower side of the moderate class under s0 however increases are manifold in all the subbasins with biggest increase 3600 in subbasin 2 and the smallest change 96 in subbasin 14 putting most of the watershed in very or extremely severe class this indicates how pasture management grazing and farming can be significant in terms of soil degradation pai et al 2011 parajuli et al 2016 sheshukov et al 2016 comparing s1 s2 and s3 to the baseline s0 indicates the further increase as rainfall ci grows verma et al 2015 zan xu et al 2021 under s1 with ci of 0 66 subbasins 6 9 10 15 23 and 27 yield 150 ton ha extremely severe under s2 with ci of 0 69 subbasins 1 13 16 22 also fall into extremely severe category yielding approximately 200 ton ha under s3 with ci 0 73 subbasins 2 5 8 11 12 17 20 21 24 also are in extremely severe class yielding 200 ton ha in fig 7e when moving from left to right the emergence of severe and extremely severe classes can be seen admas et al 2022 m d o e q mdeq 2003 zan xu et al 2021 subbasins 9 10 11 15 16 and 23 are the hotspots to be considered and prioritized figure 7f illustrates the sediment concentration in the reach segment of each subbasin suspended sediment concentration ssc in hcw were measured at the monitoring point the usgs site reach 19 fig 1 from 1986 to 2003 according to the measured data mean daily ss in the period was 137 4 mg l and the mean annual was 55 563 mg l mchenry also studied the ss load in north mississippi lakes and reported that annual mean ss at arkabutla lake surface water was 73 000 mg l approximately mchenry et al 1977 our findings regarding ssc matches with the reports comparing nomgt to s0 shows substantial increase in ssc when the grazing and corn soybean farming are practiced biedenharn et al 2004 the biggest changes occur in subbasins 1 2 3 8 9 10 15 16 22 23 24 26 29 and 30 dark subbasins in fig 6f the highest ss values under s0 is from subbasins 15 23 and 16 with over than 1 million mg l these subbasins can be considered and prioritized for water quality and impaired turbidity hotspots halecki et al 2018 c lu et al 2020 q wang et al 2021a l mw yasarer et al 2017 comparing baseline scenario s0 to s1 s2 and s3 indicates that as rainfall ci increases the ss throughout hcw decreases slightly this could be the result of scenario value generation which means less precipitation on normal rainy days not top four rainy days this could also indicate that as ci increases the raindrops can wash away bigger soil particles that can be easily settled in the reach s dutta 2016 neitsch et al 2011 wischmeier and smith 1965 1978 subbasins 4 5 6 13 21 and 27 are the lowest under s1 s2 and s3 with mean daily of 63 mg l comparing sediment yield and ss distribution shows that the hotspots are the same subbasins 9 10 11 15 16 and 23 table 5 shows the annual soil loss w r t change in ci this result indicates that up to 9 5 increase in ci could increase soil loss up to 72 3 in subbasin 11 figure 8 demonstrates changes over the year period for the variables flow discharge q syld ssc et and swc under the scenarios since the runoff generation and consequently soil erosion depends on soil conditions the time when the ers occur can play a role q wang et al 2021a fig 8a shows that the top four rainy day in baseline scenario which happen in spring and summer two in march june and august and values for all four days increases as ci grows s0 to s3 for the rest of the days normal days however the opposite occurs where s3 has least daily discharge throughout the year this can imply that the cumulative effect of normal day rain on ss can be higher than the effect of top four days on ss hence fig 8f shows decrease in ssc throughout the watershed as ci increases comparing nomgt daily discharge to s0 reveals that grazing and corn soybean farming increase runoff noticeably adimassu et al 2020 parajuli et al 2016 fig 8b illustrates the daily sediment discharge at the monitoring point daily sediment discharge shows the same pattern as flow discharge simon et al 2001 the greater amount of sediment is transported during the flood season specially from march to may therefore this time of the year should be considered and prioritized in decision making makhtoumi et al 2020 zan xu et al 2021 the transported sediment amount on the top four days is extremely high table 6 fig 8c illustrates mean daily ssc for the normal days ssc follows the same pattern as syld and q on the four topmost rainy days it shows irregularities for example on march 31 s2 generate highest ssc rather than s3 or on august 28 s0 generates the highest ssc this could be due to soil preconditions and or heterogeneity of the rain ho hagemann et al 2015 wasko and nathan 2019 zan xu et al 2021 also timing the management practices can play a role park et al 2017 fig 8d and e demonstrate et and swc through the year swc shows more variability from march to late august comparing nomgt to s0 shows that under s0 soil has more ability of holding more water park et al 2017 pulley and collins 2020 however under s1 s2 and s3 it holds less water throughout the year et under nomgt shows higher values during spring summer and fall makhtoumi et al 2020 however under other scenarios the watershed et doesn t show noticeable variability

march generate slightly more flow and sediment under nomgt ers in summer generate less flow and sediment this could be due to the timing and type of the operation as well as vegetation cover table 2 pulley and collins 2020 wang et al 2021 studied the effect of ers in different seasons and reported the same findings l wang et al 2021b under s1 the highest increase in pcp was on august 20th by 51 2 this induced 78 1 16 3 34 7 changes in q syld and ssc respectively the decrease in ssc could imply the importance of the management operations under s1 the highest syld and ssc increase occurred on march 28th by 93 8 and 21 4 respectively under s2 the highest increase in pcp was on august 20th by 96 followed by rainfall on march 28th with increase of 83 4 the increase on august 20th induced 148

in q syld and ssc respectively on june 9th under s3 78 3 increase in pcp results in 94 8 152 7 and 29 8 increase in q syld and ssc respectively table 6 which represents percent changes for the variables reveals different trends for each ers emphasizing the necessity of studying each storm individually for example ssc increases under all scenarios on march 28th but it declines on march 31st this indicates the significance of underlying conditions in the watershed such as swc and management operations timing and type as well as heterogeneity of individual rainfall park et al 2017 peleg et al 2021 pulley and collins 2020 l wang et al 2021b zhu et al 2018 3 2 1 spatial analysis of the individual ers studies have shown that rainfalls spatial variability could explain 20 30 of the runoff generation variability in urban watersheds and even higher in rural watersheds peleg et al 2017 peleg et al 2021 zhu et al 2018 here we inspect spatial distribution of the top four rainfall events

28th followed by august 20th and march 31st er has the last rank according to the fig 9b the rainfall amount ranges from 36 to 168 mm among these four days all the subbasins on june 9th received above 141 mm with the highest in subbasin 23 with 168 mm and only subbasins 30 24 and 26 received lower amount 118 128 and 128 mm respectively on march 28th received rainfall ranges from 67 to 94 mm on august 20th received rainfall ranges from 25 to 86 mm on march 31st received rainfall amount ranges from 39 to 58 mm er on august 20th shows the highest spatial variability this variability could partially explain why despite increase in total rainfall the ssc declined table 6 subbasins 8 and 10 experienced most rain followed by subbasin 4 and 29 the second highest variability occurs on march 28th where according to the fig 9b more rain received on the east of the watershed subbasin 30 with 68 mm has the least amount of rain however subbasins 11 15 16 20 21 22 and 23 received 90 mm march 31st has the lowest amount and variability compared to others the rainband covered east side mostly where subbasins 15 16 20 21 22 and 23 are located this rainfall structure spatial and temporal variability presented here could company with watershed propensities and produce a complex hydrologic and sediment processes l chen et al 2016 sun et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 in the following two figures we examine the syld and ssc response in hcw figure 9 demonstrates distribution of topsoil loss syld under the scenarios topsoil loss ranges from 1 ton ha nomgt march 28 to 130 ton ha s3 june 9 in subbasin 15 comparing nomgt to s0 reveals that in all four er events syld almost doubled due to pasture management and agricultural practices parajuli et al 2016 park et al 2017 this increase is larger in summer ers june 9 and august 20 comparing s0 to s1 s2 and s3 indicates that as ci increases vulnerable subbasins emerge however the emergence depends on the severity and spatial variability

a result most of the subbasins on the west side including 8 9 10 and 29 generated the highest syld on that day this implies the significance of spatial variability of individual ers peleg et al 2021 l wang et al 2021b our result in fig 10 emphasizes the direct relationship between severity of an er and the emergence of the subbasins with severe soil loss zan xu et al 2021 if the same classification for annual syld used here for the individual ers under nomgt almost all the subbasin are in the low class however under s0 almost all fall into the moderate class generating between 10 and 40 ton ha which emphasizes the significance of anthropogenic activities in regulating under the related processes cerdan et al 2010 halecki et al 2018 parajuli et al 2016 under s1 s2 and s3 fall into the high severe and extreme severe classes depending on the amount of rain received on that day which runoff generation mechanism is sensitive to these changes wei et al 2007 the topsoil loss hotspots can be listed as follows subbasins 15 16 23 9 10 11 sediment is the major pollutant in streams and reservoirs and in us reservoirs water storage capacity declines 0 2 each year due sedimentation s dutta 2016 mchenry et al 1977 fig 11 illustrates the suspended sediment concentration ssc in the reach segment of each subbasin spatial distribution of ssc is expected to show the same pattern as syld fig 10 it also reveals some valuable insights as well comparing nomgt to s0 indicates that ssc increases significantly when adding pasture management and farming activities the percent change under s0 is higher than that of s1 s2 and s3 subbasins 15 16 and 9 have remarkably high values of 63 600 61 450 and 62 770 mg l respectively different ers impact different subbasins due to differences in spatial variability subbasins 4 5 6 13 and 27 reflect less amount of ssc this could be due to the fact that suspended particles are more likely to settle in bigger reaches baronas et al 2020 biedenharn et al 2004 biedenharn et al 2004 carried out an erosion control project and reported significant amount of sediment settlement in hcw biedenharn et al 2004 under the ers as ci increases from s1 to s3 ssc increase throughout the watershed affecting some subbasins more than others subbasins on the west subbasins 9 10 24 and 26 and subbasins on the east subbasins 15 16 23 and 11 generate the highest ssc overall subbasins that can be considered ssc hotspots are 15 16 23 9 10 11 3 2 2 annual vs event scale soil loss we converted the amount of soil eroded from land to soil layer thickness lost across the watershed and compared the thickness lost over the year to the thickness lost during june 9th extreme rainfall event fig 12 it is important to note that on annual scale soil loss distribution corresponds to soil antecedent conditions while event scale distribution corresponds to rainfall spatial distribution and it is possible future topic to study 4 conclusion soil loss is a widespread environmental concern that has on site and off site costs causing numerous adverse impacts on natural and human systems on site costs can include depleting the fertile topsoil nutrients causing long lasting impact in crop productivity and accelerating global and regional food insecurity human activities and inclement weather can worsen the issue in this study we modeled soil loss and evaluated the watershed response with and without management operations and under three extreme rainfalls scenarios using weather radar data our results indicate that pasture management by itself can exacerbate soil loss and if accompanied with extreme rainfalls soil loss accelerates remarkably we found that ers can be more significant on event scale however over a year soil moisture and type of the management practices grazing and farming could contribute more to soil loss we classified the subbasins into different classes of soil loss severity and then determined the hotspots for soil loss which are subbasins 15 16 23 9 10 11 slight increase in rainfall concentration s1 can put vulnerable subbasins in extremely severe class 150 ton ha yr under moderate increase in the rainfall concentration s2 more subbasins fall into extremely severe category yielding approximately 200 ton ha yr under high increase in rainfall concentration s3 almost all the subbasins fall into the extremely severe class yielding 200 ton ha yr soil loss can go as high as 350 ton ha yr under extreme rainfalls grazing and farming can increase erosion 3600 in vulnerable subbasins we found that in erosion prone subbasins up to 10 increase in ci can increase soil loss up to 75 in annual syld single er can generate up to 35 of annual soil loss under one er event hotspot subbasins can lose up to 160 ton ha day fertile soil 32 and 80 increase in rainfall amount during one er event can increase soil loss by 94 and 285 respectively our results suggest the importance of site specific managements to mitigate the soil loss and all the consequences the result of this study can help in better and cost effective soil loss management implementation declaration of competing interest the authors

1191,topsoil loss is a widespread environmental concern causing adverse impacts on natural and human systems severe weather accompanied with human activities can exacerbate this issue degrading soil health and consequently accelerating global and regional food insecurity erosion impairs soil physical and chemical properties such as infiltration rate water holding capacity loss of nutrients including soil carbon and nitrogen although temporal properties of a rainfall event have meaningful implications spatial heterogeneity of a rainfall contributes substantially and cannot be overlooked therefore in this study we investigated soil loss using weather radar nexrad data we developed extreme rainfall er scenarios and land use practices nomgt s0 s1 s2 and s3 and evaluated the watershed response we found that grazing can manifold soil loss and if accompanied with extreme rainfalls soil loss accelerates impacting different subbasins each time our results suggest that spatial heterogeneity of ers can be more significant in individual extreme rainfalls however over a year soil moisture and type of the management practices grazing and farming could contribute more to topsoil loss we classified watershed subbasins into different classes of soil loss severity to determine the soil loss hotspots soil loss can go as high as 350 ton ha yr under the ers land use practices can increase erosion by 3600 slight increase in rainfall concentration s1 can put vulnerable subbasins in extremely severe class 150 ton ha yr under moderate increase in the rainfall concentration s2 more subbasins fall into extremely severe category yielding approximately 200 ton ha yr under high increase in rainfall concentration s3 almost all the subbasins fall into the extremely severe class yielding 200 ton ha yr we found that in vulnerable subbasins up to 10 increase in concentration ratio index ci can increase annual soil loss up to 75 single er can generate up to 35 of annual soil loss under one er event soil loss hotspot subbasins can lose up to 160 ton ha day 32 and 80 increase in rainfall amount for an er event can increase soil loss by 94 and 285 respectively the results also reveal that grazing and farming can be responsible for up 50 of soil loss our findings indicate the importance of site specific managements to mitigate soil loss and all the consequences our study can help in better soil loss management implementation insights of our study may also help in water quality control and flood mitigation planning efforts keywords soil loss erosion radar extreme rainfall grazing swat data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil erosion is a common form of land degradation which can lead to decrease in crop productivity and increase in flood possibility admas et al 2022 borrelli et al 2017 pimentel and burgess 2013 it is a location dependent widespread environmental hazard caused by water runoff xie et al 2011 it exports nutrients which impairs river water quality and aquatic ecosystem habitat and it causes and helps growing the dead zone in water bodies such as gulf of mexico inamdar et al 2018 q wang et al 2021a water induced erosion comprises 56 of world soil loss which cause almost 10 million ha agricultural land each year to be out of food production chain pimentel 2006 this vulnerability could be tied in increasing precipitation intensities and make the regions more erosion prone borrelli et al 2021 erosion prone parts of a watershed can be costly for the ecosystem and the environment identifying these areas are critical to introduce effective management practices conservation practices in agriculture which often referred as best management practices bmps are techniques and guidelines to improve water quality and agricultural productivity and to mitigate soil erosion and nutrient loss briak et al 2019 panagos et al 2015 zhou et al 2016 bmps implementation however can be expensive many studies have been focused on bmps to mitigate soil erosion however site specific bmps are imperative for effective soil conservation admas et al 2022 determining the proper location for bmps can also be challenging additionally the unequivocal consequences of the warming climate can expose lands to extreme rainfalls ers at regional and global scales more frequent ers generate high peak discharges quickly and create floods that can wash away soil active layer especially in growing season another associated risk is sediment deposition it affects the storage and hydropower generation capacity of the reservoirs s dutta 2016 ers one main associated risk is topsoil loss scientific community now have robust confidence on increasing trends on ers and more prominent intensification fischer et al 2013 fischer and knutti 2014 pendergrass and hartmann 2014 pfahl et al 2017 which is supported by robust agreement among them in theory model results and observational data fischer and knutti 2016 guerreiro et al 2018 hoerling et al 2016 markonis et al 2019 moustakis et al 2021 papalexiou and montanari 2019 many others also reported the rise in frequency of extreme rainfalls including kang et al 2009 stone et al 2005 kang et al 2009 stone et al 2005 groisman et al 2012 studied the changes in intensity of heavy precipitation in the central us and they reported significant increase in the frequency of very heavy rainfall and extreme precipitation events 40 increase groisman et al 2012 westra et al 2014 investigated short duration ers and concluded increase in magnitude and frequency of flash floods while emphasizing on local scale thermodynamic effects westra et al 2014 moustakias et al 2021 have studied er events over the us and concluded that a 20 year rainfall would became a 7 year rainfall on most part of the us moustakis et al 2021 1 increase in rainfall amount will increase the soil erosion up to 1 7 at multiple locations pruski and nearing 2002 in southeast us observed changes in very heavy precipitation has increased 27 walsh et al 2014a for each degree of world temperature increase the current most er events are likely to double myhre et al 2019 runoff has a direct relation to erosion with the increase in frequency of heavy precipitations soil health and functionality can be significantly degraded parajuli et al in 2016 and yasarer et al in 2017 studied the impact of climate change on sediment yield and concluded that the frequency of extreme rainfall events would increase in the future and that these changes would affect soil erosion and consequently crop productivity in multiple ways parajuli et al 2016 l mw yasarer et al 2017 in agricultural regions going through rapid land use change climate variability national resource conservation policies and socioeconomic developments can contribute to soil health aghsaei et al 2020 de oliveira serrão et al 2022 subhasri dutta and sen 2018 schiefer et al 2013 thus it is essential to understand sediment response to changing climate for preventing flood and drought and for soil conservation and water resource management borrelli et al 2021 zan xu et al 2021 a few important problems with soil erosion modeling are result uncertainties non linear relation within parameters and upscaling difficulties de vente and poesen 2005 although modeling obstacles accompanied with recent changes in climate impose challenges to our understanding of erosion process ongoing advances in technology e g data science can offer decent solutions for example soil erosion models have recently started using geospatial analysis tools in soil conservation and management practices panagos et al 2015b here we incorporate weather radar technology to capture spatially small scale hydrologic extremes stream and rain gauges networks are often limited in capturing spatial variability of rainfall alexander et al 2020 lengfeld et al 2020 katie price et al 2014 weather radar technology can efficiently capture ers especially short time less than a day ers and is more accurate in smaller watersheds gao et al 2020 lengfeld et al 2020 k price et al 2011 sexton et al 2010 additionally in comparison to in situ gauge hydrologic extremes are captured more than almost 1000 times by radar stations lengfeld et al 2020 even though scientists have recommended many water management approaches to mitigate climate change impacts most of them don t offer local solutions kang et al 2009 modeling soil erosion cannot be up or downscaled in 2004 vente et al studied the soil erosion scale issues and they concluded that soil erosion at one scale cannot be applied for other scales de vente and poesen 2005 there is also a lack of knowledge on spatial distribution of the models pandey et al 2021 borrelli et al 2021 carried out a global review and statistical analysis study included 3030 modeling reports from 126 countries and concluded that spatial aspect in less than half of one of the most common used models was concern borrelli et al 2021 thus it is crucial to study the soil erosion on finer scales the relationship between soil loss and ers is underrepresented and there is a lack of understanding it admas et al 2022 c lu et al 2020 parajuli et al 2016 xu et al 2021 x c zhang and nearing 2005 there is no uniform conclusion adopted by the scientific community and lack of understanding caused by lack of quantitative studies specially at the regional scale points out the gap therefore this study aims to address the understanding of interaction between soil erosion and er spatial variation our objectives are i to investigate erosion from land under land use management and ers by using weather radar data and ii to find hotspots for soil loss in this regard we couple stage iv radar data with hydrologic modeling under variety of weather and management scenarios the result of this study can be applied in agro ecosystem resiliency research and bmp implementation decision making as well as flood mitigation and water quality planning sediment process studies also offer understanding of microplastic processes in aquatic environments waldschläger et al 2022 2 materials and methods 2 1 method and data collection 2 1 1 method we incorporated geospatial hydrological modeling to achieve the objectives the required data including weather radar and land use data were obtained and utilized in soil and water assessment tool swat jeff arnold 1994 the radar data were manipulated and converted to swat suitable format the model then was calibrated for discharge and sediment after sensitivity analysis for parametrization for detailed information please refer to makhtoumi et al 2020 then the scenarios were developed considering future weather conditions and practiced human activities in the watershed the model was run under the scenarios and finally the output results were statistically and spatially analyzed following sections describes the steps fig 1 shows the framework diagram 2 1 2 spatial data swat incorporates spatial and temporal data neitsch et al 2011 three types of spatial data are soil land use and elevation data gridded gnatsgo gridded national soil survey geographic database is used that allows up 5 soil horizons to be modeled with 10 m resolution soilsurvey 2019 the land use data is nlcd2019 and is obtained from multi resolution land characteristics mrlc consortiums dewitz 2021 see supporting information si for the detail 2 1 3 hydro meteorological and sediment data precipitation temperature solar radiation wind speed and humidity are the input data which swat require at daily scale neitsch et al 2011 for the last four in situ gauge station data were obtained for precipitation however we used three types of data stage iv nexrad radar klazura and imy 1993 multi radar multi sensor mrms j zhang et al 2016 and in situ rain gauge data the stage iv qpe data from 2016 to end of 2021 obtained from nws website and used for scenario development for the purpose of extreme rainfall studies a high spatial 1 km and temporal 5 min resolution of reanalysis mrms was developed for the period of 2001 to 2011 j zhang et al 2016 which is used for calibration and validation in this study the national weather service nws operates the us nexrad next generation radar weather radar network which includes 160 high resolution s band doppler weather radars the network was installed in late 1980 s comprising of wsr 88ds weather surveillance radar 1988 doppler for detailed description see the si according to price et al 2014 rain gauge and radar data nexrad were the best options available for hydrologic modeling katie price et al 2014 tobin and bennett 2009 radar data is better in simulating daily stream flow and its frequency with more pronounced differences in smaller catchments k price et al 2011 additionally for small catchments higher rain station density results in better output especially in sediment fluxes chaplot 2005 masih et al 2011 gridded version of nexrad which seamless dataset is better than ground based weather stations also it has higher accuracy in capturing weather conditions in small watershed gao et al 2020 gao et al 2017 jayakrishnan 2001 moon et al 2004 therefore we used the stage iv qpe for the scenario development and the mrms reanalysis for watershed hydrology and sediment processes modeling the streamflow sediment discharge and sediment concentrations data were collected from the national water dashboard of the us geological survey usgs the usgs site close to the outlet of the watershed that considered as the monitoring point for all variables is usgs 07277700 see the si for more detail 2 2 study area hickahala creek watershed hcw is in northwestern mississippi approximately 50 km south of memphis tn it is one of mississippi river basin subwatersheds it encompasses 3 huc 12 080302040401 to 3 with the drainage area of 312 km2 the main river stream is called hickahala creek and is a tributary of the coldwater river upstream of arkabutla reservoir hcw is located between the 91 and 88 7 and latitudes 34 and 34 88 hcw hillsides are prone to erosion when there isn t or less natural vegetable cover this sediments are deposited in the channels or drained into arkabutla reservoir and decrease the flood carrying capacity making the region prone to flooding under ers biedenharn et al 2004 the main land use is pasture 43 and the second main is forest deciduous 23 mrlc consortium 2019 agricultura land use is third with 14 of the hcw area the main crops are soybean glycine max l merr warm season annual legume corn zea mays l warm season annual and cotton usda nass 2007 irrigated farming is not common in the area and only up 5 percent of farms are irrigated usda nass 2007 collins and flaya comprise the main soil cover they both are silty texture and prone to erosion of any type if left bare hcw s climate is the humid subtropical characterized by temperate winter and hot summer temporal heterogeneity of the rainfall makes northwestern ms subject to drought and flood destructive thunderstorms are expected for average period of two months each year annual mean temperature is 15 4 c the lowest temperature recorded is 22 2 c in january and the highest recorded is 41 1 c in august average annual rainfall ranges from 1371 mm to 1423 mm the wettest month is may and the driest is october fig 2 shows the study area including the elevation map land use map and all station locations 2 3 model simulation and performance evaluation 2 3 1 hydrology soil and water assessment tool revised version known as swat was used jeff arnold 1994 it is a process based and semi distributed for river basin scale j g arnold et al 1998 fortran language with 300 subroutines are used to model different parts of hydrological and biogeochemical processes on the surface and under the ground jg arnold et al 2011 it is efficient and can be used for short and long term impact studies with good computational effectiveness de oliveira serrão et al 2022 it allows to split the watershed into small parts of unique combination of soil land use and slope known hydrologic response unit hru and uses the properties of hrus for the operation j g arnold et al 2012 gassman et al 2007 this feature allows sediment loss and transport to be modeled at hru level which results in quite good details neitsch et al 2011 for details about equations used see makhtoumi et al 2020 edivaldo serrao et al in recent study concluded that swat is a good estimator in hydro sedimentological parameters that can be utilized for decision making applications de oliveira serrão et al 2022 prabhanjan et al 2015 zx xu et al 2009 zan xu et al 2021 the model is capable of detecting erosion prone parts of the watershed subhasri dutta and sen 2018 and uses subbasin properties as the main source of soil erosion subhasri dutta and sen 2018 in watershed delineation process when defining the hru we used 5 threshold for all three features i e land use soil and slope this set up created 2146 hrus and 30 subbasins see the si for the detailed land use soil horizons and other input data 2 3 2 sediment simulation in swat occurs in two phases land phase and routing phase neitsch et al 2011 at hru level sediment loss is calculated and along with water and other nutrients is regulated into the main channel at subbasin level makhtoumi et al 2020 water and sediment routing is determined in the second phase where in stream processes are simulated j g arnold et al 2012 swat uses the modified usle wischmeier and smith 1965 1978 which utilizes the rainfall energy factor instead of a runoff factor this enhances the sediment yield prediction because runoff is a function of antecedent moisture condition and rainfall energy it gets rid of the delivery ratio and individual storm events can be studied neitsch et al 2011 usle is widely used in modeling sediment loss and it is used in determining sediment yield responses to extreme rainfall events feng et al 2015 zan xu et al 2021 swat takes 4 main factors into account when modeling soil loss soil erodibility cover and management effect support practice factor for specific practices such as counter tillage strip cropping and terrace steepness effect and the rock percentage in the first soil layer neitsch et al 2011 the following is the equation used neitsch et al 2011 1 sed 11 8 q surf q peak area hru 0 56 k usle c usle p usle ls usle cfrg where sed is the sediment yield ton q surf is the surface runoff mm h2o

found in swat theoretical documentation neitsch et al 2011 eq 1 calculates the soil loss from land eqs 1 to 4 in the si calculate the sediment processes within the reaches and streams 2 3 3 calibration we evaluated accuracy of the model output via graphical comparison and statistical metrics j g arnold et al 2012 gassman et al 2007 to calibrate the model we used combination of manual and auto calibration d moriasi et al 2012 we carried out calibration and validation using split sample strategy d moriasi et al 2012 and latin hypercube sampling latin hypercube sampling is considered more advantageous than monte carlo the former makes sure the whole range of a given parameter is sampled while the later performs random sampling which could result in samples clustered in one part of the parameter range to parametrize we carried out a sensitivity analysis sa j g arnold et al 2012 saltelli et al 2004 and then utilized the sequential uncertainty fitting version algorithm sufi2 within swat cup swat calibration and uncertainty program k c abbaspour et al 2004 makhtoumi et al 2020 we performed global and one at a time sa several times and filtered out insensitive parameters k c abbaspour et al 2007a saltelli et al 2004 the model was calibrated first for flow and then calibrated for sediment while calibrated flow parameters were included for accuracy quantification our

temperature and mean daily temperature the total number of heat units needed to bring a crop to maturity can be calculated neitsch et al 2011 for forest or range the start of the growing season is the time when the buds start developing and the end of the growing season is the time when the plant seeds reach maturity neitsch et al 2011 we used specific dates rather than heat units to reduce the uncertainty since when using heat units we can t know if the application of fertilizer or pesticide scheduled is on a rainy day or not and if it does coincide significant amount of nutrient would be transported with surface runoff neitsch et al 2011 2 4 1 management operation in this study scenarios include management operation under different weather condition main management operations are farming soybean corn crop rotation irrigation fertilizer application and grazing the scheduling management operation were selected based on several studies cao et al 2018 her et al 2016 c lu et al

urea and ammonia c lu et al 2020 from the inventories and cao et al 2018 very insignificant amount is used for soybean cao et al 2018 therefore the fertilizer wasn t used when growing soybean 2 4 1 2 tillage if the soil is infrequently disturbed biological mixing can be significant swat models this process to a depth of 300 mm neitsch et al 2011 according to the ctic conservation technology information center conservation tillage no till is mainly practiced in the county epa 2022 according to local farmers and usda late march through mid april is good time to plant and mid august to mid september to harvest soybean corn in ms mspb 2021 usda ncrs 1999 we didn t set any value to lai init initial leaf area index instead we made sure that by end of the warmup period 2 years the leaf area index was in normal range 2 4 1 3 irrigation in terms of irrigation we tried two options auto irrigation and manual irrigation although the later allows to implement major growth stages of crop development we used auto irrigation based on soil water content irrigation is challenging to schedule and in reality there isn t a fixed time for irrigation and farmers irrigate based on soil water content allen et al 1998 y chen et al 2017 2018 kebede et al 2014 the irrigation amount for corn and soybean are 3100 and 2800 m3ha 1 respectively massey et al 2017 lindsey mw yasarer et al 2020 based

of ers under warming climate verma et al 2015 q wang et al 2021a south and southeastern us receives maximum rain during summer and most of the ers occurs in this time fig 5 the er changes in south us has rose 27 in last few decades mondal et al 2020 walsh et al 2014b this changes for mississippi river basin can increase 17 in rainfall and 32 in runoff in flash flood producing ers dougherty and rasmussen 2021 studies also indicate that the total annual precipitation for the region won t change groisman et al 2012 to account for these changes we developed the weather scenarios as follows in this study we have five scenarios one is with historical rainfall but without any management operations nomgt and one is with the scheduled management operations and historical rainfall s0 baseline and the other three are with both the management operations and intensified rainfalls s1 s2 s3 table 4 shows the scenario details three types of extreme rainfall scenarios for s1 s2 s3 were developed by changing the rainfall concentration indices while the total annual rainfall kept constant these indices were used to characterize the spatial and temporal distribution of the er events y lu et al 2019 zan xu et al 2021 we obtained the stage iv qpe data for the years 2016 to 2021 and analyzed this data to determine the base year for further scenario development to select a base year as a representative year that could account for the changes in rainfall behavior in the region we used daily rainfall concentration index ci abolverdi et al 2016 martin vide 2004 and the monthly rainfall concentration pci indices de luis et al 2001 oliver 1980 tables 3 and 4 show the results the following are the eqs 2 7 used to calculate the indices 2 pci 100 i 1 12 p i 2 i 1 12 p i 2 where p i is the monthly rainfall amount of month i pci ranges from around 8 to 100 if annual rainfall of a given year is concentrated in a single month pci becomes 100 and if the rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year then the pci equals to a value around 8 y lu et al 2019 oliver 1980 pci values that are 10 indicates a uniform distribution pci values between 10 and 15 indicates moderate seasonal concentration pci values between 15 and 20 indicate quite irregularity in the rainfall event distribution where rainfall occurs only in a few months and pci values 20 shows substantial rainfall concentration our pci result show that most of the years from 2016 to 2021 falls moderate concentration class and only year 2017 falls in slightly below 10 the daily concentration index ci eqs 3 7 is used to evaluate the contribution of individual er events to i e variation of proportion of daily rainfall compared to the cumulative precipitation of the year li et al 2011 it can be used to quantitatively assess the largest ers relative or percentage contribution brooks and carruthers 1953 to calculate ci the daily rainfall values should be classified based on class limits contribution of the classes to the annual rainfall amount is associated with the exponential curve called normalized rainfall curve jolliffe and hope 1996 the curve can be determined as eq 3 fitting the values of x i y i martin vide 2004 the equation can generate polygonal line known as concentration curve or lorenz curve and widely used in many area w chen et al 2015 coscarelli and caloiero 2012 vélez et al 2019 wheeler and shaw 1994 zubieta et al 2017 after determining the classes the number of rainy days and corresponding amount of rain for each class is calculated then the accumulated percentage of

classes with non zero frequency s is the area enclosed by the bisector of the quadrant and the curve ci is the fraction of s and ranges from 0 to 1 the larger the area the higher the ci indicating greater concentration degree and the greater ci means more rainfall occur in fewer days our result for the stage iv qpe data from 2016 to 2021 shows that the ci for hcw ranges approximately from 0 6 to 0 7 with 2017 being the highest table 3 based on table 3 and to ensure that the changes in the scenario rainfall events are within the acceptable range we accepted the year 2021 as the base year for scenario development this was because 2021 has the second to the highest ci and third in the annual rainfall amount it also has the highest amount of one day precipitation 146 57 mm in june 200 yrs return period among the six year 2016 2021 using eq 8 and 9 we created rainfall values for scenario s1 s2 s3 this method makes sure that the total annual rainfall would stay constant while four top highest rainy days become more intensified rainfall events zan xu et al 2021 we concentrated 3 6 and 9 of the cumulative precipitation of the year to top 4 daily precipitations in the base year

hydrological simulation of hcw indicated that for streamflow the most sensitive parameters were cnop runoff curve number esco soil evaporation rchrg dp aquafer recharge and sol awc soil moisture hcw is located in outcrop region where sparta sand aquifer is exposed at the surface unconfined thus the groundwater table is close to the surface and facilitates transmission loss making rchrg dp responsive mckee and hays 2002 the model indicates that the most influential land use change that controls soil loss is grazing this result was expected but the sensitivity was remarkably high the grazing parameters bio eat daily consumed biomass bio trmp daily trampled biomass and manure kg daily deposited manure are the most sensitive ones throughout sediment parametrization and modeling chiang et al 2010 park et al 2017 the second responsive process for soil loss was sediment routing process including parameters such as spcon spexp and prf aghsaei et al 2020 razad et al 2021 third sensitive process was soil loss from land surface where parameters such as usle k usle c usle p and sol rock play role see the si for parameters definition halecki et al 2018 calibration for both streamflow and sediment were challenging and the satisfactory metrics were at the lower side of the acceptable range this can be due to small size of hcw hcw drains inly 312km2 and there is no upstream inlet this makes the amount of daily discharge sometimes 1 cms indicating some degree of intermittency reynolds et al 2015 on the other hand there were days when both streamflow and sediment discharge were high figs 3 4 this implies that hcw is flash flood prone and easily eroded biedenharn et al 2004 dougherty and rasmussen 2021 streamflow and sediment yield were calculated for the base year to investigate the effect of extreme rainfall events on soil loss from land surface we divided hcw into 30 subbasins huc14 to spatially investigate the characteristics of ers and further divided each subbasin s underlying surface condition land use soil and slope into hrus since there is no major reservoir in hcw that could interfere with the transport processes of suspended sediment we were able to study the upland sediment concentration heimann et al 2011 fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of the agricultural and pasture management practices within hcw the distributions indicate land use irregularity among subbasins however subbasins located on the south of hcw indicate more management operations usda nass 2009 initial analysis shows that adding the management operation farming and grazing increases the surface runoff average upland sediment yield and in stream sediment change by 8 3 1206 and 1397 respectively soil erosion at hcw was originally high however appropriate management practices were implemented to mitigate the erosion biedenharn et al 2004 h c w i t mdeq 2009 although the measures controlled the soil loss and the deterioration at some degree recent emergent weather and climate irregularities appose another threat to the soil crop production and livestock hcw drains into lake arkabutla and therefore can endanger many economic opportunities soil loss can inflict both on site and off site costs here we mainly study the on site consequences to do so we analyzed different water and sediment variable under the scenarios we compared the variables under nomgt no management s0 with management but no change in rainfall s1 3 er concentration s2 6 er concentration and s3 9 er concentration s0 is our baseline scenario we presented the result in annual scale and extreme rainfall event scale therefore this section is divided into three sub sections as follows annual scale extreme rainfall event scale and annual vs event scale soil loss 3 1 annual scale soil loss according to the in situ gauge data mean annual flow discharge at the monitoring point is 2122 cms and the mean annual sediment discharge is 102 974 metric ton or 3 3 ton per hectare fig 7 shows the annual spatial distribution of rainfall water yield sediment yield sediment concentration in the reaches soil available water content and et for each subbasin we used stage iv radar data with 4 km resolution and it allows us to see how much rainfall occurs in each subbasin fig 7a indicates that under all scenarios annual rainfall ranges from 1560 to 1720 mm subbasins located at the north receives more rainfall subbasins 5 6 7 16 15 2 and 4 than subbasins at the south of the watershed subbasins 23 22 and 27 spatial distribution difference between s0 and s1 and between s1 s2 and s3 are interesting our weather scenario development model redistributes rainfall to subbasins 5 6 7 under s1 c 3 however as c concentration ratio increases s2 and the s3 more annual rainfall goes to subbasin 16 since subbasin 16 is heavily grazed fig 6a this subbasin can be more vulnerable to soil degradation due to high erosion ritchie et al 1978 swat mechanism to allocate rainfall to each subbasin creates uncertainties if averaging methods such as thiessen polygon is used it might help distributing rainfall amount smoother however it will create unrealistic rainfall records for some of the points this could lead to error in finding the soil erosion hotspots zeiger and hubbart 2017 on the other hand if fine gridded data such as nexrad stage iv or mrms is applied it might assign two different rainfall amounts to neighboring subbasins where they in reality received approximately the same amount of rain this is due to the swat mechanism that assign rainfall from stations whichever is the closes to the centroid of the subbasin zeiger and hubbart 2017 annual water yield wyld q surface q lateral q groundwater transmission loss distribution is different than that of rainfall neitsch et al 2011 it shows clear trend from nomgt scenario to s3 fig 7b it indicates that underlying conditions on the watershed surface has bigger contribution to wyld than precipitation makhtoumi et al 2020 comparing nomgt to s0 where the difference is only management practices in s0 indicates that grazing and farming soybean corn yields more surface runoff which could increase the risk of flood parajuli et al 2016 park et al 2017 subbasins 6 and 16 are reflects 8 5 and 11 2 increase in wyld when the management practices are added the increases rise further for most of the subbasins as the concentration c increases zan xu et al 2021 figure 7c presents the mean daily soil water content swc throughout the watershed swc ranges from 130 in subbasin 17 to around 300 mm in subbasin 3 comparing nomgt to s0 reveals that the added management slightly increases the soil s water holding capacity park et al 2017 comparing swc distribution to rainfall and wyld indicates that subbasins that received more rainfall and produced more wyld generally north part of hcw have less water holding capacity than subbasins located at the south increasing ci is associated with less swc throughout hcw this means more severe rainfall will deteriorate the infiltration rate and water holding capacity of the soil which could lead to drought or flood gavahi et al 2022 ho hagemann et al 2015 wasko and nathan 2019 wasko et al 2021 figure 7d presents evapotranspiration et distribution for the scenarios et decreases when adding the management operations s0 or severe rainfalls s1 s2 s3 vázquez et al 2020 and yang et al 2016 also reported the same results vázquez et al 2020 yang et al 2016 et ranges from 600 to 830 mm throughout the subbasins under different scenarios the lowest et values are under s3 and the highest et amounts are under nomgt scenario comparing nomgt and s0 reveals that practicing grazing 44 area and farming 14 area in the watershed decreases et the highest ets occurs in subbasins 15 22 23 and it decreases 15 12 and 14 respectively when the grazing and farming added subbasin 7 under all scenarios had high et this is due to the irrigation the model doesn t allow swc would fall below a set threshold and irrigates cultivated crop land use therefore et stays higher than many other subbasins despite scenario changes y chen et al 2018 verstraeten et al 2008 changing the land use nomgt to s0 inflicts bigger change than increasing rainfall ci makhtoumi et al 2020 figure 7e shows the annual soil loss distribution it indicates that both the management operations and ers exacerbate the topsoil loss admas et al 2022 halecki et al 2018 zan xu et al 2021 l mw yasarer et al 2017 x c zhang and nearing 2005 topsoil loss under the scenarios ranges from 0 to above 350 ton ha the lower range associated with nomgt and baseline s0 as the rainfall ci increase the erosion worsens throughout the watershed with more erosion for some subbasins subbasins 15 16 9 10 and 23 hcw is in coldwater river watershed and it is considered impaired due to siltation m d o e q mdeq 2003 the amount of sediment load was almost 5 times higher than other north mississippi watersheds mchenry et al 1977 hcw is in mississippi valley loess plains mvlp in 2002 simon et al studied sediment transport in mvlp and reported annual sediment yield topsoil loss ranges from 90 ton ha to 3650 ton ha simon et al 2001 based on these studies in the region we classified topsoil loss in hcw as follows low 10 ton ha moderate 10 to 40 ton ha severe 40 to 90 ton ha very severe 90 to 150 and extremely severe 150 ton ha t chen et al 2011 lemma et al 2019 simon et al 2001 see the si for details before adding any management operations nomgt most of the subbasins are in the low class except subbasins 6 7 16 22 where they fall in the lower side of the moderate class under s0 however increases are manifold in all the subbasins with biggest increase 3600 in subbasin 2 and the smallest change 96 in subbasin 14 putting most of the watershed in very or extremely severe class this indicates how pasture management grazing and farming can be significant in terms of soil degradation pai et al 2011 parajuli et al 2016 sheshukov et al 2016 comparing s1 s2 and s3 to the baseline s0 indicates the further increase as rainfall ci grows verma et al 2015 zan xu et al 2021 under s1 with ci of 0 66 subbasins 6 9 10 15 23 and 27 yield 150 ton ha extremely severe under s2 with ci of 0 69 subbasins 1 13 16 22 also fall into extremely severe category yielding approximately 200 ton ha under s3 with ci 0 73 subbasins 2 5 8 11 12 17 20 21 24 also are in extremely severe class yielding 200 ton ha in fig 7e when moving from left to right the emergence of severe and extremely severe classes can be seen admas et al 2022 m d o e q mdeq 2003 zan xu et al 2021 subbasins 9 10 11 15 16 and 23 are the hotspots to be considered and prioritized figure 7f illustrates the sediment concentration in the reach segment of each subbasin suspended sediment concentration ssc in hcw were measured at the monitoring point the usgs site reach 19 fig 1 from 1986 to 2003 according to the measured data mean daily ss in the period was 137 4 mg l and the mean annual was 55 563 mg l mchenry also studied the ss load in north mississippi lakes and reported that annual mean ss at arkabutla lake surface water was 73 000 mg l approximately mchenry et al 1977 our findings regarding ssc matches with the reports comparing nomgt to s0 shows substantial increase in ssc when the grazing and corn soybean farming are practiced biedenharn et al 2004 the biggest changes occur in subbasins 1 2 3 8 9 10 15 16 22 23 24 26 29 and 30 dark subbasins in fig 6f the highest ss values under s0 is from subbasins 15 23 and 16 with over than 1 million mg l these subbasins can be considered and prioritized for water quality and impaired turbidity hotspots halecki et al 2018 c lu et al 2020 q wang et al 2021a l mw yasarer et al 2017 comparing baseline scenario s0 to s1 s2 and s3 indicates that as rainfall ci increases the ss throughout hcw decreases slightly this could be the result of scenario value generation which means less precipitation on normal rainy days not top four rainy days this could also indicate that as ci increases the raindrops can wash away bigger soil particles that can be easily settled in the reach s dutta 2016 neitsch et al 2011 wischmeier and smith 1965 1978 subbasins 4 5 6 13 21 and 27 are the lowest under s1 s2 and s3 with mean daily of 63 mg l comparing sediment yield and ss distribution shows that the hotspots are the same subbasins 9 10 11 15 16 and 23 table 5 shows the annual soil loss w r t change in ci this result indicates that up to 9 5 increase in ci could increase soil loss up to 72 3 in subbasin 11 figure 8 demonstrates changes over the year period for the variables flow discharge q syld ssc et and swc under the scenarios since the runoff generation and consequently soil erosion depends on soil conditions the time when the ers occur can play a role q wang et al 2021a fig 8a shows that the top four rainy day in baseline scenario which happen in spring and summer two in march june and august and values for all four days increases as ci grows s0 to s3 for the rest of the days normal days however the opposite occurs where s3 has least daily discharge throughout the year this can imply that the cumulative effect of normal day rain on ss can be higher than the effect of top four days on ss hence fig 8f shows decrease in ssc throughout the watershed as ci increases comparing nomgt daily discharge to s0 reveals that grazing and corn soybean farming increase runoff noticeably adimassu et al 2020 parajuli et al 2016 fig 8b illustrates the daily sediment discharge at the monitoring point daily sediment discharge shows the same pattern as flow discharge simon et al 2001 the greater amount of sediment is transported during the flood season specially from march to may therefore this time of the year should be considered and prioritized in decision making makhtoumi et al 2020 zan xu et al 2021 the transported sediment amount on the top four days is extremely high table 6 fig 8c illustrates mean daily ssc for the normal days ssc follows the same pattern as syld and q on the four topmost rainy days it shows irregularities for example on march 31 s2 generate highest ssc rather than s3 or on august 28 s0 generates the highest ssc this could be due to soil preconditions and or heterogeneity of the rain ho hagemann et al 2015 wasko and nathan 2019 zan xu et al 2021 also timing the management practices can play a role park et al 2017 fig 8d and e demonstrate et and swc through the year swc shows more variability from march to late august comparing nomgt to s0 shows that under s0 soil has more ability of holding more water park et al 2017 pulley and collins 2020 however under s1 s2 and s3 it holds less water throughout the year et under nomgt shows higher values during spring summer and fall makhtoumi et al 2020 however under other scenarios the watershed et doesn t show noticeable variability

august 20 with 85 5 49 3 146 6 and 65 7 mm respectively table 6 indicates that without any management operation q syld and ssc depending on the amount of rain and the time of the year it occurs ers in march generate slightly more flow and sediment under nomgt ers in summer generate less flow and sediment this could be due to the timing and type of the operation as well as vegetation cover table 2 pulley and collins 2020 wang et al 2021 studied the effect of ers in different seasons and reported the same findings l wang et al 2021b under s1 the highest increase in pcp was on august 20th by 51 2 this induced 78 1 16 3 34 7 changes in q syld and ssc respectively the decrease in ssc could imply the importance of the management operations under s1 the highest syld and ssc increase occurred on march 28th by 93 8 and 21 4 respectively under s2 the highest increase in pcp was on august 20th by 96 followed by rainfall on march 28th with increase of 83 4 the increase on august 20th induced 148

base scenario the syld and ssc increase was 97 6 and 21 under s3 which has the highest concentration ratio c august 20th has the highest increase in pcp q and syld by 134 9 207 8 and 150 9 ssc declines by 18 5 although march 28th has the second highest change it generates highest changes syld and ssc under s3 on march 31st under s1 31 8 increase in pcp results in 47 69 8 and 15 5 increase in q syld and ssc respectively on june 9th under s3 78 3 increase in pcp results in 94 8 152 7 and 29 8 increase in q syld and ssc respectively table 6 which represents percent changes for the variables reveals different trends for each ers emphasizing the necessity of studying each storm individually for example ssc increases under all scenarios on march 28th but it declines on march 31st this indicates the significance of underlying conditions in the watershed such as swc and management operations timing and type as well as heterogeneity of individual rainfall park et al 2017 peleg et al 2021 pulley and collins 2020 l wang et al 2021b zhu et al 2018 3 2 1 spatial analysis of the individual ers studies have shown that rainfalls spatial variability could explain 20 30 of the runoff generation variability in urban watersheds and even higher in rural watersheds peleg et al 2017 peleg et al 2021 zhu et al 2018 here we inspect spatial distribution of the top four rainfall events under the scenarios and their effect on the sediment generation fig 9a shows the stage iv qpe radar data over mississippi for the four days june 9th has the highest rainfall amount followed by march 28th followed by august 20th and march 31st er has the last rank according to the fig 9b the rainfall amount ranges from 36 to 168 mm among these four days all the subbasins on june 9th received above 141 mm with the highest in subbasin 23 with 168 mm and only subbasins 30 24 and 26 received lower amount 118 128 and 128 mm respectively on march 28th received rainfall ranges from 67 to 94 mm on august 20th received rainfall ranges from 25 to 86 mm on march 31st received rainfall amount ranges from 39 to 58 mm er on august 20th shows the highest spatial variability this variability could partially explain why despite increase in total rainfall the ssc declined table 6 subbasins 8 and 10 experienced most rain followed by subbasin 4 and 29 the second highest variability occurs on march 28th where according to the fig 9b more rain received on the east of the watershed subbasin 30 with 68 mm has the least amount of rain however subbasins 11 15 16 20 21 22 and 23 received 90 mm march 31st has the lowest amount and variability compared to others the rainband covered east side mostly where subbasins 15 16 20 21 22 and 23 are located this rainfall structure spatial and temporal variability presented here could company with watershed propensities and produce a complex hydrologic and sediment processes l chen et al 2016 sun et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 in the following two figures we examine the syld and ssc response in hcw figure 9 demonstrates distribution of topsoil loss syld under the scenarios topsoil loss ranges from 1 ton ha nomgt march 28 to 130 ton ha s3 june 9 in subbasin 15 comparing nomgt to s0 reveals that in all four er events syld almost doubled due to pasture management and agricultural practices parajuli et al 2016 park et al 2017 this increase is larger in summer ers june 9 and august 20 comparing s0 to s1 s2 and s3 indicates that as ci increases vulnerable subbasins emerge however the emergence depends on the severity and spatial variability of the ers zan xu et al 2021 ers in march and june affected east side darker than the west side these subbasins are 15 16 23 27 6 9 11 and 10 however on august 20 the west side was affected fig 9b as a result most of the subbasins on the west side including 8 9 10 and 29 generated the highest syld on that day this implies the significance of spatial variability of individual ers peleg et al 2021 l wang et al 2021b our result in fig 10 emphasizes the direct relationship between severity of an er and the emergence of the subbasins with severe soil loss zan xu et al 2021 if the same classification for annual syld used here for the individual ers under nomgt almost all the subbasin are in the low class however under s0 almost all fall into the moderate class generating between 10 and 40 ton ha which emphasizes the significance of anthropogenic activities in regulating under the related processes cerdan et al 2010 halecki et al 2018 parajuli et al 2016 under s1 s2 and s3 fall into the high severe and extreme severe classes depending on the amount of rain received on that day which runoff generation mechanism is sensitive to these changes wei et al 2007 the topsoil loss hotspots can be listed as follows subbasins 15 16 23 9 10 11 sediment is the major pollutant in streams and reservoirs and in us reservoirs water storage capacity declines 0 2 each year due sedimentation s dutta 2016 mchenry et al 1977 fig 11 illustrates the suspended sediment concentration ssc in the reach segment of each subbasin spatial distribution of ssc is expected to show the same pattern as syld fig 10 it also reveals some valuable insights as well comparing nomgt to s0 indicates that ssc increases significantly when adding pasture management and farming activities the percent change under s0 is higher than that of s1 s2 and s3 subbasins 15 16 and 9 have remarkably high values of 63 600 61 450 and 62 770 mg l respectively different ers impact different subbasins due to differences in spatial variability subbasins 4 5 6 13 and 27 reflect less amount of ssc this could be due to the fact that suspended particles are more likely to settle in bigger reaches baronas et al 2020 biedenharn et al 2004 biedenharn et al 2004 carried out an erosion control project and reported significant amount of sediment settlement in hcw biedenharn et al 2004 under the ers as ci increases from s1 to s3 ssc increase throughout the watershed affecting some subbasins more than others subbasins on the west subbasins 9 10 24 and 26 and subbasins on the east subbasins 15 16 23 and 11 generate the highest ssc overall subbasins that can be considered ssc hotspots are 15 16 23 9 10 11 3 2 2 annual vs event scale soil loss we converted the amount of soil eroded from land to soil layer thickness lost across the watershed and compared the thickness lost over the year to the thickness lost during june 9th extreme rainfall event fig 12 it is important to note that on annual scale soil loss distribution corresponds to soil antecedent conditions while event scale distribution corresponds to rainfall spatial distribution and it is possible future topic to study 4 conclusion soil loss is a widespread environmental concern that has on site and off site costs causing numerous adverse impacts on natural and human systems on site costs can include depleting the fertile topsoil nutrients causing long lasting impact in crop productivity and accelerating global and regional food insecurity human activities and inclement weather can worsen the issue in this study we modeled soil loss and evaluated the watershed response with and without management operations and under three extreme rainfalls scenarios using weather radar data our results indicate that pasture management by itself can exacerbate soil loss and if accompanied with extreme rainfalls soil loss accelerates remarkably we found that ers can be more significant on event scale however over a year soil moisture and type of the management practices grazing and farming could contribute more to soil loss we classified the subbasins into different classes of soil loss severity and then determined the hotspots for soil loss which are subbasins 15 16 23 9 10 11 slight increase in rainfall concentration s1 can put vulnerable subbasins in extremely severe class 150 ton ha yr under moderate increase in the rainfall concentration s2 more subbasins fall into extremely severe category yielding approximately 200 ton ha yr under high increase in rainfall concentration s3 almost all the subbasins fall into the extremely severe class yielding 200 ton ha yr soil loss can go as high as 350 ton ha yr under extreme rainfalls grazing and farming can increase erosion 3600 in vulnerable subbasins we found that in erosion prone subbasins up to 10 increase in ci can increase soil loss up to 75 in annual syld single er can generate up to 35 of annual soil loss under one er event hotspot subbasins can lose up to 160 ton ha day fertile soil 32 and 80 increase in rainfall amount during one er event can increase soil loss by 94 and 285 respectively our results suggest the importance of site specific managements to mitigate the soil loss and all the consequences the result of this study can help in better and cost effective soil loss management implementation declaration of competing interest the authors

tobyl river borders with the basin of the zhaik river yaik in the south and east with the basins of the torgai and yesil rivers fig 1 table 1 tobyl is a typical flat steppe river low water within kazakhstan the yesil river esil is a left bank tributary of the yertis irtysh with a length of 2450 km and a catchment area of 177 000 km2 including an active 141 000 km2 the main tributaries are the kalkutan zhabai aqqanbūrlyq akkanburlyk and i̇manbūrlyq imanburlyk rivers the flatness of much of the territory the number of drainless depressions create favorable conditions for the retention of surface runoff water and the formation of lake reservoirs galperin 2012 data on river flow were obtained from observations on the network of the republican state enterprise kazhydromet published cadastral materials given in the following sources hydrological yearbook basic hydrological characteristics multi year data on the regime and resources of surface waters of the land surface water

code of practice sp 33 101 2003 determination of design hydrological performance and the methodological recommendations for determining estimated hydrological characteristics in cases of available insufficient or missing hydrometric observation data and for assessment of uniformity of hydrological characteristics and determination of their estimated values from irregular data code of rules 2004 rozhdestvensky et al 2007a 2007b rozhdestvensky et al 2010 organization standard 2017 since most rivers lack sufficiently long observation series to calculate flow rates within the margin of error σq 5 10 and coefficient of variation σсv 15 there is a problem of reconstruction of missing flow values i e of reducing series to a multi year period using observation data of point analogues the requirements stated in sp 33 101 2003 code of rules 2004 are taken into account when selecting river analogues the hydrological series are reduced to the multi year period by analytical methods using regression analysis the following conditions are observed 1 n 6 10 r rcv r σr acv к σ к в cv where n number of joint observation years in the given point and the point analogues n 6 at one analogue n 10 at two or more analogues r coefficient of pair or multiple correlation between flow values of the investigated river and flow values in the point analogues rcv critical value of pair or multiple correlation coefficient 0 70 k coefficient of regression equation σк root mean square error of regression coefficient acv вcv critical values of ratios of r σr and k σk respectively usually set 0 20 reducing the data of hydrological characteristics of river flow to a long term period can be carried out by graphical analytical or graph analytical methods the graphical method is most often used when selecting only one point analogue and to determine the average multi year value of the flow graphical dependences can be constructed if there are not 6 corresponding values of annual flow in the control station and station of the river analogue however the graphical method of flow reconstruction does not explicitly allow taking into account the correlation coefficient and errors of the used characteristics although it is more illustrative and relatively fast way of calculation code of rules 2004 grapho analytical method is used for bringing flow parameters by g a alekseev s method using control points of the point analogue s probability curve but not for reconstruction of annual flow values when using standard packages microsoft excel stokstat statistics for hydrology and statistica it is advisable to use analytical method of data reduction of annual river flow to a long period in this case the correlation coefficient between the flow values in the point of reduction and the point analogues is explicitly taken into account and it is also possible to estimate the errors of calculation of the flow characteristics therefore in this scientific study the analytical method is mainly used to reconstruct the annual flow the graphical method is used in some cases when restoring the values of annual flow depending on the values of flow during the vegetation period in this case for the rivers of the given territory the relationship is quite significant calculations were made in three ways according to the data of actual observations of water discharges based on series reduced to the multi year period average long term value for the conditionally natural period the modern period actual flow with significant anthropogenic influences the flow rate was estimated by different methods depending on the study of the river and the duration of observations if the duration of observation series was n 6 years and there was a reliable analogue meeting the requirements code of rules 2004 rozhdestvensky et al 2007a 2007b rozhdestvensky et al 2010 organization standard 2017 the flow rate was calculated using the reconstructed series by regression equation calculation of flow rate of poorly studied and intensively used in economic activity rivers was made by the method of ratios based on equality of modulus codes in the point with short term observations and in the point analogues the calculations were made according to the following formula 2 q q i q a q ia where q i and q iа the observed values of river flow at the point with short term observations and at the point analogue respectively q a flow rate at the calculation point and the point analogue respectively in some cases the values of annual flow were determined taking into account the relationship between the runoff of the spring period and the annual flow during spring floods up to 90 of annual flow passes on the rivers of the considered territory therefore dependence of annual flow on spring runoff is very significant r 0 90 this circumstance gives an opportunity to determine the value of annual flow depending on flow values obtained for april may or march april shahgedanova et al 2020 using the volume of spring runoff to estimate annual runoff is a valid method this is because during spring floods a large portion of the annual flow passes through the rivers in some regions there is a strong correlation between spring runoff and annual flow with an averaged correlation coefficient of up to 0 90 as a result by measuring flow values during the spring period such as april may or march april it is possible to estimate the annual flow accuracy of flow rate estimation was evaluated in three variants according to actual observation data according to data reduced to a multi year period and according to short term observation data up to 5 years in the first case random mean square errors of sample averages were determined by the following formula 3 σ q σ q n 1 r 1 r where σ q root mean square error of q r value of autocorrelation coefficient for considered area r 0 25 n number of joint observation years in the given point and the point analogues r coefficient which reflects the correlation between observations at the given point and their analogs in the second case the kritsky menkel formula was used to calculate flow rate error 4 σ q n 1 r qn 1 r qn σ q n n n n r 2 n where r qn is the autocorrelation coefficient of the series q reduced to the multi year period n r is the inter row correlation coefficient between the given series of observations and the analogue for the joint observation period n in this case a constant district value of the autocorrelation coefficient equal to 0 25 was used instead of r qn n number of joint observation years in the given point and the point analogues when annual flow series are reconstructed step by step i e when using several regression equations and for different periods the flow rate errors are determined by the kritsky menkel formula 4 taking into account the amount of information equivalent to the observed data the probability values of the annual flow of the rivers of the considered territory were determined according to the flow probability curves constructed using the calculated values of the norm and coefficients of variation of the annual flow established according to observational data long term data and for the modern period the third flow parameter coefficient of skewness was determined by the degree of correspondence of the data to the observed theoretical probability curve rozhdestvensky et al 2007a 2007b rozhdestvensky et al 2010 analysis of data from most rivers showed that the most suitable type of annual flow probability curve for the rivers in the considered area was the pearson type iii curve at cs 2cv for rivers with short observation series n 5 years due to the difficulty of estimating the coefficient of variation the probability values of flow were calculated by the method of ratios based on equality of modulus codes in the point with short term observations and in the point analogues using the following formula 5 q p q i q ap q ai where qр qар flows of the given probability in the investigated point qр and the point analogue qар qi qаi the flow of a particular year in the investigated point and the point analogue respectively historical practice of water resources assessment relies on three methods the first method finding the dependence of flow on meteorological factors primarily precipitation recently this method has been used to restore the natural flow distorted by economic activity the second method the method of water balance in particular based on the difference of precipitation and evaporation layers the greatest attention is paid to calculation of evaporation from catchment surface this method is applicable only for humid areas in particular to study the spatial characteristics of river flow for arid areas this method is of little use however in order to forecast future water resources under changing climate conditions this method has found wide application the third method flow rate mapping with subsequent calculation of water resources using geographical interpolation the cartographic direction is mainly applied for estimation of flow rate of unstudied rivers naturally when constructing a flow map first of all static observation data are used here it is important to make these field data comparable with each other i e to bring them to a single calculation period the first two methods are applicable mainly for large territories and unexplored basins moreover for areas with insufficient moisture the possibility of their use is rather limited the third method is effective only if the flow map is based on materials of a considerable hydrometric network the following methods are also used regression analysis factor analysis and the method of linear flow equations regression analysis is expressed in the following form 6 y a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 a n x n a 0 where а0 а1 a2 аn parameters x1 а1 a2 xn meteorological elements e g atmospheric precipitation air humidity deficit air temperature in this case the length of the flow series should be at least twice as long as the number of factors used factor analysis is rarely used flow factors are found through attributes and the attributes of water resources are hydrographic orographic and climatic characteristics the problem is limited to two or three factors describing up to 90 of the variance of a variable both of these methods have not found wide application the method of linear flow equations allows us to estimate water resources of the basin y km3 through the flow of its individual rivers coefficients k1 k2 kn taking into account the fact that these sections as a rule do not cover the whole catchment area are introduced into the flow rate on sites for the main rivers of the territory y1 y2 yn when determining the coefficients of linear equations it is recommended to use one of the following methods interpolation of river flow rate by its length assessment of flow rate from unaccounted area by isoline map assessment of flow rate of this territory by the method of hydrological analogy code of rules 2004 rozhdestvensky et al 2007a 2007b rozhdestvensky et al 2010 organization standard 2017 therefore the most practical way to determine water resources of the territory including river basins is to use data of static observations on gauging sites and indirect assessment of flow from unaccounted areas at the same time the results of calculations on different sites should be comparable between themselves i e represent a single calculation period this requires justification of the calculation period reconstruction of series or reduction of short series to the calculation period the total water resources of the territory are composed of the flow of specific rivers for its calculation in conditions of kazakhstan plains where the lower reaches of rivers belong to the zone of flow dispersion it deems appropriate to take a site with the highest water discharge as a calculation basis total water resources in years with different water availability probability values are obtained from the probability curve of total flow of rivers in a particular water basin in the absence of observation data in the calculation site of hydrometric observations the rate of annual flow is determined by one of the following methods method of water balance method of hydrological analogy method of averaging in a homogeneous area method of building isoline maps method of building regional flow dependences on the main physical and geographical factors the method of water balance is applied in the presence of qualitative observations on the main components of the water balance in view of absence of such data the water balance method is rarely used in hydrological practice the method of hydrological analogy is applied in case of similarity of flow of the river analogues and the investigated river geographical proximity of catchments homogeneity of flow formation conditions and in the absence of factors that significantly distort the natural flow the method of averaging in a homogeneous area is used in case of statistical homogeneity of distribution parameters in the hydrologic region flow rate in the considered site is determined as an arithmetic mean value for the river analogues that have a long series of observations in case of statistically heterogeneous values of hydrological characteristics the flow rate is determined by regional isoline maps which are constructed based on the use of all available information when constructing regional dependences for the homogeneous region under study the area or average height of catchment is taken as the main factor determining the flow rate in this scientific study the possibility of its calculation by the method of building regional dependences was considered in order to assess the flow rate of the considered region for this purpose annual flow values for all rivers and observation points of the considered region were reduced to a single calculation period 1974 2018 and flow modules were determined the catchment area m0 f f was chosen as the main physical and geographical factor 4 results and discussion the study area includes basins with uneven feeding conditions tobyl flows in the northern direction fed mainly from the eastern mugodzhar mountains yesil is fed by the kazakh hillocky area it is difficult to identify directional changes in the flow and its large background variations in this area a record on the continent variation of river flow moldakhmetov et al 2020 in particular the 30s of the last century were characterized by exceptional low water levels and the 40s on the contrary contained very high water years so the type of graphical drawings usually used to analyze the long term fluctuations depends largely on whether the original series includes these decades the analysis of long term flow fluctuations in the rivers of the considered territory was carried out using four types of constructions the direct flow course in time moving 10 year averages difference integral curves as well as moving 20 year values of mean square deviations σ these periods were the result of an empirical search that gave the best results tobyl river grishenka village the hydrological gauging station is located above the reservoirs of multi year regulation the continuous growth of annual flow fig 2a from the mid 1970s until recently is evident a huge surge in 1994 does not change the overall picture the same follows from the moving average graph fig 1b an increase since the decade 1974 1983 the values of σ decreased sharply in the 20s fig 1d when the 40s were excluded from the calculation but the values have increased somewhat in the modern period toguzak river toguzak village graphical constructions prove the continuous flow growth since 1976 though this period in principle belongs to low water phase in multi year section fig 1a b it is indicative tendency to flow growth in the midst of general low water the course σ is complex fig 1d analysis of the flow dynamics of the yesil river shows that flow fluctuations occur cyclically makhmudova et al 2021 the high water phases lasting 10 23 years are replaced by low water phases lasting from 4 years difference integral curves fig 1c are widely used to identify the phases of increased and decreased water availability of rivers the moments of change of these phases but it should be kept in mind that they illustrate the course of accumulated anomaly only relative to the sample average therefore there is every indication that a certain phase of climate and flow characterizing the current period began in the 60 70s of the twentieth century in addition the intensification of economic activity in kazakhstan also took place in this period since the 1970s a new phase in changes in water resources of vast territories began klige and lukyanova 2006 georgievsky 1996 galperin and moldakhmetov 2003 while some slowdown of the process or even grouping of years with the opposite sign of anomaly since the late 1990s do not give grounds to believe that this phase ended and was replaced by a new one these are just random groupings against the established trend the modern period in the long term course of water availability in the rivers of northern kazakhstan can be considered as the period from the mid 70s of the last century according to research annual bulletin of monitoring the state and climate change of kazakhstan 2020 the climate in northern kazakhstan has undergone significant changes since the 1970s the average temperature in the region has increased by 1 2 degrees celsius and the precipitation has become more variable with some areas experiencing increased rainfall and others experiencing more frequent droughts in terms of precipitation some parts of northern kazakhstan have seen an increase in annual rainfall while others have experienced a decrease for example in the northern part of the region annual precipitation has increased by up to 20 while in the eastern part it has decreased by up to 10 as for temperature the warming trend has been observed across the entire region in the winter months temperatures have increased by up to 4 degrees celsius while in the summer months the increase has been up to 2 degrees celsius these changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can have significant impacts on agriculture water availability and the environment in the region annual bulletin of monitoring the state and climate change of kazakhstan 2020 anthropogenic factors have a significant impact on river flow in various parts of northern kazakhstan human activities such as agricultural practices urbanization and industrialization have led to changes in the natural flow of water one of the main anthropogenic factors affecting river flow is irrigation in the lower reaches of the ishim river which is the main river in northern kazakhstan significant amounts of water are diverted for irrigation purposes this leads to a decrease in river flow particularly in the summer months when water demand is high another factor is the construction of dams and reservoirs these structures can significantly alter the natural flow of rivers and impact downstream areas for example the construction of the bukhtarma reservoir on the irtysh river has led to changes in the natural flow of the river impacting downstream areas in northern kazakhstan pollution is also a significant anthropogenic factor affecting river flow industrial activities and agricultural practices can result in the discharge of pollutants into rivers affecting water quality and altering the natural flow of water in addition the disposal of solid waste and untreated sewage can also impact river flow and water quality overall these anthropogenic factors can have significant impacts on river flow in different parts of northern kazakhstan affecting water availability and quality as well as the overall health of river ecosystems the analysis of data on all hydrological series of the considered territory reveals one common feature of the long term course the growth of flow values since the mid 1970s regardless of whether this period belongs to the low water or high water phase the moment of transition to the high water phase corresponds to the data on the long term course of global meteorological characteristics galperin 2012 makhmudova et al 2021 hence 1974 was taken as the year of the beginning of the calculation period which characterizes the current situation for the tobyl river basin it is reasonable to assess the current hydrological situation by part of the long term flow series since 1974 as well as for the lower reaches of the yesil river flow rate is estimated in two variants for the multi year period its beginning is determined by the study of the considered basin and for the modern period since 1974 comparison of flow characteristics for these periods are given in table 2 comparison of the obtained data of the average annual flow and the mean square deviation of the flow for the multi year period and the modern period on the rivers of the considered area shows the following in the basin of the tobyl river flow for the modern period decreased on the tobyl river itself up to 23 on tributaries up to 12 on the main tributaries of the yesil river the flow increases on the aqqanbūrlyq river up to 10 on the i̇manbūrlyq river up to 22 regardless of the sign of the trend for all series there is a decrease in the absolute variability of annual flow up to 30 which is not random and is a confirmation that in recent decades there were certain and directional changes in the hydrological regime of rivers there are

mean square error of correlation coefficient is within the range from 0 01 to 0 09 the annual flow rate is of great importance in flow calculations and water management design because it determines the potential water resources of the area or basin under consideration besides flow rate as a resultant element of water balance is considered as a stable hydroclimatic characteristic of the basin under given climatic conditions and level of human economic activity for direct determination of the flow rate in the tobyl river basin the available observation series for most of the points in terms

there is a decrease in the flow rate for the modern period and reaches up to 12 the ayat river up to 5 the toguzak river up to 12 only on a tributary of the obağan river there is an increase in the flow rate for the modern period up to 6 coefficients of variation of flow on the main tributaries of the tobyl river for the periods compared do not differ significantly there is some increase and some decrease in their values the results of the calculations show a decrease in the coefficients of variation of the flow of the modern period compared to the coefficients of variation over a multi year period for the tobyl river itself the root means square error in determining the flow rate is in the range from 12 0 to 21 3 the maximum value of the error in determining the flow rate is observed on the ayat river varvarinka village the root mean square error of calculation of the coefficient of variability is in the range from 12 4 to 23 9 the maximum value of the error is observed on the toguzak river toguzak village determination of the annual flow rate at hydrological gauging stations in the yesil river basin is associated with great difficulties in a stationary process the longer the series the more reliably the rate is determined in the yesil river basin with enormous temporal variability of flow to obtain its rate with an acceptable error requires observation series of longer duration than for any other regions but in conditions of non stationarity of climate and flow the very notion of norm becomes uncertain in such cases relatively short series reflecting the current situation are considered in particular the period with disturbed flow is interesting for practice because there will be no return to previous conditions when the anthropogenic factor did not affect significantly the water content of rivers therefore it is advisable to obtain different characteristics of the flow from which the user of information will choose the necessary flow rate of the yesil river basin downstream was calculated in three variants the average value for the period 1933 2018 the long term average flow for the conditionally natural period from 1933 to 1973 the actual flow for the period 1974 2018 with significant anthropogenic influences parameters of the annual river flow of the yesil river basin are shown in table 4 analysis of table 3 shows a decrease in the flow rate of the multi year period 1933 2018 relative to the flow during the modern period 1974 2018 on the yesil river up to 11 the yesil river derzhavinsk city 10 7 the yesil river kamennyi karier village 7 56 on the main tributaries of the yesil river in contrast an increase in the flow rate for the modern period and reaches up to 22 the aqqanbūrlyq river up to 11 4 babyk burlyk river up to to 12 5 i̇manbūrlyq river up to 21 5 the coefficients of variation of flow in the main tributaries of the lower reaches of the yesil river for the periods compared are not significantly different there is both some increase and some decrease in their values the results of calculations show a significant decrease in the coefficients of variation of the flow of the modern period compared with the coefficients of variation for a multi year period on the yesil river the root means square error in determining the flow rate was 10 at only three observation sites these are sites on the aqqanbūrlyq and babyk burlyk rivers for other observation points the accuracy of flow rate calculation is within 10 17 hydrological conditions in the tobyl river basin are specific conditions of surface runoff formation are very different in low water and high water years according to available observation materials the flow of high water years is 10 25 times more than in low water years the ratio between the highest and lowest annual discharges of the tobyl river grishenka village is 120 q 0 32 m3 s 1938 q 38 7 m3 s 1941 specificity of hydrological conditions is determined by irregularity of flow in time both in a multi year section and within a year coefficients of variation characterizing the variability of flow in the tobyl river basin are very high exceeding the values of 1 00 1 50 the values of coefficients of variation of the annual flow characterizing the variability of the flow according to observations for a multi year period 1931 2018 are from 0 77 to 1 43 coefficients of skewness have also large but stable values their values vary from 1 48 to 2 70 on the tobyl river and on tributaries vary from 2 10 to 2 40 the values of coefficients of variation of annual flow characterizing the variability of the flow according to observations for the modern period 1974 2018 are from 0 71 to 1 33 skewness coefficients their values vary from 1 40 to 2 80 on the tobyl river and on tributaries vary from 2 20 to 2 40 in the yesil river basin annual flow fluctuations are sharply pronounced according to the available observation materials the flow in high water years is 10 20 times greater than in low water years the values of the coefficients of variation of the annual flow which characterize the variability of the flow according to observations for a multi year period 1933 2018 are from 0 61 to 0 91 skewness coefficients have also large but stable values their values vary from 1 76 to 1 78 in the yesil river and in the tributaries change from 2 10 to 2 54 the values of coefficients of variation of annual flow which characterize the variability of the flow according to observations for the modern period 1974 2018 are from 0 61 to 1 20 skewness coefficients their values vary from 1 68 to 1 80 on the yesil river and on tributaries change from 0 80 to 1 90 curves of distribution of annual flow have big skewness flow rate probability is 40 42 and its values are approximately 1 35 times more than values of flow of 50 probability so years with 40 flow probability in conditions of the yesil river basin belong to low water years the tobyl river is the main water artery of kostanay region and together with its large tributaries uy toguzak obağan ayat and the cascade of reservoirs created on them the main source of water supply of the considered region the tobyl river is a transboundary river flows through the territory of two states and several regions of the russian federation the russian kazakh transboundary territory of the tobyl river basin is the part of the basin located in kostanay chelyabinsk and kurgan regions up to the point of kurgan city the tobyl river originates in the orenburg region then from the west a tributary zhelkuar which is comprised of two rivers sintasty and bersuat that are formed in the territory of the chelyabinsk region flows into it the next major tributaries are the ayat and uy rivers their upper reaches are in the chelyabinsk region of the russian federation and the lower reaches belong to the republic of kazakhstan the uy river flows into the tobyl river on the left with most of its catchment area located in the chelyabinsk region the obağan river flows through the territory of kostanay region and flows into the tobyl river on the right at 902 km from its estuary the main share of flow of the tobyl river basin is formed on the territory of the russian federation the volume of flow coming from the orenburg region is accounted in the point of the tobyl river dzerzhinskogo village from the territory of chelyabinsk region the volume of the flow is accounted in a site of the zhelkuar river tchaikovsky village the flow of the ayat river is accounted in a site of the ayat river varvarinka village the flow of the toguzak river comes from the chelyabinsk region and is accounted for in the point of the toguzak village surface runoff formed within the transboundary territory of the tobyl river basin million m3 is shown in table 5 the results of calculations show that depending on the water availability of some years the annual values of water resources can significantly exceed the norm or be less than it the flow resources of 25 probability of the tobyl river for the modern period 1974 2018 according to the results of the calculation exceeds the norm by 30 and the flow resources of 95 probability is 7 times less than the norm the water resources of the yesil river basin consist of the flow of the yesil river itself and silety shagalaly rivers the yesil river basin is located in the zone of insufficient moisture and has very limited water resources water resources of the considered basin are characterized by a very high variability both in a multi year section and within a year which causes very significant additional difficulties in solving water supply problems surface runoff formed within the yesil river basin million m3 is given in table 6 the results of the calculations show that the long term average surface water resources of the yesil river basin for the modern period 1974 2018 are estimated at 2081 million m3 the flow resources of 25 probability of the yesil river for the modern period according to the results of the calculation is 25 more than the norm and the flow resources of 95 probability is 5 times less than the norm the distribution of river flow rates mostly corresponds well to the distribution of annual precipitation rates over the territory which in turn depends on the altitudinal position and accessibility of a particular basin to moisture bearing air masses recommendations for calculating the flow rate of small streams of the tobyl river basin are based on the establishment of averaged ratios of flow rates from catchments of different sizes the relief of catchments plays a very significant role in the formation of flow and its influence is associated not only with the conditions of snow accumulation but to a large extent the size of melt water losses within the river basin in the tobyl river basin the change in flow modulus along the river length all other conditions being equal is related to the change in the catchment relief diagram of dependence of average multi year modulus of annual flow on the catchment area is shown in fig 5 it follows from the analysis of fig 5 that the dependence of the long term average modulus of annual flow on the catchment area in the considered territory is expressed by several graphs each of which refers to a separate hydrological area attribution of separate catchments to this or that district with the revealed dependence of average flow on the area of catchments is made on the basis of similarity of physical geographical conditions of flow the first hydrological region the basins of the rivers ayat sintasty uy and tobyl the dependence of the average multi year modulus of annual flow on the catchment area is as follows м 0 8 67 f 0 29 average deviation of points from the line of dependence is 28 the second hydrological region the basins of the shortandy koelga and toguzak rivers dependence of average multi year modulus of annual flow on the area of catchment area looks like м 0 4 59 f 0 30 the average deviation of the calculated values of the annual flow rate from the actual values is 5 the maximum deviation of points from the line of dependence is 12 the third hydrological region the basins of small rivers of steppe part of tobyl river basin dependence of the average multi year modulus of annual flow on the area of the catchment area looks like м 0 3 67 f 0 35 average deviation of points from the line of dependence is 19 analysis of flow formation conditions in the yesil river basin shows that the relative water content of small streams as a rule is higher compared with the flow of medium rivers this phenomenon is a consequence of somewhat larger snow reserves as well as smaller losses of melt water for surface retention and filtration in the catchments of small streams fig 6 shows the dependence of the long term average annual flow modulus on the catchment area in the yesil river basin the yesil river basin includes three hydrological regions the first hydrological region the basins of the yesil and zhabai rivers the dependence of the long term average modulus of annual flow on the catchment area is as follows м 0 9 59 f 0 26 average deviation of points from the line of dependence is 6 the maximum deviation 20 the second hydrological region the basins of the aqqanbūrlyq i̇manbūrlyq babyk burlyk and silety rivers dependence of average multi year modulus of annual flow on catchments area looks like м 0 3 80 f 0 20 average deviation of calculated values of annual flow rate from actual values is 6 maximum deviation of points from dependence line is 14 the third hydrological region the basins of the kalkutan arshaly and shagagaly rivers dependence of average multi year modulus of annual flow on catchment area looks like м 0 2 49 f 0 23 average deviation of points from the line of dependence is 25 the main factor contributing to the significant reduction in water flow on the main river tobol in the kostanay area since the 1970s is the construction of various hydro technical structures along the river these structures include dams reservoirs and irrigation canals which divert water away from the river and reduce the overall water flow in contrast the reduction in water flow on the tributaries and upper reaches of the tobol during the same period is not as significant which suggests that the hydro technical structures on the main river are a major contributing factor to the reduced water flow this is supported by the statistical inconsistency in water flow at the tobol kostanay hydrological station which indicates that the flow of the river has become more irregular and less predictable due to the impact of the hydro technical structures while these structures may be necessary for irrigation and other purposes they can have significant environmental impacts and should be managed carefully to minimize their negative effects on the river and its ecosystem it is also worth noting that the runoff variability decrease for some gauging stations since the 1970s may cause due not to the actual state of water resources but to the restoration of data gaps by the regression series fig 7 the issue of long term flow fluctuations is important and interesting in itself long term fluctuations are caused by certain climatic changes and identifying their character firstly allows to some extent reveal their nature and secondly makes it possible also to some extent to predict the course of the deterministic component of long term fluctuations khusanov and khaydarova 2019 korniichuk et al 2021 long term flow fluctuations are also analyzed in order to select a representative period to estimate the norm and parameters of hydrological characteristics distribution under conditions of directional climate change shaomin and guang 2021 this issue becomes particularly important since it is important not just to calculate these characteristics for a multi year period but also to give their assessment exactly for current conditions and a forecast for the near future most scientists recognize the continuing global climate warming yang et al 2021 fu et al 2004 if the climate warming trend is related to anthropogenic factor increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere gupta and sharif 2021 then further warming is inevitable in this case the climate changes unidirectionally and steadily and the early part of the long term observation series no longer reflects the current reality and its use will lead to a distortion of the probable values and distribution laws tegegne and melesse 2020 regional environmental center in central asia 2021 if the climate warming trend has a different reason it is quite likely that the phase of global temperature increase will change into its decline practical conclusion in this case to calculate the numerical indicators of hydrometeorological characteristics it is advisable to use a long series of observations hence increase of global temperature at present is obvious but increase of global temperature does not mean its growth in any part of globe in some areas opposite tendencies are possible moldakhmetov et al 2019 abuduwaili et al 2019 in this connection it is reasonable to calculate hydroclimatic characteristics at least in two variants for modern period last decades and for multi year period in kazakhstan the problem of water resources is particularly acute firstly the vast territory is poor in surface water resources per 1 km2 of area it is much less than in any central asian country secondly half of the river water comes from neighboring countries through transboundary waterways thirdly global climate warming threatens our territory with progressive desertification it becomes obvious that a clear picture of available and expected water resources is necessary to address strategic and current water management issues for planning and managing their quantity and quality as well as a starting point in international negotiations on transboundary water bodies therefore the problem of water resources assessment turns out to be very relevant not only in the socio economic and environmental aspects but also in the political aspect in the specific natural conditions of the considered territory with scarce water resources of the vast territory exceptional variability of river flow in time both perennial and intra annual the problem of water supply is particularly important all three main vectors of the country s development considered in the 2030 sustainable development concept economic social and environmental are largely related to how successfully this problem will be solved it is well known that the volume of renewable water resources of the territory is determined primarily by the river flow therefore it is extremely important to take into account the renewable surface waters and to predict their level in the nearest future 5 conclusions the main results of the study an assessment of current surface water resources in the river basins of northern kazakhstan which is necessary to address the strategic objectives of water use characteristics of the annual flow to achieve the goal of scientific research the following conclusions were obtained 1 analysis of multi year course of flow in northern kazakhstan in comparison with global and regional climatic trends led to the following conclusions in addition to global climatic changes changes in annual flow occur a new phase of hydroclimatic changes characterizing the current state of climate and flow began in the late 60s early 70s climate change is superimposed on the impact of economic activity in particular its intensification since the 60s reduction of economic activity in the 90s as a result in a significant part of lowland kazakhstan in particular in the tobyl river basin the last 40 45 years are characterized by reduced flow in comparison with the previous period the reduction of the flow rate of the modern period 1974 2018 relative to the flow during the conditionally natural period 1931 1973 on the tobyl river is up to 40 2 it is reasonable to make estimations of characteristics in several variants for the multi year period for the period characterizing modern changed conditions and for the period of conditionally undisturbed flow the year of the beginning of the estimated multi year period for different basins was chosen based on the hydrological study of the considered territory for the tobyl river basin 1931 for the yesil river basin 1933 3 reconstruction of annual flow series was made all possibilities of calculation of flow rates by incomplete observation series and relatively short term information were used flow rate is estimated by 10 hydrological gauging stations in the tobyl river basin and flow rate is estimated by 15 hydrological gauging stations in the yesil river basin 4 distribution parameters were estimated and water discharges of different water availability were calculated calculations were made separately for the multi year period and for the modern period the tobyl river basin by 10 gauging stations the yesil river basin by 15 gauging stations 5 total water resources by basins are estimated in the tobyl river basin total water resources for the multi year period is 649 million m3 for the modern period is 536 million m3 in the yesil river basin total water resources for the multi year period is 2086 million m3 for the modern period is 2081 million m3 6 regularities of territorial distribution of annual flow rate over the territory were studied on this basis recommendations for calculation of the average modulus of annual flow in unstudied sites were given for the rivers of the tobyl and yesil river basins the regional dependences of the average annual flow modulus on the catchment area for the modern period were obtained based on the obtained dependences calculations of flow in unstudied sites are possible the limitations of the study are that the physical geographical parameters of the watersheds are not specified and the beginning of possible direct anthropogenic impacts on water resources are not identified the prospect of further research may be the assessment of the statistical significance of the change in the average flow for different rivers over a long period of time it is also possible to use data on the flow in the russian part of the irtysh basin in the future for zoning credit authorship contribution statement

1192,it is well known that directional global and regional climatic changes have been taking place in recent decades in the considered area where the underground feeding of rivers is insignificant the river flow has decreased in this regard the river flow rate and total water resources of the river basins of northern kazakhstan are estimated in several ways for a multi year period for the modern

high floods in some years and the flat terrain leads to the flooding of vast areas guidance on water and adaptation to climate change 2009 a clear understanding of current water resources on average and in different years in terms of water availability as well as the extreme characteristics of the hydrological regime of rivers is necessary to address the issues of water security in the region and

patterns of annual flow development of recommendations for assessing flow characteristics of unstudied rivers 2 objects of study dry climate combined with the general predominance of flat terrain have created a peculiar hydrographic appearance of the considered territory in the tobyl river tobol basin there are 142 streams with the length of 10 km provided that more than half of them are temporary streams with the length up to 20 km there are five rivers with the length of over 100 km and only one with the length of over 500 km the length of the tobyl river is 1591 km the basin area is 395 000 km2 within the kostanay region before the influx to the obağan river ubagan only the upper stream of the river is 682 km long and part of its catchment area is 121 000 km2 in the west the basin of the tobyl river borders with the basin of the zhaik river yaik in the south and east with the basins of the torgai and yesil rivers fig 1 table 1 tobyl is a typical flat steppe river low water within kazakhstan the yesil river esil is a left bank tributary of the yertis irtysh with a length of 2450 km and a catchment area of 177 000 km2 including an active 141 000 km2 the main tributaries are the kalkutan zhabai aqqanbūrlyq akkanburlyk and i̇manbūrlyq imanburlyk rivers the flatness of much of the territory the number of drainless depressions create favorable conditions for the retention of

code of practice sp 33 101 2003 determination of design hydrological performance and the methodological recommendations for determining estimated hydrological characteristics in cases of available insufficient or missing hydrometric observation data and for assessment of uniformity of hydrological characteristics and determination of their estimated values from irregular data code of rules 2004 rozhdestvensky et al 2007a 2007b rozhdestvensky et al 2010 organization standard 2017 since most rivers lack sufficiently long observation series to calculate flow rates within the margin of error σq 5 10 and coefficient of variation σсv 15 there is a problem of reconstruction of missing flow values i e of reducing series to a multi year period using observation data of point analogues the requirements stated in sp 33 101 2003 code of rules 2004 are taken into account when selecting river analogues the hydrological series are reduced to the multi year period by analytical methods using regression analysis the following conditions are observed 1 n 6 10 r rcv r σr acv к σ к в cv where n number of joint observation years in the given point and the point analogues n 6 at one analogue n

reducing the data of hydrological characteristics of river flow to a long term period can be carried out by graphical analytical or graph analytical methods the graphical method is most often used when selecting only one point analogue and to determine the average multi year value of the flow graphical dependences can be constructed if there are not 6 corresponding values of annual flow in the control station and station of the river analogue however the graphical method of flow reconstruction does not explicitly allow taking into account the correlation coefficient and errors of the used characteristics although it is more illustrative and relatively fast way of calculation code of rules 2004 grapho analytical method is used for bringing flow parameters by g a alekseev s method using control points of the point analogue s probability curve but not for reconstruction of annual flow values when using standard packages microsoft excel stokstat statistics for hydrology and statistica it is advisable to use analytical method of data reduction of annual river flow to a long period in this case the correlation coefficient between the flow values in the point of reduction and the point analogues is explicitly taken into account and it is also possible to estimate the errors of calculation of the flow characteristics therefore in this scientific study the analytical method is mainly used to reconstruct the annual flow the graphical method is used in some cases when restoring the values of annual flow depending on the values of flow during the vegetation period in this case for the rivers of the given territory the relationship is quite significant calculations were made in three ways according to the data of actual observations of water discharges based on series reduced to the multi year period average long term value for the conditionally natural period the modern period actual flow with significant anthropogenic influences the flow rate was estimated by different methods depending on the study of the river and the duration of observations if the duration of observation series was n 6 years and there was a reliable analogue meeting the requirements code of rules 2004 rozhdestvensky et al 2007a 2007b rozhdestvensky et al 2010 organization standard 2017 the flow rate was calculated using the reconstructed series by regression equation calculation of flow rate of poorly studied and intensively used in economic activity rivers was made by the method of ratios based on equality of modulus codes in the point with short term observations and in the point analogues the calculations were made according to the following formula 2 q q i q a q ia where q i and q iа the observed values of river flow at the point with short term observations and at the point analogue respectively q a flow rate at the calculation point and the point analogue respectively in some cases the values of annual flow were determined taking into account the relationship between the runoff of the spring period and the annual flow during spring floods up to 90 of annual flow passes on the rivers of the considered territory therefore dependence of annual flow on spring runoff is very significant r 0 90 this circumstance gives an opportunity to determine the value of annual flow depending on flow values obtained for april may or march april shahgedanova et al 2020 using the volume of spring runoff to estimate annual runoff is a valid method this is because during spring floods a large portion of the annual flow passes through the rivers in some regions there is a strong correlation between spring runoff and annual flow with an averaged correlation coefficient of up to 0 90 as a result by measuring flow values during the spring period such as april may or march april it is possible to estimate the annual flow accuracy of flow rate estimation was evaluated in three variants according to actual observation data according to data reduced to a multi year period and according to short term observation data up to 5 years in the first case random mean square errors of sample averages were determined by the following formula 3 σ q σ q n 1 r 1 r where σ q root mean square error of q r value of autocorrelation coefficient for considered area r 0 25 n number of joint observation years in the given point and the point analogues r coefficient which reflects the correlation between observations at the given point and their analogs in the second case the kritsky menkel formula was used to calculate flow rate error 4 σ q n 1 r qn 1 r qn σ q n n n n r 2 n where r qn is the autocorrelation coefficient of the series q reduced to the multi year period n r is the inter row correlation coefficient between the given series of observations and the analogue for the joint observation period n in this case a constant district value of the autocorrelation coefficient equal to 0 25 was used instead of r qn n number of joint observation years in the given point and the point analogues when annual flow series are reconstructed step by step i e when using several regression equations and for different periods the flow rate errors are determined by the kritsky menkel formula 4 taking into account the amount of information equivalent to the observed data the probability values of the annual flow of the rivers of the considered territory were determined according to the flow probability curves constructed using the calculated values of the norm and coefficients of variation of the annual flow established according to observational data long term data and for the modern period the third flow parameter coefficient of skewness was determined by the degree of correspondence of the data to the observed theoretical probability curve rozhdestvensky et al 2007a 2007b rozhdestvensky et al 2010 analysis of data from most rivers showed that the most suitable type of annual flow probability curve for the rivers in the considered area was the pearson type iii curve at cs 2cv for rivers with short observation series n 5 years due to the difficulty of estimating the coefficient of variation the probability values of flow were calculated by the method of ratios based on equality of modulus codes in the point with short term observations and in the point analogues using the following formula 5 q p q i q ap q ai where qр qар flows of the given probability in the investigated point qр and the point analogue qар qi qаi the flow of a particular year in the investigated point and the point analogue respectively historical practice of water resources assessment relies on three methods the first method finding the dependence of flow on meteorological factors primarily precipitation recently this method has been used to restore the natural flow distorted by economic activity the second method the method of water balance in particular based on the difference of precipitation and evaporation layers the greatest attention is paid to calculation of evaporation from catchment surface this method is applicable only for humid areas in particular to study the spatial characteristics of river flow for arid areas this method is of little use however in order to forecast future water resources under changing climate conditions this method has found wide application the third method flow rate mapping with subsequent calculation of water resources using geographical interpolation the cartographic direction is mainly applied for estimation of flow rate of unstudied rivers naturally when constructing a flow map first of all static observation data are used here it is important to make these field data comparable with each other i e to bring them to a single calculation period the first two methods are applicable mainly for large territories and unexplored basins moreover for areas with insufficient moisture the possibility of their use is rather limited the third method is effective only if the flow map is based on materials of a considerable hydrometric network the following methods are also used regression analysis factor analysis and the method of linear flow equations regression analysis is expressed in the following form 6 y a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 a n x n a 0 where а0 а1 a2 аn parameters x1 а1 a2 xn meteorological elements e g atmospheric precipitation air humidity deficit air temperature in this case the length of the flow series should be at least twice as long as the number of factors used factor analysis is rarely used flow factors are found through attributes and the attributes of water resources are hydrographic orographic and climatic characteristics the problem is limited to two or three factors describing up to 90 of the variance of a variable both of these methods have not found wide application the method of linear flow equations allows us to estimate water resources of the basin y km3 through the flow of its individual rivers coefficients k1 k2 kn taking into account the fact that these sections as a rule do not cover the whole catchment area are introduced into the flow rate on sites for the main rivers of the territory y1 y2 yn when determining the coefficients of linear equations it is recommended to use one of the following methods interpolation of river flow rate by its length assessment of flow rate from unaccounted area by isoline map assessment of flow rate of this territory by the method of hydrological analogy code of rules 2004 rozhdestvensky et al 2007a 2007b rozhdestvensky et al 2010 organization standard 2017 therefore the most practical way to determine water resources of the territory including river basins is to use data of static observations on gauging sites and indirect assessment of flow from unaccounted areas at the same time the results of calculations on different sites should be comparable between themselves i e represent a single calculation period this requires justification of the calculation period reconstruction of series or reduction of short series to the calculation period the total water resources of the territory are composed of the flow of specific rivers for its calculation in conditions of kazakhstan plains where the lower reaches of rivers belong to the zone of flow dispersion it deems appropriate to take a site with the highest water discharge as a calculation basis total water resources in years with different water availability probability values are obtained from the probability curve of total flow of rivers in a particular water basin in the absence of observation data in the calculation site of hydrometric observations the rate of annual flow is determined by one of the following methods method of water balance method of hydrological analogy method of averaging in a homogeneous area method of building isoline maps method of building regional flow dependences on the main physical and geographical factors the method of water balance is applied in the presence of qualitative observations on the main components of the water balance in view of absence of such data the water balance method is rarely used in hydrological practice the method of hydrological analogy is applied in case of similarity of flow of the river analogues and the investigated river geographical proximity of catchments homogeneity of flow formation conditions and in the absence of factors that significantly distort the natural flow the method of averaging in a homogeneous area is used in case of statistical homogeneity of distribution parameters in the hydrologic region flow rate in the considered site is determined as an arithmetic mean value for the river analogues that have a long series of observations in case of statistically heterogeneous values of hydrological characteristics the flow rate is determined by regional isoline maps which are constructed based on the use of all available information when constructing regional dependences for the homogeneous region under study the area or average height of catchment is taken as the main factor determining the flow rate in this scientific study the possibility of its calculation by the method of building regional dependences was considered in order to assess the flow rate of the considered region for this purpose annual flow values for all rivers and observation points of the considered region were reduced to a single calculation period 1974 2018 and flow modules were determined the catchment area m0 f f was chosen as the main physical and geographical factor 4 results and discussion the study area includes basins with uneven feeding conditions tobyl flows in the northern direction fed mainly from the eastern mugodzhar mountains yesil is fed by the kazakh hillocky area it is difficult to identify directional changes in the flow and its large background variations in this area a record on the continent variation of river flow moldakhmetov et al 2020 in particular the 30s of the last century were characterized by exceptional low water levels and the 40s on the contrary contained very high water years so the type of graphical drawings usually used to analyze the long term fluctuations depends largely on whether the original series includes these decades the analysis of long term flow fluctuations in the rivers of the considered territory was carried out using four types of constructions the direct flow course in time moving 10 year averages difference integral curves as well as moving 20 year values of mean square deviations σ these periods were the result of an empirical search that gave the best results tobyl river grishenka village the hydrological gauging station is located above the reservoirs of multi year regulation the continuous growth of annual flow fig 2a from the mid 1970s until recently is evident a huge surge in 1994 does not change the overall picture the same follows from the moving average graph fig 1b an increase since the decade 1974 1983 the values of σ decreased sharply in the 20s fig 1d when the 40s were excluded from the calculation but the values have increased somewhat in the modern period toguzak river toguzak village graphical constructions prove the continuous flow growth since 1976 though this period in principle belongs to low water phase in multi year section fig 1a b it is indicative tendency to flow growth in the midst of general low water the course σ is complex fig 1d analysis of the flow dynamics of the yesil river shows that flow fluctuations occur cyclically makhmudova et al 2021 the high water phases lasting 10 23 years are replaced by low water phases lasting from 4 years difference integral curves fig 1c are widely used to identify the phases of increased and decreased water availability of rivers the moments of change of these phases but it should be kept in mind that they illustrate the course of accumulated anomaly only relative to the sample average therefore there is every indication that a certain phase of climate and flow characterizing the current period began in the 60 70s of the twentieth century in addition the intensification of economic activity in kazakhstan also took place in this period since the 1970s a new phase in changes in water resources of vast territories began klige and lukyanova 2006 georgievsky 1996 galperin and moldakhmetov 2003 while some slowdown of the process or even grouping of years with the opposite sign of anomaly since the late 1990s do not give grounds to believe that this phase ended and was replaced by a new one these are just random groupings against the established trend the modern period in the long term course of water availability in the rivers of northern kazakhstan can be considered as the period from the mid 70s of the last century according to research annual bulletin of monitoring the state and climate change of kazakhstan 2020 the climate in northern kazakhstan has undergone significant changes since the 1970s the average temperature in the region has increased by 1 2 degrees celsius and the precipitation has become more variable with some areas experiencing increased rainfall and others experiencing more frequent droughts in terms of precipitation some parts of northern kazakhstan have seen an increase in annual rainfall while others have experienced a decrease for example in the northern part of the region annual precipitation has increased by up to 20 while in the eastern part it has decreased by up to 10 as for temperature the warming trend has been observed across the entire region in the winter months temperatures have increased by up to 4 degrees celsius while in the summer months the increase has been up to 2 degrees celsius these changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can have significant impacts on agriculture water availability and the environment in the region annual bulletin of monitoring the state and climate change of kazakhstan 2020 anthropogenic factors have a significant impact on river flow in various parts of northern kazakhstan human activities such as agricultural practices urbanization and industrialization have led to changes in the natural flow of water one of the main anthropogenic factors affecting river flow is irrigation in the lower reaches of the ishim river which is the main river in northern kazakhstan significant amounts of water are diverted for irrigation purposes this leads to a decrease in river flow particularly in the summer months when water demand is high another factor is the construction of dams and reservoirs these structures can significantly alter the natural flow of rivers and impact downstream areas for example the construction of the bukhtarma reservoir on the irtysh river has led to changes in the natural flow of the river impacting downstream areas in northern kazakhstan pollution is also a significant anthropogenic factor affecting river flow industrial activities and agricultural practices can result in the discharge of pollutants into rivers affecting water quality and altering the natural flow of water in addition the disposal of solid waste and untreated sewage can also impact river flow and water quality overall these anthropogenic factors can have significant impacts on river flow in different parts of northern kazakhstan affecting water availability and quality as well as the overall health of river ecosystems the analysis of data on all hydrological series of the considered territory reveals one common feature of the long term course the growth of flow values since the mid 1970s regardless of whether this period belongs to the low water or high water phase the moment of transition to the high water phase corresponds to the data on the long term course of global meteorological characteristics galperin 2012 makhmudova et al 2021 hence 1974 was taken as the year of the beginning of the calculation period which characterizes the current situation for the tobyl river basin it is reasonable to assess the current hydrological situation by part of the long term flow series since 1974 as well as for the lower reaches of the yesil river flow rate is estimated in two variants for the multi year period its beginning is determined by the study of the considered basin and for the modern period since 1974 comparison of flow characteristics for these periods are given in table 2 comparison of the obtained data of the average annual flow and the mean square deviation of the flow for the multi year period and the modern period on the rivers of the considered area shows the following in the basin of the tobyl river flow for the modern period decreased on the tobyl river itself up to 23 on tributaries up to 12 on the main tributaries of the yesil river the flow increases on the aqqanbūrlyq river up to 10 on the i̇manbūrlyq river up to 22 regardless of the sign of the trend for all series there is a decrease in the absolute variability of annual flow up to 30 which is not random and is a confirmation that in recent decades there were certain and directional changes in the hydrological regime of rivers there are

following in the yesil river basin as well as in the tobyl river basin there aren t any rivers that have a continuous series of observations correlation coefficients r strength of relationship between annual discharges when reconstructing the relationship between the average annual values of water flow in the calculation point and the point analogue fluctuate in the range from 0 71 to 0 98 root mean square error of correlation coefficient is within the range from 0 01 to 0 09 the annual flow rate is of great importance in flow calculations and water management design because it determines the potential water resources of the area or basin under consideration besides flow rate as a resultant element of water balance is considered as a stable hydroclimatic characteristic of the basin under given climatic conditions and level of human economic activity for direct determination of the flow rate in the tobyl river basin the available observation series for most of the points in terms of large variability of the annual flow is insufficient the longest observation periods are available at hydrological gauging stations of the tobyl river grishenka village tobyl river kostanay city toguzak river toguzak village points with the longest observation series the ayat river varvarinka village sintasty river marinskoe village were used as additional point analogues after preliminary reduction of annual flow to a multi year period the series of annual flow by control stations were tested for homogeneity using student s and fisher s statistical tests to check the homogeneity of the annual flow series a graphical relationship in the form of a double integral curve was also used the heterogeneity of annual flow series at the hydrological gauging station of the tobyl river kostanay city was revealed on this basis the conclusion was made about the need for three options for estimating the rate and other parameters of flow distribution for the conditionally natural period 1931 1973 for the multi year period 1931 2018 for the period characterizing the current situation 1974 2018 parameters of annual flow of the rivers of the tobyl river basin are shown in table 3 analysis of table 2 shows a decrease in the multi year flow rate 1931 2018 relative to the flow during the modern period 1974 2018 on the tobyl river up to 23 the tobyl river grishenka village 2 the tobyl river kostanay city 23 decrease in the flow rate of the modern period 1974 2018 relative to the flow during the conditionally natural period 1931 1973 is up to 40 on the main tributaries of the tobyl river there is a decrease in the flow rate for the modern period and reaches up to 12 the ayat river up to 5 the toguzak river up to 12 only on a tributary of the obağan river there is an increase in the flow rate for the modern period up to 6 coefficients of variation of flow on the main tributaries of the tobyl river for the periods compared do not differ significantly there is some increase and some decrease in their values the results of the calculations show a decrease in the coefficients of variation of the flow of the modern period compared to the coefficients of variation over a multi year period for the tobyl river itself the root means square error in determining the flow rate is in the range from 12 0 to 21 3 the maximum value of the error in determining the flow rate is observed on the ayat river varvarinka village the root mean square error of calculation of the coefficient of variability is in the range from 12 4 to 23 9 the maximum value of the error is observed on the toguzak river toguzak village determination of the annual flow rate at hydrological gauging stations in the yesil river basin is associated with great difficulties in a stationary process the longer the series the more reliably the rate is determined in the yesil river basin with enormous temporal variability of flow to obtain its rate with an acceptable error requires observation series of longer duration than for any other regions but in conditions of non stationarity of climate and flow the very notion of norm becomes uncertain in such cases relatively short series reflecting the current situation are considered in particular the period with disturbed flow is interesting for practice because there will be no return to previous conditions when the anthropogenic factor did not affect significantly the water content of rivers therefore it is advisable to obtain different characteristics of the flow from which the user of information will choose the necessary flow rate of the yesil river basin downstream was calculated in three variants the average value for the period 1933 2018 the long term average flow for the conditionally natural period from 1933 to 1973 the actual flow for the period 1974 2018 with significant anthropogenic influences parameters of the annual river flow of the yesil river basin are shown in table 4 analysis of table 3 shows a decrease in the flow rate of the multi year period 1933 2018 relative to the flow during the modern period 1974 2018 on the yesil river up to 11 the yesil river derzhavinsk city 10 7 the yesil river kamennyi karier village 7 56 on the main tributaries of the yesil river in contrast an increase in the flow rate for the modern period and reaches up to 22 the aqqanbūrlyq river up to 11 4 babyk burlyk river up to to 12 5 i̇manbūrlyq river up to 21 5 the coefficients of variation of flow in the main tributaries of the lower reaches of the yesil river for the periods compared are not significantly different there is both some increase and some decrease in their values the results of calculations show a significant decrease in the coefficients of variation of the flow of the modern period compared with the coefficients of variation for a multi year period on the yesil river the root means square error in determining the flow rate was 10 at only three observation sites these are sites on the aqqanbūrlyq and babyk burlyk rivers for other observation points the accuracy of flow rate calculation is within 10 17 hydrological conditions in the tobyl river basin are specific conditions of surface runoff formation are very different in low water and high water years according to available observation materials the flow of high water years is 10 25 times more than in low water years the ratio between the highest and lowest annual discharges of the tobyl river grishenka village is 120 q 0 32 m3 s 1938 q 38 7 m3 s 1941 specificity of hydrological conditions is determined by irregularity of flow in time both in a multi year section and within a year coefficients of variation characterizing the variability of flow in the tobyl river basin are very high exceeding the values of 1 00 1 50 the values of coefficients of variation of the annual flow characterizing the variability of the flow according to observations for a multi year period 1931 2018 are from 0 77 to 1 43 coefficients of skewness have also large but stable values their values vary from 1 48 to 2 70 on the tobyl river and on tributaries vary from 2 10 to 2 40 the values of coefficients of variation of annual flow characterizing the variability of the flow according to observations for the modern period 1974 2018 are from 0 71 to 1 33 skewness coefficients their values vary from 1 40 to 2 80 on the tobyl river and on tributaries vary from 2 20 to 2 40 in the yesil river basin annual flow fluctuations are sharply pronounced according to the available observation materials the flow in high water years is 10 20 times greater than in low water years the values of the coefficients of variation of the annual flow which characterize the variability of the flow according to observations for a multi year period 1933 2018 are from 0 61 to 0 91 skewness coefficients have also large but stable values their values vary from 1 76 to 1 78 in the yesil river and in the tributaries change from 2 10 to 2 54 the values of coefficients of variation of annual flow which characterize the variability of the flow according to observations for the modern period 1974 2018 are from 0 61 to 1 20 skewness coefficients their values vary from 1 68 to 1 80 on the yesil river and on tributaries change from 0 80 to 1 90 curves of distribution of annual flow have big skewness flow rate probability is 40 42 and its values are approximately 1 35 times more than values of flow of 50 probability so years with 40 flow probability in conditions of the yesil river basin belong to low water years the tobyl river is the main water artery of kostanay region and together with its large tributaries uy toguzak obağan ayat and the cascade of reservoirs created on them the main source of water supply of the considered region the tobyl river is a transboundary river flows through the territory of two states and several regions of the russian federation the russian kazakh transboundary territory of the tobyl river basin is the part of the basin located in kostanay chelyabinsk and kurgan regions up to the point of kurgan city the tobyl river originates in the orenburg region then from the west a tributary zhelkuar which is comprised of two rivers sintasty and bersuat that are formed in the territory of the chelyabinsk region flows into it the next major tributaries are the ayat and uy rivers their upper reaches are in the chelyabinsk region of the russian federation and the lower reaches belong to the republic of kazakhstan the uy river flows into the tobyl river on the left with most of its catchment area located in the chelyabinsk region the obağan river flows through the territory of kostanay region and flows into the tobyl river on the right at 902 km from its estuary the main share of flow of the tobyl river basin is formed on the territory of the russian federation the volume of flow coming from the orenburg region is accounted in the point of the tobyl river dzerzhinskogo village from the territory of chelyabinsk region the volume of the flow is accounted in a site of the zhelkuar river tchaikovsky village the flow of the ayat river is accounted in a site of the ayat river varvarinka village the flow of the toguzak river comes from the chelyabinsk region and is accounted for in the point of the toguzak village surface runoff formed within the transboundary territory of the tobyl river basin million m3 is shown in table 5 the results of calculations show that depending on the water availability of some years the annual values of water resources can significantly exceed the norm or be less than it the flow resources of 25 probability of the tobyl river for the modern period 1974 2018 according to the results of the calculation exceeds the norm by 30 and the flow resources of 95 probability is 7 times less than the norm the water resources of the yesil river basin consist of the flow of the yesil river itself and silety shagalaly rivers the yesil river basin is located in the zone of insufficient moisture and has very limited water resources water resources of the considered basin are characterized by a very high variability both in a multi year section and within a year which causes very significant additional difficulties in solving water supply problems surface runoff formed within the yesil river basin million m3 is given in table 6 the results of the calculations show that the long term average surface water resources of the yesil river basin for the modern period 1974 2018 are estimated at 2081 million m3 the flow resources of 25 probability of the yesil river for the modern period according to the results of the calculation is 25 more than the norm and the flow resources of 95 probability is 5 times less than the norm the distribution of river flow rates mostly corresponds well to the distribution of annual precipitation rates over the territory which in turn depends on the altitudinal position and accessibility of a particular basin to moisture bearing air masses recommendations for calculating the flow rate of small streams of the tobyl river basin are based on the establishment of averaged ratios of flow rates from catchments of different sizes the relief of catchments plays a very significant role in the formation of flow and its influence is associated not only with the conditions of snow accumulation but to a large extent the size of melt water losses within the river basin in the tobyl river basin the change in flow modulus along the river length all other conditions being equal is related to the change in the catchment relief diagram of dependence of average multi year modulus of annual flow on the catchment area is shown in fig 5 it follows from the analysis of fig 5 that the dependence of the long term average modulus of annual flow on the catchment area in the considered territory is expressed by several graphs each of which refers to a separate hydrological area attribution of separate catchments to this or that district with the revealed dependence of average flow on the area of catchments is made on the basis of similarity of physical geographical conditions of flow the first hydrological region the basins of the rivers ayat sintasty uy and tobyl the dependence of the average multi year modulus of annual flow on the catchment area is as follows м 0 8 67 f 0 29

content of small streams as a rule is higher compared with the flow of medium rivers this phenomenon is a consequence of somewhat larger snow reserves as well as smaller losses of melt water for surface retention and filtration in the catchments of small streams fig 6 shows the dependence of the long term average annual flow modulus on the catchment area in the yesil river basin the yesil river basin includes three hydrological regions the first hydrological region the basins of the yesil and zhabai rivers the dependence of the long term average modulus of annual flow on the catchment

annual flow on catchment area looks like м 0 2 49 f 0 23 average deviation of points from the line of dependence is 25 the main factor contributing to the significant reduction in water flow on the main river tobol in the kostanay area since the 1970s is the construction of various hydro technical structures along the river these structures include dams reservoirs and irrigation canals which divert water away from the river and reduce the overall water flow in contrast the reduction in water flow on the tributaries and upper reaches of the tobol during the same period is not as significant which suggests that the hydro technical structures on the main river are a major contributing factor to the reduced water flow this is supported by the statistical inconsistency in water flow at the tobol kostanay hydrological station which indicates that the flow of the river has become more irregular and less predictable due to the impact of the hydro technical structures while these structures may be necessary for irrigation and other purposes they can have significant environmental impacts and should be managed carefully to minimize their negative effects on the river and its ecosystem it is also worth noting that the runoff variability decrease for some gauging stations since the 1970s may cause due not to the actual state of water resources but to the restoration of data gaps by the regression series fig 7 the issue of long term flow fluctuations is important and interesting in itself long term fluctuations are caused by certain climatic changes and identifying their character firstly allows to some extent reveal their nature and secondly makes it possible also to some extent to predict the course of the deterministic component of long term fluctuations khusanov and khaydarova 2019 korniichuk et al 2021 long term flow fluctuations are also analyzed in order to select a representative period to estimate the norm and parameters of hydrological characteristics distribution under conditions of directional climate change shaomin and guang 2021 this issue becomes particularly important since it is important not just to calculate these characteristics for a multi year period but also to give their assessment exactly for current conditions and a forecast for the near future most scientists recognize the continuing global climate warming yang et al 2021 fu et al 2004 if the climate warming trend is related to anthropogenic factor increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere gupta and sharif 2021 then further warming is inevitable in this case the climate changes unidirectionally and steadily and the early part of the long term observation series no longer reflects the current reality and its use will lead to a distortion of the probable values and distribution laws tegegne and melesse 2020 regional environmental center in central asia 2021 if the climate warming trend has a different reason it is quite likely that the phase of global temperature increase will change into its decline practical conclusion in this case to calculate the numerical indicators of hydrometeorological characteristics it is advisable to use a long series of observations hence increase of global temperature at present is obvious but increase of global temperature does not mean its growth in any part of globe in some areas opposite tendencies are possible moldakhmetov et al 2019 abuduwaili et al 2019 in this connection it is reasonable to calculate hydroclimatic characteristics at least in two variants for modern period last decades and for multi year period in kazakhstan the problem of water resources is particularly acute firstly the vast territory is poor in surface water resources per 1 km2 of area it is much less than in any central asian country secondly half of the river water comes from neighboring countries through transboundary waterways thirdly global climate warming threatens our territory with progressive desertification it becomes obvious that a clear picture of available and expected water resources is necessary to address strategic and current water management issues for planning and managing their quantity and quality as well as a starting point in international negotiations on transboundary water bodies therefore the problem of water resources assessment turns out to be very relevant not only in the socio economic and environmental aspects but also in the political aspect in the specific natural conditions of the considered territory with scarce water resources of the vast territory exceptional variability of river flow in time both perennial and intra annual the problem of water supply is particularly important all three main vectors of the country s development considered in the 2030 sustainable development concept economic social and environmental are largely related to how successfully this problem will be solved it is well known that the volume of renewable water resources of the territory is determined primarily by the river flow therefore it is extremely important to take into account the renewable surface waters and to predict their level in the nearest future 5 conclusions the main results of the study an assessment of current surface water resources in the river basins of northern kazakhstan which is necessary to address the strategic objectives of water use characteristics of the annual flow to achieve the goal of scientific research the following conclusions were obtained 1 analysis of multi year course of flow in northern kazakhstan in comparison with global and regional climatic trends led to the following conclusions in addition to global climatic changes changes in annual flow occur a new phase of hydroclimatic changes characterizing the current state of climate and flow began in the late 60s early 70s climate change is superimposed on the impact of economic activity in particular its intensification since the 60s reduction of economic activity in the 90s as a result in a significant part of lowland kazakhstan in particular in the tobyl river basin the last 40 45 years are characterized by reduced flow in comparison with the previous period the reduction of the flow rate of the modern period 1974 2018 relative to the flow during the conditionally natural period 1931 1973 on the tobyl river is up to 40 2 it is reasonable to make estimations of characteristics in several variants for the multi year period for the period characterizing modern changed conditions and for the period of conditionally undisturbed flow the year of the beginning of the estimated multi year period for different basins was chosen based on the hydrological study of the considered territory for the tobyl river basin 1931 for the yesil river basin 1933 3 reconstruction of annual flow series was made all possibilities of calculation of flow rates by incomplete observation series and relatively short term information were used flow rate is estimated by 10 hydrological gauging stations in the tobyl river basin and flow rate is estimated by 15 hydrological gauging stations in the yesil river basin 4 distribution parameters were estimated and water discharges of different water availability were calculated calculations were made separately for the multi year period and for the modern period the tobyl river basin by 10 gauging stations the yesil river basin by 15 gauging stations 5 total water resources by basins are estimated in the tobyl river basin total water resources for the multi year period is 649 million m3 for the modern period is 536 million m3 in the yesil river basin total water resources for the multi year period is 2086 million m3 for the modern period is 2081 million m3 6 regularities of territorial distribution of annual flow rate over the territory were studied on this basis recommendations for calculation of the average modulus of annual flow in unstudied sites were given for the rivers of the tobyl and yesil river basins the regional dependences of the average annual flow modulus on the catchment area for the modern period were obtained based on the obtained dependences calculations of flow in unstudied sites are possible the limitations of the study are that the physical geographical parameters of the watersheds are not specified and the beginning of possible direct anthropogenic impacts on water resources are not identified the prospect of further research may be the assessment of the statistical significance of the change in the average flow for different rivers over a long period of time it is also possible to use data on the flow in the russian part of the irtysh basin in the future for zoning credit authorship contribution statement

1193,the relationship between rainfall characteristics and pollutant discharge has rarely been investigated in industrial sectors to address this need we investigated the pollutant concentrations of surface runoff and the correlation between pollutant discharge and rainfall characteristics using the self reported stormwater quality data collected under the tennessee multi sector permit program for two industrial facilities in west tennessee the variation of certain stormwater quality parameters over this period was utilized as an indicator to evaluate the effectiveness of control measures implemented at these two facilities furthermore the water quality index wqi as an indicator to assess the temporal changes in stormwater quality at industrial facilities was determined using the weighted sum wsm and canadian council of ministers of the environment ccme methods the principal component analysis pca and pearson correlation coefficient were utilized to understand the correlation between runoff quality parameters rainfall characteristics and the sources of pollutants the results demonstrated lower wqi indices using the wsm method compared to the ccme method the data analysis revealed that 93 1 100 86 2 and 48 3 of al mg cu and fe experienced a concentration greater than the benchmark level respectively there was a significant relationship between total suspended solids tss and al chemical oxygen demand cod fe oil and grease o g and zn concentrations as a result tss could be a priority pollutant for designing various best management practices bmps and low impact developments lids the result of the pca and pearson correlation coefficient showed that al concentration made a significant correlation with the rainfall depth and rainfall duration this analysis also illustrated that biochemical oxygen demand bod5 cod and o g concentrations were highly correlated with antecedent dry days adds however ph was more related to rainfall depth and rainfall intensity this study informs both regulatory agencies and industry stakeholders regarding the importance of evaluating self reported stormwater quality data keywords rainfall characteristics industrial sector total suspended solids runoff pollutant loading characteristics urban runoff data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction a significant portion of stormwater pollutants is originating from the urban environment lee et al 2020 selbig and bannerman 2011 zivkovich and mays 2018 herath and salehi 2022 urban runoff has been known as a major source of non point pollutants which can deteriorate the quality of stormwater runoff and pose a substantial threat to surrounding water bodies and human health kayhanian et al 2012 chai et al 2012 yang et al 2021 a fundamental understanding of stormwater quality in industrial sectors can be a prerequisite for finding a correlation between rainfall properties and runoff quality characteristics according to previous studies urban runoff produced from industrial sectors is more polluted than that from other land uses duke et al 1998 line et al 1997 lee et al 2005 fengman et al 2012 chow et al 2013 showed that the commercial sector produces higher concentrations of bod cod tss nh3 n total phosphorous tp from industrial and residential sectors they also presented that the highest concentration for o g no3 n and zn occurred from the industrial sector studying the stormwater quality in 10 industrial sites by line et al 1997 revealed the zn and cu as the most common trace metals in the first flush jeong et al 2020 reported a lower metal pollutant loading in the particles 125 μm collected from urban areas than those collected from intensive industrial areas the quantity and quality of industrial runoff are dependent on the climate geology topography land use and degree of imperviousness stormwater management manual for western australia 2004 as a result it is vital to assess how various rainfall characteristics influence the runoff quality in the receiving waters several investigations have been performed to assess the impacts of rainfall characteristics and climate change on urban runoff quality for instance some studies introduced rainfall characteristics are as the most important factors in the production of runoff containments li et al 2007 gorgoglione et al 2019 li and barrett 2008 table si 1 present stormwater runoff quality in various land uses other studies stated that climate change could increase nutrient and sediment loadings in urban runoff alamdari et al 2017 alamdari et al 2019 alamdari et al 2022 alamdari and hogue 2021 giuffria et al 2017 alamdari et al 2018 zakizadeh et al 2022 alamdari et al 2018 the most important rainfall characteristics are antecedent dry period rainfall intensity and rainfall depth the antecedent dry period is defined as the dry duration between two sequential rainfall events pollutants are accumulated on impermeable surfaces during this period this build up is the result of various processes such as wind erosion atmospheric deposition the particles which are produced from vehicle wear and weathering of surface materials charters et al 2021 the role of the dry period on runoff quality was assessed by various studies hornig et al 2022 expressed that the antecedent dry period could have an impact on the buildup of containments on the surface yuan et al 2017 reported that the increase of antecedent dry days was associated with an increase in certain particle concentrations 30 and smaller of surface runoff xue 2009 observed a strong direct correlation between runoff quality variables tn tp zn pb cu tss and cod and previous dry days jani et al 2020 illustrated that no2 n no3 n and nh4 n concentrations had a positive correlation with the antecedent dry period chow et al 2013 showed that there was a positive correlation between that the antecedent dry days and flow weighted mean concentrations fwmcs of most containments present in the industrial runoff other important rainfall characteristics are rainfall depth and rainfall intensity total rainfall depth is defined as the amount of rainfall is fallen during a given amount of time the intensity of rainfall is defined as the ratio of the total rainfall depth of a rainfall event to the rainfall duration of the same event raindrops produce kinetic energy which can transfer containments from impervious surfaces to water bodies during rainfall events charters et al 2021 the effect of rainfall intensity on runoff quality was also investigated in several studies for instance qiu et al 2021 reported that the intensity of rainfall could influence the accumulation of sediments nutrients and other pollutants in another study fengman et al 2012 illustrated that there was a strong direct correlation between rainfall intensity and the concentration of cod from the literature review and some of the aforementioned studies it is clear that rainfall intensity and antecedent dry period can have a significant impact on the industrial runoff quality however due to the random nature and uncertainly of precipitation tiefenthaler et al 2002 it is necessary to perform comprehensive analysis about the correlation between rainfall properties and runoff water quality parameters in various areas such as industrial residential and commercial sectors this study assesses this correlation in industrial sectors understanding the pollutant release by industrial facilities to the storm runoff is more complicated due to the variable nature of industrial activities and in many cases limited access of environmental scientists to the industrial sites the clean water act prohibits pollutant discharge by any point sources into the water of the united states unless the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit exists the npdes permit includes pollutant discharge limits monitoring and reporting requirements usepa 2010 the multi sector general permit msgp allows industrial facilities to discharge their stormwater in areas where the u s environmental protection agency usepa is the npdes permitting authority usepa 2010 duke and augustenborg 2006 this permit regulates the stormwater quality within the industrial facilities which requires each facility to develop the stormwater pollution prevention plan swppp to identify the expected stormwater pollution sources control measures and develop strategies to minimize the pollutant tdec 2020 the industrial facilities could implement a combination of management strategies and structural and nonstructural practices to prevent stormwater pollution gleaton 2006 however in some cases inappropriate evaluation of industrial activities and pollution sources may result in development of the incomplete management plans duke and bauersachs 1998 following the msgp permits the industrial facilities are needed to report the stormwater quality to the state s regulatory agency on a regular basis although being self reported introduced some limitations to the data analysis but they were recognized as the best data source available to assess contaminant loadings to the receiving waters and to evaluate the effectiveness of regulation and stormwater pollution prevention plans joshi and balasubramanian 2010 the self reported stormwater quality data can demonstrate the facilities improvement in reducing the pollutants discharge and provide a self evaluation to the facility operators regarding the required modifications of stormwater management practices gleaton 2006 investigation of temporal changes in stormwater quality is mostly limited to the first flush phenomena where a greater level of contaminant is present at the beginning of storm events or rainfall joshi and balasubramanian 2010 however evaluation of long term changes in stormwater quality is an important step to understand the performance of management strategies such as best management practices bmps a clear quantification of pollutant concentrations in storm runoff is the most widely used approach to evaluate bmp s effectiveness however many industrial facilities are conducting the non structural bmps such as employees or operational procedures rather than implementing the structural bmps or pollution control devices the effectiveness of non structural bmps has been poorly evaluated compared to structural bmps limited resources poor reporting and assessment design are some of the major components preventing comprehensive evaluation of non structural bmps taylor et al 2007 understanding the relationship between physiochemical factors and rainfall characteristics is critical to manage nutrients and other pollutants export from urban landscape to downstream bodies and to better prevent eutrophication from the previous research it is clear that rainfall magnitude and antecedent dry can have a significant impact on the stormwater runoff quality in upstream watershed however there is a lack of understanding that how and at what extent rainfall characteristics affect physiochemical parameters during dry and wet weather periods especially from industrial sectors in this research the stormwater quality variations within two industrial facilities are investigated and their temporal variations are examined by calculating the water quality indices wqi i the sensitivity analysis is conducted to evaluate the suitability of wqi for assessment of stormwater quality variations ii and using the rainfall and pollutant wash off data and statistical analysis the relationship between weather conditions and pollutant concentrations in the runoff is examined iii moreover runoff pollutant loads characteristics within this industrial area were also investigated the limitation of self reported data and challenges regarding the evaluation of non structural bmps are discussed and future practices were recommended to both regulatory agencies and industry stakeholders this study will inform both regulatory agencies and industry stakeholders regarding the importance of the evaluation of self reported stormwater quality data to assess the effectiveness of regulation and stormwater pollution prevention plans 2 methodology 2 1 data sources the self reported stormwater quality data collected by two industrial facilities in tennessee with active tennessee multi sector permit tmsp during the period of 2015 2018 were analyzed the pollution prevention team collected one sample within the initial 30 min of discharge at every rainfall event the facilities a4 and a11 were selected for this study as our recent investigation demonstrated that their quarterly self reported stormwater quality parameters repeatedly exceeded the benchmark level recommended by the state regulatory agency salehi et al 2020a these facilities swppps and additional records such as notice of intent noi notice of violation nov and inspection reports were also reviewed these compliance documents were used to assess the facility operators understanding of significant sources of stormwater pollutants in the facility and the selection of bmps sector ad of tmsp requires industrial facilities to monitor for ph bod5 cod tss ammonia as nitrogen and o g concentrations although these two facilities reported the stormwater quality quarterly to the state regulatory agency sometimes due to the limited rain the stormwater quality data were not reported the list of available self reported data for the studied industrial facilities is shown in table si 2 the tn state regulatory agency benchmark levels and usepa limits are listed in table si 3 the raw data are available online for public at the tennessee department of environment and conservation website a pollution prevention team collected the runoff samples from the outfalls of these facilities during precipitation and every facility had a unique stormwater pollution prevention plan fig 1 illustrates the location of these facilities and the location of their outfalls tables si 4 and si 5 show the area of every outfall for facilities a4 and a11 which had 11 and 9 outfalls with an average protected area of 13 612 m2 and 4047 m2 per outfall respectively the drainage area of every outfall within each catchment was not available in the storm water pollution prevention plan thus it is assumed that outfalls within each catchment have an equal area it is essential to mention that a load of pollution was calculated by the amount of rainfall depth for every event and the drainage area for every outfall at the a4 and a11 facilities flow weighted mean concentrations for every event were calculated using the area of every outfall the rainfall characteristics daily rainfall rainfall intensity rainfall duration and antecedent dry period of the memphis international airport metrological station were extracted from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa website this metrological station is located 13 7 kilometers south of a4 and a11 facilities the a4 and the a11 facilities experienced 13 and 19 rainfall events respectively during five years period 2014 2018 the annual precipitation was 1371 mm 2014 1337 6 mm 2015 1564 4 mm 2016 1305 mm 2017 and 1629 4 mm 2018 the average annual rainfall was 1441 mm in the study area 2 2 statistical analysis the statistical analysis was performed using ibm spss software v 26 the normality of stormwater quality data was assessed using the kolmogorov smirnov test however for the non parametric stormwater quality data the non parametric test of mood s median was implemented to evaluate the significant changes of stormwater quality data lien et al 2018 ullah et al 2020 in case of a significant difference between the median of tested variables in mood s median test więcław and kurnicki 2016 the non parametric kruskal wallis test with multiple comparisons was applied the pearson correlation analysis was conducted for wqis a type i error of 0 05 was selected as the significance level for all tests statistical package for social science spss was selected for finding the relationship between surface runoff quality data and rainfall characteristics the water quality data collected from 2014 to 2018 were used for this analysis for this purpose we calculated the area weighted mean concentration and pollutant load average it is assumed that all the catchments get the same amount of rainfall and area weighted average concentrations were calculated using outfalls areas eq 1 where awmc is the area weighted mean concentration mg l ct is the concentration of pollutant mg l for every event and at is the drainage area of every outfall m3 1 awmc c t a t a t the inverse distribution function was applied for normalization in this study principal component analysis pca was selected for reducing the dimension of data in this method some normalized criteria such as determinant and kaiser meyer olkin kmo must be checked the number of determinants must be greater than zero according to kaiser criteria the levels of this index were categorized as marvelous kmo 0 9 meritorious 0 8 kmo 0 9 middling 0 7 kmo 0 8 mediocre 0 6 kmo 0 7 miserable 0 5 kmo 0 6 and unacceptable kmo 0 5 if kmo and determinant criteria are 0 5 and zero respectively pca is a suitable method for reducing the dimensions the numbers of extracted components of the pca method and the numbers of input variables are equal however the extracted components are selected as principal components if they have eigenvalues greater than one absolute loading values can be categorized regarding the pca loading absolute pca loading values of 0 75 0 5 0 75 and 0 5 can be categorized as strong moderate and weak respectively barakat et al 2016 in the pearson correlation coefficients matrix it is assumed that the coefficient of determination values of 0 5 0 3 0 5 and 0 3 can be categorized as strong moderate and weak respectively finally containment load characteristics of a4 and a11 facilities were analyzed by spss for every outfall then the pearson correlation coefficients matrix was applied for understanding the relationship between various containment loads we also assess the role of the season on the output pollutant loads 2 3 water quality index wqi to facilitate understanding the temporal and spatial variation of stormwater quality at the target facilities the wqi s were calculated using two different methods of weighted sum method wsm and canadian council of ministers of the environment water quality index ccme to calculate the wqi according to the wsm method eq 2 was utilized where the ci is assigned to the parameter i following the normalization n is the number of water quality parameters and pi is the relative weight associated with ith water quality parameter the relative weight pi is adapted from literature which varies between 1 and 4 the most effective stormwater quality parameter has a relative weight of 4 pesce and wunderlin 2000 the average wqis were calculated for stormwater samples collected across different outfalls and during different years at each facility the wsm wqi is evaluated as excellent 90 100 good lee et al 2020 lien et al 2018 lumb et al 2006 mohebbi et al 2013 park et al 2015 pesce and

facility a11 were used for the sensitivity analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 investigation of the relationship between runoff pollutant concentrations and rainfall characteristics area weighted average concentrations of stormwater runoff and rainfall properties at facilities a4 and a11 are presented in table si 6 and figs 2 to 5 these concentrations were compared with the benchmark levels presented by the tennessee department of environment and conservation tdec department table si 3 the pearson correlation coefficients matrix of water quality and quantity is shown in table si 7 according to table si 6 16 rainfall events at the a11 and 13 rainfall events in the a4 were investigated for 5 years from 2014 to 2018 the arithmetic averages of rainfall depth rainfall duration rainfall intensity and antecedent dry days were 19 32 mm 7 17 days 3 17 mm h and 5 36 days for facility a11 respectively and were 11 25 mm 3 5 days 2 3 mm h and 3 49 days for facility a4 respectively fig 2 cu is known as one of the most important trace metals in the industrial runoff in this study 86 2 of samples had a cu concentration greater than the benchmark level 0 018 mg l and the average concentrations of cu in the a4 a11 and the whole watershed were 0 253 mg l 0 04 mg l and 0 16 mg l respectively concentrations of pb and zn have not been measured at study site a11 fig 3 however the arithmetic average concentration of these metal pollutant at the a4 facility were 0 07 mg l and 0 28 mg l respectively the pb and zn concentrations were below the benchmark levels in all events except for two events 2014 12 15 and 2018 04 22 for pb and one event 2015 10 10 for zn zn pb and cu are originated from various anthropogenic activities a major source of cu zn and pb in runoff is the corrosion of metal structures and building roofs other sources of these trace elements in stormwater runoff are from vehicular tires and brakes traffic volume and road deposited sediment muller et al 2020 gao et al 2022 denny et al 2022 the variation of fe and al concentrations in the facilities a4 and a11 is shown in fig 4 the mean fe concentrations were 7 51 mg l 4 25 mg l and 6 05 mg l at a4 a11 and entire watershed respectively for 48 3 of events in the a4 and a11 facilities the fe concentration exceeded the benchmark level 5 mg l one of the trace metals in the industrial runoff is al that could be a toxic to organisms in high concentrations and has negative effects on both the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems rosseland et al 1990 in this study the arithmetic average of al at the a11 a4 and the entire watershed were 4 9 mg l 3 06 mg l and 4 07 mg l respectively and 93 1 of concentrations were greater than the benchmark level 0 7 mg l the strongest relationship was found between fe and al concentrations with the pearson correlation coefficient of 0 926 the metal pollutants could be originated from the land uses of these facilities that were parking lots storage area for the equipment treated wood drums old pipes wooden poles metal spools metal scrape a paved driveway and a warehouse the average concentration of mg in all events in the a4 and a11 is greater than the benchmark level the soil of the a4 and the a11 consists of silt commonly and it can be a reason for the high abundance of mg and al in the runoff samples gransee and fuhrs 2012 hugh et al 1916 the concentrations of o g in the a4 and the a11 facilities did not exceed the benchmark level 15 mg l in most rainfall events despite these facilities being used for storage and vehicle maintenance fig 4 the value of ph varied between 4 83 and 9 05 in most events fig 4 the minimum of ph was not in the range of the tdec benchmark level barakat et al 2016 di modugno et al 2015 charters et al 2021 fengman et al 2012 giuffria et al 2017 the variation of cod and bod5 concentrations at the studied industrial facilities is shown in fig 5 in this study 27 6 and 82 75 of collected stormwater samples exceeded the benchmark levels for bod5 and cod concentrations the average bod5 and cod concentrations in a4 and a11 facilities were 27 5 mg l and 249 79 mg l respectively the biodegradability of runoff is assessed by the ratio of bod5 cod if this ratio is higher than 0 5 the runoff is biodegradable and biological treatment methods are practical in this study the average of this ratio is 0 11 with ranges from 0 06 to 0 17 as a result it can be concluded that the runoff of these industrial sectors has a poor biodegradability and designers cannot advise the biological treatment methods li et al 2019 according to table si 7 there was a significant correlation between cod and bod5 concentrations r 2 0 871 bod5 concentration made a significant correlation with zn r 2 0 534 and al r 2 0 837 concentrations and indicated that metal pollutants were not present in stormwater runoff at the level to have negative impact on the growth of microorganisms although these metals are known for their inhabitation impacts on the microorganisms yuan et al 2017 in the facility a4 greater levels of cod and bod5 concentrations were found in stormwater collected from outfall 1 and 8 which were located at the drainage area including the buildings and diesel and gasoline pump the synthetic organic materials leached to the stormwater from diesel and gasoline pumps could be the sources for this elevated cod level a very small percentage of this cod was biodegradable 10 moreover in outfall 2 at facility a4 some scrape and discarded materials were observed by the inspections and they may release some organics into the stormwater fig 6a in facility a11 the greatest median cod and bod5 concentrations were found as 409 5 mg l and 40 0 mg l at outfall 7 this outfall was located in the drainage area that was utilized for the storage of metal spools drums pipes old parts one of the important water quality indicators for industrial runoff is tss concentration because this parameter is known to have a strong correlation with particulate pollutants turbidity cod and total phosphorous tp metals pollutants concentrations that can be found in the filterable fraction of the runoff kayhanian et al 2012 tss is originated from tire wear roadway wear construction sites atmospheric deposition anthropogenic waste and soil particles which are carried by wind barbosa et al 2012 aryal et al 2010 for instance at the facility a4 the greatest median tss concentration was found as 838 mg l in outfall 10 which was almost seven times greater than the recommended benchmark level this outfall received the stormwater flow from the fill materials storage so it contains materials such as sand dirt and gravel fig 6b the state regulatory agency inspection report also indicated the presence of gravel sand and dirt around this outfall the greater levels of fe al and mg were also found at the stormwater samples collected at this outfall the cause of this process might be the sand dirt and silts that were released from the storage location of fill materials salehi et al 2020a 2020b according to table si 7 tss concentration made a strong relationship with al r 2 0 772 cod r 2 0 6170 fe r 2 0 797 o g r 2 0 567 and zn r 2 0 580 concentrations as well as a moderate relationship with bod5 concentration r 2 0 429 as a result tss could be a priority pollutant for designing various best management practices bmps and low impact development lids which is consistent with literature gorgoglione et al 2019 stated that suspended solids can be surrogate pollution to evaluate other pollutant species shinya et al 2000 pointed out that many micropollutants can be attached to the suspended solids so tss can be known as the major pollutant in stormwater runoff other studies mentioned that suspended solids made a strong relationship with tp total nitrogen tn and cod concentration vaze and chiew 2002 han et al 2006a 2006b another common containment in the stormwater runoff is nitrogen different forms of nitrogen including inorganic forms nh4 no2 no3 organic forms dissolved organic n don and particle organic n pon could be present in stormwater runoff the self reported data analyzed in this study involved the inorganic form of nitrogen no2 no3 could cause eutrophication to occur in adjacent water bodies the average concentrations of ammonia were 0 3 0 45 and 0 37 mg l in the a11 the a4 and the entire watershed respectively and all the events had a concentration lower than the benchmark level 4 mg l the average concentration of no2 no3 in the a4 the a11 and the whole watershed was greater than the average of ammonia so most part of nitrogenous containments was no2 no3 the rainfall depth made a significant relationship with al r 2 0 505 and a moderate relationship with fe r 2 0 379 the correlation between rainfall duration and al was significant r 2 0 8 but the duration of rainfall made a moderate relationship with rainfall depth r 2 0 412 there were moderate relationships between rainfall intensity and ph r 2 0 392 and between rainfall depth and rainfall intensity r 2 0 45 the authors expected to observe a logical correlation between runoff pollutions and rain intensity due to the kinetic energy of rainfall intensity kleinman et al 2006 but they could not find any relationship the result of this study is comparable with yang and toor 2017 they mentioned that there is no correlation between measured pollutant variables and rainfall depth and the intensity of rainfall however there was a conflict with the result of nayeb yazdi et al 2019 they found that tss made a direct correlation with rainfall intensity the correlation between the dry period with all the water quality parameters was assessed the results did not show any significant correlation between dry period and runoff quality parameters which are comparable with other studies for instance gnecco et al 2005a 2005b reported no correlation between the awmcs of runoff containments and antecedent dry days adds because of the low medium intensity of the rainfall events although brodie and egodawatta 2011 and fengman et al 2012 stated that there is a strong relationship between rainfall specifications and cod and tss concentrations but the results of this article illustrated that there were the worst relationships between cod tss and rainfall specifications the most important reason for this conflict can be a stepwise relationship between stormwater quality and some rainfall conditions liu et al 2013 as a result there was no meaningful correlation between awmcs of runoff pollution and rainfall characteristics 3 2 principal component analysis pca the categorization of the pca loading for runoff pollutant concentrations and rainfall characteristics are also investigated fig 7 9 the p value of runoff quality and quantity values were calculated by a one sample kolmogorov test are shown in table si 8 according to the results the p value for all rainfall conditions and runoff quality parameters was 0 05 so their distributions were not normal the pca was conducted after normalizing the parameters determinant and kmo criteria were 1 7 e 10 and 0 581 at this part respectively according to kaiser criteria the levels of this index were categorized as miserable kmo and determinant criteria are 0 5 and zero respectively thus pca is a suitable method for reducing the dimensions according to table si 9 three components which had eigenvalues larger than 1 were considerable 52 167 of the total variance was for the first principal component pc1 and al fe and cu concentrations loaded this component strongly and cod tss bod and nh4 concentrations loaded it moderately the contaminants which were released by storage and maintenance equipment and fill materials could attribute to this component the second principal component pc2 included 17 721 of the total variance and was loaded by no2 no3 concentration strongly and nh4 concentration moderately pollution sources that were produced by biogenic pollution sources living organisms might associate with this component barakat et al 2016 salehi et al 2020a 2020b the rainfall intensity and ph loaded the third principal component strongly which constituted 11 216 of the total variance the first three principal components were loaded weakly on rainfall depth antecedent dry period o g and mg concentrations the factor analysis also assessed the relationship between weather conditions antecedent dry days daily rainfall depth and rainfall intensity and three groups of runoff quality parameters the first group was tss bod cod and o g concentrations determinant and kmo criteria were 0 024 and 0 626 at this part two components which had eigenvalues larger than 1 were considerable and included 70 66 of the total variance according to fig 7 bod cod and o g concentrations were highly correlated with adds this could have been a consequence of the accumulation of organic matter on the ground tss had a first component near to the bod cod o g and adds but there was a significant difference on the pc2 second principal component and it was an unexpected result trace metals al cu fe and mg formed the second group we assessed two components that had eigenvalues larger than 1 and found that 73 3 of the total variance was assigned to these components determinant and kmo criteria were 0 005 and 0 663 in this group according to fig 8 there was a strong correlation between trace metals concentrations fe cu al mg however these trace metals were not affected by rainfall conditions rainfall depth rainfall intensity and adds the result of this study was unexpected because yuan et al 2017 reported that the concentration of various metals pb cu zn cd cr and ni in stormwater was affected by various rainfall conditions one reason of this conflict might be the assessment of different metals pollutants and land uses in this study and yuan et al 2017 the metal pollutants could be originated from storage materials on site drums old pipes wooden poles metal spools metal scrape and vehicular transportation activities such as heavy industrial trucks muller et al 2020 the last group was formed by no2 no3 and nh4 concentrations and ph three first components of this part have eigen values 1 and included 81 25 of the total variance determinant and kmo criteria of this part were 0 165 and 0 521 respectively factor analysis on the relationship between rainfall conditions and inorganic nitrogenous containments nh4 no2 no3 and ph is shown in fig 9 according to this figure it was found that ph was more correlated to rainfall depth and rainfall intensity however nh4 and no2 no3 concentrations did not make a significant relationship with any rainfall conditions this was primarily caused by the conversion of particle nitrogen to a soluble form thus it is clear that rainfall conditions have an arbitrary influence on nitrogenous containments yuan et al 2017 there is a conflict between the result of this study and jani et al 2020 they observed a positive correlation between nitrogenous containments no2 n no3 n and nh4 n and rainfall characteristics the total rainfall and antecedent dry period in urban areas the type of land use in this research and were industrial and residential respectively in the residential areas the source of nitrogenous containments are landscapes fertilizers muller et al 2020 however researchers did not observe any landscapes in the a4 and a11 facilities as a result it is clear that they did not observe a correlation between rainfall characteristics and nitrogenous containments and it can be a reason of this conflict containment loadings at facilities a4 and a11 also analyzed by spss for every outfall tables si10 si12 and figs s1 and s2 show the results of these analyses follow weighted mean concentrations of every facility were compared with the tdec benchmark levels table si 3 the awmcs of al cod mg no2 no3 and tss concentrations were greater than the benchmark level at the a4 facility a11 facility and the entire watershed but fe and bod5 levels were greater than the benchmark level only at the a11 facility the pearson correlation coefficients matrix of surface runoff quality parameters is shown in table si 13 fig 10 showed the fraction of pollution loads for every season in the a11 facility the percentage of the al load varied between 0 8 and 33 7 the 85 of the al load was originated from outfalls 6 7 and 8 in the facility a4 the percentage of the al load varied from 1 8 to 33 4 the 74 3 of this pollutant load was produced from outfalls 6 7 8 and 9 the awmc of this pollution exceeded the benchmark level 0 75 mg l at the facilities a4 and all and the entire catchment the stormwater management team needs to reduce 83 2 76 57 and 78 14 of this pollution at the a11 the a4 and the whole watershed respectively according to table si 14 and fig 10 25 7 23 4 13 8 and 37 1 of the al load was produced in fall spring summer and winter respectively nh4 was less than the benchmark level in every facility and the entire watershed most of nh4 loads were originated from outfalls 6 7 and 8 at the facility a11 with 83 7 of the total load and outfalls 6 9 at the facility a4 with 75 9 of the total load according to table si 14 and fig 10 a maximum level of the nh4 load occurred in the spring with 49 2 of the total load the greatest part of bod5 loading was originated from outfall 6 from the a11 39 3 and in outfall 9 from the a4 30 9 outfalls 6 8 in the facility a11 and outfalls 6 9 in the facility a4 have generated the greatest part of the bod5 load in these facilities the level of bod5 concentration was higher than the benchmark level in the a11 facility but the level of it was lower than the benchmark level in the a4 facility and the whole watershed according to table si 14 and fig 10 the percentage of the bod5 load for every season varied between 10 6 and 37 1 the lowest and greatest bod5 concentrations were occurred in the summer and the winter respectively the cod concentration was greater than the benchmark level in the facilities a4 the a11 and the whole watershed the greater cod concentration was found in outfall 7 of the facility a11 45 2 of the cod load and outfall 9 of the facility a4 26 5 of the cod load 56 68 31 2 and 37 86 of the cod load must be removed from the a11 the a4 and the entire watershed for achieving the benchmark level of this containment there was a strong correlation between cod and bod5 concentrations with a determination coefficient 0 5 the highest level of the cod load was produced in the winter with 33 2 of the total load table si 14 and fig 10 the percentage of the fe load changed from 0 9 to 34 8 in every outfall at the a11 and from 1 8 to 32 6 in every outfall at the a4 the maximum level of the fe load happened in outfall 6 from catchment 11 and in outfall 6 from catchment 4 the level of fe in the facility a11 exceeds the benchmark level 5 mg l but the amount of it in the a4 facility and the entire watershed did not exceed the benchmark level 5 mg l 11 47 of this pollution need to be removed at the facility a11 to meet the benchmark levels the 24 9 25 1 16 5 and 33 5 of the cod load occurred in the fall spring summer and winter respectively the majority of cod occurs in fall winter and spring which generate 83 5 of cod the origins of this containment in these seasons are vegetation and animal wastes hornig et al 2022 the mg percentage varied between 0 8 and 53 4 in the a11 facility and between 2 4 and 26 6 in the a4 facility the level of this containment was greater than the benchmark level 0 064 mg l in the facilities a11 the a4 and the entire watershed the stormwater management team need to reduce 99 27 of the total load in the whole industrial watershed the maximum level of the mg load happened in the winter with 33 4 of the total load the level of no2 no3 exceeded the benchmark level 0 7 mg l in the a4 the a11 and the entire watershed the 78 68 30 36 and 50 72 of the no2 no3 load must reduce in the a11 the a4 and the whole watershed respectively in the facilities a11 and a4 outfall 6 generated 88 7 and 23 7 of the total load respectively the source of nitrogen in the runoff can be chemical fertilizers atmospheric deposition organic materials soil and nitrification yang and lusk 2018 so the landscapes where are located in the catchment can be an important source of nitrogenous containments despite the summer had the lowest level of runoff volume 58 6 of the pollutant load was produced in the summer according to jani et al 2020 inorganic n no2 no3 and nh4 can be mobilized by summer rainfall to the surface runoff the o g had an awmc lower than the benchmark 15 mg l in every facility the maximum level of the load occurred in outfall 7 of catchment 11 43 4 and outfall 9 of the catchment a4 37 6 o g made a strong correlation with the cod r 2 0 727 fe r 2 0 625 mg r 2 0 554 and tss r 2 0 72 winter and fall produced 63 2 of the total load at the a4 and the a11 facilities according to tables si 10 si 12 and figs s1 s2 the percentage of the tss load varied from 0 7 to 30 9 of the total tss load at the facility a11 and 1 5 to 24 6 of the total tss load at the facility a4 the load of tss was 100 6 tons year 27 5 and 72 5 of the total load were produced at the a11 and a4 facilities respectively the tss awmc exceeds the benchmark level 150 mg l thus it is necessary to remove 73 58 55 03 and 60 13 of the tss from the a11 the a4 and the entire watershed respectively the tss made a strong relationship with al bod5 cod fe mg o g and ph as a result tss can be a priority pollutant for designers who design different bmp and lid systems according to tables si 10 si 12 the planners need to remove 20 4 tons year and 40 13 tons year of the a11 and the a4 to achieve the benchmark level of tss winter and fall generate 64 8 of the tss load at facility a4 and facility a11 as a result the maximum load of pollutions commonly was produced from outfalls 6 8 of the facility a11 and outfalls 6 and 9 of the facility a4 the concentrations of tss no2 no3 mg cod and al concentrations were higher than the benchmark levels in the entire industrial watershed 60 of the tss mg cod and al loads was produced in the fall and winter approximately 3 3 evaluation of swppps effectiveness by assessment of stormwater quality temporal variations the swppps are usually developed by the stormwater management team after reviewing the potential pollutants and operations at the industrial facilities through listing the required bmps to reduce stormwater pollution fig 11 however periodical evaluation and assessment of the effectiveness of applied management practices is essential to ensure compliance under the permit gleaton 2006 in this study the swppps effectiveness was evaluated through investigation of temporal changes of water quality index wqi and certain stormwater quality parameters 3 3 1 the water quality index calculation and sensitivity analysis although the water quality indices were used mainly to evaluate the quality of freshwater streams and rivers in this study using the wqi as an effective indicator to assess the spatiotemporal variations of stormwater quality at industrial facilities was evaluated for this purpose an initial comparison was made between wqis calculated according to the wsm and ccme methods for stormwater samples collected in facility a11 in 2018 the wsm wqis calculated for stormwater samples collected at eight outfalls in facility a11 were averaged for each quarter in 2018 and shown in fig 12 however the stormwater quality data at each outfall were considered as frequency to calculate the ccme wqis the results demonstrated the lower wsm wqis compared to the ccme wqis however they were significantly correlated r 2 0 979 p value 0 05 according to the wsm classification the stormwater quality in facility a11 in quarters 1 and 3 of 2018 was ranked as bad and in quarter 4 was ranked as medium however according to the ccme classification the stormwater quality in facility a11 in quarters 1 and 3 of 2018 was ranked as marginal and in quarter 4 was ranked as good similar to the literature this finding raises concerns regarding the different water quality classifications obtained using various wqis uddin et al 2021 the ccme wqi decreases when a stormwater quality parameter does not meet its objective value however the wsm wqi was reported to be insensitive to the extremely low individual water quality parameters as it considers the arithmetic mean for wqi calculation banda and kumarasamy 2020 to identify the sensitivity of wqis to each stormwater quality parameter the water quality indices that were calculated by omitting the certain water quality parameter were compared with the original wqis calculated according to the wsm and ccme methods fig 13 it should be noted that wsm wqis that were averaged for eight different outfalls at each quarter are shown in fig 13 the ccme wqis calculated by omitting every stormwater quality parameter were strongly correlated with the original wsm wqi r 2 0 997 p value 0 05 although omitting every stormwater quality parameter in quarter 3 did not change the category of stormwater samples collected in that period but omitting oil and grease bod5 and cod data promoted the stormwater quality ranking from bad to medium in quarter 3 white omitting nh4 mg no2 no3 and tss data declined the stormwater quality ranking from medium to bad the wsm wqis calculated by omitting every stormwater quality parameter expects the tss concentrations were strongly correlated with the original wsm wqi r2 0 966 p value 0 05 however removing the tss data from wsm wqis calculation resulted in the least correlation with the original wsm wqis r 2 0 666 p value 0 05 the ranking of stormwater quality in quarters 1 and 4 has not changed by omitting the individual stormwater quality parameters the wsm wqis were found fairly insensitive to the ph data however omitting the tss and cod data in quarter 2 promoted the stormwater quality from marginal to fair analysis of the sensitivity of both wsm wqis and ccme wqis to the stormwater quality parameters illustrated the high dependence on the target data sets 3 3 2 the spatiotemporal variation of stormwater quality in industrial facilities using the wsm wqis to identify the spatiotemporal variation of stormwater quality the wsm wqis were calculated using the self reported stormwater data collected from 2014 to 2018 for 11 outfalls in facility a4 and 8 outfalls at facility a11 according to the wsm method as demonstrated in fig 14 the annually averaged wsm wqi at different outfalls in facility a4 ranged from 37 9 to 70 5 which represents bad to medium stormwater quality the annually averaged wsm wqi in 2015 43 7 ranked as bad and was significantly lower p value 0 05 than annually averaged wsm wqi in 2014 53 6 and 2017 53 8 which were ranked as medium quality however no significant differences were found among the wsm wqis for various outfalls in facility a4 in facility a11 the greatest annually averaged wsm wqi was found as 54 5 in 2016 and ranked as medium the lowest wsm wqi was found as 46 5 in 2017 and ranked as bad the wsm wqis calculation represented a significant p value 0 05 water quality deterioration from 2016 to 2017 by reduction of wsm wqi from medium 54 5 to bad 46 5 this might imply the lower effectiveness of stormwater quality control measures applied during 2017 compared to 2016 significant differences were found in wqis among various outfalls in facility a11 ranging from bad to medium quality p value 0 05 although wqis illustrate a general trend in variation of stormwater quality but to better understand the reasons behind those variations and develop effective mitigation practices detailed analysis of stormwater quality parameters and individual stormwater management practices is required 3 4 the temporal variations of stormwater quality and implemented management practices to better evaluate the effectiveness of implemented stormwater management practices at the target industrial facilities the temporal variations of certain stormwater constituents over the 4 year period was investigated so the direction of change in certain stormwater pollutants concentration was evaluated to find if the facility pollution prevention efforts were effective in reducing the pollutant loadings this assessment is critical to support the current efforts protecting the watersheds and to evaluate the effectiveness of the regulation that impacts thousands of industries in tennessee the temporal variations of tss cod and bod5 concentrations at facilities a4 and a11 during the 4 year study period are shown fig 15 in facility a4 significant reductions in tss cod and bod5 concentrations were found from 2015 to 2016 p value 0 05 however no further reduction was found after 2016 p value 0 05 in facility a11 the cod and tss concentrations were not significantly different over the years p value 0 05 however bod5 concentrations were reduced from 2016 to 2017 p value 0 05 and did not change after that this implies the low performance of applied management practices in reducing the contaminant in stormwater however while the main activities at each facility are stagnant ancillary activities along with their associated pollutant sources could change daily at each facility which could make some challenges adjusting the stormwater management practices to the pollutant sources in this study the management controls described in both facilities swppps were mostly the employees procedures and operational practices rather than structural bmps table si 4 for instance in facility a4 the control measures were described as regular sweeping inspections of storm drain outlets facility inspection for spills and leaks immediate cleanup of spills and leaks appropriate disposal of liquids washing the equipment and vehicles in designated areas and maintenance of the landscape however additional site specific control measures such as inlet protections were recommended by the state regulatory agency as the stormwater drain was directly exposed to the sand and gravel although outfall 10 in facility a4 was located within the gravel and sand material storage area no sediment control measure was found around the inlet and gravel deposition was reported inside the inlet the stormwater samples at this outfall reportedly exceeded the tss and several metals concentrations at this particular outfall from 2015 to 2018 it was mentioned by the industry sector that the storage of industrial equipment at this facility may alter routinely this could negatively impact stormwater quality if appropriate best management practices are not implemented however the official records indicated that the industry sector had developed the corrective action plan cap in 2015 but the industry sector was not able to complete the cap actions and make progress toward reducing the pollutants concentrations in the stormwater discharged from this facility 2017 furthermore not properly maintaining the bmps and good housekeeping measures could have contributed to the contaminant release to the stormwater poor housekeeping was reported in facility a11 during the recent state regulatory agency inspection the road debris and loose gravel were found around outfall 7 which is the storage yard for metal pipes drums spools and old parts no sediment control measures were found around its inlet this outfall reportedly demonstrated exceedance in tss and several metals a stockpile of excavated soil broken concrete and sediment deposition was found around outfall 9 the comparison of the inspection report in 2009 with the report in 2018 demonstrated an improvement in the housekeeping practices in this facility however the industrial activities including storage of various equipment were altered routinely but the swppps were not updated accordingly 4 limitation and recommendations there are some limitations and assumptions in this assessment that should be considered in future studies in this study researchers did not have access to the industrial facilities so they did not have a deep understanding of the local conditions of the facilities at every measured rainfall event the pollution prevention team collected one sample within the initial 30 min of discharge at every rainfall event however several samples should be collected during every rainfall event there was a small volume of runoff quality data so it is hard to assess seasonal variations and loads of containments in stormwater in this research the authors did not have any information about the output discharge of every outfall at the a4 and a11 facilities therefore they calculated a load of pollution by the amount of rainfall depth for every event and the drainage area for every outfall at the a4 and a11 facilities they assumed that outfalls within each drainage area have an equal area future research should include additional information about the area and local conditions of every outfall in the facility a4 and the a11 the quantitative evaluation of stormwater pollutant control measures requires field sampling and inspection however the researchers did not have access to the industrial sites to conduct the field sampling and inspection and they only used the self reported stormwater quality data and state regulatory agency compliance documents such as recent swppps inspection reports and notice of violations there are certain uncertainties associated with the self reported nature of data such as poor sampling or analysis practices furthermore to verify that the control measures described in the swppps are actually implemented frequent site inspections are required implementation of non structural bmps in industrial sites involves high degree of uncertainty regarding their performance in reducing the pollutants loading very limited information is available to the industry stakeholders in respect to the effectiveness of non structural bmps thus many of them implement those without sufficient information on their effectiveness taylor and fletcher 2007 a greater level of practical training should be provided by the regulatory agencies to stormwater managers on how to evaluate and monitor their nonstructural bmps the swppps should be updated regularly following the inspection reports and self evaluation of stormwater quality the onsite operators at each facility should be informed regarding the applied stormwater management changes the local regulatory agency can conduct annual surveys to evaluate the changes in the people s knowledge attitude and behavior toward protection of stormwater quality this survey in combination with an assessment of self reported stormwater quality data could be utilized as a valuable tool by the regulatory agency to assess the effectiveness of their enforcement and monitoring practices although the wqis could be used as an effective tool to study the stormwater quality trends and communicate them to the public industry sectors policymakers and other stakeholders this index should not substitute the detailed analysis of individual stormwater quality parameters furthermore the wsm wqis are also facing the eclipsing problem where the index does not reflect the poor water quality when at least one extremely poor water quality parameter existed gupta et al 2003 uddin et al 2021 the sensitivity analysis demonstrated the sensitivity of wqi to the type of stormwater quality parameter furthermore the wqis were temporally variable in each facility this finding underscores the importance of stormwater sampling where the collection of sufficient and consistent stormwater quality data reduces the wqis random variations the stormwater management teams at the industrial facilities are recommended to evaluate their self reported stormwater quality data regularly to better identify the performance of the implemented stormwater management practices as stormwater quality characteristics exceeding the regulatory limits additional administrative practices structural and non structural controls should be applied to better protect the stormwater quality in respect to the non structural bmps proper training and education of employees including inspectors maintenance personnel all member of the pollution prevention team is essential all employees should have sufficient knowledge regarding the harmful environmental effects of improper disposal of materials into the storm drain so they understand the importance of preventing stormwater pollution they should have a proper understanding of the facility s stormwater infrastructure and locations of outfalls they should be trained annually and periodically to provide a general overview of the components and goals of the swppp potential pollutant sources erosion control and runoff management quarterly housekeeping inspections annual visual examinations of the outfalls record keeping and reporting procedures annual site compliance evaluation and swppp amendments 5 conclusion this study investigated the stormwater quality variations in two industrial facilities that were mainly used as utility storage yards the self reported stormwater quality data collected quarterly under the tennessee multi sector permit tmsp along with the compliance documents were utilized for the analysis at both studied facilities tss mg cu and al concentrations exceeded the state regulatory agency benchmark levels frequently the influences of rainfall characteristics on runoff quality parameters as well as runoff pollutant loading characteristics within this industrial sector was investigated it was found that tss concentration made a significant correlation with most of pollutants so it could be a priority pollutant for designing various bmps and lids no meaningful relationship between the stormwater runoff quality characteristics with the rainfall conditions was found the event means concentrations of tss no2 no3 mg cod and al concentrations exceeded the benchmark levels in the whole watershed the stormwater generated in fall and winter created 60 of the tss mg cod and al loads approximately the temporal variation of major stormwater quality characteristics was used as an indicator to evaluate the performance of the facilities swppps using two different methods including weighted sum method wsm and canadian council of ministers of the environment water quality index ccme the reduction of tss concentration from 2015 to 2018 at both facilities was observed this might be due to more effective stormwater management practices or reduction of pollutant sources however the implementation of non structural bmps at these facilities makes their performance evaluation challenging it s recommended that the industrial facilities stormwater management teams evaluate their self reported stormwater quality data regularly to better identify the performance of the implemented stormwater management practices and apply the

1193,the relationship between rainfall characteristics and pollutant discharge has rarely been investigated in industrial sectors to address this need we investigated the pollutant concentrations of surface runoff and the correlation between pollutant discharge and rainfall characteristics using the self reported stormwater quality data collected under the tennessee multi sector permit program for two industrial facilities in west tennessee the variation of certain stormwater quality parameters over this period was utilized as an indicator to evaluate the effectiveness of control measures implemented at these two facilities furthermore the water quality index wqi as an indicator to assess the temporal changes in stormwater quality at industrial facilities was determined using the weighted sum wsm and canadian council of ministers of the environment ccme methods the principal component analysis pca and pearson correlation coefficient were utilized to understand the correlation between runoff quality parameters rainfall characteristics and the sources of pollutants the results demonstrated lower wqi indices using the wsm method compared to the ccme method the data analysis revealed that 93 1 100 86 2 and 48 3 of al mg cu and fe experienced a concentration greater than the benchmark level respectively there was a significant relationship between total suspended solids tss and al chemical oxygen demand cod fe oil and grease o g and zn concentrations as a result tss could be a priority pollutant for designing various best management practices bmps and low impact developments lids the result of the pca and pearson correlation coefficient showed that al concentration made a significant correlation with the rainfall depth and rainfall duration this analysis also illustrated that biochemical oxygen demand bod5 cod and o g concentrations were highly correlated with antecedent dry days adds however ph was more related to rainfall depth and rainfall intensity this study informs both regulatory agencies and industry stakeholders regarding the importance of evaluating self reported stormwater quality data keywords rainfall characteristics industrial sector total suspended solids runoff pollutant loading characteristics urban runoff data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction a significant portion of stormwater pollutants is originating from the urban environment lee et al 2020 selbig and bannerman 2011 zivkovich and mays 2018 herath and salehi 2022 urban runoff has been known as a major source of non point pollutants which can deteriorate the quality of stormwater runoff and pose a substantial threat to surrounding water bodies and human health kayhanian et al 2012 chai et al 2012 yang et al 2021 a fundamental understanding of stormwater quality in industrial sectors can be a prerequisite for finding a correlation between rainfall properties and runoff quality characteristics according to previous studies urban runoff produced from industrial sectors is more polluted than that from other land uses duke et al 1998 line et al 1997 lee et al 2005 fengman et al 2012 chow et al 2013 showed that the commercial sector produces higher concentrations of bod cod tss nh3 n total phosphorous tp from industrial and residential sectors they also presented that the highest concentration for o g no3 n and zn occurred from the industrial sector studying the stormwater quality in 10 industrial sites by line et al 1997 revealed the zn and cu as the most common trace metals in the first flush jeong et al 2020 reported a lower metal pollutant loading in the particles 125 μm collected from urban areas than those collected from intensive industrial areas the quantity and quality of industrial runoff are dependent on the climate geology topography land use and degree of imperviousness stormwater management manual for western australia 2004 as a result it is vital to assess how various rainfall characteristics influence the runoff quality in the receiving waters several investigations have been performed to assess the impacts of rainfall characteristics and climate change on urban runoff quality for instance some studies introduced rainfall characteristics are as the most important factors in the production of runoff containments li et al 2007 gorgoglione et al 2019 li and barrett 2008 table si 1 present stormwater runoff quality in various land uses other studies stated that climate change could increase nutrient and sediment loadings in urban runoff alamdari et al 2017 alamdari et al 2019 alamdari et al 2022 alamdari and hogue 2021 giuffria et al 2017 alamdari et al 2018 zakizadeh et al 2022 alamdari et al 2018 the most important rainfall characteristics are antecedent dry period rainfall intensity and rainfall depth the antecedent dry period is defined as the dry duration between two sequential rainfall events pollutants are accumulated on impermeable surfaces during this period this build up is the result of various processes such as wind erosion atmospheric deposition the particles which are produced from vehicle wear and weathering of surface materials charters et al 2021 the role of the dry period on runoff quality was assessed by various studies hornig et al 2022 expressed that the antecedent dry period could have an impact on the buildup of containments on the surface yuan et al 2017 reported that the increase of antecedent dry days was associated with an increase in certain particle concentrations 30 and smaller of surface runoff xue 2009 observed a strong direct correlation between runoff quality variables tn tp zn pb cu tss and cod and previous dry days jani et al 2020 illustrated that no2 n no3 n and nh4 n concentrations had a positive correlation with the antecedent dry period chow et al 2013 showed that there was a positive correlation between that the antecedent dry days and flow weighted mean concentrations fwmcs of most containments present in the industrial runoff other important rainfall characteristics are rainfall depth and rainfall intensity total rainfall depth is defined as the amount of rainfall is fallen during a given amount of time the intensity of rainfall is defined as the ratio of the total rainfall depth of a rainfall event to the rainfall duration of the same event raindrops produce kinetic energy which can transfer containments from impervious surfaces to water bodies during rainfall events charters et al 2021 the effect of rainfall intensity on runoff quality was also investigated in several studies for instance qiu et al 2021 reported that the intensity of rainfall could influence the accumulation of sediments nutrients and other pollutants in another study fengman et al 2012 illustrated that there was a strong direct correlation between rainfall intensity and the concentration of cod from the literature review and some of the aforementioned studies it is clear that rainfall intensity and antecedent dry period can have a significant impact on the industrial runoff quality however due to the random nature and uncertainly of precipitation tiefenthaler et al 2002 it is necessary to perform comprehensive analysis about the correlation between rainfall properties and runoff water quality parameters in various areas such as industrial residential and commercial sectors this study assesses this correlation in industrial sectors understanding the pollutant release by industrial facilities to the storm runoff is more complicated due to the variable nature of industrial activities and in many cases limited access of environmental scientists to the industrial sites the clean water act prohibits pollutant discharge by any point sources into the water of the united states unless the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit exists the npdes permit includes pollutant discharge limits monitoring and reporting requirements usepa 2010 the multi sector general permit msgp allows industrial facilities to discharge their stormwater in areas where the u s environmental protection agency usepa is the npdes permitting authority usepa 2010 duke and augustenborg 2006 this permit regulates the stormwater quality within the industrial facilities which requires each facility to develop the stormwater pollution prevention plan swppp to identify the expected stormwater pollution sources control measures and develop strategies to minimize the pollutant tdec 2020 the industrial facilities could implement a combination of management strategies and structural and nonstructural practices to prevent stormwater pollution gleaton 2006 however in some cases inappropriate evaluation of industrial activities and pollution sources may result in development of the incomplete management plans duke and bauersachs 1998 following the msgp permits the industrial facilities are needed to report the stormwater quality to the state s regulatory agency on a regular basis although being self reported introduced some limitations to the data analysis but they were recognized as the best data source available to assess contaminant loadings to the receiving waters and to evaluate the effectiveness of regulation and stormwater pollution prevention plans joshi and balasubramanian 2010 the self reported stormwater quality data can demonstrate the facilities improvement in reducing the pollutants discharge and provide a self evaluation to the facility operators regarding the required modifications of stormwater management practices gleaton 2006 investigation of temporal changes in stormwater quality is mostly limited to the first flush phenomena where a greater level of contaminant is present at the beginning of storm events or rainfall joshi and balasubramanian 2010 however evaluation of long term changes in stormwater quality is an important step to understand the performance of management strategies such as best management practices bmps a clear quantification of pollutant concentrations in storm runoff is the most widely used approach to evaluate bmp s effectiveness however many industrial facilities are conducting the non structural bmps such as employees or operational procedures rather than implementing the structural bmps or pollution control devices the effectiveness of non structural bmps has been poorly evaluated compared to structural bmps limited resources poor reporting and assessment design are some of the major components preventing comprehensive evaluation of non structural bmps taylor et al 2007 understanding the relationship between physiochemical factors and rainfall characteristics is critical to manage nutrients and other pollutants export from urban landscape to downstream bodies and to better prevent eutrophication from the previous research it is clear that rainfall magnitude and antecedent dry can have a significant impact on the stormwater runoff quality in upstream watershed however there is a lack of understanding that how and at what extent rainfall characteristics affect physiochemical parameters during dry and wet weather periods especially from industrial sectors in this research the stormwater quality variations within two industrial facilities are investigated and their temporal variations are examined by calculating the water quality indices wqi i the sensitivity analysis is conducted to evaluate the suitability of wqi for assessment of stormwater quality variations ii and using the rainfall and pollutant wash off data and statistical analysis the relationship between weather conditions and pollutant concentrations in the runoff is examined iii moreover runoff pollutant loads characteristics within this industrial area were also investigated the limitation of self reported data and challenges regarding the evaluation of non structural bmps are discussed and future practices were recommended to both regulatory agencies and industry stakeholders this study will inform both regulatory agencies and industry stakeholders regarding the importance of the evaluation of self reported stormwater quality data to assess the effectiveness of regulation and stormwater pollution prevention plans 2 methodology 2 1 data sources the self reported stormwater quality data collected by two industrial facilities in tennessee with active tennessee multi sector permit tmsp during the period of 2015 2018 were analyzed the pollution prevention team collected one sample within the initial 30 min of discharge at every rainfall event the facilities a4 and a11 were selected for this study as our recent investigation demonstrated that their quarterly self reported stormwater quality parameters repeatedly exceeded the benchmark level recommended by the state regulatory agency salehi et al 2020a these facilities swppps and additional records such as notice of intent noi notice of violation nov and inspection reports were also reviewed these compliance documents were used to assess the facility operators understanding of significant sources of stormwater pollutants in the facility and the selection of bmps sector ad of tmsp requires industrial facilities to monitor for ph bod5 cod tss ammonia as nitrogen and o g concentrations although these two facilities reported the stormwater quality quarterly to the state regulatory agency sometimes due to the limited rain the stormwater quality data were not reported the list of available self reported data for the studied industrial facilities is shown in table si 2 the tn state regulatory agency benchmark levels and usepa limits are listed in table si 3 the raw data are available online for public at the tennessee department of environment and conservation website a pollution prevention team collected the runoff samples from the outfalls of these facilities during precipitation and every facility had a unique stormwater pollution prevention plan fig 1 illustrates the location of these facilities and the location of their outfalls tables si 4 and si 5 show the area of every outfall for facilities a4 and a11 which had 11 and 9 outfalls with an average protected area of 13 612 m2 and 4047 m2 per outfall respectively the drainage area of every outfall within each catchment was not available in the storm water pollution prevention plan thus it is assumed that outfalls within each catchment have an equal area it is essential to mention that a load of pollution was calculated by the amount of rainfall depth for every event and the drainage area for every outfall at the a4 and a11 facilities flow weighted mean concentrations for every event were calculated using the area of every outfall the rainfall characteristics daily rainfall rainfall intensity rainfall duration and antecedent dry period of the memphis international airport metrological station were extracted from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa website this metrological station is located 13 7 kilometers south of a4 and a11 facilities the a4 and the a11 facilities experienced 13 and 19 rainfall events respectively during five years period 2014 2018 the annual precipitation was 1371 mm 2014 1337 6 mm 2015 1564 4 mm 2016 1305 mm 2017 and 1629 4 mm 2018 the average annual rainfall was 1441 mm in the study area 2 2 statistical analysis the statistical analysis was performed using ibm spss software v 26 the normality of stormwater quality data was assessed using the kolmogorov smirnov test however for the non parametric stormwater quality data the non parametric test of mood s median was implemented to evaluate the significant changes of stormwater quality data lien et al 2018 ullah et al 2020 in case of a significant difference between the median of tested variables in mood s median test więcław and kurnicki 2016 the non parametric kruskal wallis test with multiple comparisons was applied the pearson correlation analysis was conducted for wqis a type i error of 0 05 was selected as the significance level for all tests statistical package for social science spss was selected for finding the relationship between surface runoff quality data and rainfall characteristics the water quality data collected from 2014 to 2018 were used for this analysis for this purpose we calculated the area weighted mean concentration and pollutant load average it is assumed that all the catchments get the same amount of rainfall and area weighted average concentrations were calculated using outfalls areas eq 1 where awmc is the area weighted mean concentration mg l ct is the concentration of pollutant mg l for every event and at is the drainage area of every outfall m3 1 awmc c t a t a t the inverse distribution function was applied for normalization in this study principal component analysis pca was selected for reducing the dimension of data in this method some normalized criteria such as determinant and kaiser meyer olkin kmo must be checked the number of determinants must be greater than zero according to kaiser criteria the levels of this index were categorized as marvelous kmo 0 9 meritorious 0 8 kmo 0 9 middling 0 7 kmo 0 8 mediocre 0 6 kmo 0 7 miserable 0 5 kmo 0 6 and unacceptable kmo 0 5 if kmo and determinant criteria are 0 5 and zero respectively pca is a suitable method for reducing the dimensions the numbers of extracted components of the pca method and the numbers of input variables are equal however the extracted components are selected as principal components if they have eigenvalues greater than one absolute loading values can be categorized regarding the pca loading absolute pca loading values of 0 75 0 5 0 75 and 0 5 can be categorized as strong moderate and weak respectively barakat et al 2016 in the pearson correlation coefficients matrix it is assumed that the coefficient of determination values of 0 5 0 3 0 5 and 0 3 can be categorized as strong moderate and weak respectively finally containment load characteristics of a4 and a11 facilities were analyzed by spss for every outfall then the pearson correlation coefficients matrix was applied for understanding the relationship between various containment loads we also assess the role of the season on the output pollutant loads 2 3 water quality index wqi to facilitate understanding the temporal and spatial variation of stormwater quality at the target facilities the wqi s were calculated using two different methods of weighted sum method wsm and canadian council of ministers of the environment water quality index ccme to calculate the wqi according to the wsm method eq 2 was utilized where the ci is assigned to the parameter i following the normalization n is the number of water quality parameters and pi is the relative weight associated with ith water quality parameter the relative weight pi is adapted from literature which varies between 1 and 4 the most effective stormwater quality parameter has a relative weight of 4 pesce and wunderlin 2000 the average wqis were calculated for stormwater samples collected across different outfalls and during different years at each facility the wsm wqi is evaluated as excellent 90 100 good lee et al 2020 lien et al 2018 lumb et al 2006 mohebbi et al 2013 park et al 2015 pesce and

omitting that particular water quality parameter with the original water quality index rickwood and carr 2009 the stormwater quality data which were collected in 2018 for three different quarters in facility a11 were used for the sensitivity analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 investigation of the relationship between runoff pollutant concentrations and rainfall characteristics area weighted average concentrations of stormwater runoff and rainfall properties at facilities a4 and a11 are presented in table si 6 and figs 2 to 5 these concentrations were compared with the benchmark levels presented by the tennessee department of environment and conservation tdec department table si 3 the pearson correlation coefficients matrix of water quality and quantity is shown in table si 7 according to table si 6 16 rainfall events at the a11 and 13 rainfall events in the a4 were investigated for 5 years from 2014 to 2018 the arithmetic averages of rainfall depth rainfall duration rainfall intensity and antecedent dry days were 19 32 mm 7 17 days 3 17 mm h and 5 36 days for facility a11 respectively and were 11 25 mm 3 5 days 2 3 mm h and 3 49 days for facility a4 respectively fig 2 cu is known as one of the most important trace metals in the industrial runoff in this study 86 2 of samples had a cu concentration greater than the benchmark level 0 018 mg l and the average concentrations of cu in the a4 a11 and the whole watershed were 0 253 mg l 0 04 mg l and 0 16 mg l respectively concentrations of pb and zn have not been measured at study site a11 fig 3 however the arithmetic average concentration of these metal pollutant at the a4 facility were 0 07 mg l and 0 28 mg l respectively the pb and zn concentrations were below the benchmark levels in all events except for two events 2014 12 15 and 2018 04 22 for pb and one event 2015 10 10 for zn zn pb and cu are originated from various anthropogenic activities a major source of cu zn and pb in runoff is the corrosion of metal structures and building roofs other sources of these trace elements in stormwater runoff are from vehicular tires and brakes traffic volume and road deposited sediment muller et al 2020 gao et al 2022 denny et al 2022 the variation of fe and al concentrations in the facilities a4 and a11 is shown in fig 4 the mean fe concentrations were 7 51 mg l 4 25 mg l and 6 05 mg l at a4 a11 and entire watershed respectively for 48 3 of events in the a4 and a11 facilities the fe concentration exceeded the benchmark level 5 mg l one of the trace metals in the industrial runoff is al that could be a toxic to organisms in high concentrations and has negative effects on both the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems rosseland et al 1990 in this study the arithmetic average of al at the a11 a4 and the entire watershed were 4 9 mg l 3 06 mg l and 4 07 mg l respectively and 93 1 of concentrations were greater than the benchmark level 0 7 mg l the strongest relationship was found between fe and al concentrations with the pearson correlation coefficient of 0 926 the metal pollutants could be originated from the land uses of these facilities that were parking lots storage area for the equipment treated wood drums old pipes wooden poles metal spools metal scrape a paved driveway and a warehouse the average concentration of mg in all events in the a4 and a11 is greater than the benchmark level the soil of the a4 and the a11 consists of silt commonly and it can be a reason for the high abundance of mg and al in the runoff samples gransee and fuhrs 2012 hugh et al 1916 the concentrations of o g in the a4 and the a11 facilities did not exceed the benchmark level 15 mg l in most rainfall events despite these facilities being used for storage and vehicle maintenance fig 4 the value of ph varied between 4 83 and 9 05 in most events fig 4 the minimum of ph was not in the range of the tdec benchmark level barakat et al 2016 di modugno et al 2015 charters et al 2021 fengman et al 2012 giuffria et al 2017 the variation of cod and bod5 concentrations at the studied industrial facilities is shown in fig 5 in this study 27 6 and 82 75 of collected stormwater samples exceeded the benchmark levels for bod5 and cod concentrations the average bod5 and cod concentrations in a4 and a11 facilities were 27 5 mg l and 249 79 mg l respectively the biodegradability of runoff is assessed by the ratio of bod5 cod if this ratio is higher than 0 5 the runoff is biodegradable and biological treatment methods are practical in this study the average of this ratio is 0 11 with ranges from 0 06 to 0 17 as a result it can be concluded that the runoff of these industrial sectors has a poor biodegradability and designers cannot advise the biological treatment methods li et al 2019 according to table si 7 there was a significant correlation between cod and bod5 concentrations r 2 0 871 bod5 concentration made a significant correlation with zn r 2 0 534 and al r 2 0 837 concentrations and indicated that metal pollutants were not present in stormwater runoff at the level to have negative impact on the growth of microorganisms although these metals are known for their inhabitation impacts on the microorganisms yuan et al 2017 in the facility a4 greater levels of cod and bod5 concentrations were found in stormwater collected from outfall 1 and 8 which were located at the drainage area including the buildings and diesel and gasoline pump the synthetic organic materials leached to the stormwater from diesel and gasoline pumps could be the sources for this elevated cod level a very small percentage of this cod was biodegradable 10 moreover in outfall 2 at facility a4 some scrape and discarded materials were observed by the inspections and they may release some organics into the stormwater fig 6a in facility a11 the greatest median cod and bod5 concentrations were found as 409 5 mg l and 40 0 mg l at outfall 7 this outfall was located in the drainage area that was utilized for the storage of metal spools drums pipes old parts one of the important water quality indicators for industrial runoff is tss concentration because this parameter is known to have a strong correlation with particulate pollutants turbidity cod and total phosphorous tp metals pollutants concentrations that can be found in the filterable fraction of the runoff kayhanian et al 2012 tss is originated from tire wear roadway wear construction sites atmospheric deposition anthropogenic waste and soil particles which are carried by wind barbosa et al 2012 aryal et al 2010 for instance at the facility a4 the greatest median tss concentration was found as 838 mg l in outfall 10 which was almost seven times greater than the recommended benchmark level this outfall received the stormwater flow from the fill materials storage so it contains materials such as sand dirt and gravel fig 6b the state regulatory agency inspection report also indicated the presence of gravel sand and dirt around this outfall the greater levels of fe al and mg were also found at the stormwater samples collected at this outfall the cause of this process might be the sand dirt and silts that were released from the storage location of fill materials salehi et al 2020a 2020b according to table si 7 tss concentration made a strong relationship with al r 2 0 772 cod r 2 0 6170 fe r 2 0 797 o g r 2 0 567 and zn r 2 0 580 concentrations as well as a moderate relationship with bod5 concentration r 2 0 429 as a result tss could be a priority pollutant for designing various best management practices bmps and low impact development lids which is consistent with literature gorgoglione et al 2019 stated that suspended solids can be surrogate pollution to evaluate other pollutant species shinya et al 2000 pointed out that many micropollutants can be attached to the suspended solids so tss can be known as the major pollutant in stormwater runoff other studies mentioned that suspended solids made a strong relationship with tp total nitrogen tn and cod concentration vaze and chiew 2002 han et al 2006a 2006b another common containment in the stormwater runoff is nitrogen different forms of nitrogen including inorganic forms nh4 no2 no3 organic forms dissolved organic n don and particle organic n pon could be present in stormwater runoff the self reported data analyzed in this study involved the inorganic form of nitrogen no2 no3 could cause eutrophication to occur in adjacent water bodies the average concentrations of ammonia were 0 3 0 45 and 0 37 mg l in the a11 the a4 and the entire watershed respectively and all the events had a concentration lower than the benchmark level 4 mg l the average concentration of no2 no3 in the a4 the a11 and the whole watershed was greater than the average of ammonia so most part of nitrogenous containments was no2 no3 the rainfall depth made a significant relationship with al r 2 0 505 and a moderate relationship with fe r 2 0 379 the correlation between rainfall duration and al was significant r 2 0 8 but the duration of rainfall made a moderate relationship with rainfall depth r 2 0 412 there were moderate relationships between rainfall intensity and ph r 2 0 392 and between rainfall depth and rainfall intensity r 2 0 45 the authors expected to observe a logical correlation between runoff pollutions and rain intensity due to the kinetic energy of rainfall intensity kleinman et al 2006 but they could not find any relationship the result of this study is comparable with yang and toor 2017 they mentioned that there is no correlation between measured pollutant variables and rainfall depth and the intensity of rainfall however there was a conflict with the result of nayeb yazdi et al 2019 they found that tss made a direct correlation with rainfall intensity the correlation between the dry period with all the water quality parameters was assessed the results did not show any significant correlation between dry period and runoff quality parameters which are comparable with other studies for instance gnecco et al 2005a 2005b reported no correlation between the awmcs of runoff containments and antecedent dry days adds because of the low medium intensity of the rainfall events although brodie and egodawatta 2011 and fengman et al 2012 stated that there is a strong relationship between rainfall specifications and cod and tss concentrations but the results of this article illustrated that there were the worst relationships between cod tss and rainfall specifications the most important reason for this conflict can be a stepwise relationship between stormwater quality and some rainfall conditions liu et al 2013 as a result there was no meaningful correlation between awmcs of runoff pollution and rainfall characteristics 3 2 principal component analysis pca the categorization of the pca loading for runoff pollutant concentrations and rainfall characteristics are also investigated fig 7 9 the p value of runoff quality and quantity values were calculated by a one sample kolmogorov test are shown in table si 8 according to the results the p value for all rainfall conditions and runoff quality parameters was 0 05 so their distributions were not normal the pca was conducted after normalizing the parameters determinant and kmo criteria were 1 7 e 10 and 0 581 at this part respectively according to kaiser criteria the levels of this index were categorized as miserable kmo and determinant criteria are 0 5 and zero respectively thus pca is a suitable method for reducing the dimensions according to table si 9 three components which had eigenvalues larger than 1 were considerable 52 167 of the total variance was for the first principal component pc1 and al fe and cu concentrations loaded this component strongly and cod tss bod and nh4 concentrations loaded it moderately the contaminants which were released by storage and maintenance equipment and fill materials could attribute to this component the second principal component pc2 included 17 721 of the total variance and was loaded by no2 no3 concentration strongly and nh4 concentration moderately pollution sources that were produced by biogenic pollution sources living organisms might associate with this component barakat et al 2016 salehi et al 2020a 2020b the rainfall intensity and ph loaded the third principal component strongly which constituted 11 216 of the total variance the first three principal components were loaded weakly on rainfall depth antecedent dry period o g and mg concentrations the factor analysis also assessed the relationship between weather conditions antecedent dry days daily rainfall depth and rainfall intensity and three groups of runoff quality parameters the first group was tss bod cod and o g concentrations determinant and kmo criteria were 0 024 and 0 626 at this part two components which had eigenvalues larger than 1 were considerable and included 70 66 of the total variance according to fig 7 bod cod and o g concentrations were highly correlated with adds this could have been a consequence of the accumulation of organic matter on the ground tss had a first component near to the bod cod o g and adds but there was a significant difference on the pc2 second principal component and it was an unexpected result trace metals al cu fe and mg formed the second group we assessed two components that had eigenvalues larger than 1 and found that 73 3 of the total variance was assigned to these components determinant and kmo criteria were 0 005 and 0 663 in this group according to fig 8 there was a strong correlation between trace metals concentrations fe cu al mg however these trace metals were not affected by rainfall conditions rainfall depth rainfall intensity and adds the result of this study was unexpected because yuan et al 2017 reported that the concentration of various metals pb cu zn cd cr and ni in stormwater was affected by various rainfall conditions one reason of this conflict might be the assessment of different metals pollutants and land uses in this study and yuan et al 2017 the metal pollutants could be originated from storage materials on site drums old pipes wooden poles metal spools metal scrape and vehicular transportation activities such as heavy industrial trucks muller et al 2020 the last group was formed by no2 no3 and nh4 concentrations and ph three first components of this part have eigen values 1 and included 81 25 of the total variance determinant and kmo criteria of this part were 0 165 and 0 521 respectively factor analysis on the relationship between rainfall conditions and inorganic nitrogenous containments nh4 no2 no3 and ph is shown in fig 9 according to this figure it was found that ph was more correlated to rainfall depth and rainfall intensity however nh4 and no2 no3 concentrations did not make a significant relationship with any rainfall conditions this was primarily caused by the conversion of particle nitrogen to a soluble form thus it is clear that rainfall conditions have an arbitrary influence on nitrogenous containments yuan et al 2017 there is a conflict between the result of this study and jani et al 2020 they observed a positive correlation between nitrogenous containments no2 n no3 n and nh4 n and rainfall characteristics the total rainfall and antecedent dry period in urban areas the type of land use in this research and were industrial and residential respectively in the residential areas the source of nitrogenous containments are landscapes fertilizers muller et al 2020 however researchers did not observe any landscapes in the a4 and a11 facilities as a result it is clear that they did not observe a correlation between rainfall characteristics and nitrogenous containments and it can be a reason of this conflict containment loadings at facilities a4 and a11 also analyzed by spss for every outfall tables si10 si12 and figs s1 and s2 show the results of these analyses follow weighted mean concentrations of every facility were compared with the tdec benchmark levels table si 3 the awmcs of al cod mg no2 no3 and tss concentrations were greater than the benchmark level at the a4 facility a11 facility and the entire watershed but fe and bod5 levels were greater than the benchmark level only at the a11 facility the pearson correlation coefficients matrix of surface runoff quality parameters is shown in table si 13 fig 10 showed the fraction of pollution loads for every season in the a11 facility the percentage of the al load varied between 0 8 and 33 7 the 85 of the al load was originated from outfalls 6 7 and 8 in the facility a4 the percentage of the al load varied from 1 8 to 33 4 the 74 3 of this pollutant load was produced from outfalls 6 7 8 and 9 the awmc of this pollution exceeded the benchmark level 0 75 mg l at the facilities a4 and all and the entire catchment the stormwater management team needs to reduce 83 2 76 57 and 78 14 of this pollution at the a11 the a4 and the whole watershed respectively according to table si 14 and fig 10 25 7 23 4 13 8 and 37 1 of the al load was produced in fall spring summer and winter respectively nh4 was less than the benchmark level in every facility and the entire watershed most of nh4 loads were originated from outfalls 6 7 and 8 at the facility a11 with 83 7 of the total load and outfalls 6 9 at the facility a4 with 75 9 of the total load according to table si 14 and fig 10 a maximum level of the nh4 load occurred in the spring with 49 2 of the total load the greatest part of bod5 loading was originated from outfall 6 from the a11 39 3 and in outfall 9 from the a4 30 9 outfalls 6 8 in the facility a11 and outfalls 6 9 in the facility a4 have generated the greatest part of the bod5 load in these facilities the level of bod5 concentration was higher than the benchmark level in the a11 facility but the level of it was lower than the benchmark level in the a4 facility and the whole watershed according to table si 14 and fig 10 the percentage of the bod5 load for every season varied between 10 6 and 37 1 the lowest and greatest bod5 concentrations were occurred in the summer and the winter respectively the cod concentration was greater than the benchmark level in the facilities a4 the a11 and the whole watershed the greater cod concentration was found in outfall 7 of the facility a11 45 2 of the cod load and outfall 9 of the facility a4 26 5 of the cod load 56 68 31 2 and 37 86 of the cod load must be removed from the a11 the a4 and the entire watershed for achieving the benchmark level of this containment there was a strong correlation between cod and bod5 concentrations with a determination coefficient 0 5 the highest level of the cod load was produced in the winter with 33 2 of the total load table si 14 and fig 10 the percentage of the fe load changed from 0 9 to 34 8 in every outfall at the a11 and from 1 8 to 32 6 in every outfall at the a4 the maximum level of the fe load happened in outfall 6 from catchment 11 and in outfall 6 from catchment 4 the level of fe in the facility a11 exceeds the benchmark level 5 mg l but the amount of it in the a4 facility and the entire watershed did not exceed the benchmark level 5 mg l 11 47 of this pollution need to be removed at the facility a11 to meet the benchmark levels the 24 9 25 1 16 5 and 33 5 of the cod load occurred in the fall spring summer and winter respectively the majority of cod occurs in fall winter and spring which generate 83 5 of cod the origins of this containment in these seasons are vegetation and animal wastes hornig et al 2022 the mg percentage varied between 0 8 and 53 4 in the a11 facility and between 2 4 and 26 6 in the a4 facility the level of this containment was greater than the benchmark level 0 064 mg l in the facilities a11 the a4 and the entire watershed the stormwater management team need to reduce 99 27 of the total load in the whole industrial watershed the maximum level of the mg load happened in the winter with 33 4 of the total load the level of no2 no3 exceeded the benchmark level 0 7 mg l in the a4 the a11 and the entire watershed the 78 68 30 36 and 50 72 of the no2 no3 load must reduce in the a11 the a4 and the whole watershed respectively in the facilities a11 and a4 outfall 6 generated 88 7 and 23 7 of the total load respectively the source of nitrogen in the runoff can be chemical fertilizers atmospheric deposition organic materials soil and nitrification yang and lusk 2018 so the landscapes where are located in the catchment can be an important source of nitrogenous containments despite the summer had the lowest level of runoff volume 58 6 of the pollutant load was produced in the summer according to jani et al 2020 inorganic n no2 no3 and nh4 can be mobilized by summer rainfall to the surface runoff the o g had an awmc lower than the benchmark 15 mg l in every facility the maximum level of the load occurred in outfall 7 of catchment 11 43 4 and outfall 9 of the catchment a4 37 6 o g made a strong correlation with the cod r 2 0 727 fe r 2 0 625 mg r 2 0 554 and tss r 2 0 72 winter and fall produced 63 2 of the total load at the a4 and the a11 facilities according to tables si 10 si 12 and figs s1 s2 the percentage of the tss load varied from 0 7 to 30 9 of the total tss load at the facility a11 and 1 5 to 24 6 of the total tss load at the facility a4 the load of tss was 100 6 tons year 27 5 and 72 5 of the total load were produced at the a11 and a4 facilities respectively the tss awmc exceeds the benchmark level 150 mg l thus it is necessary to remove 73 58 55 03 and 60 13 of the tss from the a11 the a4 and the entire watershed respectively the tss made a strong relationship with al bod5 cod fe mg o g and ph as a result tss can be a priority pollutant for designers who design different bmp and lid systems according to tables si 10 si 12 the planners need to remove 20 4 tons year and 40 13 tons year of the a11 and the a4 to achieve the benchmark level of tss winter and fall generate 64 8 of the tss load at facility a4 and facility a11 as a result the maximum load of pollutions commonly was produced from outfalls 6 8 of the facility a11 and outfalls 6 and 9 of the facility a4 the concentrations of tss no2 no3 mg cod and al concentrations were higher than the benchmark levels in the entire industrial watershed 60 of the tss mg cod and al loads was produced in the fall and winter approximately 3 3 evaluation of swppps effectiveness by assessment of stormwater quality temporal variations the swppps are usually developed by the stormwater management team after reviewing the potential pollutants and operations at the industrial facilities through listing the required bmps to reduce stormwater pollution fig 11 however periodical evaluation and assessment of the effectiveness of applied management practices is essential to ensure compliance under the permit gleaton 2006 in this study the swppps effectiveness was evaluated through investigation of temporal changes of water quality index wqi and certain stormwater quality parameters 3 3 1 the water quality index calculation and sensitivity analysis although the water quality indices were used mainly to evaluate the quality of freshwater streams and rivers in this study using the wqi as an effective indicator to assess the spatiotemporal variations of stormwater quality at industrial facilities was evaluated for this purpose an initial comparison was made between wqis calculated according to the wsm and ccme methods for stormwater samples collected in facility a11 in 2018 the wsm wqis calculated for stormwater samples collected at eight outfalls in facility a11 were averaged for each quarter in 2018 and shown in fig 12 however the stormwater quality data at each outfall were considered as frequency to calculate the ccme wqis the results demonstrated the lower wsm wqis compared to the ccme wqis however they were significantly correlated r 2 0 979 p value 0 05 according to the wsm classification the stormwater quality in facility a11 in quarters 1 and 3 of 2018 was ranked as bad and in quarter 4 was ranked as medium however according to the ccme classification the stormwater quality in facility a11 in quarters 1 and 3 of 2018 was ranked as marginal and in quarter 4 was ranked as good similar to the literature this finding raises concerns regarding the different water quality classifications obtained using various wqis uddin et al 2021 the ccme wqi decreases when a stormwater quality parameter does not meet its objective value however the wsm wqi was reported to be insensitive to the extremely low individual water quality parameters as it considers the arithmetic mean for wqi calculation banda and kumarasamy 2020 to identify the sensitivity of wqis to each stormwater quality parameter the water quality indices that were calculated by omitting the certain water quality parameter were compared with the original wqis calculated according to the wsm and ccme methods fig 13 it should be noted that wsm wqis that were averaged for eight different outfalls at each quarter are shown in fig 13 the ccme wqis calculated by omitting every stormwater quality parameter were strongly correlated with the original wsm wqi r 2 0 997 p value 0 05 although omitting every stormwater quality parameter in quarter 3 did not change the category of stormwater samples collected in that period but omitting oil and grease bod5 and cod data promoted the stormwater quality ranking from bad to medium in quarter 3 white omitting nh4 mg no2 no3 and tss data declined the stormwater quality ranking from medium to bad the wsm wqis calculated by omitting every stormwater quality parameter expects the tss concentrations were strongly correlated with the original wsm wqi r2 0 966 p value 0 05 however removing the tss data from wsm wqis calculation resulted in the least correlation with the original wsm wqis r 2 0 666 p value 0 05 the ranking of stormwater quality in quarters 1 and 4 has not changed by omitting the individual stormwater quality parameters the wsm wqis were found fairly insensitive to the ph data however omitting the tss and cod data in quarter 2 promoted the stormwater quality from marginal to fair analysis of the sensitivity of both wsm wqis and ccme wqis to the stormwater quality parameters illustrated the high dependence on the target data sets 3 3 2 the spatiotemporal variation of stormwater quality in industrial facilities using the wsm wqis to identify the spatiotemporal variation of stormwater quality the wsm wqis were calculated using the self reported stormwater data collected from 2014 to 2018 for 11 outfalls in facility a4 and 8 outfalls at facility a11 according to the wsm method as demonstrated in fig 14 the annually averaged wsm wqi at different outfalls in facility a4 ranged from 37 9 to 70 5 which represents bad to medium stormwater quality the annually averaged wsm wqi in 2015 43 7 ranked as bad and was significantly lower p value 0 05 than annually averaged wsm wqi in 2014 53 6 and 2017 53 8 which were ranked as medium quality however no significant differences were found among the wsm wqis for various outfalls in facility a4 in facility a11 the greatest annually averaged wsm wqi was found as 54 5 in 2016 and ranked as medium the lowest wsm wqi was found as 46 5 in 2017 and ranked as bad the wsm wqis calculation represented a significant p value 0 05 water quality deterioration from 2016 to 2017 by reduction of wsm wqi from medium 54 5 to bad 46 5 this might imply the lower effectiveness of stormwater quality control measures applied during 2017 compared to 2016 significant differences were found in wqis among various outfalls in facility a11 ranging from bad to medium quality p value 0 05 although wqis illustrate a general trend in variation of stormwater quality but to better understand the reasons behind those variations and develop effective mitigation practices detailed analysis of stormwater quality parameters and individual stormwater management practices is required 3 4 the temporal variations of stormwater quality and implemented management practices to better evaluate the effectiveness of implemented stormwater management practices at the target industrial facilities the temporal variations of certain stormwater constituents over the 4 year period was investigated so the direction of change in certain stormwater pollutants concentration was evaluated to find if the facility pollution prevention efforts were effective in reducing the pollutant loadings this assessment is critical to support the current efforts protecting the watersheds and to evaluate the effectiveness of the regulation that impacts thousands of industries in tennessee the temporal variations of tss cod and bod5 concentrations at facilities a4 and a11 during the 4 year study period are shown fig 15 in facility a4 significant reductions in tss cod and bod5 concentrations were found from 2015 to 2016 p value 0 05 however no further reduction was found after 2016 p value 0 05 in facility a11 the cod and tss concentrations were not significantly different over the years p value 0 05 however bod5 concentrations were reduced from 2016 to 2017 p value 0 05 and did not change after that this implies the low performance of applied management practices in reducing the contaminant in stormwater however while the main activities at each facility are stagnant ancillary activities along with their associated pollutant sources could change daily at each facility which could make some challenges adjusting the stormwater management practices to the pollutant sources in this study the management controls described in both facilities swppps were mostly the employees procedures and operational practices rather than structural bmps table si 4 for instance in facility a4 the control measures were described as regular sweeping inspections of storm drain outlets facility inspection for spills and leaks immediate cleanup of spills and leaks appropriate disposal of liquids washing the equipment and vehicles in designated areas and maintenance of the landscape however additional site specific control measures such as inlet protections were recommended by the state regulatory agency as the stormwater drain was directly exposed to the sand and gravel although outfall 10 in facility a4 was located within the gravel and sand material storage area no sediment control measure was found around the inlet and gravel deposition was reported inside the inlet the stormwater samples at this outfall reportedly exceeded the tss and several metals concentrations at this particular outfall from 2015 to 2018 it was mentioned by the industry sector that the storage of industrial equipment at this facility may alter routinely this could negatively impact stormwater quality if appropriate best management practices are not implemented however the official records indicated that the industry sector had developed the corrective action plan cap in 2015 but the industry sector was not able to complete the cap actions and make progress toward reducing the pollutants concentrations in the stormwater discharged from this facility 2017 furthermore not properly maintaining the bmps and good housekeeping measures could have contributed to the contaminant release to the stormwater poor housekeeping was reported in facility a11 during the recent state regulatory agency inspection the road debris and loose gravel were found around outfall 7 which is the storage yard for metal pipes drums spools and old parts no sediment control measures were found around its inlet this outfall reportedly demonstrated exceedance in tss and several metals a stockpile of excavated soil broken concrete and sediment deposition was found around outfall 9 the comparison of the inspection report in 2009 with the report in 2018 demonstrated an improvement in the housekeeping practices in this facility however the industrial activities including storage of various equipment were altered routinely but the swppps were not updated accordingly 4 limitation and recommendations there are some limitations and assumptions in this assessment that should be considered in future studies in this study researchers did not have access to the industrial facilities so they did not have a deep understanding of the local conditions of the facilities at every measured rainfall event the pollution prevention team collected one sample within the initial 30 min of discharge at every rainfall event however several samples should be collected during every rainfall event there was a small volume of runoff quality data so it is hard to assess seasonal variations and loads of containments in stormwater in this research the authors did not have any information about the output discharge of every outfall at the a4 and a11 facilities therefore they calculated a load of pollution by the amount of rainfall depth for every event and the drainage area for every outfall at the a4 and a11 facilities they assumed that outfalls within each drainage area have an equal area future research should include additional information about the area and local conditions of every outfall in the facility a4 and the a11 the quantitative evaluation of stormwater pollutant control measures requires field sampling and inspection however the researchers did not have access to the industrial sites to conduct the field sampling and inspection and they only used the self reported stormwater quality data and state regulatory agency compliance documents such as recent swppps inspection reports and notice of violations there are certain uncertainties associated with the self reported nature of data such as poor sampling or analysis practices furthermore to verify that the control measures described in the swppps are actually implemented frequent site inspections are required implementation of non structural bmps in industrial sites involves high degree of uncertainty regarding their performance in reducing the pollutants loading very limited information is available to the industry stakeholders in respect to the effectiveness of non structural bmps thus many of them implement those without sufficient information on their effectiveness taylor and fletcher 2007 a greater level of practical training should be provided by the regulatory agencies to stormwater managers on how to evaluate and monitor their nonstructural bmps the swppps should be updated regularly following the inspection reports and self evaluation of stormwater quality the onsite operators at each facility should be informed regarding the applied stormwater management changes the local regulatory agency can conduct annual surveys to evaluate the changes in the people s knowledge attitude and behavior toward protection of stormwater quality this survey in combination with an assessment of self reported stormwater quality data could be utilized as a valuable tool by the regulatory agency to assess the effectiveness of their enforcement and monitoring practices although the wqis could be used as an effective tool to study the stormwater quality trends and communicate them to the public industry sectors policymakers and other stakeholders this index should not substitute the detailed analysis of individual stormwater quality parameters furthermore the wsm wqis are also facing the eclipsing problem where the index does not reflect the poor water quality when at least one extremely poor water quality parameter existed gupta et al 2003 uddin et al 2021 the sensitivity analysis demonstrated the sensitivity of wqi to the type of stormwater quality parameter furthermore the wqis were temporally variable in each facility this finding underscores the importance of stormwater sampling where the collection of sufficient and consistent stormwater quality data reduces the wqis random variations the stormwater management teams at the industrial facilities are recommended to evaluate their self reported stormwater quality data regularly to better identify the performance of the implemented stormwater management practices as stormwater quality characteristics exceeding the regulatory limits additional administrative practices structural and non structural controls should be applied to better protect the stormwater quality in respect to the non structural bmps proper training and education of employees including inspectors maintenance personnel all member of the pollution prevention team is essential all employees should have sufficient knowledge regarding the harmful environmental effects of improper disposal of materials into the storm drain so they understand the importance of preventing stormwater pollution they should have a proper understanding of the facility s stormwater infrastructure and locations of outfalls they should be trained annually and periodically to provide a general overview of the components and goals of the swppp potential pollutant sources erosion control and runoff management quarterly housekeeping inspections annual visual examinations of the outfalls record keeping and reporting procedures annual site compliance evaluation and swppp amendments 5 conclusion this study investigated the stormwater quality variations in two industrial facilities that were mainly used as utility storage yards the self reported stormwater quality data collected quarterly under the tennessee multi sector permit tmsp along with the compliance documents were utilized for the analysis at both studied facilities tss mg cu and al concentrations exceeded the state regulatory agency benchmark levels frequently the influences of rainfall characteristics on runoff quality parameters as well as runoff pollutant loading characteristics within this industrial sector was investigated it was found that tss concentration made a significant correlation with most of pollutants so it could be a priority pollutant for designing various bmps and lids no meaningful relationship between the stormwater runoff quality characteristics with the rainfall conditions was found the event means concentrations of tss no2 no3 mg cod and al concentrations exceeded the benchmark levels in the whole watershed the stormwater generated in fall and winter created 60 of the tss mg cod and al loads approximately the temporal variation of major stormwater quality characteristics was used as an indicator to evaluate the performance of the facilities swppps using two different methods including weighted sum method wsm and canadian council of ministers of the environment water quality index ccme the reduction of tss concentration from 2015 to 2018 at both facilities was observed this might be due to more effective stormwater management practices or reduction of pollutant sources however the implementation of non structural bmps at these facilities makes their performance evaluation challenging it s recommended that the industrial facilities stormwater management teams evaluate their self reported stormwater quality data regularly to better identify the performance of the implemented stormwater management practices and apply the additional administrative practices structural and non structural controls upon exceedance of the regulatory limits this study suggests that despite their limitations the wqis are providing a simple tool for the public policymakers and industry stakeholders to assess communicate and understand the stormwater quality and effectiveness of policies and management practices credit authorship

1194,light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl flow on the water table is highly mobile and is sensitive to the fluctuation of groundwater this process is highly complex and involves the migration of three immiscible phases i e water lnapl and air which need the explicit definition of multiple parameters a coupled experimental and numerical simulation methodology is performed by using time domain reflectrometer tdr and multiphase simulation of a controlled environment to mimic the water table fluctuation and its effect on the lnapl residual saturation tdr probes are installed in different locations of a 2d tank i e a cuboid box with relatively low off plane thickness and the bulk permittivity of the phases are measured through artificially imposed boundary conditions the bulk permittivity is then translated into saturation of the three different phases the translated residual saturations along with the previously measured porous media properties e g porosity and saturated permeability are then inserted into the numerical simulator i e comsol multiphysics and the migration of the three phase in porous media is simulated the numerical exponents and entry pressures needed for the simulation of the multiphase flow are estimated using the temporal experimental values the exponents of water lnapl relative permeability were estimated to be around 2 while the exponents gas lnapl relative permeability were estimated to be closer to 3 the results simulated with the optimized parameters are then evaluated with pictures taken from the transparent face of the 2d tank different stages of the experiment the temporal evolution of different phase saturation has been compared and validated between the experimental results obtained and interpreted by the tdr probe measurements and the simulations the relative error stays in the 5 confidence level for most reported points and only in the highly dynamic flow time steps the error reaches around 12 which are discussed in the text and is accepted due to the highly nonlinear nature of the problem keywords light non aquous phase liquid lnapl time domain reflectrometer tdr three phase flow in porous media

groundwater contaminants which are lighter or less dense than water and remain undissolved or hardly dissolved in water organic liquid contaminants such as petroleum oil gasoline or diesel fuel are frequent lnapl contaminations physically and chemically dissimilar fluids e g water and air lnapl form interfaces that prevents fluid mixing investigating among liquids and gas evaluating and remediating the sites contaminated by lnapl is a challenging task exposure to even small amounts of this kind of pollution causes health and ecological risks to the environment mccarthy and johnson 1993 oostrom et al 2007 cavelan et al 2022 remediation of lnapl contaminated sites common in industrial regions esp near the artificial subterranean storages are difficult and expensive as lnapl is a long term source of vapor groundwater and soil contamination in the subsurface zone itrc 2018 lnapl reaching the water table is further complicated by natural water table fluctuation huntley and beckett 2002 chrysikopoulos and lee 1998 understanding the behavior of lnapl movement is not only important for oil production from fractured reservoirs but also it is important for environmental assessment and groundwater quality management as an example the movement can lead to residual saturation of lnapl in soil that can endanger the groundwater resources in for large periods while the classical approaches may not be sufficient for their removal therefore the understanding of the nature of the lnapl deposit movement due to water table fluctuation through experiment and simulation is highly valuable to the environmental scientists and engineers initial studies of lnapl movement in the sub surface stone 1973 include capillary viscous and gravitational forces with lnapl migrating through the vadose zone and spreading pooling over the water table while pressing the capillary fringe when it reaches the saturated zone van geel and sykes 1994a 1994b atteia et al 2019 provided an easy to use model considering the impacts of vertical movement of the lnapl layer and the lnapl residual saturations for describing and estimating the influence of groundwater table fluctuations on the floating lnapl thickness in a well while in the subsurface lnapl mass is diminished by the natural attenuation processes of dissolution volatilization and biodegradation also knon as natural source zone depletion nszd in some cases nszd is considered more cost effective compared to active remediation of sites contaminated with lnapl sookhak lari et al 2019 listed twenty one physicochemical and microbiological processes driving partitioning and compositional changes of lnapl in the vadose zone and groundwater they reviewed 36 numerical models with the capabilities to simulate these processes understanding lnapl behavior characterization and distribution in the subsurface is essential to manage and make decisions for the lnapl polluted sites with various complexities quantifying the residual mobile and migrating lnapl is key for a successful remediation plan extreme weather events due to global climate change is a new concern for weather vulnerabilities to lnapls contamination from tanks and pipelines epa 2010 the lnapl accumulation at the water table highlights the importance of the study of lnapl fate due to the water table fluctuations cavelan et al 2022 lnapl temporal vertical distribution in the unsaturated and saturated zones changes due to water table fluctuations e g seasonal or tidal numerical study of lnapl migration due to the groundwater table fluctuation though essentially important for sustainable groundwater management is a complex and challenging task this problem involves the proper assessment and simulation of three phase flow in porous media because the pores above the groundwater table are filled with at least three dominantly immiscible phases i e water lnapl and air and this composition can change rapidly and significantly over time and space niessner and helmig 2007 the literature on the modelling of three phase flow in porous media is still relatively limited moortgat et al 2011 part of the difficulty come from the assessment of the relative permeabilities of the three phases and almost all are to some level based on empirical or semi empirical relationships and their limitation regarding the flow and pressure conditions and the underlying heterogeneity should be assessed prior to application mohammdi alamooti et al 2018 in this work we have chosen the stone model stone 1970 1973 proper for the purpose of the simulations the stone model succeeds in delivering the realistic and relatively accurate results and is simple enough to be added to the modelling tool i e comsol multiphysics in this study with great facility and without adding high complexity and nonlinearity to the process of solution however the residual saturation of the different phases should be properly measured before the application of the stone model for this reason a method and the device that can be used for determination of residual saturations for a wide range of flow regimes efficiently and cheaply is of high value and interest time domain reflectometer tdr is an electromagnetic geophysical device that can be used for fluid content and composition as well as some porous media characteristics marr and fairhurst 1999 by sending a fast electric pulse wave and measuring the response of the fluid porous media bulk relative permittivity the bulk permittivity of the solid multifluid phase can be inversely translated into the fluid saturation through complex refractive index model crim model birchak et al 1974 roth et al 1990 endres and knight 1992 it has been shown that by measuring the bulk permittivity of the variably saturated two phase flow in porous media the water content is delivered quite efficiently e g ling et al 2016 tdrs have been previously used to measure the fluid saturation of a two phase napl and water system colombano et al 2021a 2021b philippe et al 2021 davarzani et al 2021 in this work we will use tdr probes to measure different fluid saturation in a three phase fluid system in porous media i e water lnapl and air being the three fluid phases and glass beads being the solid porous phase and use this bulk permittivity to determine the temporal evolution of phase saturation which will later be used in the modelling of the three phase system properties including the residual saturation of each fluid phase and the exponents used in the model equations the objectives of this study are 1 to perform a coupled experimental and numerical study of lnapl deposit on the water table in the highly permeable porous media 2 to give insights regarding both the experimental and numerical aspect of the study and 3 to propose a methodology for measuring the unknowns and parameters in the system that are needed to perform such task further in the field scale studies first we explain the governing equations and mathematical aspect of the multiphase flow in porous media for three immiscible fluids following the experimental set up procedure are presented next the modelling aspects and the methodology is presented finally the results of the simulations and the experiments are compared and discussed to evaluate our proposed methodology and its accuracy the modelling aspect of the study result in a simple butuseful and straight forward methodology in the assessment for assessing the lnapl movement induced by the fluctuation of the water table this work can be regarded as a preliminary study towards more applied and larger scale studies of such procedure for sustainable groundwater management and prevention of napl contamination in the vadose zone 2 mathematical formulations and numerical model 2 1 governing differential equations and constitutive relationship the flow of multiple immiscible fluid phases in porous media for low reynolds number is governed by darcy s law eq 1 and the mass balance equation eq 2 for each phase as following bear 1988 1 v α ρ α k ij k r α μ α p α ρ α g z α w n g 2 ø ρ α s α t

where s w s o and s g are respectively the water oil i e lnapl and gas i e air saturations the relative permeability of the three phases have been calculated using the stone i model stone 1970 based

phase system the values of the parameters are reported in table 4 the system of equations and the constitutive relations expressed in eqs 1 to 17 and the eqs a1 to a 6 for the detailed derivation of equations in the stone i model contain unknown residual saturations that need to be identified so the three phase flow system of equations to be correctly applied the bulk permittivity measured by the tdr probes in the tank at different locations can be translated into phase saturation the crim model for multi phase dielectric permittivity birchak et al 1974 roth et al 1990 knight and endres 1990

media used in our experimental set up and will be referred to as gb from this point forward 2 2 numerical simulation tool comsol multiphysics the system of partial differential equations and constituitive relationships of the three phase flow in this work i e eq 1 to eq 23 are discretized and solved using conforming finite element simulator of comsol multiphysics simply referred to as comsol from this point forward comsol has been used in the modelling of two phase flow in porous media previously by the authors of the present study and has shown to be effective in handling simulations of coupled flow and transport in porous media both in small field scale studies and simulation of the experimental set ups it has rarely been applied on studies involving three phase flow in porous media in this study as stated before stone i model has been applied to the discussed problem and the results are validated and briefly discussed eqs 1 to 23 are discretized and simulated using comsol multiphysics the boundary conditions used in the simulations are described schematically in the fig 1a the simulations has been done in two dimensional domain due to the configuration of the flow that makes it negligible to consider the third dimension the measured properties of the fluid and porous media are specified in table 1 3 experimental material and methods a rectangular cuboidal tank with lower off plane thickness 50 cm 30 cm 7 cm called the 2d tank made from polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf is used for performing the experiments the 2d tank consists of a central reservoir that is the control volume of the experiment and is filled with glass beads gb before the fluid phases configuration are added there are two side channels on the left and the right of the 2d tank i e the counter channels for regulating the fluid level through the experiments as well as imposing a piezometric gradient when needed a highly permeable metallic grid separates the counter channels and the central reservoir five injection pumping nozzles located at the bottom side of the central reservoir allowing for imposing various flow boundary conditions the front face of the 2d tank is made from a 1 cm thick glass which allows the photographs to be taken from the process of the fluid flow this 2d tank has been already used for different studies from the authors see colombano et al 2020 colombano et al 2021a 2021b philippe et al 2021 koohbor et al 2022 and due to its previous preparation for measuring permittivity and resistivity it was suitable for the project in this study the 2d tank is equipped with 15 tdr probes at different locations to measure the bulk permittivity of the medium at the adjacent points a campbell cr 1000 data logger is used to acquire and save the relative permittivity the relative permittivity can be converted to the phase saturation by eq 19 the use of tdr probes is advantageous for monitoring the phase transport for different points in the 2d tanks and validating the results obtained by the photographs the measured permittivity also allows calculating the residual saturation of different fluid phases the process of acquiring the residual saturation from tdr results are explained in further sections a watson marlow 530 u peristaltic pump was used for drainage and imbibition conditions from the nozzles the injected or recovered fluid were placed direction into a beaker on a precision balance sartorius cubis mse8201s 000 d0 5 kg 10 mg connected to a computer for storing and monitoring the recovered mass continuously through the experiment a 34 m pixel 7360 4912 nikon ds10 digital camera equipped with a nikkor lens 105 nikon was used to take pictures in every step of the experiment two 500 w broncolor projectors were used for light adjustment and improving the brightness of the pictures the imaging system and the light adjustment equipment were set in a way to avoid reflection of the surrounding and to optimize the contrast that is required for the interpretation for later calibration of the light and color and potential minor changes throughout the experiments one color scale and one gray scale were used constantly during the experiment and another color scale was used at the beginning and at the end of each experimental scenario the pictures are analyzed by imagej image processing program to determine the saturation of water and lnapl at every time step of the experiment for more details regarding the image processing practice and theory of the authors in previous works the image interpretation is based on the optical density of reflected light stimson 1974 schincariol et al 1993 flores et al 2011 and the determination of relationships between the optical density of each phase saturation colombano et al 2020 colombano et al 2021a 2021b philippe et al 2021 prior to imbibition and drainage scenarios 2d tank should be set to the initial conditions first the reservoir is filled and packed in gradual steps of 2 3 cm with gb and water until 10 cm i e one third of the height of the area of interest see fig 3a the packing should be done in such a way that the trapped air bubbles in the system be minimized if not completely vanished similarly the next 10 cm is gradually filled and packed with gb and commercial gasoil i e lnapl phase fig 3b the top 10 cm is only filled and packed with gb i e the air phase part of the tank the schematic initial conditions can be seen in fig 3c each experimental series start by an imbibition scenario the water is injected from the five nozzles at the bottom of the 2d tank with constant flowrate 20 ml min 1 see fig 4a and b until the tank is filled up until two third with water and one third with lnapl see fig 4c throughout the imbibition photographs are taken from the evolution of the phase transport see fig 5 simultaneously to each photo tdr probes measure the permittivity evolution of their surrounding points the results of the analyzed photos and the permittivity evolutions are later compared and discussed after each imbibition water is pumped out from the five nozzles at a constant flowrate of 20 ml min 1 i e re 0 026 which is in the darcy flow region see fig 4d to f until the 2d tank reaches a state resembling the initial conditions however the top and the middle layers now have residual saturations of lnapl and water respectively photos are taken and bulk permittivity is measured in the drainage process as in the imbibition process see fig 5 the process is repeated for minimization of the errors and then checked for validity the same procedure of imbibition and drainage is performed and repeated for three scenarios with different configuration of porous media diameter size and top layer water saturation the scenarios are as follows 1 1 0 15 mm gb dry top layer the tank is filled with uniform size glass beads 1 mm in diameter and the top layer is kept dry in the beginning of the experiment 2 0 5 0 1 mm gb dry top layer the tank is filled with uniform size glass beads 0 5 mm in diameter and the top layer is kept dry in the beginning of the experiment 3 1 0 15 mm gb wet top layer the tank is filled with uniform size glass beads 1 mm in diameter and the top layer has been previously humidified sw 0 11 to mimic the conditions of the top layer of the soil after a rain event the scenario is chosen and studied also due to the three phase flow nature of the flow in the top layer during the imbibition and drainage process 4 results and discussions 4 1 the imbibition drainage image results figure 5 shows examples of images taken at different steps of the experiment for an imbibition and a drainage scenario for three different experimental runs it can be seen that the water table stays quite horizontal through the course of the experiment for the imbibition drainage scenarios fig 5a and f are analogous to the initial conditions shown in fig 5d and e respectively fig 5c and h are respectively the final point of the imbibition and drainage for the 1 mm gb scenario it can be seen that the color of the blue in the middle layer differs than the color of the blue at the bottom layer of the tank which is attributed to the residual lnapl in this layer the final stage of imbibition are drainage for the second i e 0 5 mm gb with dry top layer and third i e 1 mm gb with wet top layer scenarios are seen respectively in fig 5e and j also in fig 5h the color of the lnapl seems to have a greenish shade which can be attributed to the residual saturation of the water that stays in the middle layer after one cycle of imbibition drainage the values of the residual saturations can be obtained by the results of the bulk permittivity measured by the tdr probes the measurements and the values are presented in the next section fig 6 shows the zoomed pictures along with their schematic representation of how different phases in various sections are observed through the experiment fig 6a refers to the locations where the porous media is saturated with water however due to previous conditions there is a residual lnapl saturation two phase with water and lnapl in fig 5c d f etc the middle layer has this condition fig 6b refers to where the porous media is saturated with lnapl when there is a residual water saturation two phase with water and lnapl in fig 5h i j etc the middle layer has this condition fig 6c represents where the top layer has a residual or close to residual saturation of water two phase air and water there is no equivalent in the fig 5 for this condition however it can be inferred that this is the initial conditions for the third scenario 1 mm wet top layer before the first imbibition cycle starts in real field applications this can refer to the condition when the soil is moist due to a recent light rain fig 6d refers to where the three phases of water lnapl and air are present in the voids this can be seen in the top layers in figs 5e just after the imbibition step leading to the dominant saturation of lnapl and relative residual saturations of water and air 4 2 permittivity measurements and estimation of residual saturation the tdr probes are used to measure the bulk permittivity in 15 different points in the 2d tank tdrs 1 to 5 on the top layer tdrs 6 to 10 in the middle layer and tdrs 11 to 15 on the bottom layer of the tank see fig 2c the tdr probes measure and register the relative bulk permittivity of their adjacent points at constant time steps during the experiment fig 7 shows the results of the relative permittivity measurements for the middle layer in the first imbibition drainage for the 1 mm gb dry top layer applying the crim model i e eq 24 on the results of bulk permittivity one can estimate the saturation of each phase at different times during the process of the experiment first the intrinsic permittivity of the fluid phases air water lnapl should be measure before the start of the experiment which can be easily done by putting a tdr probe inside a beaker filled with either of this fluid phases for obvious reasons for measuring the air permittivity is done by measuring the tdr measurements in contact with air then for measuring the intrinsic permittivity of the glass beads a beaker is filled with packed glass beads and air phase and the permittivity is measured knowing the porosity the intrinsic permittivity of glass beads are extracted from the crim model table 2 shows the values of the relative permittivity of the three fluid phase and the solid phase having the relative permittivity of each of the phases in the system we can use crim model and translate permittivity of each point into saturation of the fluid phases around each tdr probe considering that for the different scenarios imbibition drainage procedure in this study there is no lateral variation we express the average saturation i e analogous to average bulk permittivity in the five tdr probes in each layer i e top layer middle layer and bottom layer doing so has the advantage of calculation of one distinct value for the residual saturation of each changing phase in the studied layers fig 8a c and e show the evolution of saturation of each phase in the top layer for the three scenarios respectively and fig 8b d and f show the evolution of saturation of each phase in the middle layer for the three scenarios respectively because the bottom layer stays fully saturated with water we have no water saturation variation hence this layer has not been represented in this study and the area of interest are chosen to be the top and the middle layer the plots in fig 8 can be used to interpret the residual saturation of each phase in different layers through the process of the experiment by calculating the difference of the phase saturation in the beginning of the imbibition and at the end of drainage the calculated values for the residual saturations of air and lnapl in the top layer and water and lnapl in the middle layer for each changing phase can be seen in table 3 the values of residual saturation obtained by the tdr probes are essential in the process of simulation see table 3 4 3 validation of the numerical simulations with the experimental results the values of the entry pressures p d wo and p d og and n wo and n og in the stone i model exponents needed for the simulation are estimated using the parameter estimation module of comsol and the results of experiments the estimated values are given in table 4 figure 9 shows the results of the simulations for the three experimental scenarios through the imbibition drainage procedure the results of the simulation and the experiments are compatible and the simulation mimics the general behavior of the three phase flow quite well during the drainage step of the experiments it can be seen that the color of the lnapl porous media bulk mixture has a blue shadow which is related to the residual water saturation that coats the porous media similar to what has been shown in figs 5d and 6b the simulations also show similar results indicating that the stone i model has accounted well for the residual saturation of the water in the top part of the 2d tank we can also see that in the imbibition process the lnapl color map experiences a higher brightness accounting for the residual air saturation both in the simulations and the experimental results overall look over the different parts of fig 9 shows that the combination of stone i in comsol i e through user definition and accounting for stabilization of the oscillations that can occur is a simple process with enough descriptive aspects to be applied on the future simulations of lnapl deposit movement in porous media due to the water table fluctuation the spatial distribution of the phases saturation in fig 9 is interesting and shows that the model generate the same conditions and mimics the general phase evolution however it is not enough for quantitative assessment purposes for the validation of the results of the temporal evolution of the results of the simulations and the experiment we compared the results obtained by tdr probe in the top middle of the tank tdr 3 and the tdr probe in the middle of the tank tdr 8 for the third scenario i e the top wet soil 1 mm gb scenario interpreted as the phase saturation and the results obtained by the numerical simulation the results are in fig 10 and for the facility of the reader each phase has its corresponding figure and has been compared with the experimental results the results show compatibility and verify the results of the simulation in most cases the relative error is withing the 5 difference except the highly dynamic moment of the phase evolution in the adjacent points of the tdr probe the reasons can be attributed to the difference of flow conditions in the close distance with the tdr related to the installation and the change of boundary conditions at these points that contribute to a slower multiphase flow and resulting in a smoother curve than that of the simulation the other reason is attributed to the precision of the estimated model exponents that impact directly the multiphase flow behavior resulting in a higher error where the temporal gradient of saturation is higher a sensitivity analysis of the exponent accuracy and the phase evolution impacts is proposed regarding this matter in the future works based on the same condition and question the results are promising and show potential for further investigations however there are assumptions and limitations that need to be addressed for the future work in this study the effect of heterogeneity in the porous media is neglected and in order to control the effect of porous media and focus on the applicability of tdr probe measurement on fluid flow modelling in the field scale applications the heterogeneity of the porous media contributes to the complexity of the problem e g the effect of porosity and the relative permeability of the different phases however the presented methodology is capable of taking into account these heterogeneity effects the effect of temperature has not been discussed on the permittivity and the viscosity of the fluids either in order to simplify the methodology in the field applications it is likely that due to the high spatial scales involved in the migration of the three phases there are changes of temperature that can affect the measured values of the permittivity hence the interpretation of the saturation however the tdr probes are equipped with thermometers and can register the temperature in real time during the experimentation process both in the lab scale studies and in the field so the effect of temperature be calibrated there are other simplifying assumptions including the effect of water saturation variability and the oil wet porous media however they are out of the context of this study 5 conclusion and summary as an attempt to understand the lnapl deposit movement due to water table fluctuation and parameter estimation of the three phase flow model i e stone i model a series of controlled tests are performed on a 30 cm 50 cm 7 cm rectangular tank called the 2d tank fifteen tdr probes i e three rows of five are installed in different parts of the tank allowing to measure the permittivity of the bulk mixture of fluid i e three phase and porous media the tank is filled with artificial glass beads representing the uniform size porous media by injecting and draining water from the bottom of the 2d tank various conditions mimicking the movement of lnapl i e gasoil here contamination distribution on the water table are investigated the bulk permittivity is then translated into saturation using the crim model the residual saturations of the each phase then is easily calculated and can be directly used in the simulations also the tdrs can be used to show the temporal evolution of phases in each part of the tank due to the water table fluctuation the temporal saturation interpretation of the permittivity results then can be used to validate and also estimate the parameters of the simulations the process of the experiments are abstracted through the multiphase flow in porous media and simulated by applying stone i model into comsol multiphysics the numerous parameters needed to the results of the simulations are in well accordance with the experiments and show that using the stone i model for the three phase flow that do not require extreme considerations and exact behavior of the fluid flow is advantageous and feasible through comsol in addition the parameter estimation of the comsol is used to better refine the parameters used in the stone i model by inverse modelling the results of the experiment to the required parameters and exponents the fore mentioned combination can have the advantage of both simplicity in application and the descriptive capabilities needed for a relatively simple series of simulations the present study can be regarded as a preliminary study related to the effect of water table fluctuation on the lnapl deposits in highly permeable soils i e clean and coarser sands or silt in the field the methodology and the combination of tools in the study that is the use of tdr probes for extracting the residual saturation and the validation results and also the simulation and inverse modelling using comsol multiphysics can give valuable insights and invokes important considerations before the study can be applied on the field scale study the methodology proposed in the present study is a practical framework for using tdr probes to measure the temporal and spatial phase evolution of water lnapl air in the vadose zone i e three phase flow in porous media in both lab scale and field scale studies the measured permittivity can be interpreted as the phase saturation and the phase saturation can be used both for inverse modelling and parameter estimation needed for the process of three phase flow simulation and in addition for validation of the results the present study has been performed in laboratory under controlled conditions to enable the authors to focus on the fluid phase evolution and exempt the result from the field ambient conditions as much as possible however in order to be able to directly apply the methodology and findings of this study to real world field scale studies additional research studies are advised first a coupled thermos hydro chemical coupled experimental numerical study with the same setting i e 2d tank equipped with tdr probes or similar setting is proposed to study the effect of temperature changes mimicking the daily and seasonal temperature changes and their effect on the permittivity measured by the tdr probes in addition a series of global sensitivity is advised on the stone i model parameters interpreted by the permittivity evolution and quantifying the experimental errors that can affect the results of the simulations finally a numerical artifact designed with better adjusted characteristics and open source for global use is advised to be developed for such studies

1194,light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl flow on the water table is highly mobile and is sensitive to the fluctuation of groundwater this process is highly complex and involves the migration of three immiscible phases i e water lnapl and air which need the explicit definition of multiple parameters a coupled experimental and numerical simulation methodology is performed by using time domain reflectrometer tdr and multiphase simulation of a controlled environment to mimic the water table fluctuation and its effect on the lnapl residual saturation tdr probes are installed in different locations of a 2d tank i e a cuboid box with relatively low off plane thickness and the bulk permittivity of the phases are measured through artificially imposed boundary conditions the bulk permittivity is then translated into saturation of the three different phases the translated residual saturations along with the previously measured porous media properties e g porosity and saturated permeability are then inserted into the numerical simulator i e comsol multiphysics and the migration of the three phase in porous media is simulated the numerical exponents and entry pressures needed for the simulation of the multiphase flow are estimated using the temporal experimental values the exponents of water lnapl relative permeability were estimated to be around 2 while the exponents gas lnapl relative permeability were estimated to be closer to 3 the results simulated with the optimized parameters are then evaluated with pictures taken from the transparent face of the 2d tank different stages of the experiment the temporal evolution of different phase saturation has been compared and validated between the experimental results obtained and interpreted by the tdr probe measurements and the simulations the relative error stays in the 5 confidence level for most reported points and only in the highly dynamic flow time steps the error reaches around 12 which are

frequent lnapl contaminations physically and chemically dissimilar fluids e g water and air lnapl form interfaces that prevents fluid mixing investigating among liquids and gas evaluating and remediating the sites contaminated by lnapl is a challenging task exposure to even small amounts of this kind of pollution causes health and ecological risks to the environment mccarthy and johnson 1993 oostrom et al 2007 cavelan et al 2022 remediation of lnapl contaminated sites common in industrial regions esp near the artificial subterranean storages are difficult and expensive as lnapl is a long term source of vapor groundwater and soil contamination in the subsurface zone itrc 2018 lnapl reaching the water table is further complicated by natural water table fluctuation huntley and beckett 2002 chrysikopoulos and lee 1998 understanding the behavior of lnapl movement is not only important for oil production from fractured reservoirs but also it is important for environmental assessment and groundwater quality management as an example the movement can lead to residual saturation of lnapl in soil that can endanger the groundwater resources in for large periods while the classical approaches may not be sufficient for their removal therefore the understanding of the nature of the lnapl deposit movement due to water table fluctuation through experiment and simulation is highly valuable to the environmental scientists and engineers initial studies of lnapl movement in the sub surface stone 1973 include capillary viscous and gravitational forces with lnapl migrating through the vadose zone and spreading pooling over the water table while pressing the capillary fringe when it reaches the saturated zone van geel and sykes 1994a 1994b atteia et al 2019 provided an easy to use model considering the impacts of vertical movement of the lnapl layer and the lnapl residual saturations for describing and estimating the influence of groundwater table fluctuations on the floating lnapl thickness in a well while in the subsurface lnapl mass is diminished by the natural attenuation processes of dissolution volatilization and biodegradation also knon as natural source zone depletion nszd in some cases nszd is considered more cost effective compared to active remediation of sites contaminated with lnapl sookhak lari et al 2019 listed twenty one physicochemical and microbiological processes driving partitioning and compositional changes of lnapl in the vadose zone and groundwater they reviewed 36 numerical models with the capabilities to simulate these processes understanding lnapl behavior characterization and distribution in the subsurface is essential to manage and make decisions for the lnapl polluted sites with various complexities quantifying the residual mobile and migrating lnapl is key for a successful remediation plan extreme weather events due to global climate change is a new concern for weather vulnerabilities to lnapls contamination from tanks and pipelines epa 2010 the lnapl accumulation at the water table highlights the importance of the study of lnapl fate due to the water table fluctuations cavelan et al 2022 lnapl temporal vertical distribution in the unsaturated and saturated zones changes due to water table fluctuations e g seasonal or tidal numerical study of lnapl migration due to the groundwater table fluctuation though essentially important for sustainable groundwater management is a complex and challenging task this problem involves the proper assessment and simulation of three phase flow in porous media because the pores above the groundwater table are filled with at least three dominantly immiscible phases i e water lnapl and air and this composition can change rapidly and significantly over time and space niessner and helmig 2007 the literature on the modelling of three phase flow in porous media is still relatively limited moortgat et al 2011 part of the difficulty come from the assessment of the relative permeabilities of the three phases and almost all are to some level based on empirical or semi empirical relationships and their limitation regarding the flow and pressure conditions and the underlying heterogeneity should be assessed prior to application mohammdi alamooti et al 2018 in this work we have chosen the stone model stone 1970 1973 proper for the purpose of the simulations the stone model succeeds in delivering the realistic and relatively accurate results and is simple enough to be added to the modelling tool i e comsol multiphysics in this study with great facility and without adding high complexity and nonlinearity to the process of solution however the residual saturation of the different phases should be properly measured before the application of the stone model for this reason a method and the device that can be used for determination of residual saturations for a wide range of flow regimes efficiently and cheaply is of high value and interest time domain reflectometer tdr is an electromagnetic geophysical device that can be used for fluid content and composition as well as some porous media characteristics marr and fairhurst 1999 by sending a fast electric pulse wave and measuring the response of the fluid porous media bulk relative permittivity the bulk permittivity of the solid multifluid phase can be inversely translated into the fluid saturation through complex refractive index model crim model birchak et al 1974 roth et al 1990 endres and knight 1992 it has been shown that by measuring the bulk permittivity of the variably saturated two phase flow in porous media the water content is delivered quite efficiently e g ling et al 2016 tdrs have been previously used to measure the fluid saturation of a two phase napl and water system colombano et al 2021a 2021b philippe et al 2021 davarzani et al 2021 in this work we will use tdr probes to measure different fluid saturation in a three phase fluid system in porous media i e water lnapl and air being the three fluid phases and glass beads being the solid porous phase and use this bulk permittivity to determine the temporal evolution of phase saturation which will later be used in the modelling of the three phase system properties including the residual saturation of each fluid phase and the exponents used in the model equations the objectives of this study are 1 to perform a coupled experimental and numerical study of lnapl deposit on the water table in the highly permeable porous media 2 to give insights regarding both the experimental and numerical aspect of the study and 3 to propose a methodology for measuring the unknowns and parameters in the system that are needed to perform such task further in the field scale studies first we explain the governing equations and mathematical aspect of the multiphase flow in porous media for three immiscible fluids following the experimental set up procedure are presented next the modelling aspects and the methodology is presented finally the results of the simulations and the experiments are compared and discussed to evaluate our proposed methodology and its accuracy the modelling aspect of the study result in a simple butuseful and straight forward methodology in the assessment for assessing the lnapl movement induced by the fluctuation of the water table this work can be regarded as a preliminary study towards more applied and larger scale studies of such procedure for sustainable groundwater management and prevention of napl contamination in the vadose zone 2 mathematical formulations and numerical model 2 1 governing differential equations and constitutive relationship the flow of multiple immiscible fluid phases in porous media for low reynolds number is governed by darcy s law eq 1 and the mass balance equation eq 2 for each phase as following bear 1988 1 v α ρ α k ij k r α μ α p α ρ α g z α w n g 2 ø ρ α s α t

phase system the values of the parameters are reported in table 4 the system of equations and the constitutive relations expressed in eqs 1 to 17 and the eqs a1 to a 6 for the detailed derivation of equations in the stone i model contain unknown residual saturations that need to be identified so the three phase flow system of equations to be correctly applied the bulk permittivity measured by the tdr probes in the tank at different locations can be translated into phase saturation the crim model for multi phase dielectric permittivity birchak et al 1974 roth et al 1990 knight and endres 1990

media used in our experimental set up and will be referred to as gb from this point forward 2 2 numerical simulation tool comsol multiphysics the system of partial differential equations and constituitive relationships of the three phase flow in this work i e eq 1 to eq 23 are discretized and solved using conforming finite element simulator of comsol multiphysics simply referred to as comsol from this point forward comsol has been used in the modelling of two phase flow in porous media previously by the authors of the present study and has shown to be effective in handling simulations of coupled flow and transport in porous media both in small field scale studies and simulation of the experimental set ups it has rarely been applied on studies involving three phase flow in porous media in this study as stated before stone i model has been applied to the discussed problem and the results are validated and briefly discussed eqs 1 to 23 are discretized and simulated using comsol multiphysics the boundary conditions used in the simulations are described schematically in the fig 1a the simulations has been done in two dimensional domain due to the configuration of the flow that makes it negligible to consider the third dimension the measured properties of the fluid and porous media are specified in table 1 3 experimental material and methods a rectangular cuboidal tank with lower off plane thickness 50 cm 30 cm 7 cm called the 2d tank made from polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf is used for performing the experiments the 2d tank consists of a central reservoir that is the control volume of the experiment and is filled with glass beads gb before the fluid phases configuration are added there are two side channels on the left and the right of the 2d tank i e the counter channels for regulating the fluid level through the experiments as well as imposing a piezometric gradient when needed a highly permeable metallic grid separates the counter channels and the central reservoir five injection pumping nozzles located at the bottom side of the central reservoir allowing for imposing various flow boundary conditions the front face of the 2d tank is made from a 1 cm thick glass which allows the photographs to be taken from the process of the fluid flow this 2d tank has been already used for different studies from the authors see colombano et al 2020 colombano et al 2021a 2021b philippe et al 2021 koohbor et al 2022 and due to its previous preparation for measuring permittivity and resistivity it was suitable for the project in this study the 2d tank is equipped with 15 tdr probes at different locations to measure the bulk permittivity of the medium at the adjacent points a campbell cr 1000 data logger is used to acquire and save the relative permittivity the relative permittivity can be converted to the phase saturation by eq 19 the use of tdr probes is advantageous for monitoring the phase transport for different points in the 2d tanks and validating the results obtained by the photographs the measured permittivity also allows calculating the residual saturation of different fluid phases the process of acquiring the residual saturation from tdr results are explained in further sections a watson marlow 530 u peristaltic pump was used for drainage and imbibition conditions from the nozzles the injected or recovered fluid were placed direction into a beaker on a precision balance sartorius cubis mse8201s 000 d0 5 kg 10 mg connected to a computer for storing and monitoring the recovered mass continuously through the experiment a 34 m pixel 7360 4912 nikon ds10 digital camera equipped with a nikkor lens 105 nikon was used to take pictures in every step of the experiment two 500 w broncolor projectors were used for light adjustment and improving the brightness of the pictures the imaging system and the light adjustment equipment were set in a way to avoid reflection of the surrounding and to optimize the contrast that is required for the interpretation for later calibration of the light and color and potential minor changes throughout the experiments one color scale and one gray scale were used constantly during the experiment and another color scale was used at the beginning and at the end of each experimental scenario the pictures are analyzed by imagej image processing program to determine the saturation of water and lnapl at every time step of the experiment for more details regarding the image processing practice and theory of the authors in previous works the image interpretation is based on the optical density of reflected light stimson 1974 schincariol et al 1993 flores et al 2011 and the determination of relationships between the optical density of each phase saturation colombano et al 2020 colombano et al 2021a 2021b philippe et al 2021 prior to imbibition and drainage scenarios 2d tank should be set to the initial conditions first the reservoir is filled and packed in gradual steps of 2 3 cm with gb and water until 10 cm i e one third of the height of the area of interest see fig 3a the packing should be done in such a way that the trapped air bubbles in the system be minimized if not completely vanished similarly the next 10 cm is gradually filled and packed with gb and commercial gasoil i e lnapl phase fig 3b the top 10 cm is only filled and packed with gb i e the air phase part of the tank the schematic initial conditions can be seen in fig 3c each experimental series start by an imbibition scenario the water is injected from the five nozzles at the bottom of the 2d tank with constant flowrate 20 ml min 1 see fig 4a and b until the tank is filled up until two third with water and one third with lnapl see fig 4c throughout the imbibition photographs are taken from the evolution of the phase transport see fig 5 simultaneously to each photo tdr probes measure the permittivity evolution of their surrounding points the results of the analyzed photos and the permittivity evolutions are later compared and discussed after each imbibition water is pumped out from the five nozzles at a constant flowrate of 20 ml min 1 i e re 0 026 which is in the darcy flow region see fig 4d to f until the 2d tank reaches a state resembling the initial conditions however the top and the middle layers now have residual saturations of lnapl and water respectively photos are taken and bulk permittivity is measured in the drainage process as in the imbibition process see fig 5 the process is repeated for minimization of the errors and then checked for validity the same procedure of imbibition and drainage is performed and repeated for three scenarios with different configuration of porous media diameter size and top layer water saturation the scenarios are as follows 1 1 0 15 mm gb dry top layer the tank is filled with uniform size glass beads 1 mm in diameter and the top layer is kept dry in the beginning of the experiment 2 0 5 0 1 mm gb dry top layer the tank is filled with uniform size glass beads 0 5 mm in diameter and the top layer is kept dry in the beginning of the experiment 3 1 0 15 mm gb wet top layer the tank is filled with uniform size glass beads 1 mm in diameter and the top layer has been previously humidified sw 0 11 to mimic the conditions of the top layer of the soil after a rain event the scenario is chosen and studied also due to the three phase flow nature of the flow in the top layer during the imbibition and drainage process 4 results and discussions 4 1 the imbibition drainage image results figure 5 shows examples of images taken at different steps of the experiment for an imbibition and a drainage scenario for three different experimental runs it can be seen that the water table stays quite horizontal through the course of the experiment for the imbibition drainage scenarios fig 5a and f are analogous to the initial conditions shown in fig 5d and e respectively fig 5c and h are respectively the final point of the imbibition and drainage for the 1 mm gb scenario it can be seen that the color of the blue in the middle layer differs than the color of the blue at the bottom layer of the tank which is attributed to the residual lnapl in this layer the final stage of imbibition are drainage for the second i e 0 5 mm gb with dry top layer and third i e 1 mm gb with wet top layer scenarios are seen respectively in fig 5e and j also in fig 5h the color of the lnapl seems to have a greenish shade which can be attributed to the residual saturation of the water that stays in the middle layer after one cycle of imbibition drainage the values of the residual saturations can be obtained by the results of the bulk permittivity measured by the tdr probes the measurements and the values are presented in the next section fig 6 shows the zoomed pictures along with their schematic representation of how different phases in various sections are observed through the experiment fig 6a refers to the locations where the porous media is saturated with water however due to previous conditions there is a residual lnapl saturation two phase with water and lnapl in fig 5c d f etc the middle layer has this condition fig 6b refers to where the porous media is saturated with lnapl when there is a residual water saturation two phase with water and lnapl in fig 5h i j etc the middle layer has this condition fig 6c represents where the top layer has a residual or close to residual saturation of water two phase air and water there is no equivalent in the fig 5 for this condition however it can be inferred that this is the initial conditions for the third scenario 1 mm wet top layer before the first imbibition cycle starts in real field applications this can refer to the condition when the soil is moist due to a recent light rain fig 6d refers to where the three phases of water lnapl and air are present in the voids this can be seen in the top layers in figs 5e just after the imbibition step leading to the dominant saturation of lnapl and relative residual saturations of water and air 4 2 permittivity measurements and estimation of residual saturation the tdr probes are used to measure the bulk permittivity in 15 different points in the 2d tank tdrs 1 to 5 on the top layer tdrs 6 to 10 in the middle layer and tdrs 11 to 15 on the bottom layer of the tank see fig 2c the tdr probes measure and register the relative bulk permittivity of their adjacent points at constant time steps during the experiment fig 7 shows the results of the relative permittivity measurements for the middle layer in the first imbibition drainage for the 1 mm gb dry top layer applying the crim model i e eq 24 on the results of bulk permittivity one can estimate the saturation of each phase at different times during the process of the experiment first the intrinsic permittivity of the fluid phases air water lnapl should be measure before the start of the experiment which can be easily done by putting a tdr probe inside a beaker filled with either of this fluid phases for obvious reasons for measuring the air permittivity is done by measuring the tdr measurements in contact with air then for measuring the intrinsic permittivity of the glass beads a beaker is filled with packed glass beads and air phase and the permittivity is measured knowing the porosity the intrinsic permittivity of glass beads are extracted from the crim model table 2 shows the values of the relative permittivity of the three fluid phase and the solid phase having the relative permittivity of each of the phases in the system we can use crim model and translate permittivity of each point into saturation of the fluid phases around each tdr probe considering that for the different scenarios imbibition drainage procedure in this study there is no lateral variation we express the average saturation i e analogous to average bulk permittivity in the five tdr probes in each layer i e top layer middle layer and bottom layer doing so has the advantage of calculation of one distinct value for the residual saturation of each changing phase in the studied layers fig 8a c and e show the evolution of saturation of each phase in the top layer for the three scenarios respectively and fig 8b d and f show the evolution of saturation of each phase in the middle layer for the three scenarios respectively because the bottom layer stays fully saturated with water we have no water saturation variation hence this layer has not been represented in this study and the area of interest are chosen to be the top and the middle layer the plots in fig 8 can be used to interpret the residual saturation of each phase in different layers through the process of the experiment by calculating the difference of the phase saturation in the beginning of the imbibition and at the end of drainage the calculated values for the residual saturations of air and lnapl in the top layer and water and lnapl in the middle layer for each changing phase can be seen in table 3 the values of residual saturation obtained by the tdr probes are essential in the process of simulation see table 3 4 3 validation of the numerical simulations with the experimental results the values of the entry pressures p d wo and p d og and n wo and n og in the stone i model exponents needed for the simulation are estimated using the parameter estimation module of comsol and the results of experiments the estimated values are given in table 4 figure 9 shows the results of the simulations for the three experimental scenarios through the imbibition drainage procedure the results of the simulation and the experiments are compatible and the simulation mimics the general behavior of the three phase flow quite well during the drainage step of the experiments it can be seen that the color of the lnapl porous media bulk mixture has a blue shadow which is related to the residual water saturation that coats the porous media similar to what has been shown in figs 5d and 6b the simulations also show similar results indicating that the stone i model has accounted well for the residual saturation of the water in the top part of the 2d tank we can also see that in the imbibition process the lnapl color map experiences a higher brightness accounting for the residual air saturation both in the simulations and the experimental results overall look over the different parts of fig 9 shows that the combination of stone i in comsol i e through user definition and accounting for stabilization of the oscillations that can occur is a simple process with enough descriptive aspects to be applied on the future simulations of lnapl deposit movement in porous media due to the water table fluctuation the spatial distribution of the phases saturation in fig 9 is interesting and shows that the model generate the same conditions and mimics the general phase evolution however it is not enough for quantitative assessment purposes for the validation of the results of the temporal evolution of the results of the simulations and the experiment we compared the results obtained by tdr probe in the top middle of the tank tdr 3 and the tdr probe in the middle of the tank tdr 8 for the third scenario i e the top wet soil 1 mm gb scenario interpreted as the phase saturation and the results obtained by the numerical simulation the results are in fig 10 and for the facility of the reader each phase has its corresponding figure and has been compared with the experimental results the results show compatibility and verify the results of the simulation in most cases the relative error is withing the 5 difference except the highly dynamic moment of the phase evolution in the adjacent points of the tdr probe the reasons can be attributed to the difference of flow conditions in the close distance with the tdr related to the installation and the change of boundary conditions at these points that contribute to a slower multiphase flow and resulting in a smoother curve than that of the simulation the other reason is attributed to the precision of the estimated model exponents that impact directly the multiphase flow behavior resulting in a higher error where the temporal gradient of saturation is higher a sensitivity analysis of the exponent accuracy and the phase evolution impacts is proposed regarding this matter in the future works based on the same condition and question the results are promising and show potential for further investigations however there are assumptions and limitations that need to be addressed for the future work in this study the effect of heterogeneity in the porous media is neglected and in order to control the effect of porous media and focus on the applicability of tdr probe measurement on fluid flow modelling in the field scale applications the heterogeneity of the porous media contributes to the complexity of the problem e g the effect of porosity and the relative permeability of the different phases however the presented methodology is capable of taking into account these heterogeneity effects the effect of temperature has not been discussed on the permittivity and the viscosity of the fluids either in order to simplify the methodology in the field applications it is likely that due to the high spatial scales involved in the migration of the three phases there are changes of temperature that can affect the measured values of the permittivity hence the interpretation of the saturation however the tdr probes are equipped with thermometers and can register the temperature in real time during the experimentation process both in the lab scale studies and in the field so the effect of temperature be calibrated there are other simplifying assumptions including the effect of water saturation variability and the oil wet porous media however they are out of the context of this study 5 conclusion and summary as an attempt to understand the lnapl deposit movement due to water table fluctuation and parameter estimation of the three phase flow model i e stone i model a series of controlled tests are performed on a 30 cm 50 cm 7 cm rectangular tank called the 2d tank fifteen tdr probes i e three rows of five are installed in different parts of the tank allowing to measure the permittivity of the bulk mixture of fluid i e three phase and porous media the tank is filled with artificial glass beads representing the uniform size porous media by injecting and draining water from the bottom of the 2d tank various conditions mimicking the movement of lnapl i e gasoil here contamination distribution on the water table are investigated the bulk permittivity is then translated into saturation using the crim model the residual saturations of the each phase then is easily calculated and can be directly used in the simulations also the tdrs can be used to show the temporal evolution of phases in each part of the tank due to the water table fluctuation the temporal saturation interpretation of the permittivity results then can be used to validate and also estimate the parameters of the simulations the process of the experiments are abstracted through the multiphase flow in porous media and simulated by applying stone i model into comsol multiphysics the numerous parameters needed to the results of the simulations are in well accordance with the experiments and show that using the stone i model for the three phase flow that do not require extreme considerations and exact behavior of the fluid flow is advantageous and feasible through comsol in addition the parameter estimation of the comsol is used to better refine the parameters used in the stone i model by inverse modelling the results of the experiment to the required parameters and exponents the fore mentioned combination can have the advantage of both simplicity in application and the descriptive capabilities needed for a relatively simple series of simulations the present study can be regarded as a preliminary study related to the effect of water table fluctuation on the lnapl deposits in highly permeable soils i e clean and coarser sands or silt in the field the methodology and the combination of tools in the study that is the use of tdr probes for extracting the residual saturation and the validation results and also the simulation and inverse modelling using comsol multiphysics can give valuable insights and invokes important considerations before the study can be applied on the field scale study the methodology proposed in the present study is a practical framework for using tdr probes to measure the temporal and spatial phase evolution of water lnapl air in the vadose zone i e three phase flow in porous media in both lab scale and field scale studies the measured permittivity can be interpreted as the phase saturation and the phase saturation can be used both for inverse modelling and parameter estimation needed for the process of three phase flow simulation and in addition for validation of the results the present study has been performed in laboratory under controlled conditions to enable the authors to focus on the fluid phase evolution and exempt the result from the field ambient conditions as much as possible however in order to be able to directly apply the methodology and findings of this study to real world field scale studies additional research studies are advised first a coupled thermos hydro chemical coupled experimental numerical study with the same setting i e 2d tank equipped with tdr probes or similar setting is proposed to study the effect of temperature changes mimicking the daily and seasonal temperature changes and their effect on the permittivity measured by the tdr probes in addition a series of global sensitivity is advised on the stone i model parameters interpreted by the permittivity evolution and quantifying the experimental errors that can affect the results of the simulations finally a numerical artifact designed with better adjusted characteristics and open source for global use is advised to be developed for such studies
