14860,greywater is an attractive source for water reuse at the household or building level particularly for non potable applications two greywater treatment approaches are membrane bioreactors mbr and moving bed biofilm reactors mbbr yet their performance has not been compared so far within their respective treatment flowsheets including post disinfection two lab scale treatment trains were operated on synthetic greywater a mbr with either polymeric chlorinated polyethylene c pe 165 days or ceramic silicon carbide sic 199 days membranes coupled with uv disinfection and b single stage 66 days or two stage 124 days mbbr coupled with an electrochemical cell ec for in situ disinfectant generation water quality was constantly monitored and escherichia coli log removals were assessed through spike tests under low flux operation of the mbr 8 l m 2 h 1 the sic membranes delayed the onset of membrane fouling and needed less frequent cleaning compared to c pe membranes both treatment systems met most water quality requirements for unrestricted greywater reuse at a 10 fold lower reactor volume for the mbr than the mbbr however neither the mbr nor the two staged mbbr allowed adequate nitrogen removal and the mbbr did not consistently meet effluent chemical oxygen demand and turbidity requirements both ec and uv provided non detectable e coli concentrations in the effluent although the ec provided residual disinfection scaling and fouling decreased its energetic and disinfection performance over time making it less efficient than uv disinfection several outlines to improve the performance of both treatment trains and disinfection processes are proposed thus allowing a fit for use approach that leverages the advantages of the respective treatment trains results from this investigation will assist in elucidating the most efficient robust and low maintenance technology and configurations for small scale greywater treatment for reuse graphical abstract image

sustainable water management is increasingly challenged by urban densification population increase and climate change pikaar et al 2022 moreover water scarcity negatively impacts public health food security human rights ecosystems and education which shows the relevance of water system resilience as a critical development goal united nations 2019 potable water and sanitation provision mainly relies on highly centralized treatment plants that demand extensive piping networks to transport large quantities of water over large distances high water transport costs low system resilience and adaptability associated with this approach have led to a growing interest in the decentralization of water management leigh and lee 2019 rabaey et al 2020 decentralized installations can be defined as modularized water management units applied on a small scale i e ranging from households to buildings and communities where collection treatment and discharge or potential water reuse take place near the point of both water demand and wastewater production larsen et al 2013 domestic wastewater can be separated into blackwater faecally contaminated wastewater and greywater to allow for more efficient water reclamation and resource recovery larsen et al 2013 greywater which originates from household applications such as sinks washing machines dishwashers and showers adds up to 75 90 of the total household wastewater produced boano et al 2020 greywater is often considered an attractive resource as it contains only 30 50 of the total organic and 9 20 of the nutrient load of a household larsen et al 2013 it exhibits a lower risk for fecal contamination contributing to higher social acceptance for reuse larsen et al 2016 however greywater treatment often including post disinfection is essential to minimize environmental and human health concerns prior to reuse schoen et al 2018 existing treatment technologies for greywater reuse at a pilot or industrial scale include constructed wetlands rotating biological contactors moving bed biofilm reactors mbbr and membrane bioreactors mbr boano et al 2020 friedler et al 2005 hydraloop systems 2021 wu 2019 amongst these mbr and mbbr are attractive options for greywater treatment within buildings due to their compactness biomass retention mechanisms and robustness to external disturbances barwal and chaudhary 2014 palmarin et al 2020 park et al 2015 despite being commercially implemented limited research is available on the use of mbbr for greywater treatment and reuse chrispim and nolasco 2017 masmoudi jabri et al 2020 mbr treatment however has been reported in a considerable number of studies predominantly applying polymeric membranes wu 2019 these polymeric membranes are most commonly used in large scale mbr treatment systems due to their lower cost relative to ceramic membranes rana and matsuura 2010 conversely the more expensive ceramic membranes are usually reserved for specific applications due to their better chemical and thermal stability gitis and rothenberg 2016 among ceramic membrane materials silicon carbide sic exhibits considerably low maintenance requirements a long lifespan and low fouling susceptibility hofs et al 2011 zsirai et al 2016 in decentralized treatment the ceramic membrane cost becomes low relative to the overall small scale treatment system costs larsen et al 2013 making ceramic membrane based mbrs potentially a robust and highly promising technology to the best of the authors knowledge only a handful of studies are available for the physical treatment of greywater using ceramic membranes ahn et al 1998 bhattacharya et al 2013 das et al 2018 jafari et al 2021 kim and park 2021 only two studies considered the combination with biological treatment as ceramic mbrs using al2o3 microfiltration membranes sun et al 2010 and a low cost microfiltration membrane produced from dried clay soil and rice bran hasan et al 2015 while both studies reported promising removal of organics turbidity and suspended solids the removal of total nitrogen and phosphorus was limited hasan et al 2015 reported that no membrane cleaning was necessary during six months of operation thus no studies have directly compared polymeric and ceramic membranes for the small scale biological treatment of greywater in an mbr nor is there a direct comparison with mbbr for the same greywater influent for the latter limited research is available on greywater treatment in general the post treatment disinfection technologies ultraviolet light uv or electrochemical disinfection by in situ chlorine generation ec have also not been compared on the same greywater effluent for water reclamation in decentralized systems these disinfection approaches differ in susceptibility to the turbidity or composition of the effluent as flow through uv cells can be comparably less effective in the presence of suspended solids friedler et al 2021 the abovementioned critical gaps in knowledge must be filled for the successful selection and implementation of decentralized greywater treatment systems therefore the current investigation studied the treatment of a semi synthetic greywater through compact mbr and mbbr treatment trains polymeric and ceramic membranes were compared for the mbr setup while for the mbbr single and two stage reactors were evaluated the quality of feeds and treated greywater was closely monitored and statistically analysed to study the performance and determine the best system configuration disinfection was investigated through the coupling of mbbr with ec and mbr with uv for long term continuous treatment since the mbr effluent was expected to contain less suspended particles however the disinfection technologies were evaluated on both mbr and mbbr effluent samples the main goal was not to identify the best approach but to assist in elucidating the most convenient i e robust low maintenance efficient technology and configurations for decentralized greywater treatment 2 material and methods 2 1 synthetic greywater composition since real greywater can vary heavily by source and over time synthetic greywater was selected as the feed for both lab scale mbr and mbbr table 1 to represent an average mixed greywater the semi synthetic greywater was composed of a selection of chemical compounds personal care products and detergents and was adjusted from a previously used synthetic composition in industry and further based on general synthetic wastewater risk assessment studies for personal care product use real greywater composition from the literature economic data on detergent use and greywater quantity dependent on source for flanders aiyuk and verstraete 2004 ficheux et al 2019 larsen et al 2013 madsen and miljøstyrelsen 2001 vlaamse milieumaatschappij 2018 section s1 the remainder of the cod and tn not provided by the personal care products and detergents were approximated by adding acetate and ammonium chloride the synthetic greywater was freshly prepared using tap water and analysed as described in section 2 3 2 2 mbr and mbbr setup and operational conditions the mbr was coupled with a uv lamp mbr uv fig 1 a the mbbr with an electrochemical disinfection unit mbbr ec fig 1b during long term operation ensuring both pollutants removal and pathogen inactivation the mbr uv and mbbr ec treatment trains were operated in parallel and in the same room at 22 2 c each treatment train was constructed in technical duplicate plastic drums 60 120 l were used for synthetic greywater storage and mixed using an overhead stirrer with 4 bladed propellers ika eurostar 20 to avoid sedimentation two submerged mbrs each with 10 l of active volume were constructed out of acrylic panels and operated in parallel the reactors were inoculated with activated sludge from a wastewater treatment plant ossemeersen ghent at 1 g l 1 mixed liquor suspended solids mlss the polymeric membranes were flat sheet chlorinated polyethylene c pe membranes kubota japan with a pore size of 0 4 µm a surface area of 0 11 m² and a hydrophilic coating to reduce membrane fouling to compare membrane materials the c pe membranes were replaced after 165 days of operation by flat sheet commercial ceramic membranes sic with a surface area of 0 17 m² a pore size of 0 56 µm and a porosity of 42 the mbr with sic membrane was operated for 190 days two mbbrs with an active volume of 5 l were operated in parallel and were constructed from plastic vessels the mbbrs were followed by a conical settler of 11 l with 7 l of active volume fastbrewing canada the filling ratio of the reactor vessels was 40 using high density polyethylene carriers with a specific surface area of 800 m² m ³ anoxkaldness k5 lund sweden previously used in a full scale mbbr system for decentralized treatment of office greywater a second 5 l stage was added after 66 days to enhance nitrification the mbbrs were operated for a total of 190 days peristaltic pumps watson marlow 530s provided the mbrs with an influent flow rate of 15 ml min 1 effluent recovery of 95 with a resulting membrane flux of 7 8 lmh l m 2 h 1 for the polymeric membranes and 5 1 lmh for the ceramic membranes for membrane relaxation a cycle timer h3cr f omron japan was installed after day 15 and set at 8 min of pumping in a cycle of 10 min the excess water was removed through overflow at a constant water level for sludge wastage for the mbbr peristaltic pumps supplied a constant flow of 8 3 ml min 1 water flowed gravitationally through the mbbr stages until collected in an effluent vessel the transmembrane pressure tmp of the mbr was monitored using a digital manometer dpgw 00 dwyer u s a installed at the water level height the membranes were cleaned when membrane pressure exceeded 100 mbar aside from relaxation polymeric membranes were cleaned through ex situ chemical cleaning i e 2 h of submersion in a 0 75 wt active chlorine solution followed by rinsing or ex situ manual cleaning i e gently wiping the sludge cake layer from the membrane surface to mimic the effects of backwashing since backwashing was not possible with this c pe flat sheet membrane the ceramic membranes were cleaned by brushing off the fouling cake followed by backwashing both mbr and mbbr systems were aerated by aquarium pumps airpump 400 eheim germany for the mbr two bar shaped aeration stones of length 200 mm superfish u k were used per reactor the aeration flow rate was set at 0 5 l o2 min 1 per mbr to obtain dissolved oxygen do concentration of approximately 4 mg l 1 due to a different reactor geometry the mbbr used ball shaped aeration stones at a maximum flow rate of 1 4 l o2 min 1 for carriers suspension with a do of 8 mg l 1 additionally overhead stirrers were required in the first mbbr stage to ensure adequate carrier movement one uv reactor uv c multimax xclear netherlands with a chamber volume of 197 ml was installed per mbr low pressure mercury vapor uv c lamps with a power rating of 9 w and a uv c output of 2 3 w were used tuv pl s 9 w 2p uv c philips netherlands an ec disinfection unit was installed for the mbbrs of which the design is described by mosquera romero et al 2022 briefly a power supply 0 30 v velleman belgium provided a constant current density of 20 a m 2 section s3 to drive chlorine production at the anode in the first chamber based on chloride oxidation the mixed metal oxide anode 8 8 cm ti iro2 disinfected the effluent as it passed through the anodic chamber a stainless steel cathode was used

is termed ammonia removal but this rather indicates ammonia oxidation and should not be directly associated with total nitrogen removal total and volatile suspended solids of the influent and effluent tss and vss and the activated sludge mlss and mlvss were obtained according to standard methods 2540d e the sludge volume index for the settler of the mbbr was determined using an imhoff cone following standard method 2710d apha 2017 the do of the reactors was measured using an ldo10103 do probe hach belgium to corroborate operational difficulties with the presence of certain genera the microbial community on the mbbr carriers was fingerprinted using illumina next generation 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing a single sample from the carriers was collected in both mbbr trains for both stages sample preparation and processing of the amplicon data generated after sample analysis by lgc genomics teddington middlesex uk was performed using the method described by de paepe et al 2017 using the mothur software package v 1 44 3 for rstudio data cleaning was performed by removing known operational errors and identifying outliers using the function tsoutliers from the forecast package v8 20 for rstudio outlier removal was not performed for the effluent for nitrogen tn and nitrogen species turbidity or cod exceptions were made when tn and nitrogen species values could not be

studied with spike tests since synthetic greywater does not usually contain coliforms a concentration of 108 cfu 100 ml 1 of e coli lmg 8063 atcc 8739 as an indicator of total coliforms was spiked to the synthetic greywater influent this is ten fold higher than the maximum reported in the literature table s4 as a worst case scenario the concentration of bacteria in the effluent was measured at 1 1 5 hrt after the spike both mbr and mbbr effluent were evaluated on both disinfection methods macconkey and chromogenic coliform agar were employed to detect total coliforms and e coli based on the agar spread method and the membrane 0 45 µm s pak merck filtration method apha 2017 iso 2014 the analysis was performed in duplicates and with negative blanks the log removal value lrv for both treatment technologies mbr and mbbr and both disinfection technologies uv and ec were obtained the total chlorine and free available chlorine concentrations for the ec were determined with standard methods 4500 cl g apha 2017 using a lightwave ii uv vis spectrophotometer biochrom wpa u k the uv dose was calculated according to the methods in section s4 3 results 3 1 influent synthetic greywater characterization acetate provided 59 of the cod to the fresh synthetic greywater the rest originated from the various personal care products and detergents table 1 s3 the tap water matrix only added a small amount of cod 1 however tap water notably contributed to tn 13 mainly in the form of no3 n table s3 likewise tap water was a major contributor of ions such as k ca2 mg2 no3 n and so4 2 na and cl were mainly provided by the chemical compounds including nacl ammonium almost exclusively 83 originated through the addition of nh4cl the total cod tcod of the influent 379 92 mg l 1 was significantly different from the calculated 516 mg l 1 p 2 10 16 indicating degradation occurring in the feed containers by microorganisms that naturally can thrive in the storage conditions the latter was also confirmed by the increase of influent turbidity during the duration of the experiment additionally the tss and vss concentrations were 0 67 and 0 27 g l 1 respectively indicating the presence of biomass or precipitates the measured tn was also significantly different from the expected values p 3 10 16 the nitrogen was mainly present as organic nitrogen tn all other species and ammonium since no3 n and no2 n were on average only 0 2 and 0 3 mg l 1 respectively phosphate was not consistently detected in the influent 3 2 biological treatment of greywater by mbr and mbbr a comprehensive overview of the data for effluent quality and removal efficiencies for all treatment train configurations is found in tables s5 and s6 an overview of the process efficiency can be seen in fig 2 for a few key parameters cod tn and suspended solids the results are described in more detail in sections 3 2 1 through 3 2 3 3 2 1 cod removal despite the fluctuating influent concentration consistently high cod removal efficiencies were observed for both membrane materials fig 2 an average cod removal of 94 was recorded for the c pe polymeric membranes with a 5 percentile of 89 the sic ceramic membranes exhibited a similar average cod removal of 95 and a 5 percentile of 90 although the two materials have different surface characteristics the cod removal can be mainly attributed to biological degradation due to the high removal efficiency low effluent cod concentrations below 50 mg l 1 were consistently reached with the mbr treatment fig 2 average effluent cod concentrations were 22 mg l 1 for the c pe membranes and 19 mg l 1 for the sic membranes the cod removal efficiency of the mbbr was relatively stable figs 2 and s12 with no observable difference between the duplicates however a decrease in cod removal efficiency of 30 during the first weeks was observed figure s12 which contributes to the high variability seen for the single stage mbbr in fig 2 values around 78 removal were observed after 4 weeks figure s12 adding a second mbbr stage day 66 showed a significant although limited increase in the average cod removal efficiency 86 fig 2 in comparison to the single stage mbbr 78 excluding the initial adaptation period p 4 10 5 which can be explained by the higher hrt of the former the limited increase indicates that the first stage of the treatment system was the major contributor to cod removal while some polishing still occurred in the second stage and most suspended cod biomass were removed by the settler the first stage removed 49 of all cod with values of 11 for the second stage and 40 for the settler still cod removal efficiency could occasionally spike down due to biomass overflow fig 2 3 2 2 nitrogen removal tn removal in the mbr was generally low fig 2 as the aeration created an oxic environment in the reactors preventing denitrification in the mixed liquor the limited nitrogen removal efficiencies observed 40 16 for the c pe and 42 17 for the sic can mainly be attributed to assimilation by heterotrophic microorganisms and subsequent sludge overflow wastage which could be variable fig 2 a statistical comparison between the calculated nitrogen removal by assimilation section s5 1 and the measured nitrogen removal confirmed this on average the tn removal rate for the whole reactor was 0 18 0 05 g n d 1 while the calculated removal rate through immobilization was 0 16 0 03 g n d 1 immobilization thus explains the majority of nitrogen removal although a significant difference was found for the paired samples p 9 10 6 other processes such as denitrification occurring in settled sludge inside the reactor and biofilm attached to the reactor walls may also contribute to the tn removal to a limited extent although the presence of denitrifying genera was not verified the low and variable nh4 n removal efficiency 15 18 of the single stage mbbr combined with low no3 concentrations in the effluent 0 3 g l 1 indicated that nitrification was limited tables s5 and s6 to establish nitrification the mbbr was expanded to a two stage system the effluent concentrations indicated promising nitrification and ammonia removal efficiencies 94 13 nh4 n removal table s6 of all ammonia removal 38 occurred in the first stage 57 in the second stage and 5 in the settler low no2 n concentrations in the effluent suggests that not only ammonia oxidation but also nitrite oxidation consistently occurred this was supported by the presence of ammonia oxidizing genera nitrosospira 0 5 and nitrosomonas 2 as well as nitrite oxidizing candidatus nitrotoga 3 in the second stage of the mbbr figure s14 like the mbr only limited nitrogen removal was observed for the single staged mbbr fig 2 however the mbbr can potentially enable additional denitrification in the anoxic zone of the biofilm tawfik et al 2010 the total nitrogen removal 0 05 0 03 g n d 1 was significantly different p 6 10 13 from the calculated assimilated nitrogen 0 10 0 03 g n d 1 in the single staged mbbr indicating that not all nitrogen assimilation led to nitrogen removal and any denitrification was unlikely this discrepancy mainly occurred during the adjustment period until day 46 the difference decreased after day 46 and yet remained significant p 6 10 6 for the two stage mbbr the overall difference between the nitrogen removal 0 10 0 05 g n d 1 and nitrogen assimilation 0 12 0 02 g n d 1 was still significant p 0 005 for the last 25 days the removal was higher than the assimilation for 54 of all samples compared to 21 before which could indicate denitrification this is further supported by the amplicon sequencing results figure s14 showing the presence of denitrifying genera thauera 0 2 denitratisoma 0 05 and dechloromonas 0 05 in the second stage of the mbbr 3 2 3 removal of suspended solids the tss values of the mbr effluent for both membrane materials were below the detection limit of 0 01 g l 1 additionally high turbidity removals were observed with an average of 97 3 and a 5 percentile of 89 4 for the c pe membranes and an average of 98 7 and a 5 percentile of 96 7 for the sic membranes despite the difference in removal the average turbidity of the c pe and sic effluents was similar 0 64 and 0 66 ntu respectively during the two stage mbbr operation 10 of all samples exhibited high tss concentrations above 50 mg l 1 all during the last 25 days and caused by settling sludge issues related to sludge bulking confirmed by the average sludge volume index of both mbbr duplicates 333 ml g 1 and 215 ml g 1 amplicon sequencing results of the microbial community on the carriers of the first mbbr stage indicate the genera thiothrix 11 35 and sphaerotilus 11 13 as possible filamentous bacteria causing issues later on in the settler floating sludge was frequently observed possibly caused by denitrification in the decanter due to the high nitrate concentrations which also influenced the effluent tss concentrations 3 3 membrane fouling during mbr treatment the compare both membrane materials in terms of maintenance the cleaning frequency and fouling rate of the membranes was investigated an abrupt tmp increase relating to rapid fouling was noticeable after 8 days of c pe mbr operation since membrane relaxation was not yet implemented section 2 2 furthermore the first 72 days were characterized by severe membrane fouling fig 3 a caused by the dispersed and fine nature of mlss contents due to a period with limited access to the lab data is only available for the last 41 days with manual cleaning for the c pe membranes the average frequency of cleaning for the first 72 days was every 4 2 days and for the last 41 days every 5 7 days the sic membranes showed a more gradual increase in tmp during long term operation with the first abrupt increase of tmp after 122 days of operation 51 days of continuous operation fig 3b after day 122 irreversible fouling gradually increased indicated by a continually rising baseline after membrane cleaning fig 3b an average of 10 8 days between manual cleaning for both sic membranes was recorded ranging from 27 days at the first cleaning and 7 by the last cleaning the observed discrepancy in fouling and cleaning requirements can be attributed to three factors lower flux for the sic membranes different pore properties larger pore size of sic membranes and different porosity and pore length and the difference in surface material properties e g composition and roughness excluding effects other than surface material the average linear fouling rate for the polymeric membranes was 13 1011 5 1011 m 1 d 1 for the first 72 days and 4 1011 1 1011 m 1 d 1 for the last 41 days the average linear fouling rate for the ceramic membranes was 8 1011 3 1011 m 1 d 1 3 4 pathogen removal by biological treatments and disinfection units the influent of the mbr and the two stage mbbr systems was spiked with 108 cfu 100 ml 1 e coli to analyze pathogen removal along the treatment train the mbr with polymeric and ceramic membranes showed an lrv of 3 1 3 7 and 2 7 3 0 respectively the lower lrv of ceramic membranes would be due to their larger nominal pore size table 2 and membrane surface defects variable lrv values of 1 2 3 3 were obtained in the effluent of the two stage mbbrs tawfik et al 2010 reported a 2 3 log removal for fecal coliforms in an uasb mbbr setup in which most coliforms were removed in the mbbr step although an mbbr can reduce the e coli concentration in greywater most existing water reuse requirements demand considerably lower coliform concentrations in the effluent thus a disinfection post treatment is needed to ensure safe greywater reuse uv disinfection of the mbr effluents reduced e coli to non detectable levels 1 cfu 100 ml 1 table 3 the uv system section s4 operated under a mean residence time of 11 2 min and a dose of 726 j l 1 at 254 nm due to bioreactor limitations the uv dose provided at the continuous flow rate of 14 25 ml min 1 was more than 10 fold higher than the required dose table s7 which translates to a high energy consumption of 10 5 kwh m 3 37 800 j l 1 large molecules particles or flocs can reduce the effectiveness of uv disinfection or increase the required uv dose friedler et al 2021 nevertheless the results showed complete inactivation of higher e coli effluent concentrations up to 1010 cfu 100 ml 1 at a turbidity of 54 4 ntu i e compared to the unspiked effluent of 0 47 ntu under the same uv reactor conditions resulting in an lrv 10 inactivation of 4 3 5 3 log of e coli was observed when continuously treating mbbr effluents with a cem ec at an hrt of 30 min and a current density of 20 a m 2 the total lrv of the mbbr ec was 7 at a residual chlorine concentration of 0 5 mg cl2 l 1 which was not consistently sufficient to reduce e coli to non detectable levels table 3 under these conditions the ec system s energy use was calculated at 5 kwh m 3 18 000 j l 1 which is particularly high due to the low effluent conductivity 1 ms cm 1 and long hrt due to ec sizing limitations additionally the cell voltage increased after two weeks of operation due to inorganic scaling at the cathode e g caco3 section s3 lastly the elevated tss concentrations in the mbbr effluent caused organic fouling and can react with the active chlorine in turn increasing the internal resistance and decreasing the disinfection efficacy of the ec section s3 the disinfection of the opposite bioreactor effluent was verified under the same operational conditions for the uv and ec the mbbr effluent was successfully disinfected at a uv dose of 726 j l 1 at 254 nm despite containing suspended biomass that could reduce uv effectiveness similarly the ec successfully disinfected mbr effluents and provided residual chlorine of 0 77 mg cl2 l 1 a higher active chlorine production with the mbr effluent supports the idea of suspended organic compounds consuming chlorine in the mbbr effluents 4 comparative analysis and design recommendations for water reclamation 4 1 mbr and mbbr treatment of greywater the effluent quality of the mbr with sic membranes and the two staged mbbr were compared against two recent international standards for unrestricted non potable wastewater reuse table 4 s7 the nitrogen removal for both systems was similarly variable and insufficient to meet the standards table 4 since both systems were continuously aerated no notable denitrification was expected and nitrogen removal occurred mainly through immobilization in biomass section 3 2 2 despite the preference for single volume reactors in decentralized applications due to compactness and reduced complexity a second mbbr stage was required to induce nitrification similarly adding an anoxic stage could allow for denitrification to keep the reactor at a single stage for the mbr several options can be proposed to improve treatment performance which may also be applied to the mbbr for instance intermittent aeration would allow anoxic periods to prevail during operation leading to denitrification however this would impact membrane scouring in the mbr for the mbbr additional stirrers were necessary in any case since bubble aeration was not sufficient to ensure carrier suspension hence reducing aeration would not cause an issue another strategy is the addition of mbbr carriers to the mbr to obtain a hybrid system a moving bed biofilm membrane reactor palmarin et al 2020 allowing denitrification in the anoxic layers of the biofilm on the carriers it is possible that aeration would have to be lowered to enable local anoxia with the same concerns as discussed above but also improve overall energy consumption nevertheless all these modifications would increase system complexity risking increased system costs and points of failure the latter can be counteracted by building in redundancy the mbbr struggled with sludge bulking and overflow in the effluent caused by filamentous bacteria thiotrix and sphaerotilus this contradicts the literature where sludge bulking is generally not a problem with mbbrs chen et al 2008 henriet et al 2017 reported that thiothrix thrives in nutrient deficient wastewater containing high concentrations of low molecular weight fatty acids hence thiothrix growth was stimulated by the addition of acetate as the main carbon source table 1 and a low nutrient to cod ratio indeed the average cod n p ratio was 100 6 5 0 07 which is low compared to the ideal rule of thumb ratio for activated sludge of 100 20 1 however this is not uncommon for greywater typically ranging from as low as 100 1 0 3 to 100 7 2 2 7 table s4 sphaerotilus on the other hand has been reported to grow at low do concentrations and high concentrations of readily biodegradable substrates martins et al 2004 due to the high aeration of the bioreactor section s5 2 oxygen limitation was unlikely poor settling of the sludge was also noticeable for the mbr when temporarily halting aeration although without operational effects due to its reliance on filtration as opposed to gravitational settling however the mbr was not indifferent to sludge quality as rapid fouling development could be observed when the mlss was fine and dispersed at low concentrations fig 3 a possible solution for these sludge issues would be a feast and famine regime where the influent is intermittently fed to the reactors this would be the case in real life scenarios as greywater production is not continuous throughout the day and a small buffer tank would be required to protect the bioreactors indeed an abrupt change in influent composition was followed by a decrease in cod removal efficiency for the mbbr as the biofilm carriers were previously seeded on different greywater section 2 2 the synthetic greywater contains laundry and dishwasher detergent two compounds present in lower concentrations in general wastewater due to dilution that can impact unacclimated microorganisms katam and bhattacharyya 2018 due to sludge bulking in the mbbr high tss values were recorded for samples with excessive biomass overflow coinciding with lower nitrogen and cod removals due to the contribution of biomass to the effluent concentrations the mbr met the effluent turbidity standards while the mbbr did not table 4 and a 9 fold higher average turbidity was observed compared to the mbr the average effluent cod concentration of the mbbr was approximately 2 fold higher than the mbr both systems met the standards on average but the maximum value was occasionally exceeded for the mbbr next to the enhanced tss removal of the mbr the higher cod removal efficiency of the mbr could have been caused by the higher total biomass present in the mbr system as it was more easily controlled through the sludge wastage while the mbbr was uncontrolled with the release of flocs from the carriers without recirculation of settled sludge despite the presence of a dedicated disinfection unit it is worth mentioning that the lrv of the mbr was higher than that of the mbbr table 3 because of the filtration mechanism of the membranes where pathogens are actively filtered out the flow to reactor volume ratio 1 h r t was 1 7 l l 1 d 1 for the mbr and 0 7 l l 1 d 1 for the mbbr including the settler the ratio for the mbr could theoretically be increased to 8 9 2 6 l l 1 d 1 to obtain an mlss concentration of 10 g l 1 under the average synthetic greywater composition section s5 4 similarly for an ideal surface loading rate of 4 g cod m 2 d 1 for the first mbbr stage the ratio could be increased to 1 0 0 2 l l 1 d 1 section s5 2 assuming the current synthetic greywater represents an average real greywater composition and the treatment performance would not be influenced by the proposed flow increases reactor volumes of approximately 7 to 22 l for the mbr and 66 to 202 l for the mbbr would be required to treat an inhabitant equivalent of greywater 63 2 to 193 l p 1 d 1 larsen et al 2013 vlaamse milieumaatschappij 2018 the above results highlight the known advantages of mbr based treatment systems which supports the focus of researchers on mbr rather than mbbr for greywater treatment as noted in the introduction however an important and evident drawback of the mbr is the cost of membranes and maintenance frequency due to membrane fouling relative to the mbbr applying the fit for purpose approach the mbr is most suitable for greywater treatment with unrestricted reuse whereas the mbbr installation allows a low cost and low maintenance treatment option for water reuse purposes with less stringent quality requirements 4 2 ceramic and polymeric membranes for mbr the sic ceramic membranes heavily delayed the initial onset of membrane fouling while fouling was observed much sooner for the c pe polymeric membranes during long term operation the c pe membranes needed cleaning every 5 7 days and the sic every 10 8 days which could partly be explained by the 1 4 times larger pore size of the sic membranes and the difference in surface materials these results align with previous findings on surface water treatment although a large difference in membrane pore size was used previously hofs et al 2011 a lower fouling rate would indeed be expected for the sic membranes as they have high hydrophilicity and a low isoelectric point 2 2 5 although the c pe membranes were also coated with a hydrophilic agent when rapid fouling occurred which can be predominantly ascribed to cake layer filtration the sic membranes fouled at a similar rate to the c pe ones when corrected for differences in pore size membrane area and porosity thus the material has seemingly no effect on the rate of cake layer formation furthermore the larger pore size of the sic membranes can shift the fouling mechanism from cake filtration toward increased pore blocking wang and tarabara 2008 pore blocking is less reversible and would explain the increasing baseline after cleaning the sic membranes including the increasing frequency of cleaning after long term operation the c pe membranes were operated at a higher flux 7 8 lmh than the sic membranes 5 2 lmh which might explain the discrepancy in cleaning frequency and onset of rapid fouling between the two membranes however both membranes were operated at a relatively low flux for conventional mbr which sees typical fluxes of 15 45 lmh park et al 2015 thus the flux was not expected to be higher than the critical flux for immediate rapid fouling it can be anticipated that all membranes will be used at rather low lmh within a decentralized setting due to the saved maintenance costs relative to a centralized large scale system where operational control is far more stringent and capital costs will be more relevant at a small scale with single membrane prices around 50 150 differences in cost would be negligible compared to an overall system cost of e g above 5000 under practical applications frequent and automated backwashing would be incorporated during the operational regime alongside relaxation compared to its use as an occasional physical cleaning method in this study compared to polymeric membranes the flat sheet ceramic membranes were back washable thus posing an advantage for delaying rapid fouling onset and increased time between manual cleanings 4 3 uv and cem ec disinfection of the effluent the uv disinfection and cem ec were compared by evaluating the log removal values lrv and effluent e coli concentrations against the quality requirements table 4 although additional biological indicators are often required such as ms2 coliphage as a viral indicator table s7 both systems met the minimum required lrv but only the uv reached non detectable e coli concentrations the higher removal for the uv was caused by the relatively low flow rates used and thus high uv dose which suggests that pathogen inactivation can still occur if the flow rate is increased to improve the energy use per volume of treated water for the uv which was twice as high compared to the ec the effluent could be stored in a buffer tank for batch uv disinfection at a higher flow rate alternatively more efficient small scale uv led arrays could be used as they require a lower operating voltage and can emit light at 265 nm or 280 nm improving microbial inactivation li et al 2017 the limited removal for the ec was caused by interference of suspended solids and inorganic precipitation to meet the required disinfectant dose for the ec either the contact time or the generated reactive chlorine concentration should be increased ec performance is expected to improve for lower effluent tss concentrations e g under intermittent feeding without bulking sludge as the ec showed a higher lrv and residual chlorine concentration for the mbr effluent based on tss alone the integration of mbr ec could improve the ec performance and energy consumption and the mbbr uv integration is preferred above mbbr ec as the uv disinfection performance seemed less affected by increased turbidity which does not line up with initial expectations based on the literature independent of influent tss levels ca2 and mg2 in both the mbr and mbbr effluent can cause inorganic scaling in the ec due to the alkaline catholyte ph 9 9 0 4 thus while the high salt content of greywater is beneficial for in situ chlorine generation due to higher chloride concentrations high levels of calcium and magnesium should be avoided as they would lead to scaling this scaling has been previously observed for other wastewaters increases internal resistance and thus energy consumption and can be solved by frequent maintenance with an acid wash or by polarity reversal using boron doped diamond electrodes radjenovic and sedlak 2015 another option is avoiding effluent passage through the cathodic chamber and allowing disinfection at quasi neutral ph in the anolyte as demonstrated by mosquera romero et al 2022 it is important to note that possible regrowth of pathogens was not investigated reactivation of pathogens in the case of uv disinfection is possible due to dna repair mechanisms such as photoreactivation and dark repair li et al 2017 during prolonged storage however periodic re disinfection could ensure safety regrowth of pathogens is a lesser concern for the ec due to the presence of residual disinfectant although chlorine tolerant bacteria could be present gupta et al 2022 simultaneous ozone and chlorine production using e g boron doped diamond electrodes could mitigate this tolerance rajab et al 2015 the main concern during disinfection using oxidants remains however the generation of disinfection by products radjenovic and sedlak 2015 which was not evaluated in the current study conclusions and recommendations a single mbr or mbbr reactor volume was insufficient to meet the total nitrogen removal required by international standards for unrestricted urban water reuse other approaches are necessary to enhance nitrogen removal such as intermittent aeration multi stage mbbr or hybrid mbr operating with biofilm carriers for denitrification enhancement because of the greywater composition sludge bulking caused lower cod tss and turbidity removal for the mbbr which hindered it to consistently meet quality standards for water reuse although sludge bulking is not expected under real conditions it indicates a vulnerability of the mbbr towards greywater composition and organics loading for decentralized systems under ideal loading conditions the required theoretical reactor volumes would be 7 22 l p 1 for the mbr and 66 202 l p 1 for the mbbr dependent on the greywater quantity 63 2 to 193 l p 1 d 1 tests with various real greywater supplies could enable the study of variable contaminants and increased organics loading and further assess the effect on mlss concentration of the mbr during low flux mbr operation 8 lmh the sic ceramic membranes delayed the onset of membrane fouling and needed cleaning half as frequently as the c pe polymeric membranes when correcting for pore morphology and membrane area the sic membranes fouled equally as fast incorporating regular backwashing in the operating regime for the sic membranes could enhance their potential for low maintenance both ec and uv could provide the required disinfection dose for e coli inactivation in greywater whilst providing residual chlorine the ec exhibited vulnerability to high tss values and scaling due to precipitation which is linked to the inherent characteristics of greywater being a low nutrient to cod ratio and high salt content the mbr and mbbr treatment trains with either uv or ec disinfection are promising decentralized treatment systems albeit with different water reuse applications following the fit for use approach credit authorship contribution statement seppe ongena formal analysis

14860,greywater is an attractive source for water reuse at the household or building level particularly for non potable applications two greywater treatment approaches are membrane bioreactors mbr and moving bed biofilm reactors mbbr yet their performance has not been compared so far within their respective treatment flowsheets including post disinfection two lab scale treatment trains were operated on synthetic greywater a mbr with either polymeric chlorinated polyethylene c pe 165 days or ceramic silicon carbide sic 199 days membranes coupled with uv disinfection and b single stage 66 days or two stage 124 days mbbr coupled with an electrochemical cell ec for in situ disinfectant generation water quality was constantly monitored and escherichia coli log removals were assessed through spike tests under low flux operation of the mbr 8 l m 2 h 1 the sic membranes delayed the onset of membrane fouling and needed less frequent cleaning compared to c pe membranes both treatment systems met most water quality requirements for unrestricted greywater reuse at a 10 fold lower reactor volume for the mbr than the mbbr however neither the mbr nor the two staged mbbr allowed adequate nitrogen removal and the mbbr did not consistently meet effluent chemical oxygen demand and turbidity requirements both ec and uv provided non detectable e coli concentrations in the effluent although the ec provided residual disinfection scaling and fouling decreased its energetic and disinfection performance over time making it less efficient than uv disinfection several outlines to improve the performance of both treatment trains and disinfection processes are proposed thus allowing a fit for use approach that leverages the advantages of the respective treatment trains results

sustainable water management is increasingly challenged by urban densification population increase and climate change pikaar et al 2022 moreover water scarcity negatively impacts public health food security human rights ecosystems and education which shows the relevance of water system resilience as a critical development goal united nations 2019 potable water and sanitation provision mainly relies on highly centralized treatment plants that demand extensive piping networks to transport large quantities of water over large distances high water transport costs low system resilience and adaptability associated with this approach have led to a growing interest in the decentralization of water management leigh and lee 2019 rabaey et al 2020 decentralized installations can be defined as modularized water management units applied on a small scale i e ranging from households to buildings and communities where collection treatment and discharge or potential water reuse take place near the point of both water demand and wastewater production larsen et al 2013 domestic wastewater can be separated into blackwater faecally contaminated wastewater and greywater to allow for more efficient water reclamation and resource recovery larsen et al 2013 greywater which originates from household applications such as sinks washing machines dishwashers and showers adds up to 75 90 of the total household wastewater produced boano et al 2020 greywater is often considered an attractive resource as it contains only 30 50 of the total organic and 9 20 of the nutrient load of a household larsen et al 2013 it exhibits a lower risk for fecal contamination contributing to higher social acceptance for reuse larsen et al 2016 however greywater treatment often including post disinfection is essential to minimize environmental and human health concerns prior to reuse schoen et al 2018 existing treatment technologies for greywater reuse at a pilot or industrial scale include constructed wetlands rotating biological contactors moving bed biofilm reactors mbbr and membrane bioreactors mbr boano et al 2020 friedler et al 2005 hydraloop systems 2021 wu 2019 amongst these mbr and mbbr are attractive options for greywater treatment within buildings due to their compactness biomass retention mechanisms and robustness to external disturbances barwal and chaudhary 2014 palmarin et al 2020 park et al 2015 despite being commercially implemented limited research is available on the use of mbbr for greywater treatment and reuse chrispim and nolasco 2017 masmoudi jabri et al 2020 mbr treatment however has been reported in a considerable number of studies predominantly applying polymeric membranes wu 2019 these polymeric membranes are most commonly used in large scale mbr treatment systems due to their lower cost relative to ceramic membranes rana and matsuura 2010 conversely the more expensive ceramic membranes are usually reserved for specific applications due to their better chemical and thermal stability gitis and rothenberg 2016 among ceramic membrane materials silicon carbide sic exhibits considerably low maintenance requirements a long lifespan and low fouling susceptibility hofs et al 2011 zsirai et al 2016 in decentralized treatment the ceramic membrane cost becomes low relative to the overall small scale treatment system costs larsen et al 2013 making ceramic membrane based mbrs potentially a robust and highly promising technology to the best of the authors knowledge only a handful of studies are available for the physical treatment of greywater using ceramic membranes ahn et al 1998 bhattacharya et al 2013 das et al 2018 jafari et al 2021 kim and park 2021 only two studies considered the combination with biological treatment as ceramic mbrs using al2o3 microfiltration membranes sun et al 2010 and a low cost microfiltration membrane produced from dried clay soil and rice bran hasan et al 2015 while both studies reported promising removal of organics turbidity and suspended solids the removal of total nitrogen and phosphorus was limited hasan et al 2015 reported that no membrane cleaning was necessary during six months of operation thus no studies have directly compared polymeric and ceramic membranes for the small scale biological treatment of greywater in an mbr nor is there a direct comparison with mbbr for the same greywater influent for the latter limited research is available on greywater treatment in general the post treatment disinfection technologies ultraviolet light uv or electrochemical disinfection by in situ chlorine generation ec have also not been compared on the same greywater effluent for water reclamation in decentralized systems these disinfection approaches differ in susceptibility to the turbidity or composition of the effluent as flow through uv cells can be comparably less effective in the presence of suspended solids friedler et al 2021 the abovementioned critical gaps in knowledge must be filled for the successful selection and implementation of decentralized greywater treatment systems therefore the current investigation studied the treatment of a semi synthetic greywater through compact mbr and mbbr treatment trains polymeric and ceramic membranes were compared for the mbr setup while for the mbbr single and two stage reactors were evaluated the quality of feeds and treated greywater was closely monitored and statistically analysed to study the performance and determine the best system configuration disinfection was investigated through the coupling of mbbr with ec and mbr with uv for long term continuous treatment since the mbr effluent was expected to contain less suspended particles however the disinfection technologies were evaluated on both mbr and mbbr effluent samples the main goal was not to identify the best approach but to assist in elucidating the most convenient i e robust low maintenance efficient technology and configurations for decentralized greywater treatment 2 material and methods 2 1 synthetic greywater composition since real greywater can vary heavily by source and over time synthetic greywater was selected as the feed for both lab scale mbr and mbbr table 1 to represent an average mixed greywater the semi synthetic greywater was composed of a selection of chemical compounds personal care products and detergents and was adjusted from a previously used synthetic composition in industry and further based on general synthetic wastewater risk assessment studies for personal care product use real greywater composition from the literature economic data on detergent use and greywater quantity dependent on source for flanders aiyuk and verstraete 2004 ficheux et al 2019 larsen et al 2013

uv lamp mbr uv fig 1 a the mbbr with an electrochemical disinfection unit mbbr ec fig 1b during long term operation ensuring both pollutants removal and pathogen inactivation the mbr uv and mbbr ec

flat sheet chlorinated polyethylene c pe membranes kubota japan with a pore size of 0 4 µm a surface area of 0 11 m² and a hydrophilic coating to reduce membrane fouling to compare membrane materials

previously used in a full scale mbbr system for decentralized treatment of office greywater a second 5 l stage was added after 66 days to enhance nitrification the mbbrs were operated for a total of 190 days peristaltic pumps watson marlow 530s provided the mbrs with an influent flow rate of 15 ml min 1 effluent recovery of 95 with a resulting membrane flux of 7 8 lmh l m 2 h 1 for the polymeric membranes and 5 1 lmh for the ceramic membranes for membrane relaxation a cycle timer h3cr f omron japan was installed after day 15 and set at 8 min of pumping in a cycle of 10 min the excess water was removed through overflow at a constant water level for sludge wastage for the mbbr peristaltic pumps supplied a constant flow of 8 3 ml min 1 water flowed gravitationally through the mbbr stages until collected in an effluent vessel the transmembrane pressure tmp of the mbr was monitored using a digital manometer dpgw 00 dwyer u s a installed at the water level height the membranes were cleaned when membrane pressure exceeded 100 mbar aside from relaxation polymeric membranes were cleaned through ex situ chemical cleaning i e 2 h of submersion in a 0 75 wt active chlorine solution followed by rinsing or ex situ manual cleaning i e gently wiping the sludge cake layer from the membrane surface to mimic the effects of backwashing since backwashing was not possible with this c pe flat sheet membrane the ceramic membranes were cleaned by brushing off the fouling cake followed by backwashing both mbr and mbbr systems were aerated by aquarium pumps airpump 400 eheim germany for the mbr two bar shaped aeration stones of length 200 mm superfish u k were used per reactor the aeration flow rate was set at 0 5 l o2 min 1 per mbr to obtain dissolved oxygen do concentration of approximately 4 mg l 1 due to a different reactor geometry the mbbr used ball shaped aeration stones at a maximum flow rate of 1 4 l o2 min 1 for carriers suspension with a do of 8 mg l 1 additionally overhead stirrers were required in the first mbbr stage to ensure adequate carrier movement one uv reactor uv c multimax xclear netherlands with a chamber volume of 197 ml was installed per mbr low

studied with spike tests since synthetic greywater does not usually contain coliforms a concentration of 108 cfu 100 ml 1 of e coli lmg 8063 atcc 8739 as an indicator of total coliforms was spiked to the synthetic greywater influent this is ten fold higher than the maximum reported in the literature table s4 as a worst case scenario the concentration of bacteria in the effluent was measured at 1 1

characterization acetate provided 59 of the cod to the fresh synthetic greywater the rest originated from the various personal care products and detergents table 1 s3 the tap water matrix only added a small amount of cod 1 however tap water notably contributed to tn 13 mainly in the form of no3 n table s3 likewise tap water was a major contributor of ions such as k ca2 mg2 no3 n and so4 2 na and cl were mainly provided by the chemical compounds including nacl ammonium almost exclusively 83 originated through the addition of nh4cl the total cod tcod of the influent 379 92 mg l 1 was significantly different from the calculated 516 mg l 1 p 2 10 16 indicating degradation occurring in the feed containers by microorganisms that naturally can thrive in the storage conditions the latter was also confirmed by the increase of influent turbidity during the duration of the experiment additionally the tss and vss concentrations were 0 67 and 0 27 g l 1 respectively indicating the presence of biomass or precipitates the measured tn was also significantly different from the expected values p 3 10 16 the nitrogen was mainly present as organic nitrogen tn all other species and ammonium since no3 n and no2 n were on average only 0 2 and 0 3 mg l 1 respectively phosphate was not consistently detected in the influent 3 2 biological treatment of greywater by mbr and mbbr a comprehensive overview of the data for effluent quality and removal efficiencies for all treatment train configurations is found in tables s5 and s6 an overview of the process efficiency can be seen in fig 2 for a few key parameters cod tn and suspended solids the results are described in more detail in sections 3 2 1 through 3 2 3 3 2 1 cod removal despite the fluctuating influent concentration consistently high cod removal efficiencies were observed for both membrane materials fig 2 an average cod removal of 94 was recorded for the c pe polymeric membranes with a 5 percentile of 89 the sic ceramic membranes exhibited a similar average cod removal of 95 and a 5 percentile of 90 although the two materials have different surface characteristics the cod removal can be mainly attributed to biological degradation due to the high removal efficiency low effluent cod concentrations below 50 mg l 1 were consistently reached with the mbr treatment fig 2 average effluent cod concentrations were 22 mg l 1 for the c pe membranes and 19 mg l 1 for the sic membranes the cod removal efficiency of the mbbr was relatively stable figs 2 and s12 with no observable difference between the duplicates however a decrease in cod removal efficiency of 30 during the first weeks was observed figure s12 which contributes to the high variability seen for the single stage mbbr in fig 2 values around 78 removal were observed after 4 weeks figure s12 adding a second mbbr stage day 66 showed a significant although limited increase in the average cod removal efficiency 86 fig 2 in comparison to the single stage mbbr 78 excluding the initial adaptation period p 4 10 5 which can be explained by the higher hrt of the former the limited increase indicates that the first stage of the treatment system was the major contributor to cod removal while some polishing still occurred in the second stage and most suspended cod biomass were removed by the settler the first stage removed 49 of all cod with values of 11 for the second stage and 40 for the settler still cod removal efficiency could occasionally spike down due to biomass overflow fig 2 3 2 2 nitrogen removal tn removal in the mbr was generally low fig 2 as the aeration created an oxic environment in the reactors preventing denitrification in the mixed liquor the limited nitrogen removal efficiencies observed 40 16 for the c pe and 42 17 for the sic can mainly be attributed to assimilation by heterotrophic microorganisms and subsequent sludge overflow wastage which could be variable fig 2 a statistical comparison between the calculated nitrogen removal by assimilation section s5 1 and the measured nitrogen removal confirmed this on average the tn removal rate for the whole reactor was 0 18 0 05 g n d 1 while the calculated removal rate through immobilization was 0 16 0 03 g n d 1 immobilization thus explains the majority of nitrogen removal although a significant difference was found for the paired samples p 9 10 6 other processes such as denitrification occurring in settled sludge inside the reactor and biofilm attached to the reactor walls may also contribute to the tn removal to a limited extent although the presence of denitrifying genera was not verified the low and variable nh4 n removal efficiency 15 18 of the single stage mbbr combined with low no3 concentrations in the effluent 0 3 g l 1 indicated that nitrification was limited tables s5 and s6 to establish nitrification the mbbr was expanded to a two stage system the effluent concentrations indicated promising nitrification and ammonia removal efficiencies 94 13 nh4 n removal table s6 of all ammonia removal 38 occurred in the first stage 57 in the second stage and 5 in the settler low no2 n concentrations in the effluent suggests that not only ammonia oxidation but also nitrite oxidation consistently occurred this was supported by the presence of ammonia oxidizing genera nitrosospira 0 5 and nitrosomonas 2 as well as nitrite oxidizing candidatus nitrotoga 3 in the second stage of the mbbr figure s14 like the mbr only limited nitrogen removal was observed for the single staged mbbr fig 2 however the mbbr can potentially enable additional denitrification in the anoxic zone of the biofilm tawfik et al 2010 the total nitrogen removal 0 05 0 03 g n d 1 was significantly different p 6 10 13 from the calculated assimilated nitrogen 0 10 0 03 g n d 1 in the single staged mbbr indicating that not all nitrogen assimilation led to nitrogen removal and any denitrification was unlikely this discrepancy mainly occurred during the adjustment period until day 46 the difference decreased after day 46 and yet remained significant p 6 10 6 for the two stage mbbr the overall difference between the nitrogen removal 0 10 0 05 g n d 1 and nitrogen assimilation 0 12 0 02 g n d 1 was still significant p 0 005 for the last 25 days the removal was higher than the assimilation for 54 of all samples compared to 21 before which could indicate denitrification this is further supported by the amplicon sequencing results figure s14 showing the presence of denitrifying genera thauera 0 2 denitratisoma 0 05 and dechloromonas 0 05 in the second stage of the mbbr 3 2 3 removal of suspended solids the tss values of the mbr effluent for both membrane materials were below the detection limit of 0 01 g l 1 additionally high turbidity removals were observed with an average of 97 3 and a 5 percentile of 89 4 for the c pe membranes and an average of 98 7 and a 5 percentile of 96 7 for the sic membranes despite the difference in removal the average turbidity of the c pe and sic effluents was similar 0 64 and 0 66 ntu respectively during the two stage mbbr operation 10 of all samples exhibited high tss concentrations above 50 mg l 1 all during the last 25 days and caused by settling sludge issues related to sludge bulking confirmed by the average sludge volume index of both mbbr duplicates 333 ml g 1 and 215 ml g 1 amplicon sequencing results of the microbial community on the carriers of the first mbbr stage indicate the genera thiothrix 11 35 and sphaerotilus 11 13 as possible filamentous bacteria causing issues later on in the settler floating sludge was frequently observed possibly caused by denitrification in the decanter due to the high nitrate concentrations which also influenced the effluent tss concentrations 3 3 membrane fouling during mbr treatment the compare both membrane materials in terms of maintenance the cleaning frequency and fouling rate of the membranes was investigated an abrupt tmp increase relating to rapid fouling was noticeable after 8 days of c pe mbr operation since membrane relaxation was not yet implemented section 2 2 furthermore the first 72 days were characterized by severe membrane fouling fig 3 a caused by the dispersed and fine nature of mlss contents due to a period with limited access to the lab data is only available for the last 41 days with manual cleaning for the c pe membranes the average frequency of cleaning for the first 72 days was every 4 2 days and for the last 41 days every 5 7 days the sic membranes showed a more gradual increase in tmp during long term operation with the first abrupt increase of tmp after 122 days of operation 51 days of continuous operation fig 3b after day 122 irreversible fouling gradually increased indicated by a continually rising baseline after membrane cleaning fig 3b an average of 10 8 days between manual cleaning for both sic membranes was recorded ranging from 27 days at the first cleaning and 7 by the last cleaning the observed discrepancy in fouling and cleaning requirements can be attributed to three factors lower flux for the sic membranes different pore properties larger pore size of sic membranes and different porosity and pore length and the difference in surface material properties e g composition and roughness excluding effects other than surface material the average linear fouling rate for the polymeric membranes was 13 1011 5 1011 m 1 d 1 for the first 72 days and 4 1011 1 1011 m 1 d 1 for the last 41 days the average linear fouling rate for the ceramic membranes was 8 1011 3 1011 m 1 d 1 3 4 pathogen removal by biological treatments and disinfection units the influent of the mbr and the two stage mbbr systems was spiked with 108 cfu 100 ml 1 e coli to analyze pathogen removal along the treatment train the mbr with polymeric and ceramic membranes showed an lrv of 3 1 3 7 and 2 7 3 0 respectively the lower lrv of ceramic membranes would be due to their larger nominal pore size table 2 and membrane surface defects variable lrv values of 1 2 3 3 were obtained in the effluent of the two stage mbbrs tawfik et al 2010 reported a 2 3 log removal for fecal coliforms in an uasb mbbr setup in which most coliforms were removed in the mbbr step although an mbbr can reduce the e coli concentration in greywater most existing water reuse requirements demand considerably lower coliform concentrations in the effluent thus a disinfection post treatment is needed to ensure safe greywater reuse uv disinfection of the mbr effluents reduced e coli to non detectable levels 1 cfu 100 ml 1 table 3 the uv system section s4 operated under a mean residence time of 11 2 min and a dose of 726 j l 1 at 254 nm due to bioreactor limitations the uv dose provided at the continuous flow rate of 14 25 ml min 1 was more than 10 fold higher than the required dose table s7 which translates to a high energy consumption of 10 5 kwh m 3 37 800 j l 1 large molecules particles or flocs can reduce the effectiveness of uv disinfection or increase the required uv dose friedler et al 2021 nevertheless the results showed complete inactivation of higher e coli effluent concentrations up to 1010 cfu 100 ml 1 at a turbidity of 54 4 ntu i e compared to the unspiked effluent of 0 47 ntu under the same uv reactor conditions resulting in an lrv 10 inactivation of 4 3 5 3 log of e coli was observed when continuously treating mbbr effluents with a cem ec at an hrt of 30 min and a current density of 20 a m 2 the total lrv of the mbbr ec was 7 at a residual chlorine concentration of 0 5 mg cl2 l 1 which was not consistently sufficient to reduce e coli to non detectable levels table 3 under these conditions the ec system s energy use was calculated at 5 kwh m 3 18 000 j l 1 which is particularly high due to the low effluent conductivity 1 ms cm 1 and long hrt due to ec sizing limitations additionally the cell voltage increased after two weeks of operation due to inorganic scaling at the cathode e g caco3 section s3 lastly the elevated tss concentrations in the mbbr effluent caused organic fouling and can react with the active chlorine in turn increasing the internal resistance and decreasing the disinfection efficacy of the ec section s3 the disinfection of the opposite bioreactor effluent was verified under the same operational conditions for the uv and ec the mbbr effluent was successfully disinfected at a uv dose of 726 j l 1 at 254 nm despite containing suspended biomass that could reduce uv effectiveness similarly the ec successfully disinfected mbr effluents and provided residual chlorine of 0 77 mg cl2 l 1 a higher active chlorine production with the mbr effluent supports the idea of suspended organic compounds consuming chlorine in the mbbr effluents 4 comparative analysis and design recommendations for water reclamation 4 1 mbr and mbbr treatment of greywater the effluent quality of the mbr with sic membranes and the two staged mbbr were compared against two recent international standards for unrestricted non potable wastewater reuse table 4 s7 the nitrogen removal for both systems was similarly variable and insufficient to meet the standards table 4 since both systems were continuously aerated no notable denitrification was expected and nitrogen removal occurred mainly through immobilization in biomass section 3 2 2 despite the preference for single volume reactors in decentralized applications due to compactness and reduced complexity a second mbbr stage was required to induce nitrification similarly adding an anoxic stage could allow for denitrification to keep the reactor at a single stage for the mbr several options can be proposed to improve treatment performance which may also be applied to the mbbr for instance intermittent aeration would allow anoxic periods to prevail during operation leading to denitrification however this would impact membrane scouring in the mbr for the mbbr additional stirrers were necessary in any case since bubble aeration was not sufficient to ensure carrier suspension hence reducing aeration would not cause an issue another strategy is the addition of mbbr carriers to the mbr to obtain a hybrid system a moving bed biofilm membrane reactor palmarin et al 2020 allowing denitrification in the anoxic layers of the biofilm on the carriers it is possible that aeration would have to be lowered to enable local anoxia with the same concerns as discussed above but also improve overall energy consumption nevertheless all these modifications would increase system complexity risking increased system costs and points of failure the latter can be counteracted by building in redundancy the mbbr struggled with sludge bulking and overflow in the effluent caused by filamentous bacteria thiotrix and sphaerotilus this contradicts the literature where sludge bulking is generally not a problem with mbbrs chen et al 2008 henriet et al 2017 reported that thiothrix thrives in nutrient deficient wastewater containing high concentrations of low molecular weight fatty acids hence thiothrix growth was stimulated by the addition of acetate as the main carbon source table 1 and a low nutrient to cod ratio indeed the average cod n p ratio was 100 6 5 0 07 which is low compared to the ideal rule of thumb ratio for activated sludge of 100 20 1 however this is not uncommon for greywater typically ranging from as low as 100 1 0 3 to 100 7 2 2 7 table s4 sphaerotilus on the other hand has been reported to grow at low do concentrations and high concentrations of readily biodegradable substrates martins et al 2004 due to the high aeration of the bioreactor section s5 2 oxygen limitation was unlikely poor settling of the sludge was also noticeable for the mbr when temporarily halting aeration although without operational effects due to its reliance on filtration as opposed to gravitational settling however the mbr was not indifferent to sludge quality as rapid fouling development could be observed when the mlss was fine and dispersed at low concentrations fig 3 a possible solution for these sludge issues would be a feast and famine regime where the influent is intermittently fed to the reactors this would be the case in real life scenarios as greywater production is not continuous throughout the day and a small buffer tank would be required to protect the bioreactors indeed an abrupt change in influent composition was followed by a decrease in cod removal efficiency for the mbbr as the biofilm carriers were previously seeded on different greywater section 2 2 the synthetic greywater contains laundry and dishwasher detergent two compounds present in lower concentrations in general wastewater due to dilution that can impact unacclimated microorganisms katam and bhattacharyya 2018 due to sludge bulking in the mbbr high tss values were recorded for samples with excessive biomass overflow coinciding with lower nitrogen and cod removals due to the contribution of biomass to the effluent concentrations the mbr met the effluent turbidity standards while the mbbr did not table 4 and a 9 fold higher average turbidity was observed compared to the mbr the average effluent cod concentration of the mbbr was approximately 2 fold higher than the mbr both systems met the standards on average but the maximum value was occasionally exceeded for the mbbr next to the enhanced tss removal of the mbr the higher cod removal efficiency of the mbr could have been caused by the higher total biomass present in the mbr system as it was more easily controlled through the sludge wastage while the mbbr was uncontrolled with the release of flocs from the carriers without recirculation of settled sludge despite the presence of a dedicated disinfection unit it is worth mentioning that the lrv of the mbr was higher than that of the mbbr table 3 because of the filtration mechanism of the membranes where pathogens are actively filtered out the flow to reactor volume ratio 1 h r t was 1 7 l l 1 d 1 for the mbr and 0 7 l l 1 d 1 for the mbbr including the settler the ratio for the mbr could theoretically be increased to 8 9 2 6 l l 1 d 1 to obtain an mlss concentration of 10 g l 1 under the average synthetic greywater composition section s5 4 similarly for an ideal surface loading rate of 4 g cod m 2 d 1 for the first mbbr stage the ratio could be increased to 1 0 0 2 l l 1 d 1 section s5 2 assuming the current synthetic greywater represents an average real greywater composition and the treatment performance would not be influenced by the proposed flow increases reactor volumes of approximately 7 to 22 l for the mbr and 66 to 202 l for the mbbr would be required to treat an inhabitant equivalent of greywater 63 2 to 193 l p 1 d 1 larsen et al 2013 vlaamse milieumaatschappij 2018 the above results highlight the known advantages of mbr based treatment systems which supports the focus of researchers on mbr rather than mbbr for greywater treatment as noted in the introduction however an important and evident drawback of the mbr is the cost of membranes and maintenance frequency due to membrane fouling relative to the mbbr applying the fit for purpose approach the mbr is most suitable for greywater treatment with unrestricted reuse whereas the mbbr installation allows a low cost and low maintenance treatment option for water reuse purposes with less stringent quality requirements 4 2 ceramic and polymeric membranes for mbr the sic ceramic membranes heavily delayed the initial onset of membrane fouling while fouling was observed much sooner for the c pe polymeric membranes during long term operation the c pe membranes needed cleaning every 5 7 days and the sic every 10 8 days which could partly be explained by the 1 4 times larger pore size of the sic membranes and the difference in surface materials these results align with previous findings on surface water treatment although a large difference in membrane pore size was used previously hofs et al 2011 a lower fouling rate would indeed be expected for the sic membranes as they have high hydrophilicity and a low isoelectric point 2 2 5 although the c pe membranes were also coated with a hydrophilic agent when rapid fouling occurred which can be predominantly ascribed to cake layer filtration the sic membranes fouled at a similar rate to the c pe ones when corrected for differences in pore size membrane area and porosity thus the material has seemingly no effect on the rate of cake layer formation furthermore the larger pore size of the sic membranes can shift the fouling mechanism from cake filtration toward increased pore blocking wang and tarabara 2008 pore blocking is less reversible and would explain the increasing baseline after cleaning the sic membranes including the increasing frequency of cleaning after long term operation the c pe membranes were operated at a higher flux 7 8 lmh than the sic membranes 5 2 lmh which might explain the discrepancy in cleaning frequency and onset of rapid fouling between the two membranes however both membranes were operated at a relatively low flux for conventional mbr which sees typical fluxes of 15 45 lmh park et al 2015 thus the flux was not expected to be higher than the critical flux for immediate rapid fouling it can be anticipated that all membranes will be used at rather low lmh within a decentralized setting due to the saved maintenance costs relative to a centralized large scale system where operational control is far more stringent and capital costs will be more relevant at a small scale with single membrane prices around 50 150 differences in cost would be negligible compared to an overall system cost of e g above 5000 under practical applications frequent and automated backwashing would be incorporated during the operational regime alongside relaxation compared to its use as an occasional physical cleaning method in this study compared to polymeric membranes the flat sheet ceramic membranes were back washable thus posing an advantage for delaying rapid fouling onset and increased time between manual cleanings 4 3 uv and cem ec disinfection of the effluent the uv disinfection and cem ec were compared by evaluating the log removal values lrv and effluent e coli concentrations against the quality requirements table 4 although additional biological indicators are often required such as ms2 coliphage as a viral indicator table s7 both systems met the minimum required lrv but only the uv reached non detectable e coli concentrations the higher removal for the uv was caused by the relatively low flow rates used and thus high uv dose which suggests that pathogen inactivation can still occur if the flow rate is increased to improve the energy use per volume of treated water for the uv which was twice as high compared to the ec the effluent could be stored in a buffer tank for batch uv disinfection at a higher flow rate alternatively more efficient small scale uv led arrays could be used as they require a lower operating voltage and can emit light at 265 nm or 280 nm improving microbial inactivation li et al 2017 the limited removal for the ec was caused by interference of suspended solids and inorganic precipitation to meet the required disinfectant dose for the ec either the contact time or the generated reactive chlorine concentration should be increased ec performance is expected to improve for lower effluent tss concentrations e g under intermittent feeding without bulking sludge as the ec showed a higher lrv and residual chlorine concentration for the mbr effluent based on tss alone the integration of mbr ec could improve the ec performance and energy consumption and the mbbr uv integration is preferred above mbbr ec as the uv disinfection performance seemed less affected by increased turbidity which does not line up with initial expectations based on the literature independent of influent tss levels ca2 and mg2 in both the mbr and mbbr effluent can cause inorganic scaling in the ec due to the alkaline catholyte ph 9 9 0 4 thus while the high salt content of greywater is beneficial for in situ chlorine generation due to higher chloride concentrations high levels of calcium and magnesium should be avoided as they would lead to scaling this scaling has been previously observed for other wastewaters increases internal resistance and thus energy consumption and can be solved by frequent maintenance with an acid wash or by polarity reversal using boron doped diamond electrodes radjenovic and sedlak 2015 another option is avoiding effluent passage through the cathodic chamber and allowing disinfection at quasi neutral ph in the anolyte as demonstrated by mosquera romero et al 2022 it is important to note that possible regrowth of pathogens was not investigated reactivation of pathogens in the case of uv disinfection is possible due to dna repair mechanisms such as photoreactivation and dark repair li et al 2017 during prolonged storage however periodic re disinfection could ensure safety regrowth of pathogens is a lesser concern for the ec due to the presence of residual disinfectant although chlorine tolerant bacteria could be present gupta et al 2022 simultaneous ozone and chlorine production using e g boron doped diamond electrodes could mitigate this tolerance rajab et al 2015 the main concern during disinfection using oxidants remains however the generation of disinfection by products radjenovic and sedlak 2015 which was not evaluated in the current study conclusions and recommendations a single mbr or mbbr reactor volume was insufficient to meet the total nitrogen removal required by international standards for unrestricted urban water reuse other approaches are necessary to enhance nitrogen removal such as intermittent aeration multi stage mbbr or hybrid mbr operating with biofilm carriers for denitrification enhancement because of the greywater composition sludge bulking caused lower cod tss and turbidity removal for the mbbr which hindered it to consistently meet quality standards for water reuse although sludge bulking is not expected under real conditions it indicates a vulnerability of the mbbr towards greywater composition and organics loading for decentralized systems under ideal loading conditions the required theoretical reactor volumes would be 7 22 l p 1 for the mbr and 66 202 l p 1 for the mbbr dependent on the greywater quantity 63 2 to 193 l p 1 d 1 tests with various real greywater supplies could enable the study of variable contaminants and increased organics loading and further assess the effect on mlss concentration of the mbr during low flux mbr operation 8 lmh the sic ceramic membranes delayed the onset of membrane fouling and needed cleaning half as frequently as the c pe polymeric membranes when correcting for pore morphology and membrane area the sic membranes fouled equally as fast incorporating regular backwashing in the operating regime for the sic membranes could enhance their potential for low maintenance both ec and uv could provide the required disinfection dose for e coli inactivation in greywater whilst providing residual chlorine the ec exhibited vulnerability to high tss values and scaling due to precipitation which is linked to the inherent characteristics of greywater being a low nutrient to cod ratio and high salt content the mbr and mbbr treatment trains with either uv or ec disinfection are promising decentralized treatment systems albeit with different water reuse applications following the fit for use approach credit authorship contribution statement seppe ongena formal analysis

14861,smart stormwater systems equipped with real time controls are transforming urban drainage management by enhancing the flood control and water treatment potential of previously static infrastructure real time control of detention basins for instance has been shown to improve contaminant removal by increasing hydraulic retention times while also reducing downstream flood risk however to date few studies have explored optimal real time control strategies for achieving both water quality and flood control targets this study advances a new model predictive control mpc algorithm for stormwater detention ponds that determines the outlet valve control schedule needed to maximize pollutant removal and minimize flooding using forecasts of the incoming pollutograph and hydrograph comparing mpc against three rule based control strategies mpc is found to be more effective at balancing between multiple competing control objectives such as preventing overflows reducing peak discharges and improving water quality moreover when paired with an online data assimilation scheme based on extended kalman filtering ekf mpc is found to be robust to uncertainty in both pollutograph forecasts and water quality measurements by providing an integrated control strategy that optimizes both water quality and quantity goals while remaining robust to uncertainty in hydrologic and pollutant dynamics this study paves the way for real world smart stormwater systems that will achieve improved flood and nonpoint source pollution management graphical abstract keywords model predictive control real time control data assimilation smart stormwater systems data availability code and data links are available at https github com future water mpc pond 1 introduction management of nonpoint source pollutants has long been recognized as one of the most critical challenges in stormwater engineering harrington et al 1985 patterson et al 2013 hammer 1992 today a majority of water bodies in the us are classified by the environmental protection agency epa as impaired with the primary drivers of impairment being nonpoint source pollutants like sediments nutrients and sewage u s environmental protection agency 2017 rowny and stewart 2012 stormwater engineers have traditionally managed these contaminants through the use of stormwater best management practices bmps like detention basins which provide temporary storage of water to reduce peak discharge rates prevent streambed erosion and remove contaminants through sedimentation li et al 2019 liu et al 2014 wilson et al 2015 however recent research has called into question the ability of static bmps to adequately respond to the changing hydrologic conditions caused by climate change and urbanization tirpak et al 2021 hathaway et al 2014 on one hand stormwater ponds must be designed to prevent flooding during large storm events which necessitates larger storage volumes and outlet pipes at the same time larger pipes lead to more rapid discharges that cause erosion and impact aquatic habitats downstream moreover given the effect of the first flush with high levels of pollutants carried by runoff early in the event very limited treatment can be achieved under design practices that prioritize localized flood control by maximizing conveyance middleton and barrett 2008 balancing between conflicting water quality and flood control objectives with a single static design remains a fundamental dilemma in urban drainage engineering in recent years smart stormwater systems have emerged as a promising new approach to urban drainage management that addresses many of the shortcomings of static bmp design drawing on advances in the internet of things smart stormwater systems use distributed sensors and actuators to dynamically reconfigure stormwater infrastructure for the purposes of improved flood and pollution control kerkez et al 2016 bartos et al 2018 real time control rtc of stormwater detention basins using actuated outlet valves for instance increases available storage capacity prior to storm events thereby reducing flashy flows downstream and improving sedimentation of pollutants smart stormwater systems have been shown to improve pollutant removal mitigate urban flooding reduce combined sewer overflows and drastically reduce the size of stormwater ponds needed to achieve desired levels of treatment and flood control performance muschalla et al 2014 wong and kerkez 2018 mullapudi et al 2017 despite the promise for real time controls to solve urban flooding and water quality problems optimal control strategies for stormwater basins are as of yet poorly explored in particular fundamental questions remain concerning i how stormwater ponds should be controlled in real time to meet both water quality and flood control objectives and ii how real time control strategies can be made robust to the uncertainty inherent in real world rainfall and pollutant inputs most research on real time stormwater pond control has focused on water quantity targets such minimizing overflows and floods wong and kerkez 2018 shaving hydraulic peaks kearney et al 2011 or increasing hydraulic retention time hrt in basins shishegar et al 2019a though many studies demonstrate that water quality can be improved by rtc water quality is only presented as the result of the control and not as the decision variable carpenter et al 2014 in a few recent studies control strategies have explicitly included water quality as a parameter sharior et al 2019 incorporate water quality into control rules for an outlet valve based on pond height and total suspended solids tss concentration in this scheme the valve remains closed until the pond water level or tss concentration reaches a predefined minimal threshold value at which time the valve is opened and the pond is drained akin et al 2022 also integrate real time turbidity data into control decisions and test their control strategy in a real world deployment to improve the quality of effluent akin et al 2022 in addition bowes et al 2022 propose a deep reinforcement learning based control strategy for flood mitigation and pollutant treatment at the system level bowes et al 2022 while previous work shows the power of rtc for improving water quality more work is needed to achieve holistic stormwater management strategies that handle competing water quality and quantity goals under real world uncertainty first more adaptive alternatives to rule based control are required predetermined rule based approaches require pre knowledge of the system and trial and error tuning to set specific thresholds for control and may underperform when novel conditions are encountered rule based controls also struggle to balance between multiple competing objectives and have few built in capabilities for handling uncertainty in addition incorporation of more dynamic control actions is necessary prior work largely focuses on binary on off control i e totally opened or completely closed gates which limits the range of possible outcomes and may even cause oscillations in the gate position near thresholds leading to increased operational cost and wear and tear gaborit et al 2013 most importantly reactive control systems that base control actions only on current and past sensor observations must be upgraded to incorporate predictions predictive control based on weather forecasts has been shown to outperform reactive control for flood attenuation because it enables current control actions to be adjusted to reflect future inputs and thus prevent stormwater ponds from overflowing shishegar et al 2019b gaborit et al 2016 xu et al 2020 however taking into account pollutant dynamics in the control of stormwater infrastructure is a difficult task given the uncertainty in water quality predictions model predictive control mpc provides a method to overcome the aforementioned limitations especially under uncertainty in rainfall and pollutant forecasts mpc is an optimization based method that has been successfully implemented in many industries including chemical plants robot control and autonomous vehicles as an effective tool to drive future optimal control strategies from a system model and forecasts of external inputs with constraints on controls and states camacho and alba 2013 for a given forecast window mpc uses the system s current state as the initial state and solves a finite horizon open loop optimal control problem to determine the optimal control action at each time step this optimization yields an optimal control sequence and only the first control action in this sequence is applied to the system mayne et al 2000 this process is repeated as the prediction horizon recedes mpc s receding horizon strategy confers on it an inherent robustness to uncertainty de nicolao et al 1996 magni and sepulchre 1997 within the field of water resources engineering mpc has been mainly applied in urban drainage systems for peak flow reduction kändler et al 2022 zhou et al 2022 flood risk mitigation gomes júnior et al 2022 and combined sewer overflow cso control cembrano et al 2004 ocampo martinez et al 2013 lund et al 2018 joseph duran et al 2015 puig et al 2009 sun et al 2020 however due to the nonlinearity of the dynamics of water quantity and quality most studies depend on approximate linear models with perfect water quality predictions sun et al 2020 2021 or hrt as a surrogate for water quality shishegar et al 2019b this study considers a nonlinear model predictive control nmpc strategy to take into account the nonlinearity of the combined hydraulic and quality models in addition to the advantages of linear mpc such as enabling constraints on decision variables nmpc can compute optimal control actions under nonlinear costs and constraints to that end this study develops an optimal control strategy for a stormwater basin to maximize its flood and pollution control considering the nonlinearity of water system dynamics control is implemented using nmpc based on a mass balance and continuously stirred tank reactor cstr representation to account for real world uncertainty in the pollutograph forecast an extended kalman filter is implemented to estimate the contaminant concentration in the pond at each time step by assimilating simulated turbidity sensor data into the model the proposed optimization approach offers an adaptable way to minimize floods and maximize runoff treatment without building additional infrastructure the fundamental contributions of this paper are the following we derive a new methodology for optimal control of stormwater detention ponds that explicitly incorporates water quality parameters into the control objective and strategy we show that when combined with data assimilation the control strategy remains robust to uncertainty in both the pollutograph forecasts and sensor measurements we demonstrate that as compared to rule based control the mpc based control strategy is effective at balancing multiple competing objectives including i preventing overflows ii slowing and reducing the peak outflow and iii improving water quality 2 material and methods this section details the derivation implementation and evaluation of a model predictive control algorithm for improving water quality in stormwater detention basins first a physically based model is derived to simulate the hydraulics and contaminant dynamics within a real world stormwater pond drawing on this model a model predictive control algorithm is developed to determine the optimal outlet valve control strategy needed to reduce downstream pollutant loads and reduce erosion at the outlet while at the same time preventing overflows within the pond to account for uncertainty in the pollutograph forecast the control strategy is combined with an extended kalman filter which adaptively estimates the internal contaminant concentration in the pond based on simulated turbidity sensor data finally the mpc based control strategy is evaluated against three rule based control strategies accounting for uncertainty in both the pollutograph forecast and the measured contaminant concentration in the pond 2 1 study area our study focuses on an urban watershed located in ann arbor michigan fig 1 this watershed and its stormwater infrastructure are the subject of a long term monitoring project bartos et al 2018 and the catchment has been previously investigated in multiple studies on real time sensing and control of urban drainage infrastructure wong and kerkez 2018 bartos and kerkez 2021b the watershed is approximately 4 km 2 in area and consists of multiple stormwater basins that receive runoff from mostly urbanized impervious sub catchments this study concentrates specifically on the central basin which is the largest basin in the network and the location where the two major tributaries merge the flows and tss concentrations entering the basin are driven by runoff from upstream subcatchments that routes through the drainage network these processes are simulated using the epa stormwater management model swmm rossman 2010 parameters for the model are taken from a calibrated model described in a previous study wong and kerkez 2018 cdm smith 2015 in the swmm model the subcatchment wash off function is based on the event mean concentration emc parameters for each land use are listed in table s1 2 2 hydraulic model a hydraulic model is derived to simulate the dynamics of the water within the detention pond under free flowing inlet conditions and orifice control at the outlet the hydraulic model for the stormwater pond is based on a mass balance where the change in storage is equal to the difference between inflow q i n and outflow q o u t the surface area of the basin at each time step a is computed using the storage curve based on the basin water depth h it is assumed that precipitation evaporation and infiltration within the basin are negligible the depth in the pond is thus modeled by the discrete difference equation 1 h t 1 h t δ t a h t q i n t q o u t t at the outlet of the pond a controllable orifice is installed to regulate the outflow rate such that q o u t θ c d a d 2 g max h t h 0 0 where θ is the orifice opening ratio from 0 to 1 c d is the orifice discharge coefficient a d is the effective orifice area h 0 is the bottom elevation of the orifice and g is the gravitational acceleration 2 3 water quality model drawing on the hydraulic model developed in the previous section a coupled water quality model is derived to model contaminant fate and transport within the pond the water quality model formulated here for tss can be expressed as a pollutant mass balance considering sedimentation as a first order reaction krajewski et al 2017 it is assumed that the pond itself behaves as a cstr which means the effluent concentration is equal to the concentration in the pond the contaminant concentration in the pond is thus described by the following discrete difference equation which is the same equation used in swmm rossman and huber 2016 2 c t 1 c t a h t h t e k δ t c i n t q i n t δ t a h t h t q i n t δ t where c is the concentration in the effluent and in the pond and k is the first order rate constant the treatment constant k of the stormwater pond is assumed to be 0 8 day 1 as specified in the guidelines for conducting reasonable assurance analysis in watershed management programs la rwqcb 2014 in practice the sedimentation process may depend on the depth and velocity of flow gaborit et al 2013 however the assumption of a constant removal rate is a simplification made here to avoid over parameterization and can be considered as a source of uncertainty in the model to be subsequently addressed using data assimilation the sensitivity of the results to uncertainty in the decay rate is evaluated with respect to a range of typical decay rate parameters 0 2 0 8 day 1 in the supplementary information si document see fig s1 2 4 model predictive control using the models described in the previous section a model predictive control algorithm is derived to determine the optimal valve control strategy needed to minimize the total pollutant mass delivered downstream while at the same time reducing peak outflow and preventing the pond from overflowing in general terms given a dynamical model of the detention pond along with forecasts of the incoming hydrograph and influent concentration the mpc algorithm determines the valve control strategy needed to optimize an objective function over a future prediction horizon at each control time step the optimal control action is determined over the prediction horizon based on the current state of the system and future inputs into the system the control time step is set at 15 min and the prediction horizon is set at 24 h the performance of mpc with different prediction horizons ranging from 12 to 36 h is also evaluated in the si see fig s2 once the optimal control action at the current time step is applied the prediction and optimal control computations are recalculated recursively as the prediction horizon moves one step forward the nonlinear mpc problem is solved with the gradient based interior point method in matlab the optimization problem is defined formally as follows min u j x u d 3 s t x τ 1 f x τ u τ d τ x τ x τ t t t u τ u τ t t t 1 x 0 x 0 where j is the objective function x r n x is the states of the system at time step τ which represent both the water level and tss concentration of the pond u r n u is the vector of manipulated variables which represent the controlled valve opening ratio d r n d is the sequence of disturbances including incoming runoff and tss concentration of the runoff the function f denotes the system dynamics which are eqs 1 and 2 x and u are linear constraints in the states and the inputs here physical constraints are imposed on both the maximum allowable water height 0 h h max and the valve opening ratio 0 θ 1 the valve opening time is not treated as a physical constraint because typical valve opening times are small typically 1 minute compared to the 15 minute control time interval however the supplementary information document describes how physical constraints on the valve opening time may be expressed in the formulation as inequality constraints see section s2 the objective function is formulated to enhance the two main functions of stormwater ponds i slowing and reducing stormwater discharges and ii lowering pollutant loads the objective function of the nmpc optimization is formulated as follows 4 j w 1 τ t t t q o u t τ q o u t 2 w 2 τ t t t c τ q o u t τ 2 w 3 h t t 2 where the constant parameter q o u t is the average outflow over the prediction horizon w 1 w 2 w 3 are tuning weights that reflect the priority among conflicting objectives and can be adjusted to meet the importance set by the system operators the weights are shown in table s2 and the relative importance of different weights are presented in figs s3 and s4 the first objective term minimizes the peak outflow rate from the pond the peak outflow is reduced by minimizing the difference between the outflow and the average outflow over the prediction horizon the second term minimizes the cumulative pollutant load over the horizon the last term minimizes the water level at the end of the horizon which provides a driving force to encourage the pond to fully drain 2 5 data assimilation with extended kalman filtering the mpc control strategy described in the previous section is combined with an extended kalman filter to estimate the contaminant concentration within the pond and ensure that control remains robust in the face of measurement and forecast uncertainty in real world applications effective control of water quality requires knowledge of the contaminant concentration within the stormwater pond in real world situations however this contaminant concentration is difficult to know with certainty pollutograph forecasts based on build up and wash off models are highly uncertain turbidity sensors deployed in the stormwater pond may provide real time estimates of tss concentration but these estimates are based on site specific correlations and are thus also uncertain to overcome these problems and enable real world implementation a state estimation scheme is derived that uses an extended kalman filter to continuously estimate the tss concentration within the pond from noisy turbidity sensor data the extended kalman filter ekf recursively estimates the tss concentration within the pond by combining estimates from a process model together with estimates obtained from sensor data this procedure ensures that the process model stays up to date with the true behavior of the system while accounting for uncertainty in the model the ekf estimates the state of a nonlinear system based on a successive linearization of the system with respect to previous estimates of the state julier and uhlmann 2004 lee and ricker 1994 for sensor fusion the extended kalman filter has two stages prediction and update the system model f x k u k eqs 1 2 and the observation model h x k can be expressed as the difference equation with additive white process noise w k measurement noise v k and measured sensor data y k 5 x k 1 f x k u k w k 6 y k h x k v k the filter is initialized with the initial state x ˆ 0 0 e x 0 and covariance p 0 0 e x 0 x ˆ 0 x 0 x ˆ 0 t based on the previous state estimate x ˆ k k its covariance matrix p k k and the input u k prior estimates of the new state x ˆ k 1 k and its covariance matrix p k 1 k are computed 7 x ˆ k 1 k f x ˆ k k u k 8 p k 1 k f k p k k f k t q k where the jacobian matrix f k f x x ˆ k k u k and q k is the covariance matrix of the process noise once a sensor measurement is obtained it is used to adjust the latest estimate of the system state first the measurement residual y and its covariance matrix s are computed 9 y k 1 y k 1 h x ˆ k 1 k 10 s k 1 h k 1 p k 1 k h k 1 t r k where the jacobian matrix h k 1 h x x ˆ k 1 k and r k is the covariance matrix of the measurement noise

1 i k k 1 h k 1 p k 1 k this procedure yields near optimal estimates of the tss concentration in the pond both of which are subsequently used as inputs to the mpc algorithm together these two steps form a combined estimation and control scheme mpc ekf 2 6 control strategies this study compares four control strategies including three rule based control strategies and a mpc based approach here three rule based control schemes are examined including outflow regulated control rbc outflow concentration based control rbc conc and a combination of both outflow and concentration rbc both rbc outflow is a control algorithm that keeps the valve closed and only opens it if the water height exceeds the maximum allowable water level to prevent the pond from overflowing while discharging water the valve is adjusted to ensure that outflows do not exceed the desired outflow rate in order to prevent downstream erosion mullapudi et al 2017 rbc conc is based on the pollutant concentration under this scheme the valve is closed to retain stormwater longer and allow for additional treatment by settling if the concentration is above a threshold otherwise the valve is opened allowing the water to drain rbc conc also prevents the pond from overflowing by opening the valve when the maximum depth is reached sharior et al 2019 bowes et al 2022 rbc both combines the features of rbc conc and rbc outflow like rbc conc it keeps the valve closed until the concentration reaches a specified threshold but also regulates the outflow rate by adjusting the valve opening as with rbc outflow the control algorithm is described formally in algorithm s1 the three rule based control strategies rbc conc rbc outflow and rbc both are chosen because they are representative of previous control strategies used within the literature sharior et al 2019 muschalla et al 2014 gaborit et al 2013 however it should be noted that more sophisticated rule based control strategies are possible such as predictive rule based control or rule based control schemes embedded within an optimization framework shishegar et al 2019a and that these schemes may offer better performance than those studied in this work in addition to the rule based control strategies this study also considers three different model predictive control schemes the first two mpc cases are based on different influent water quality information mpc true determines its control actions under perfect influent forecasts i e the mpc controller has access to perfect information about incoming pollutant loads generated by the swmm model by contrast mpc false simulates control actions under an inaccurate forecast i e the mpc controller does not have access to perfect information about incoming pollutant loads rather a single incorrect forecasted emc value is assumed finally mpc ekf determines its control actions under inaccurate influent forecasts i e using a single incorrect forecasted emc but continuously calibrates its process model by assimilating sensor measurements i e the true behavior of the pond at each time step using ekf note that mpc ekf represents our primary result while mpc true and mpc false are presented for reference the implementation of these strategies is discussed in further detail in the following section 2 7 implementation and evaluation of mpc with ekf to test the viability of mpc under real world uncertainty we assess its performance when the modeled pollutograph forecast is inaccurate but ekf is used to improve estimates of tss concentration in the pond briefly this procedure uses a pollutograph forecast based on a de calibrated model run along with artificial sensor data based on a ground truth swmm model run with added noise to simulate how the mpc ekf strategy will perform in practice when the forecast model is imperfect and the sensor data is noisy to generate a de calibrated pollutograph forecast that either overestimates or underestimates tss runoff concentrations from the sub catchments constant emc values that deviate from the true pollutograph are employed using emc values has two main advantages 1 they have simple dynamics compared to build up and wash off models and 2 emc monitoring data are available for bmps nationally clary et al 2002 next mpc is executed for the first control time step under the de calibrated forecast in parallel the system is also simulated under a ground truth pollutograph forecast which yields the true behavior of the pond the mpc true strategy computes its control action sequence using the ground truth pollutograph forecast from the swmm model the mpc false strategy computes its control action sequence using the de calibrated forecast based on a single incorrect expected emc value the mpc ekf strategy also uses the de calibrated forecast but continuously updates the estimated contaminant concentration in the pond from synthetic turbidity sensor data synthetic sensor data is generated by adding random noise to the output of this ground truth simulation given the accuracy of commercial turbidity meters the measurement sensor noise is assumed to be about 2 of the reading ysi inc 2022 this sensor data is then fused into the system using ekf updating the model s states to rectify disparities between the forecast and reality this procedure repeats recursively at each optimization time step based on the control action from the false forecast and filtered measurements from the true forecast this procedure shows how our framework performs under the uncertainty in water quality predictions fig 2 2 8 performance evaluation metrics the metrics used in this paper to evaluate the control performance are a overflow volume b peak outflow rate c downstream tss load d control effort and e outflow flashiness these metrics are defined mathematically in table 1 3 results the performance of the mpc algorithm is evaluated in terms of preventing overflows reducing peak outflow and minimizing pollutant loads while simultaneously minimizing control effort compared to the three reactive rule based control strategies considered mpc more effectively balances between competing objectives and is the only control strategy that prevents overflows during a continuous simulation crucially we show that data fusion via ekf enables mpc to achieve these goals under measurement noise and uncertainty in influent quality predictions that are characteristic of real world conditions in the following sections the performance of mpc is evaluated in detail for both single storm and continuous simulation scenarios and the effects of uncertainty in the tss sensor data and pollutant emc concentrations are also assessed 3 1 control performance fig 3 shows how the passive system rbcs and mpc respond to a 10 year 24 h design storm event total depth 83 mm maximal intensity 113 9 mm h compared to the passive system all four real time control strategies utilize the pond s capacity more effectively by allowing the pond to fill to its maximum height however the three chosen rule based control strategies struggle to reduce the outflow rate and minimize valve control effort these limitations are clear for the case of concentration based control rbc conc because the valve is opened above the concentration threshold and closed below the valve oscillates rapidly between the closed and open positions with the potential to cause wear and tear under real world operations fig 3f moreover when the valve is opened at a high water level water is released at a high flow rate higher even than in the passive system because the outflow rate is proportional to the square root of the water level fig 3d while rbc conc achieves lower tss loads downstream compared to other control strategies this performance depends on the concentration threshold fig s5 in this example the threshold is set to achieve a 90 reduction in influent emc however a higher threshold may not allow sufficient treatment whereas a lower threshold may maximize treatment but at the same time increase the risk of overflow in the case of rbc outflow water is released at a constant rate when the water level reaches a user specified limit as such the high outflow rate seen in rbc conc is prevented however even in this scenario the issue of how to set the flow rate remains an open question for the experiment shown in fig 3d the specified outflow rate is set to the same value as the maximum flow rate of mpc if the maximum outflow rate is set to a smaller value tss removal may be improved due to a longer retention time however at the same time this strategy prevents the pond from draining quickly making it vulnerable to future stormwater events and flooding as with rbc conc rbc outflow may lead to significant flooding due to overflow of the pond rbc both which is based on setting thresholds for both pollutant concentration and outflow rate shows the best performance in pollutant load reduction at the chosen allowable outflow rate however this result is achieved by more extensive use of valve control actions compared to other control strategies as with the case of rbc conc the rapid oscillation of the valve between open and closed positions may lead to greater wear and tear and greater power draw which may be problematic for battery powered installations while it is possible to handle these oscillations by adding more rules to limit valve operation frequency the problem of balancing between conflicting objectives becomes challenging in rbc as the number of rules grows see section 4 for discussion mpc simultaneously reduces the peak flow and tss load while also preventing overflow and limiting actuator effort dynamic control by mpc results in a tss load reduction of 87 from 500 kg to 65 kg as compared to the passive system intuitively mpc improves pollutant removal by releasing more flow when the pond s tss concentration is low and decreasing the discharge when the concentration is high additionally mpc shows a 30 reduction in the magnitude of peak flow from 0 34 m 3 s to 0 24 m 3 s the outflow of stormwater volume is efficiently spread across the event duration and outside of the rainfall time window according to the dynamically controlled outlet valve resulting in a longer detention time and further treated pollutants in the effluent a comparison of relative performance for each stormwater control strategy including the passive system is shown in fig 4a all values are calculated as a relative percentage based on the maximum value for each metric note that a smaller area represents better performance mpc has the smallest overall area indicating that it is effective at balancing between multiple control objectives even though rbc conc shows good performance in tss load reduction this outcome comes at the cost of increasing peak outflow and control effort on the other hand rbc outflow shows better performance in peak flow and control by compensating the detention time and downstream tss load but performs poorly at reducing tss load rbc both is an effective solution for reducing loads and regulating outflow rate in this case but comes at the cost of extensive valve control actions compared to the rule based control strategies mpc is able to effectively balance between multiple competing objectives 3 2 mpc ekf under uncertainty to assess its robustness to uncertainty the mpc ekf strategy is tested under forecast and measurement uncertainty both of which are characteristic of real world stormwater control applications fig 5 shows the performance of mpc ekf under the uncertainty of both noisy measurements and imperfect forecasts with influent concentration predicted as a constant value 18 8 mg l gray lines represent 100 trials with measurement noise even with poor predictions of influent tss concentrations and the introduction of measurement noise the performance of mpc ekf remains robust by fusing the sensor measurements and reorganizing the control strategy at each time step although emc is an important analytical parameter for rainfall runoff events and can be used to assess water quality impacts from stormwater runoff it is still based on post hoc analysis from previous rainfall events therefore there is no guarantee that the same emc will hold true for every different rainfall event mpc ekf is thus tested under different emc levels a total of eight scenarios are considered each with the same conditions as in the previous example fig 5 but with emcs between 25 and 200 of the previous case as shown in fig 6 no matter what level of emc is predicted the pond can be properly controlled through real time data assimilation in the beginning the valve control trajectories of each mpc ekf are the same as the corresponding mpcs since both have the same predictions as mpc ekf assimilates the sensor measurements at each time step however the valve control trajectories evolve to be similar to the original emc level 100 fig 6b this result is more explicit in the case of 25 emc in this case the valve opening ratio starts near the level of 0 05 resulting from the under predicted concentration but converges to the level of the 100 emc case through online state estimation in other words real time data assimilation allows for successful control even with faulty predictions but faster convergence and better performance can be expected with more precise predictions 3 3 performance under real world conditions a case study the performance of the mpc ekf strategy is evaluated using real world storm events recorded throughout the year of 2021 fig s6c precipitation intensity data are collected from a rain gauge operated by the city of ann arbor near the study catchment city of ann arbor 2023 the rainfall characteristics of the 2021 rainfall series are summarized in table s3 in addition to utilizing individual design rainfall events as in drainage engineering practice the rain events across an entire year are considered i to capture the behavior of the pond under real world weather variability and ii to evaluate the long term performance under continuous rainfall events fig 7 illustrates the pond dynamics for the four control scenarios during the period from 22 september to 1 october 2021 the dynamics throughout the entire year of 2021 are shown in fig s8 the control strategies and thresholds for rbcs are the same as in the previous cases compared to the 10 year 24 h design storm event fig 7 clearly shows the drawbacks of reactive control for all three rule based control cases flooding cannot be avoided which leads to system failure because the control strategy is reactive and the valve cannot pre emptively release water to make room for the anticipated inflow fig 7d at the beginning of the rainfall events all rbcs close the valve because the water level in the pond has not reached the threshold fig 7g however as the rainfall events continue the water level reaches the maximum allowable height and the valve opens to drain water however this control action comes too late to handle the inflow so the water depth exceeds the limit resulting in overflow rbc outflow and rbc both are much worse a larger amount of overflow occurs because the flow rate that can be discharged is limited fig 7e such unwanted spills and control failures also lead to poorer results than for the previous design storm event in terms of tss attenuation because overflow leaves the spill volume untreated fig 7h it is also noteworthy that unlike the previous design storm event rbc both does not show the best performance for load reduction in the given period in contrast mpc ekf adapts and copes with various hydrological inputs using forecasts here even though the height does not reach the maximum height during the beginning of rainfall events mpc ekf decides to intentionally discharge water to secure capacity to cope with the upcoming rainfall events even when discharge is unavoidable the amount of discharge is increased when the concentration is low so that the downstream load is minimized when the height limit is reached the valve is slowly opened to release water while maximizing the benefits of water treatment in this way mpc ekf can adaptively maximize the capacity of the pond for both flood and pollution control fig 4 summarizes the performance of the pond under a the design storm and b continuous real world rainfall events mpc shows the most balanced performance in both cases while the three selected rbcs struggle to balance between multiple objectives and struggle to prevent overflows for certain rainfall events this result indicates that mpc is advantageous in cases where multiple competing benefits are required and provides a flexible framework that can be adapted to meet multiple stormwater objectives under various storm events 4 discussion with climate change urbanization population growth and aging infrastructure placing increasing stresses on urban water systems deployment of real time stormwater control systems will help to manage flooding and pollutant loads while at the same time reducing the need for new stormwater infrastructure expansion the model predictive control and data assimilation strategy developed here provides an adaptive measure to substantially enhance the performance of existing stormwater detention basins through real time control retrofits by determining the outlet valve control strategy that optimizes both water quality and quantity goals over a receding time horizon our approach provides an explicit and adaptable framework that attenuates the total peak flow to the stream and improves water quality through sedimentation in addition our approach handles both sensor measurement error and pollutant forecast uncertainty by fusing real time turbidity data into the process model thereby demonstrating applicability to real world stormwater systems where both model and forecast uncertainty are large compared to rule based controls mpc offers three major advantages that make it a strong general framework for stormwater rtc first mpc has an explicit objective that can be optimized rule based controls rely on heuristics and do not guarantee optimality unless paired with a separate optimization framework while the outcomes correspond to solutions that meet the rule set they are not necessarily the best solution for a given scenario mpc on the other hand is an optimization algorithm that approximates a global long horizon solution by solving a local finite horizon problem because mpc directly computes the valve control strategy to minimize pollutant loads without intermediary proxies or rules it serves as an explainable and predictable framework for real time control second mpc readily extends to control problems with many different objectives and constraints while rule based control strategies can also be augmented with additional rules adding new rules may ultimately lead to complex decision hierarchies that are difficult to implement or analyze for instance with only two basic control rules rbc both features a relatively complicated hierarchy of conditional statements see algorithm s1 ensuring that these complex rules effectively balance between multiple competing objectives proves more challenging as the number of rules grows by contrast mpc is readily extended by adding more terms to the objective function with the relative priority of each goal defined by its weight thus instead of specifying a series of binary decisions at each time step mpc finds the control strategy that best balances between these weighted objectives making it highly extensible as an overall control framework last mpc is adaptable to changing hydrologic inputs and site conditions existing studies focus on rule based controls either reactive or predictive that require operators to establish fixed thresholds on the desired pond depth contaminant concentration or retention time the main drawback of this approach is that good thresholds are specifically tuned to one particular storm and study site and thus fail to generalize consider the problem of determining the proper water depth threshold to prevent overflows while also maximizing treatment capacity under rbc outflow if overflow prevention is required a conservative threshold must be placed on the water level that maximizes available capacity however this conservative threshold will also lead to reduced pollutant treatment for smaller storm events it is difficult to know a priori how the ideal thresholds for rule based control should be set without knowing the exact expected rainfall and pollutograph intensities and if novel storm events are encountered these pre selected thresholds may fail to perform as desired by contrast mpc adapts to each new site and rainfall event by computing an optimized outflow schedule based on the expected rainfall and pollutograph forecast furthermore this study shows that when paired with state estimation techniques i e ekf model predictive control is robust to uncertainty in pollutant forecasts this finding is significant because it shows that our technique can be readily applied to real world stormwater systems where pollutant dynamics are poorly characterized given the uncertainties inherent in runoff pollutant dynamics precise forecasts of future pollutant inflows are difficult to achieve in practice however the findings of this study show that when combined with real time sensor data i e turbidity measurements within a stormwater pond our mpc ekf approach is able to achieve near optimal flood reduction and pollutant removal benefits even when initial pollutograph forecasts are inaccurate this result highlights that combining real time control with state estimation significantly enhances the viability of real time stormwater control strategies under real world conditions 4 1 towards real world implementation while this study shows the potential for model predictive control to improve stormwater quality several research questions must be addressed to enable application to real world stormwater systems in terms of scalability future work should consider control of stormwater facilities at the watershed scale optimization of control measures at the local level can yield optimal performance for individual sites but does not guarantee maximum performance at the system level hence future work should extend the framework described in this paper to the watershed scale to provide a global solution for stormwater management systematic control of distributed stormwater facilities can coordinate individual elements to achieve city scale benefits similarly future research should investigate how our method can be integrated into a real time digital twin stormwater model which can address the real world problem of sparsely spaced sensors by estimating the states for ungauged locations to achieve system scale control bartos and kerkez 2021b furthermore investigating sensor placement algorithms may be required to decide how many sensors are necessary and where they should be positioned to enhance the performance of stormwater systems eulogi et al 2021 bartos and kerkez 2021a another natural extension of our study is the development of control strategies for the removal of different pollutants this work focuses on tss as the contaminant of interest thus the stormwater pond is modeled as a continuously stirred tank reactor with first order reaction kinetics however contaminant removal is often subject to much more complicated biological and physicochemical processes recent studies have developed a real time toolkit for complex water quality modeling mason et al 2021 and explored nutrient dynamics in stormwater treatment wijesiri et al 2022 mason et al 2022 such approaches should be incorporated into our control framework thereby enabling enhanced attenuation and treatment of pollutants like nutrients microbes metals as well as contaminants of emerging concern like microplastics such a contribution will enable more complete smart stormwater management by integrating the fields of control theory hydrology and aquatic chemistry in addition improving water quality predictions is crucial for future research this study shows that real time data assimilation enables the control strategy to remain robust to poor predictions but it is also clear that better performance can be achieved with more accurate predictions of water quality better understanding of pollutant dynamics is especially important in cases with significant hysteresis behavior or lag between the hydrograph and pollutograph future work should thus test control performance under more detailed pollutant generation and transport models when measured data are available these observations may be incorporated into water quality prediction models such as exponential or rating curve wash off functions or machine learning based models to capture pollutant dynamics more precisely ahmed et al 2019 chen et al 2020 in terms of reliability uncertainty in weather forecasts should be examined in future work while uncertainty in water quality measurements and predictions were considered our approach assumed full knowledge of hydrologic states mainly to maintain water mass balance to accurately compare the pollutant load and examine the effect of water quality variable for each scenario however in practice weather predictions are subject to significant uncertainty which might cause adverse impacts like overflows if not accounted for thus the impacts of incomplete knowledge and the resulting compensation of the performance remain to be investigated future work may consider the uncertainty in weather forecasts using a robust model predictive control approach shang et al 2019 or a hybrid markov decision process goorden et al 2021 5 conclusion this study develops a novel approach for active management of stormwater ponds that combines model predictive control with online data assimilation to mitigate flooding and improve water quality our approach provides an optimal valve control strategy based on nonlinear model predictive control with a receding horizon window along with an extended kalman filtering process that enables the assimilation of real time turbidity sensor data the resulting model predictive control algorithm outperforms the passive system at reducing pollutant outflows limiting erosion and preventing flooding with minimum control effort and more effectively balances between these competing objectives compared to commonly used reactive rule based control strategies this study is the first to integrate water quality parameters explicitly into the control objective function and does not require specification of site specific control rules or thresholds moreover by integrating real time data our approach shows strong and stable performance even under noisy sensor measurements and imperfect knowledge of influent pollutant dynamics these features make our methodology readily applicable to real world stormwater ponds without the need for extensive model or rule calibration dynamically controlled stormwater ponds with mpc ekf will facilitate environmental restoration reduce urban

14861,smart stormwater systems equipped with real time controls are transforming urban drainage management by enhancing the flood control and water treatment potential of previously static infrastructure real time control of detention basins for instance has been shown to improve contaminant removal by increasing hydraulic retention times while also reducing downstream flood risk however to date few studies have explored optimal real time control strategies for achieving both water quality and flood control targets this study advances a new model predictive control mpc algorithm for stormwater detention ponds that determines the outlet valve control schedule needed to maximize pollutant removal and minimize flooding using forecasts of the incoming pollutograph and hydrograph comparing mpc against three rule based control strategies mpc is found to be more effective at balancing between multiple competing control objectives such as preventing overflows reducing peak discharges and improving water quality moreover when paired with an online data assimilation scheme based on extended kalman filtering ekf mpc is found to be robust to uncertainty in both pollutograph forecasts and water quality measurements by providing an integrated control strategy that optimizes both water quality and quantity goals while remaining robust to uncertainty in hydrologic and pollutant dynamics this study paves the way for real world smart stormwater systems that will achieve improved flood and nonpoint source pollution management graphical abstract keywords model predictive control real time control data assimilation smart stormwater systems data availability code and data links are available at https github com future water mpc pond 1 introduction management of nonpoint source pollutants has long been recognized as one of the most critical challenges in stormwater engineering harrington et al 1985 patterson et al 2013 hammer 1992 today a majority of water bodies in the us are classified by the environmental protection agency epa as impaired with the primary drivers of impairment being nonpoint source pollutants like sediments nutrients and sewage u s environmental protection agency 2017 rowny and stewart 2012 stormwater engineers have traditionally managed these contaminants through the use of stormwater best management practices bmps like detention basins which provide temporary storage of water to reduce peak discharge rates prevent streambed erosion and remove contaminants through sedimentation li et al 2019 liu et al 2014 wilson et al 2015 however recent research has called into question the ability of static bmps to adequately respond to the changing hydrologic conditions caused by climate change and urbanization tirpak et al 2021 hathaway et al 2014 on one hand stormwater ponds must be designed to prevent flooding during large storm events which necessitates larger storage volumes and outlet pipes at the same time larger pipes lead to more rapid discharges that cause erosion and impact aquatic habitats downstream moreover given the effect of the first flush with high levels of pollutants carried by runoff early in the event very limited treatment can be achieved under design practices that prioritize localized flood control by maximizing conveyance middleton and barrett 2008 balancing between conflicting water quality and flood control objectives with a single static design remains a fundamental dilemma in urban drainage engineering in recent years smart stormwater systems have emerged as a promising new approach to urban drainage management that addresses many of the shortcomings of static bmp design drawing on advances in the internet of things smart stormwater systems use distributed sensors and actuators to dynamically reconfigure stormwater infrastructure for the purposes of improved flood and pollution control kerkez et al 2016 bartos et al 2018 real time control rtc of stormwater detention basins using actuated outlet valves for instance increases available storage capacity prior to storm events thereby reducing flashy flows downstream and improving sedimentation of pollutants smart stormwater systems have been shown to improve pollutant removal mitigate urban flooding reduce combined sewer overflows and drastically reduce the size of stormwater ponds needed to achieve desired levels of treatment and flood control performance muschalla et al 2014 wong and kerkez 2018 mullapudi et al 2017 despite the promise for real time controls to solve urban flooding and water quality problems optimal control strategies for stormwater basins are as of yet poorly explored in particular fundamental questions remain concerning i how stormwater ponds should be controlled in real time to meet both water quality and flood control objectives and ii how real time control strategies can be made robust to the uncertainty inherent in real world rainfall and pollutant inputs most research on real time stormwater pond control has focused on water quantity targets such minimizing overflows and floods wong and kerkez 2018 shaving hydraulic peaks kearney et al 2011 or increasing hydraulic retention time hrt in basins shishegar et al 2019a though many studies demonstrate that water quality can be improved by rtc water quality is only presented as the result of the control and not as the decision variable carpenter et al 2014 in a few recent studies control strategies have explicitly included water quality as a parameter sharior et al 2019 incorporate water quality into control rules for an outlet valve based on pond height and total suspended solids tss concentration in this scheme the valve remains closed until the pond water level or tss concentration reaches a predefined minimal threshold value at which time the valve is opened and the pond is drained akin et al 2022 also integrate real time turbidity data into control decisions and test their control strategy in a real world deployment to improve the quality of effluent akin et al 2022 in addition bowes et al 2022 propose a deep reinforcement learning based control strategy for flood mitigation and pollutant treatment at the system level bowes et al 2022 while previous work shows the power of rtc for improving water quality more work is needed to achieve holistic stormwater management strategies that handle competing water quality and quantity goals under real world uncertainty first more adaptive alternatives to rule based control are required predetermined rule based approaches require pre knowledge of the system and trial and error tuning to set specific thresholds for control and may underperform when novel conditions are encountered rule based controls also struggle to balance between multiple competing objectives and have few built in capabilities for handling uncertainty in addition incorporation of more dynamic control actions is necessary prior work largely focuses on binary on off control i e totally opened or completely closed gates which limits the range of possible outcomes and may even cause oscillations in the gate position near thresholds leading to increased operational cost and wear and tear gaborit et al 2013 most importantly reactive control systems that base control actions only on current and past sensor observations must be upgraded to incorporate predictions predictive control based on weather forecasts has been shown to outperform reactive control for flood attenuation because it enables current control actions to be adjusted to reflect future inputs and thus prevent stormwater ponds from overflowing shishegar et al 2019b gaborit et al 2016 xu et al 2020 however taking into account pollutant dynamics in the control of stormwater infrastructure is a difficult task given the uncertainty in water quality predictions model predictive control mpc provides a method to overcome the aforementioned limitations especially under uncertainty in rainfall and pollutant forecasts mpc is an optimization based method that has been successfully implemented in many industries including chemical plants robot control and autonomous vehicles as an effective tool to drive future optimal control strategies from a system model and forecasts of external inputs with constraints on controls and states camacho and alba 2013 for a given forecast window mpc uses the system s current state as the initial state and solves a finite horizon open loop optimal control problem to determine the optimal control action at each time step this optimization yields an optimal control sequence and only the first control action in this sequence is applied to the system mayne et al 2000 this process is repeated as the prediction horizon recedes mpc s receding horizon strategy confers on it an inherent robustness to uncertainty de nicolao et al 1996 magni and sepulchre 1997 within the field of water resources engineering mpc has been mainly applied in urban drainage systems for peak flow reduction kändler et al 2022 zhou et al 2022 flood risk mitigation gomes júnior et al 2022 and combined sewer overflow cso control cembrano et al 2004 ocampo martinez et al 2013 lund et al 2018 joseph duran et al 2015 puig et al 2009 sun et al 2020 however due to the nonlinearity of the dynamics of water quantity and quality most studies depend on approximate linear models with perfect water quality predictions sun et al 2020 2021 or hrt as a surrogate for water quality shishegar et al 2019b this study considers a nonlinear model predictive control nmpc strategy to take into account the nonlinearity of the combined hydraulic and quality models in addition to the advantages of linear mpc such as enabling constraints on decision variables nmpc can compute optimal control actions under nonlinear costs and constraints to that end this study develops an optimal control strategy for a stormwater basin to maximize its flood and pollution control considering the nonlinearity of water system dynamics control is implemented using nmpc based on a mass balance and continuously stirred tank reactor cstr representation to account for real world uncertainty in the pollutograph forecast an extended kalman filter is implemented to estimate the contaminant concentration in the pond at each time step by assimilating simulated turbidity sensor data into the model the proposed optimization approach offers an adaptable way to minimize floods and maximize runoff treatment without building additional infrastructure the fundamental contributions of this paper are the following we derive a new methodology for optimal control of stormwater detention ponds that explicitly incorporates water quality parameters into the control objective and strategy we show that when combined with data assimilation the control strategy remains robust to uncertainty in both the pollutograph forecasts and sensor measurements we demonstrate that as compared to rule based control the mpc based control strategy is effective at balancing multiple competing objectives including i preventing overflows ii slowing and reducing the peak outflow and iii improving water quality 2 material and methods this section details the derivation implementation and evaluation of a model predictive control algorithm for improving water quality in stormwater detention basins first a physically based model is derived to simulate the hydraulics and contaminant dynamics within a real world stormwater pond drawing on this model a model predictive control algorithm is developed to determine the optimal outlet valve control strategy needed to reduce downstream pollutant loads and reduce erosion at the outlet while at the same time preventing overflows within the pond to account for uncertainty in the pollutograph forecast the control strategy is combined with an extended kalman filter which adaptively estimates the internal contaminant concentration in the pond based on simulated turbidity sensor data finally the mpc based control strategy is evaluated against three rule based control strategies accounting for uncertainty in both the pollutograph forecast and the measured contaminant concentration in the pond 2 1 study area our study focuses on an urban watershed located in ann arbor michigan fig 1 this watershed and its stormwater infrastructure are the subject of a long term monitoring project bartos et al 2018 and the catchment has been previously investigated in multiple studies on real time sensing and control of urban drainage infrastructure wong and kerkez 2018 bartos and kerkez 2021b the watershed is approximately 4 km 2 in area and consists of multiple stormwater basins that receive runoff from mostly urbanized impervious sub catchments this study concentrates specifically on the central basin which is the largest basin in the network and the location where the two major tributaries merge the flows and tss concentrations entering the basin are driven by runoff from upstream subcatchments that routes through the drainage network these processes are simulated using the epa stormwater management model swmm rossman 2010 parameters for the model are taken from a calibrated model described in a previous study wong and kerkez 2018 cdm smith 2015 in the swmm model the subcatchment wash off function is based on the event mean concentration emc parameters for each land use are listed in table s1 2 2 hydraulic model a hydraulic model is derived to simulate the dynamics of the water within the detention pond under free flowing inlet conditions and orifice control at the outlet the hydraulic model for the stormwater pond is based on a mass balance where the change in storage is equal to the difference between inflow q i n and outflow q o u t the surface area of the basin at each time step a is computed using the storage curve based on the basin water depth h it is assumed that precipitation evaporation and infiltration within the basin are negligible the depth in the pond is thus modeled by the discrete difference equation 1 h t 1 h t δ t a h t q i n t q o u t t at the outlet of the pond a controllable orifice is installed to regulate the outflow rate such that q o u t θ c d a d 2 g max h t h 0 0 where θ is the orifice opening ratio from 0 to 1 c d is the orifice discharge coefficient a d is the effective orifice area h 0 is the bottom elevation of the orifice and g is the gravitational acceleration 2 3 water quality model drawing on the hydraulic model developed in the previous section a coupled water quality model is derived to model contaminant fate and transport within the pond the water quality model formulated here for tss can be expressed as a pollutant mass balance considering sedimentation as a first order reaction krajewski et al 2017 it is assumed that the pond itself behaves as a cstr which means the effluent concentration is equal to the concentration in the pond the contaminant concentration in the pond is thus described by the following discrete difference equation which is the same equation used in swmm rossman and huber 2016 2 c t 1 c t a h t h t e k δ t c i n t q i n t δ t a h t h t q i n t δ t where c is the concentration in the effluent and in the pond and k is the first order rate constant the treatment constant k of the stormwater pond is assumed to be 0 8 day 1 as specified in the guidelines for conducting reasonable assurance analysis in watershed management programs la rwqcb 2014 in practice the sedimentation process may depend on the depth and velocity of flow gaborit et al 2013 however the assumption of a constant removal rate is a simplification made here to avoid over parameterization and can be considered as a source of uncertainty in the model to be subsequently addressed using data assimilation the sensitivity of the results to uncertainty in the decay rate is evaluated with respect to a range of typical decay rate parameters 0 2 0 8 day 1 in the supplementary information si document see fig s1 2 4 model predictive control using the models described in the previous section a model predictive control algorithm is derived to determine the optimal valve control strategy needed to minimize the total pollutant mass delivered downstream while at the same time reducing peak outflow and preventing the pond from overflowing in general terms given a dynamical model of the detention pond along with forecasts of the incoming hydrograph and influent concentration the mpc algorithm determines the valve control strategy needed to optimize an objective function over a future prediction horizon at each control time step the optimal control action is determined over the prediction horizon based on the current state of the system and future inputs into the system the control time step is set at 15 min and the prediction horizon is set at 24 h the performance of mpc with different prediction horizons ranging from 12 to 36 h is also evaluated in the si see fig s2 once the optimal control action at the current time step is applied the prediction and optimal control computations are recalculated recursively as the prediction horizon moves one step forward the nonlinear mpc problem is solved with the gradient based interior point method in matlab the optimization problem is defined formally as follows min u j x u d 3 s t x τ 1 f x τ u τ d τ x τ x τ t t t u τ u τ t t t 1 x 0 x 0 where j is the objective function x r n x is the states of the system at time step τ which represent both the water level and tss concentration of the pond u r n u is the vector of manipulated variables which represent the controlled valve opening ratio d r n d is the sequence of disturbances including incoming runoff and tss concentration of the runoff the function f denotes the system dynamics which are eqs 1 and 2 x and u are linear constraints in the states and the inputs here physical constraints are imposed on both the maximum allowable water height 0 h h max and the valve opening ratio 0 θ 1 the valve opening time is not treated as a physical constraint because typical valve opening times are small typically 1 minute compared to the 15 minute control time interval however the supplementary information document describes how physical constraints on the valve opening time may be expressed in the formulation as inequality constraints see section s2 the objective function is formulated to enhance the two main functions of stormwater ponds i slowing and reducing stormwater discharges and ii lowering pollutant loads the objective function of the nmpc optimization is formulated as follows 4 j w 1 τ t t t q o u t τ q o u t 2 w 2 τ t t t c τ q o u t τ 2 w 3 h t t 2 where the constant parameter q o u t is the average outflow over the prediction horizon w 1 w 2 w 3 are tuning weights that reflect the priority among conflicting objectives and can be adjusted to meet the importance set by the system operators the weights are shown in table s2 and the relative importance of different weights are presented in figs s3 and s4 the first objective term minimizes the peak outflow rate from the pond the peak outflow is reduced by minimizing the difference between the outflow and the average outflow over the prediction horizon the second term minimizes the cumulative pollutant load over the horizon the last term minimizes the water level at the end of the horizon which provides a driving force to encourage the pond to fully drain 2 5 data assimilation with extended kalman filtering the mpc control strategy described in the previous section is combined with an extended kalman filter to estimate the contaminant concentration within the pond and ensure that control remains robust in the face of measurement and forecast uncertainty in real world applications effective control of water quality requires knowledge of the contaminant concentration within the stormwater pond in real world situations however this contaminant concentration is difficult to know with certainty pollutograph forecasts based on build up and wash off models are highly uncertain turbidity sensors deployed in the stormwater pond may provide real time estimates of tss concentration but these estimates are based on site specific correlations and are thus also uncertain to overcome these problems and enable real world implementation a state estimation scheme is derived that uses an extended kalman filter to continuously estimate the tss concentration within the pond from noisy turbidity sensor data the extended kalman filter ekf recursively estimates the tss concentration within the pond by combining estimates from a process model together with estimates obtained from sensor data this procedure ensures that the process model stays up to date with the true behavior of the system while accounting for uncertainty in the model the ekf estimates the state of a nonlinear system based on a successive linearization of the system with respect to previous estimates of the state julier and uhlmann 2004 lee and ricker 1994 for sensor fusion the extended kalman filter has two stages prediction and update the system model f x k u k eqs 1 2 and the observation model h x k can be expressed as the difference equation with additive white process noise w k measurement noise v k and measured sensor data y k 5 x k 1 f x k u k w k 6 y k h x k v k the filter is initialized with the initial state x ˆ 0 0 e x 0 and covariance p 0 0 e x 0 x ˆ 0 x 0 x ˆ 0 t based on the previous state estimate x ˆ k k its covariance matrix p k k and the input u k prior estimates of the new state x ˆ k 1 k and its covariance matrix p k 1 k are computed 7 x ˆ k 1 k f x ˆ k k u k 8 p k 1 k f k p k k f k t q k where the jacobian matrix f k f x x ˆ k k u k and q k is the covariance matrix of the process noise once a sensor measurement is obtained it is used to adjust the latest estimate of the system state first the measurement residual y and its covariance matrix s are computed 9 y k 1 y k 1 h x ˆ k 1 k 10 s k 1 h k 1 p k 1 k h k 1 t r k where the jacobian matrix h k 1 h x x ˆ k 1 k and r k is the covariance matrix of the measurement noise then the optimal kalman gain is given by 11 k k 1 p k 1 k h k 1 t s k 1 1 using the kalman gain the state estimate and its covariance matrix are updated 12 x ˆ k 1 k 1 x ˆ k 1 k k k 1 y k 1 13 p k 1 k 1 i k k 1 h k 1 p k 1 k this procedure yields near optimal estimates of the tss concentration in the pond both of which are subsequently used as inputs to the mpc algorithm together these two steps form a combined estimation and control scheme mpc ekf 2 6 control strategies this study compares four control strategies including three rule based control strategies and a mpc based approach here three rule based control schemes are examined including outflow regulated control rbc outflow concentration based control rbc conc and a combination of both outflow and concentration rbc both rbc outflow is a control algorithm that keeps the valve closed and only opens it if the water height exceeds the maximum allowable water level to prevent the pond from overflowing while discharging water the valve is adjusted to ensure that outflows do not exceed the desired outflow rate in order to prevent downstream erosion mullapudi et al 2017 rbc conc is based on the pollutant concentration under this scheme the valve is closed to retain stormwater longer and allow for additional treatment by settling if the concentration is above a threshold otherwise the valve is opened allowing the water to drain rbc conc also prevents the pond from overflowing by opening the valve when the maximum depth is reached sharior et al 2019 bowes et al 2022 rbc both combines the features of rbc conc and rbc outflow like rbc conc it keeps the valve closed until the concentration reaches a specified threshold but also regulates the outflow rate by adjusting the valve opening as with rbc outflow the control algorithm is described formally in algorithm s1 the three rule based control strategies rbc conc rbc outflow and rbc both are chosen because they are representative of previous control strategies used within the literature sharior et al 2019 muschalla et al 2014 gaborit et al 2013 however it should be noted that more sophisticated rule based control strategies are possible such as predictive rule based control or rule based control schemes embedded within an optimization framework shishegar et al 2019a and that these schemes may offer better performance than those studied in this work in addition to the rule based control strategies this study also considers three different model predictive control schemes the first two mpc cases are based on different influent water quality information mpc true determines its control actions under perfect influent forecasts i e the mpc controller has access to perfect information about incoming pollutant loads generated by the swmm model by contrast mpc false simulates control actions under an inaccurate forecast i e the mpc controller does not have access to perfect information about incoming pollutant loads rather a single incorrect forecasted emc value is assumed finally mpc ekf determines its control actions under inaccurate influent forecasts i e using a single incorrect forecasted emc but continuously calibrates its process model by assimilating sensor measurements i e the true behavior of the pond at each time step using ekf note that mpc ekf represents our primary result while mpc true and mpc false are presented for reference the implementation of these strategies is discussed in further detail in the following section 2 7 implementation and evaluation of mpc with ekf to test the viability of mpc under real world uncertainty we assess its performance when the modeled pollutograph forecast is inaccurate but ekf is used to improve estimates of tss concentration in the pond briefly this procedure uses a pollutograph forecast based on a de calibrated model run along with artificial sensor data based on a ground truth swmm model run with added noise to simulate how the mpc ekf strategy will perform in practice when the forecast model is imperfect and the sensor data is noisy to generate a de calibrated pollutograph forecast that either overestimates or underestimates tss runoff concentrations from the sub catchments constant emc values that deviate from the true pollutograph are employed using emc values has two main advantages 1 they have simple dynamics compared to build up and wash off models and 2 emc monitoring data are available for bmps nationally clary et al 2002 next mpc is executed for the first control time step under the de calibrated forecast in parallel the system is also simulated under a ground truth pollutograph forecast which yields the true behavior of the pond the mpc true strategy computes its control action sequence using the ground truth pollutograph forecast from the swmm model the mpc false strategy computes its control action sequence using the de calibrated forecast based on a single incorrect expected emc value the mpc ekf strategy also uses the de calibrated forecast but continuously updates the estimated contaminant concentration in the pond from synthetic turbidity sensor data synthetic sensor data is generated by adding random noise to the output of this ground truth simulation given the accuracy of commercial turbidity meters the measurement sensor noise is assumed to be about 2 of the reading ysi inc 2022 this sensor data is then fused into the system using ekf updating the model s states to rectify disparities between the forecast and reality this procedure repeats recursively at each optimization time step based on the control action from the false forecast and filtered measurements from the true forecast this procedure shows how our framework performs under the uncertainty in water quality predictions fig 2 2 8 performance evaluation metrics the metrics used in this paper to evaluate the control performance are a overflow volume b peak outflow rate c downstream tss load d control effort and e outflow flashiness these metrics are defined mathematically in table 1 3 results the performance of the mpc algorithm is evaluated in terms of preventing overflows reducing peak outflow and minimizing pollutant loads while simultaneously minimizing control effort compared to the three reactive rule based control strategies considered mpc more effectively balances between competing objectives and is the only control strategy that prevents overflows during a continuous simulation crucially we show that data fusion via ekf enables mpc to achieve these goals under measurement noise and uncertainty in influent quality predictions that are characteristic of real world conditions in the following sections the performance of mpc is evaluated in detail for both single storm and continuous simulation scenarios and the effects of uncertainty in the tss sensor data and pollutant emc concentrations are also assessed 3 1 control performance fig 3 shows how the passive system rbcs and mpc respond to a 10 year 24 h design storm event total depth 83 mm maximal intensity 113 9 mm h compared to the passive system all four real time control strategies utilize the pond s capacity more effectively by allowing the pond to fill to its maximum height however the three chosen rule based control strategies struggle to reduce the outflow rate and minimize valve control effort these limitations are clear for the case of concentration based control rbc conc because the valve is opened above the concentration threshold and closed below the valve oscillates rapidly between the closed and open positions with the potential to cause wear and tear under real world operations fig 3f moreover when the valve is opened at a high water level water is released at a high flow rate higher even than in the passive system because the outflow rate is proportional to the square root of the water level fig 3d while rbc conc achieves lower tss loads downstream compared to other control strategies this performance depends on the concentration threshold fig s5 in this example the threshold is set to achieve a 90 reduction in influent emc however a higher threshold may not allow sufficient treatment whereas a lower threshold may maximize treatment but at the same time increase the risk of overflow in the case of rbc outflow water is released at a constant rate when the water level reaches a user specified limit as such the high outflow rate seen in rbc conc is prevented however even in this scenario the issue of how to set the flow rate remains an open question for the experiment shown in fig 3d the specified outflow rate is set to the same value as the maximum flow rate of mpc if the maximum outflow rate is set to a smaller value tss removal may be improved due to a longer retention time however at the same time this strategy prevents the pond from draining quickly making it vulnerable to future stormwater events and flooding as with rbc conc rbc outflow may lead to significant flooding due to overflow of the pond rbc both which is based on setting thresholds for both pollutant concentration and outflow rate shows the best performance in pollutant load reduction at the chosen allowable outflow rate however this result is achieved by more extensive use of valve control actions compared to other control strategies as with the case of rbc conc the rapid oscillation of the valve between open and closed positions may lead to greater wear and tear and greater power draw which may be problematic for battery powered installations while it is possible to handle these oscillations by adding more rules to limit valve operation frequency the problem of balancing between conflicting objectives becomes challenging in rbc as the number of rules grows see section 4 for discussion mpc simultaneously reduces the peak flow and tss load while also preventing overflow and limiting actuator effort dynamic control by mpc results in a tss load reduction of 87 from 500 kg to 65 kg as compared to the passive system intuitively mpc improves pollutant removal by releasing more flow when the pond s tss concentration is low and decreasing the discharge when the concentration is high additionally mpc shows a 30 reduction in the magnitude of peak flow from 0 34 m 3 s to 0 24 m 3 s the outflow of stormwater volume is efficiently spread across the event duration and outside of the rainfall time window according to the dynamically controlled outlet valve resulting in a longer detention time and further treated pollutants in the effluent a comparison of relative performance for each stormwater control strategy including the passive system is shown in fig 4a all values are calculated as a relative percentage based on the maximum value for each metric note that a smaller area represents better performance mpc has the smallest overall area indicating that it is effective at balancing between multiple control objectives even though rbc conc shows good performance in tss load reduction this outcome comes at the cost of increasing peak outflow and control effort on the other hand rbc outflow shows better performance in peak flow and control by compensating the detention time and downstream tss load but performs poorly at reducing tss load rbc both is an effective solution for reducing loads and regulating outflow rate in this case but comes at the cost of extensive valve control actions compared to the rule based control strategies mpc is able to effectively balance between multiple competing objectives 3 2 mpc ekf under uncertainty to assess its robustness to uncertainty the mpc ekf strategy is tested under forecast and measurement uncertainty both of which are characteristic of real world stormwater control applications fig 5 shows the performance of mpc ekf under the uncertainty of both noisy measurements and imperfect forecasts with influent concentration predicted as a constant value 18 8 mg l gray lines represent 100 trials with measurement noise even with poor predictions of influent tss concentrations and the introduction of measurement noise the performance of mpc ekf remains robust by fusing the sensor measurements and reorganizing the control strategy at each time step although emc is an important analytical parameter for rainfall runoff events and can be used to assess water quality impacts from stormwater runoff it is still based on post hoc analysis from previous rainfall events therefore there is no guarantee that the same emc will hold true for every different rainfall event mpc ekf is thus tested under different emc levels a total of eight scenarios are considered each with the same conditions as in the previous example fig 5 but with emcs between 25 and 200 of the previous case as shown in fig 6 no matter what level of emc is predicted the pond can be properly controlled through real time data assimilation in the beginning the valve control trajectories of each mpc ekf are the same as the corresponding mpcs since both have the same predictions as mpc ekf assimilates the sensor measurements at each time step however the valve control trajectories evolve to be similar to the original emc level 100 fig 6b this result is more explicit in the case of 25 emc in this case the valve opening ratio starts near the level of 0 05 resulting from the under predicted concentration but converges to the level of the 100 emc case through online state estimation in other words real time data assimilation allows for successful control even with faulty predictions but faster convergence and better performance can be expected with more precise predictions 3 3 performance under real world conditions a case study the performance of the mpc ekf strategy is evaluated using real world storm events recorded throughout the year of 2021 fig s6c precipitation intensity data are collected from a rain gauge operated by the city of ann arbor near the study catchment city of ann arbor 2023 the rainfall characteristics of the 2021 rainfall series are summarized in table s3 in addition to utilizing individual design rainfall events as in drainage engineering practice the rain events across an entire year are considered i to capture the behavior of the pond under real world weather variability and ii to evaluate the long term performance under continuous rainfall events fig 7 illustrates the pond dynamics for the four control scenarios during the period from 22 september to 1 october 2021 the dynamics throughout the entire year of 2021 are shown in fig s8 the control strategies and thresholds for rbcs are the same as in the previous cases compared to the 10 year 24 h design storm event fig 7 clearly shows the drawbacks of reactive control for all three rule based control cases flooding cannot be avoided which leads to system failure because the control strategy is reactive and the valve cannot pre emptively release water to make room for the anticipated inflow fig 7d at the beginning of the rainfall events all rbcs close the valve because the water level in the pond has not reached the threshold fig 7g however as the rainfall events continue the water level reaches the maximum allowable height and the valve opens to drain water however this control action comes too late to handle the inflow so the water depth exceeds the limit resulting in overflow rbc outflow and rbc both are much worse a larger amount of overflow occurs because the flow rate that can be discharged is limited fig 7e such unwanted spills and control failures also lead to poorer results than for the previous design storm event in terms of tss attenuation because overflow leaves the spill volume untreated fig 7h it is also noteworthy that unlike the previous design storm event rbc both does not show the best performance for load reduction in the given period in contrast mpc ekf adapts and copes with various hydrological inputs using forecasts here even though the height does not reach the maximum height during the beginning of rainfall events mpc ekf decides to intentionally discharge water to secure capacity to cope with the upcoming rainfall events even when discharge is unavoidable the amount of discharge is increased when the concentration is low so that the downstream load is minimized when the height limit is reached the valve is slowly opened to release water while maximizing the benefits of water treatment in this way mpc ekf can adaptively maximize the capacity of the pond for both flood and pollution control fig 4 summarizes the performance of the pond under a the design storm and b continuous real world rainfall events mpc shows the most balanced performance in both cases while the three selected rbcs struggle to balance between multiple objectives and struggle to prevent overflows for certain rainfall events this result indicates that mpc is advantageous in cases where multiple competing benefits are required and provides a flexible framework that can be adapted to meet multiple stormwater objectives under various storm events 4 discussion with climate change urbanization population growth and aging infrastructure placing increasing stresses on urban water systems deployment of real time stormwater control systems will help to manage flooding and pollutant loads while at the same time reducing the need for new stormwater infrastructure expansion the model predictive control and data assimilation strategy developed here provides an adaptive measure to substantially enhance the performance of existing stormwater detention basins through real time control retrofits by determining the outlet valve control strategy that optimizes both water quality and quantity goals over a receding time horizon our approach provides an explicit and adaptable framework that attenuates the total peak flow to the stream and improves water quality through sedimentation in addition our approach handles both sensor measurement error and pollutant forecast uncertainty by fusing real time turbidity data into the process model thereby demonstrating applicability to real world stormwater systems where both model and forecast uncertainty are large compared to rule based controls mpc offers three major advantages that make it a strong general framework for stormwater rtc first mpc has an explicit objective that can be optimized rule based controls rely on heuristics and do not guarantee optimality unless paired with a separate optimization framework while the outcomes correspond to solutions that meet the rule set they are not necessarily the best solution for a given scenario mpc on the other hand is an optimization algorithm that approximates a global long horizon solution by solving a local finite horizon problem because mpc directly computes the valve control strategy to minimize pollutant loads without intermediary proxies or rules it serves as an explainable and predictable framework for real time control second mpc readily extends to control problems with many different objectives and constraints while rule based control strategies can also be augmented with additional rules adding new rules may ultimately lead to complex decision hierarchies that are difficult to implement or analyze for instance with only two basic control rules rbc both features a relatively complicated hierarchy of conditional statements see algorithm s1 ensuring that these complex rules effectively balance between multiple competing objectives proves more challenging as the number of rules grows by contrast mpc is readily extended by adding more terms to the objective function with the relative priority of each goal defined by its weight thus instead of specifying a series of binary decisions at each time step mpc finds the control strategy that best balances between these weighted objectives making it highly extensible as an overall control framework last mpc is adaptable to changing hydrologic inputs and site conditions existing studies focus on rule based controls either reactive or predictive that require operators to establish fixed thresholds on the desired pond depth contaminant concentration or retention time the main drawback of this approach is that good thresholds are specifically tuned to one particular storm and study site and thus fail to generalize consider the problem of determining the proper water depth threshold to prevent overflows while also maximizing treatment capacity under rbc outflow if overflow prevention is required a conservative threshold must be placed on the water level that maximizes available capacity however this conservative threshold will also lead to reduced pollutant treatment for smaller storm events it is difficult to know a priori how the ideal thresholds for rule based control should be set without knowing the exact expected rainfall and pollutograph intensities and if novel storm events are encountered these pre selected thresholds may fail to perform as desired by contrast mpc adapts to each new site and rainfall event by computing an optimized outflow schedule based on the expected rainfall and pollutograph forecast furthermore this study shows that when paired with state estimation techniques i e ekf model predictive control is robust to uncertainty in pollutant forecasts this finding is significant because it shows that our technique can be readily applied to real world stormwater systems where pollutant dynamics are poorly characterized given the uncertainties inherent in runoff pollutant dynamics precise forecasts of future pollutant inflows are difficult to achieve in practice however the findings of this study show that when combined with real time sensor data i e turbidity measurements within a stormwater pond our mpc ekf approach is able to achieve near optimal flood reduction and pollutant removal benefits even when initial pollutograph forecasts are inaccurate this result highlights that combining real time control with state estimation significantly enhances the viability of real time stormwater control strategies under real world conditions 4 1 towards real world implementation while this study shows the potential for model predictive control to improve stormwater quality several research questions must be addressed to enable application to real world stormwater systems in terms of scalability future work should consider control of stormwater facilities at the watershed scale optimization of control measures at the local level can yield optimal performance for individual sites but does not guarantee maximum performance at the system level hence future work should extend the framework described in this paper to the watershed scale to provide a global solution for stormwater management systematic control of distributed stormwater facilities can coordinate individual elements to achieve city scale benefits similarly future research should investigate how our method can be integrated into a real time digital twin stormwater model which can address the real world problem of sparsely spaced sensors by estimating the states for ungauged locations to achieve system scale control bartos and kerkez 2021b furthermore investigating sensor placement algorithms may be required to decide how many sensors are necessary and where they should be positioned to enhance the performance of stormwater systems eulogi et al 2021 bartos and kerkez 2021a another natural extension of our study is the development of control strategies for the removal of different pollutants this work focuses on tss as the contaminant of interest thus the stormwater pond is modeled as a continuously stirred tank reactor with first order reaction kinetics however contaminant removal is often subject to much more complicated biological and physicochemical processes recent studies have developed a real time toolkit for complex water quality modeling mason et al 2021 and explored nutrient dynamics in stormwater treatment wijesiri et al 2022 mason et al 2022 such approaches should be incorporated into our control framework thereby enabling enhanced attenuation and treatment of pollutants like nutrients microbes metals as well as contaminants of emerging concern like microplastics such a contribution will enable more complete smart stormwater management by integrating the fields of control theory hydrology and aquatic chemistry in addition improving water quality predictions is crucial for future research this study shows that real time data assimilation enables the control strategy to remain robust to poor predictions but it is also clear that better performance can be achieved with more accurate predictions of water quality better understanding of pollutant dynamics is especially important in cases with significant hysteresis behavior or lag between the hydrograph and pollutograph future work should thus test control performance under more detailed pollutant generation and transport models when measured data are available these observations may be incorporated into water quality prediction models such as exponential or rating curve wash off functions or machine learning based models to capture pollutant dynamics more precisely ahmed et al 2019 chen et al 2020 in terms of reliability uncertainty in weather forecasts should be examined in future work while uncertainty in water quality measurements and predictions were considered our approach assumed full knowledge of hydrologic states mainly to maintain water mass balance to accurately compare the pollutant load and examine the effect of water quality variable for each scenario however in practice weather predictions are subject to significant uncertainty which might cause adverse impacts like overflows if not accounted for thus the impacts of incomplete knowledge and the resulting compensation of the performance remain to be investigated future work may consider the uncertainty in weather forecasts using a robust model predictive control approach shang et al 2019 or a hybrid markov decision process goorden et al 2021 5 conclusion this study develops a novel approach for active management of stormwater ponds that combines model predictive control with online data assimilation to mitigate flooding and improve water quality our approach provides an optimal valve control strategy based on nonlinear model predictive control with a receding horizon window along with an extended kalman filtering process that enables the assimilation of real time turbidity sensor data the resulting model predictive control algorithm outperforms the passive system at reducing pollutant outflows limiting erosion and preventing flooding with minimum control effort and more effectively balances between these competing objectives compared to commonly used reactive rule based control strategies this study is the first to integrate water quality parameters explicitly into the control objective function and does not require specification of site specific control rules or thresholds moreover by integrating real time data our approach shows strong and stable performance even under noisy sensor measurements and imperfect knowledge of influent pollutant dynamics these features make our methodology readily applicable to real world stormwater ponds without the need for extensive model or rule calibration dynamically controlled stormwater ponds with mpc ekf will facilitate environmental restoration reduce urban flooding and enable more sustainable and adaptive urban stormwater management for smarter future cities declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

pyrolysis reactions furthermore bond length calculations indicated that pfoa cleavage only begins to occur at temperatures in excess of those generated at the bubble interface i e 1500 k at the femtosecond level this suggests that pfoa vaporizes or injects by nanodrops upon attachment to the cavitation bubble enters the bubble and is then cleaved within the bubble by pyrolysis our research in low frequency ultrasonic horn system challenges the previous founding that defluorination of pfoa initiates and occurs at the bubble water interface we describe here that supplementing us based processes with complementary treatments may have undesired effects on the efficacy of us the mechanistic insights will further promote the implementation of us technology for pfas treatment in achieving the zero fluoro pollution goal graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords ultrasound persulfate pfoa langmuir type adsorption model bond dissociation energy pyrolysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas possessing at least one perfluoroalkyl moiety cnf2n 1 have been included in numerous industrial and consumer products since the mid 20th century cui et al 2020 trojanowicz et al 2018 they are a growing society concern due to their wide distribution persistence and high potential for bioaccumulation in the environment cui et al 2020 jin et al 2015 page et al 2019 pfas are frequently detected in aquatic ecosystems and thus pose a serious risk to human health li et al 2020 pfas are extremely resistant to conventional water treatment technologies owing to the exceptional strength of the carbonfluorine bond cf bond energy of 530 kj mol vecitis et al 2008b to date only partial defluorination i e remove fluorine atom from pfas molecules has been reported from most treatment technologies although the degradation e g cutoff of cooh head rate can reach up to 100 the produced shorter chain intermediates containing several cf bonds are likely to be even more recalcitrant and toxic than the precursor molecule appelo et al 2010 liu et al 2021 therefore complete defluorination i e decomposing all cf bonds into innoxious inorganic products to achieve zero toxicity should be the goal in pfas remediation however this remains a great challenge liu et al 2021 ultrasound us is soundwaves with frequency ranging from 20 khz to 2 mhz and can degrade a range of recalcitrant organic pollutants including pfas azam et al 2020 chatel 2019 mason et al 1988 applying us to liquids generates repeating patterns of compressions and rarefactions leading to the nucleation growth and implosive collapse of gas and vapor filled bubbles i e cavitation bubbles during bubble collapse a localized hot spot is formed where the temperature and the pressure inside the bubble increase to 5000 6000 k and 1000 2000 atms respectively while the temperature at the bubble liquid interface remains 1000 1500 k gole et al 2018 pollet 2010 suslick et al 1990 pyrolytic cleavage of recalcitrant organic pollutants thus occurs either within the bubble or at the bubble water interface furthermore hydrogen h and hydroxyl oh radicals eq 1 are produced inside the bubble and react directly with volatile pollutants in the gas phase or are released to the interfacial region and into the bulk solution kidak et al 2018 wu 2005 1 h 2 o o h h due to their surfactant property pfas tend to accumulate at bubble water interfaces indicating the suitability of us to defluorinate pfas hence accumulation at the interface is the first step prior to pyrolytic degradation or radical oxidation by cavitation it is generally accepted that pfas defluorination by us irradiation is initiated by breakage of the hydrophilic tail e g cooh to cnf2n 1 followed by stepwise elimination of the cf2 unit cao et al 2020 lei et al 2020 vecitis et al 2008b according to this mechanism fluoride elimination is accomplished through the reaction of cnf2n 1 with oh to form cn 1f2n 1cof which then decomposes to the short chain analogue cn 1f2n 1cooh although previous studies proved the excellent us performance for pfas degradation full defluorination at low frequencies is still an issue often necessitating additives such as io4 lee et al 2016 to promote full mineralization us is often coupled with sulfate so4 radicals that have a higher redox potential and longer lifetime than oh radicals 2 6 3 1 vnhe 30 40 ms compared to 1 9 2 7 vnhe 1 μs supplementing us with so4 thereby replacing oh is believed to improve oxidative pollutant removal by us duan et al 2018 ike et al 2018 lee et al 2020 oh et al 2016 liu et al found that so4 can render 93 5 degradation or 43 6 defluorination of pfoa after 30 h liu et al 2012 enhanced defluorination by so4 occurs due to the transfer of one electron from pfoa to so4 to form c7h15 liu et al 2012 yin et al 2016 this can also be extended to pfos removal as it can easily be converted to pfoa kim et al 2019 so4 supplementation can therefore in theory reduce energy consumption for pfas degradation the synergistic effects of us and so4 were demonstrated for pfas degradation 99 9 under single frequency treatment 20 khz where a synergistic index of 2 16 the defluorination ratio of us so4 to us alone 33 2 14 6 was observed lei et al 2020 however for full defluorination of pfas an even greater synergy would be required and key mechanistic questions regarding effective defluorination with so4 need to be addressed these include how so4 contributes to pfas defluorination under us irradiation how pfas and so4 anions interact with the bubble interface and how defluorination occurs with regards to the location in the cavitation bubble to answer these we investigated the application of a low frequency us system 20 khz horn system with enlarged power input to achieve complete defluorination of pfoa as a representative pfas persulfate s2o8 2 ps was used as the so4 precursor which is converted at the bubble water interface to so4 eq 2 wei et al 2017 2 s 2 o 8 2 2 s o 4 radical quenching tests in the us system as well as pfoa defluorination and degradation in the uv h2o2 and uv ps systems were performed to assess the roles of oh and so4 under us irradiation a defluorination kinetics fitted langmuir type model was used to describe the approach and partitioning behavior of pfoa in the presence of ps on the cavitation bubbles theoretical calculations of the cc and cf bond dissociation energies bdes and bond lengths were carried out to elucidate the defluorination mechanism by cavitation we hope these findings could fill a gap in understanding the mechanism of pfas defluorination by cavitation while providing a new perspective for pfas treatment in us based processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and solution preparation detailed chemical information table s1 and preparation of stock solution s1 are presented in the supporting information si 2 2 us based treatment fig s1 depicts the schematic of the laboratory scale experimental setup used in this study us based batch experiments were carried out under ambient pressure in a 100 ml cylindrical water jacketed glass reactor equipped with a 20 00 0 20 khz ultrasonic horn system ccy 20 fr mxmoonant with a stainless steel probe diameter 2 cm for a typical run the pfoa and ps stock solution was first diluted to the predetermined concentration i e 1 207 2 415 6 037 12 08 and 24 15 μm for pfoa and 0 5 1 2 5 5 8 and 10 mm for ps in a volume of 50 ml and then transfer this solution into the jacketed reactor next the ultrasound probe was immersed in the prepared solution at a depth of 1 cm and the cooling water water cooler cwp 100 green line thermotechnika crown cool was recirculated to keep the solution temperature at 17 0 1 0 temperature variation is shown in fig s2 to prevent the generation of so4 from thermal activation of ps park et al 2016 us based experiments were initiated by starting us irradiation on and off mode 5 min on and 2 min off blank test was carried out under the same conditions without us irradiation radicals quenching experiments were carried out under the same conditions in the presence of methanol scavenger for so4 and oh and the corresponding rate constants are 9 7 108 1 m s and 1 1 107 1 m s respectively monteagudo et al 2018 tba scavenger for oh and the corresponding rate constant is 3 8 7 6 108 1 m s li et al 2013 and methanol tba respectively all experiments were performed in duplicate

remain the same as us based treatment experiments were initiated by being exposed to uv irradiation samples were withdrawn using a syringe and filtered through a polyether sulfones pes 0 45 μm filter at the designated time so4 and oh were quenched with thiosulfate fagan et al 2020 and tba li et al 2013 respectively prior to analysis all experiments were performed in duplicate 2 4 sample analysis the concentration of fluoride ions was measured using ion chromatography ic dionex aquion ca usa equipped with an analytic column dionex ionpac as23 the parameters for each loop were illustrated in table s2 the defluorination rate was calculated with eq 3 3 d e f l u o r i n a t i o n r a t e f p f o a 0 15 100 where f is the concentration of fluoride released from parent pfoa molecule μm pfoa 0 is the initial concentration of pfoa μm and factor 15 corresponds to the number of cf bonds in pfoa molecule pfoa and decomposition intermediates were analyzed by an ultra high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry uhplc qtof ms the details are presented in the s2 ps in aqueous was measured by a modified spectrophotometric method using ki the detailed steps and the calibration curve are shown in s3 and fig s3 liang et al 2008 system ph and temperature were measured using a ph meter md 8000 l phenomenal 2 5 competitive adsorption model at the bubble water interface given the extremely short existence of the cavitation bubble and the instantaneous partitioning and pyrolysis of the attached pfoa at the bubble water interface a heterogeneous kinetic model based on a langmuir type adsorption mechanism was applied to model the behavior of pfoa towards the bubble water interface chiha et al 2010 the details of the model are described in the s4 the linear forms used to calculate equilibrium constant k defined as the ratio of the pfoa adsorption and desorption rate constants were found in table s3 2 6 theoretical calculations theoretical calculations were used to provide the detailed pyrolysis pathway after the partitioning of pfoa at the bubble water interface first bdes of cc and cf bonds in pfoa structure as a function of the temperature 300 k to 5000 k and pressure 0 atm to 2000 atm were calculated to speculate the initial steps of defluorination the bde for each bond in the pfoa molecule was calculated with eq 4 details are provided in s5 4 b d e h r a d i c a l f r a g m e n t 1 h r a d i c a l f r a g m e n t 2 h p a r e n t p f o a where h represents the enthalpy of formation at a certain temperature liu et al 2018 then the ab initio molecular dynamics aimd simulations were used to estimate the bond length change of the cc and cf bonds in pfoa structure at different temperatures details are provided in s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 suppression of pfoa defluorination by ps in us system 3 1 1 pfoa defluorination in us and us ps systems defluorination of pfoa was examined under us irradiation in the presence and absence of ps fig 1 a shows that us irradiation efficiently defluorinated pfoa 50 across a wide us power range 100 900 w at 20 00 0 50 khz the defluorination extent reached 90 06 2 h at a power input of 900 w where the parent pfoa was completely degraded fig s4 the increased cleavage of the cf bond with us power intensity can be attributed to the increased amplitude of the ultrasonic wave which generates more cavitation bubbles and accordingly more sites for pfoa partitioning lei et al 2020 ren et al 2019 furthermore more energy is released following collapse of more cavitation bubbles this increases localized temperatures and pressures lei et al 2020 ren et al 2019 leads to greater radical production eq 1 henglein 1987 and enhances pfoa defluorination at the bubble water interface and in the gaseous phase full pfoa defluorination was achieved by increasing the length of us treatment to 4 h at the highest power input previous study reported complete defluorination of pfos by sole us treatment at frequencies varied from 400 khz to 1000 khz within 4 h but almost no f released at the low frequency of 44 khz james wood et al 2020 their explanation of defluorination reaction by e aq is rather speculative nevertheless full defluorination of pfas by low frequency us often needs additives e g io4 45 mm 40 khz 120 w 2 h reaction time to synergize the treatments lee et al 2016 no fluorine ions fig 1a and no degradation fig s4 were detected by 1 mm ps treatment alone demonstrating that ps alone cannot defluorinate or decompose pfoa however providing 1 mm ps reduced the defluorination extent by 8 99 and 17 01 at us power inputs of 100 w and 900 w respectively this contrasts with what was previously reported for combining us and ps treatments fagan et al 2020 lu et al 2019 according to eq 2 so4 production increases in proportion with ps concentration although excessive ps might consume the produced so4 and oh eqs 5 and 6 here ps supplementation decreased pfoa defluorination rates 84 54 33 84 at all ps concentrations fig 1b regardless of radical yield indicating that so4 oh may not account for the cleavage of cf bonds 5 s 2 o 8 2 s o 4 s o 4 2 s 2 o 8 6 s 2 o 8 2 o h o h s 2 o 8 3 1 2 pfoa defluorination kinetics the pfoa defluorination kinetics were conducted under different conditions in the us ps system fig s5 and fig 2 in all experimental conditions pfoa defluorination was fitted by the zero kinetic model eq 7 7 r 0 d f d t k 0 where r 0 is the defluorination rate of pfoa in the zero kinetic model k 0 μm min is the corresponding rate constant of pfoa defluorination and f is the fluoride concentration released from pfoa molecules fig s6 one probable reason could be that organo fluorine 15 times of pfoa molecules is in excess during the reactions which makes defluorination independent of pfoa concentration hu et al 2018 within t 30 min increasing us power from 100 900 w increased defluorination efficiencies by 41 78 fig s5a and k 0 values by 37 03 fig 2a this further suggests that increasing the amplitude of the ultrasonic wave promotes pfoa defluorination moreover the well fitted zero order kinetics for pfoa defluorination at different us power inputs in the us ps system implies that pfoa defluorination is only limited by the bubble water interfacial adsorption sites vecitis et al 2008a even in the presence of so4 in us ps system as shown in fig 2b and fig s5b decreasing pfoa defluorination was observed with increasing ps dosage fig s5c shows a maximal defluorination of 24 02 at an initial pfoa concentration of 2 415 μm but decreased to 10 69 as pfoa concentration increased to 24 15 μm additionally the k 0 values decreased from 0 1450 μm min to 0 06455 μm min with an increase in pfoa concentration from 2 415 μm to 24 15 μm fig 2c as an anion s2o8 2 cannot be adsorbed at the hydrophobic bubble water surface but can approach to the interface as close as possible i e partitioning to the interface thus we hypothesized that the ps induced inhibition on pfoa defluorination kinetics originates from the interaction of ps with the cavitation bubbles due to their nonvolatile property at ambient temperature we can infer that pfoa accumulation and ps activation both occur at the bubble water interface with the same us power the interface area of cavitation bubbles in the bulk solution available for pfoa and ps partitioning should be the same we measured ps consumptions under us irradiation with and without pfoa table s4 the results show that 56 19 of ps was converted to so4 in milliq water while it was only 22 96 in the presence of pfoa this demonstrates the pfoa and ps competed for the adsorption sites at the bubble water interface since the same us power gives the same total energy input at a fixed period more available ps would consume additional us power for ps activation to so4 leaving less energy for pfoa decomposition it should be noted that the surface tension of cavitation bubbles is reduced by increasing salt concentration as described by lin et al 2015 for us sodium sulfate na2so4 leading to more cavitation bubbles and thus more pfoa degradation this however contradicts the expectation that less pfoa partitioning to the cavitation bubble by increasing sulfate concentration therefore a clear explanation is missing to scrutinize the roles of radicals and bubble surfaces in the defluorination process of pfoa 3 2 competition between ps and pfoa at the bubble water interface the competitive adsorption model was used to verify that pfoa defluorination under us irradiation is partitioning dependent and to quantitatively evaluate the effect of ps on the partitioning behavior of pfoa towards the bubble water interface first we calculated the gibbs energy change go of the us ps system with two ps dosages details are described in s7 hu et al 2018 liu 2009 the g for us 900 w ps 1 mm and us 900 w ps 10 mm were 34 07 0 12 and 32 69 0 11 kj mol table s5 respectively implying the partitioning of pfoa on the bubble interface in the presence of ps was spontaneous and feasible a langmuir type competitive adsorption model was then used to present the affinity of pfoa towards cavitation bubble at different ps concentrations the experimental data fig 3 fitted well with the form 2 table s3 with r2 of 0 9804 1 mm ps and 0 9730 10 mm ps demonstrating the defluorination of pfoa is partitioning dependent under us irradiation the calculated results based on form 2 were illustrated in table s6 the k is defined as the ratio of the rate constants for adsorption and desorption of pfoa at the bubble water interface s4 which describes whether the pfoa molecules are concentrated or not on the interface burns et al 2008 lu et al 2019 nanzai et al 2009 okitsu et al 2005 with the addition of 10 mm ps the k was approximately half that at 1 mm ps demonstrating that raising ps negatively affects the affinity between pfoa and the bubble water interface the ps can also partitioning to the bubble interface and thus competes with pfoa at the adsorption site adding ps to us systems can hinder the attachment of pfoa to the bubble water interface resulting in reduced defluorination in addition the activation of ps in us system is driven by the us energy transfer that can break the peroxide bond bde 92 kj mol of ps to generate two units of so4 benson 1978 lee et al 2020 okitsu et al 2005 hence the activation of ps reduces the energy available to pfoa further lowering the defluorination rate 3 3 exclusion of radicals on pfoa defluorination after pfoa was adsorbed onto the bubbles defluorination can undergo three possible pathways 1 direct oxidation by ps excluded already 2 oxidation by radicals and 3 pyrolysis under high temperature it is previously reported that the pfoa defluorination by so4 starts from decarboxylation with a formation of an unstable perfluoroalkyl radical c7f15 which then reacts with oh kim et al 2019 yang et al 2020 yin et al 2016 under us irradiation it is postulated that pfoa decomposes to c7f15 and cooh that react with so4 oh to allow radical enhanced defluorination lei et al 2020 to investigate how free radicals work in pfoa defluorination without the energy provided by us experiments were conducted without us irradiation so4 and oh were generated from activating ps and h2o2 by uv irradiation eqs 8 and 9 respectively 8 s 2 o 8 2 hv 2 s o 4 9 h 2 o 2 h v 2 o h no defluorination was observed with uv treatment alone and the defluorination rates in uv ps and uv h2o2 systems were all below 5 00 suggesting that both so4 and oh had a negligible contribution in fluorine elimination fig 4 a and 4b however some degradation of pfoa by uv 19 20 uv ps 28 03 and uv h2o2 21 43 was observed demonstrating that the 254 nm uv irradiation can break cc bonds promoted by so4 and oh fig s4 compared to us uv showed a higher ps conversion efficiency table s4 however the pfoa defluorination and degradation rates by uv ps 2 020 and 21 43 were much lower than us ps 78 58 and 92 60 under the same treatment time this further supports our conclusion that the excellent pfoa defluorination performance was mainly attributed to us irradiation and the role of so4 was insignificant this was further corroborated by radical quenching experiments fig 4c where no change in the defluorination and degradation of pfoa was detected after adding scavengers in the scavenger tests the potential influence of added scavengers to cavitation process and hot spot should not be overlooked due to their volatile property both methanol and tba are possible to evaporate into the cavitation bubble and then lower the collapse temperature hao et al 2014 and thus a reduced pfoa defluorination however from another perspective they are also surfactants capable of reducing the surface tension resulting in a reduced cavitation threshold and consequently an increased amount of cavitation bubbles merouani et al 2010 which favors the pfoa defluorination since we did not observe any obvious defluorination degradation changes with methanol tba and methanol tba mixture addition respectively we considered the changes in cavitational processes are negligible derived from competition of scavengers for partitioning to interface in conclusion it is likely that the high pfoa defluorination depended on the concentration and intensity of cavitation bubbles rather than the presence of oxidizing radicals it is reported that non equilibrium plasma may occur in noble gasses saturated water pflieger et al 2017 our experiments were not aerated by any noble gas and were conducted in air atmosphere resulting in an o2 rich system even if non equilibrium plasma exists its formed e aq would be easily quenched by the o2 or the h ph around 4 see fig s8 thus we did not consider the contribution of the non equilibrium plasma as well as the e aq to pfoa defluorination 3 4 theoretical calculation of pyrolytic defluorination within cavitation bubbles 3 4 1 changes of bdes of cc and cf bonds experimental results have demonstrated that the pfoa defluorination is likely dominated by pyrolysis at either bubble water interface or in the gaseous phase not by radical oxidations nonetheless it is impossible to capture the real reaction intermediates by lc ms due to the extremely short lived cavitation bubbles in addition the shedding of the ionizable group is another limitation that makes the pfas fragmentation undetectable by ms liu et al 2018 in our case only perfluorobutanoic acid pfba and perfluoropropionic acid pfpra were possibly detected but below the quantitation limit ms spectrum is shown in fig s9 hence the bdes of cc and cf bonds of pfoa were calculated to provide insights into the initial step of pyrolysis driven defluorination as shown in fig 5 the cc bdes 69 50 86 16 kcal mol are much lower than the cf bdes 110 23 120 65 kcal mol while the influence of pressure was minor the elevated temperature could reduce the bdes of pfoa suggesting the bond breakage is more readily to occur when pfoa molecules approach to the center of the cavitation bubble specifically compared to the cf bdes the cc bdes were more sensitive to temperature change e g when temperature increased from 300 k to 5000 k the c1c2 bdes decreased from 90 19 kcal mol to 73 08 kcal mol while c1f1 bdes reduced from 120 65 kcal mol to 117 58 kcal mol the pfoa mainly exist both in neutral and anionic forms at ph around 4 fig s8 since its pk a value is determined to be 3 8 burns et al 2008 thus the changes of bdes of cc and cf bonds for neutral and anionic pfoa as well as their intermediates pfba and pfpra were calculated figs s10 s11 and s12 the same trend was observed for pfoa and its intermediates for different forms in the process of approaching the localized hot spot hence we considered that the formed fluorocarbon intermediates undergo similar pyrolysis pathway as pfoa in the hot spot for pfoa molecule at any temperature the cc bdes decreased in the sequence of c1 c2 c2 c3 c5 c6 c3 c4 c4 c5 c6 c7 c7 c8 this also represents the cleavage order because the bond with lower bde is easier to break under the same conditions thus decarboxylation at c7c8 is the most likely initial step regarding cf bond the breakage was supposed to start from the weakest c7f7 bond followed by c3f3 c5f5 c4f4 c2f2 c6f6 and c1f1 note that the specific bdes values for bonds were different for neutral or anionic pfas form under the same temperature figs s10 s11 and s12 thus a different cleavage order may proceed for instance the c7c8 and c3c4 bonds possess the highest and lowest bdes of cc bonds in the anionic pfoa fig s11 since 100 defluorination rate was obtained it is reasonable to assume that almost all cc and cf bonds can cleave once the pfoa molecule approaches to the bubble water interface or enters the bubble core 3 4 2 pyrolysis driven pfoa defluorination inside cavitation bubble to map a comprehensive image of pfoa decomposition at the cavitation bubble we further calculated the time dependent cc and cf bond lengths at different temperatures by aimd simulations the cavitation occurs in microseconds such that the localized hot spot is formed at the instant of adiabatic implosion followed by a cooling rate over 1010 k s xu et al 2013 ye et al 2018 therefore our simulation was built based on this transient state in femtosecond level fs 10 15 s the notable increase in bond length presents the possibility of bond breakage and the corresponding time reveals the ease of bond breakage i e the shorter time the easier it is to break since pfas are always categorized as nonvolatile substances under ambient conditions the consensus is that in situ decomposition occurs after partitioning at the bubble water interface vecitis et al 2008b however to our surprise all the bond lengths were virtually unchanged even when the temperature was elevated to 2500 k for neutral pfoa which is almost twice the interfacial temperature 1000 1500 k at the bubble water interface fig s14 regarding the anionic pfoa the breakage of bonds begins at 1500 k after 8000 fs for c7c8 and c6f1 only fig s16 this temperature is much higher as compared to previous studies that the thermal decomposition of pfas began at 473 15 573 15 k by sole thermal treatment xiao et al 2021 it should be noted that our simulation was carried out in fs level while hours or even days of thermal treatment were necessary to obtain a complete decomposition of parent pfas and its decomposed short chain analogue crownover et al 2019 xiao et al 2021 further the experimental result of complete defluorination suggests the defluorination reaction did not occur at the interface although the aimd simulation was conducted in ideal conditions a fact that may have been overlooked is that the temperature at the bubble water interface is much higher than the pfoa boiling point about 465 55 k which allows the attached pfoa molecules to evaporate into the cavitation bubble likewise the relatively long lifetime 50 μs of cavitation bubbles in our 20 khz system may allow enough time for the pfoa to enter the gas phase furthermore the collapse of cavitation bubbles near the inner wall of reactor are asymmetric making it possible for the nonvolatile pfoa to enter the gas phase by the nanodroplet injection suslick et al 2018 xu et al 2009 moreover the surfactant property of pfoa also contributes to the asymmetric collapse fagan et al 2022 wu et al 2021 hence we hypothesized the decomposition of pfoa mainly occurs inside the cavitation bubble to verify this hypothesis we further increased the simulation temperature an almost simultaneous cleavage of the c2c3 and c1f1 2 bonds in neutral pfoa at approximate 7000 0 fs fig 6 a and 6d was observed under 3000 k while the other bonds remained stable within 10 000 0 fs the decomposition of anionic pfoa are more readily but only limited bond breakage was observed at 3000 k within 10 000 0 fs fig s16 this result strongly indicates the cleavage of bonds actually occurs inside of cavitation bubble and starts from the region close to the interface since the undecomposed pfoa molecules are able to diffuse to the bubble center we continued to increase the simulation temperature obviously the raised temperature makes the bond breakage more likely to happen fig 6a and 6d vs fig 6b 6c 6e and 6f and hence leads to a more complete defluorination snapshots at the end of the simulation are shown in fig s17 under 4000 k all the cc bonds except for c1c2 and more than half of the cf bonds can break and the breaking points were advanced for instance in comparison with that of 3000 k the initial breakage of the cc bond was shortened from approximate 6890 0 fs c2c3 3000 k to 756 0 fs c4c5 4000 k and 166 0 fs c4c5 5000 k while cf bond was from approximate 7140 0 fs c1f1 2 3000 k to 1448 0 fs c6f6 1 4000 k and 173 0 fs c7f7 2 5000 k this trend was more obvious at an even higher temperature of 8000 k the bond length change for neutral pfoa is depicted in fig s14 the details of bond breakage along the temperature are described in s8 although the increased temperature enables easier bond cleavage not all the bonds could be promoted taking the c4f4 2 bond as an example it kept stable at 3000 k and could break at 3870 0 fs at 4000 k 332 0 fs at 5000 k but 603 0 fs at 8000 k besides the breakage of all bonds occurs at the fs level indicating either defluorination or degradation process of pfoa is instantaneous within lifetime of cavitation bubbles micro second level meanwhile the defluorination intermediates generated should undergo in situ decomposition as well in the localized hot spot as evidenced by the high defluorination efficiencies the volatility rendered by the extremely high temperature makes the intermediates trapped in the gas phase preventing the formed short chain pfas from entering the bulk solution nevertheless some intermediates may still transfer back into the bulk solution as detected by the lc ms e g pfba and pfpra in our research previous study also reports that intermediates could be released from the hot spot e g pfhxa pfpa pfhpa pfba and pfpra were detected during 20 khz us treatment with a power input range of 150 375 w panda et al 2019 therefore combined with the aimd results we proposed a pyrolysis driven pfoa defluorination mechanism inside the cavitation bubble fig 7 primarily temperature determines the pathway and the initial cleavage of the cc bond always precedes before the cf bond which is in accordance with the bdes results however the fluorocarbon intermediates a k a perfluoroalkyl radical differ in different temperature c2c3 breakage at 3000 k and c4c5 breakage at 4000 5000 k the generated perfluoroalkyl radicals may be in situ decomposed or move toward the cavitation bubble core where the higher temperature allows for more effective cf cleavage until the formation of cf2 and cf radicals those radicals are still present at 4000 k but can break rapidly at 5000 k on the other hand the pfca radicals undergo decarboxylation to form perfluoroalkyl radicals that go through the same defluorination steps the leaving f generated from the breakage of the cf bond converts to f only when it is released to the liquid phase noted the cleavage of one cf bond makes the other f linking to the same carbon atom not equivalent e g the initial step of defluorination of pfoa at 4000 k occurred at c6f6 1 1448 0 fs but the c6f6 2 was stable since the results of the radical quenching test showed the contribution of oh was very minor we did not consider the oh involved defluorination pathway besides structures with multiple free electrons are likely to form unsaturated bonds and we gave examples in fig 7 the simulation results at different temperature files indicate the attachment of pfoa at the bubble water interface is the first but also the rate limiting step for pfoa decomposition which verifies the use of the competitive adsorption model to describe the behavior of pfoa towards the bubble water interface 4 conclusions the u s epa recently reduced health advisories limit of pfoa from 0 07 ng l epa 2016 to nearly zero 0 004 ng l epa 2022 requiring the development of zero fluoro pollution technologies in this paper us technology has shown great potential to achieve 100 pfoa defluorination without producing toxic byproducts the following conclusions are drawn our experimental and adsorption modeling results verified that pfoa defluorination rates rely on pfoa partitioning onto the cavitation bubble thus the availability of bubble water interface for pfoa partitioning is critically important additionally in the future combining different parameters such as s2o8 2 ions into the model could be a direction for extending it to a more universal interaction model we observed that ps in fact competed with pfoa for the adsorption sites and suppressed pfoa decomposition therefore when implementing us for defluorination of pfas any addition of chemicals that need to be activated at the bubble water interface should be carefully scrutinized for their potential adverse effects on the decomposition of any volatile hydrophobic target pollutants our theoretical calculations proved the pfoa defluorination mainly occurs inside the cavitation bubble and is initiated by extreme high temperatures most intermediates are also trapped in the cavitation bubble this indicates low frequency us is a viable approach for achieving complete defluorination of a variety of pfas and ultimately the zero pollution goal in summary the innovation points for this study are 1 demonstrating full defluorination of pfoa in low frequency us system without any additives 2 offering a different thought of persulfate s roles in ultrasonic pfoa defluorination and 3 proposing an updated mechanistic explanation of pfoa decomposition at different locations of the cavitation bubbles the combined experimental and theoretical results presented in this study provide a blueprint for further refinement of us technology to enable its energy and cost effective implementation for complete defluorination of one of societies priority contaminants since pfas is generally present at trace levels pre concentration using nanofiltration or foaming methods before degradation is necessary and would increase economic feasibility this suggests the possibility of scaling the us process for pfas

14862,advanced oxidation reduction of pfas is challenged and concerned by the formation of toxic short chain intermediates during water treatments in this study we investigated the complete defluorination of pfoa by ultrasound persulfate us ps with harmless end products of co2 h2o and f ions we observed 100 defluorination after 4 h of us treatment alone with a power input of 900 w ps addition however suppressed defluorination we demonstrated by kinetics fitted langmuir type adsorption modeling the added ps increased competition with pfoa for adsorption sites on the bubble water interface where radical oxidation and pyrolysis may occur providing sulfate so4 and hydroxyl oh radicals by means other than us did not defluorinate pfoa indicating that pyrolysis likely contributes to the high defluorination performance bond dissociation energies for cc and cf were independent of pressure but decreased at elevated temperatures within cavitation bubbles i e 5000 k favoring the pyrolysis reactions furthermore bond length calculations indicated that pfoa cleavage only begins to occur at temperatures in excess of those generated at the bubble interface i e 1500 k at the femtosecond level this suggests that pfoa vaporizes or injects by nanodrops upon attachment to the cavitation bubble enters the bubble and is then cleaved within the bubble by pyrolysis our research in low frequency ultrasonic horn system challenges the previous founding that defluorination of pfoa initiates and occurs at the bubble water interface we describe here that supplementing us based processes with complementary treatments may have undesired effects on the efficacy of us the mechanistic insights will further promote the implementation of us technology for pfas treatment in achieving the zero fluoro pollution goal graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords ultrasound persulfate pfoa langmuir type adsorption model bond dissociation energy pyrolysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas possessing at least one perfluoroalkyl moiety cnf2n 1 have been included in numerous industrial and consumer products since the mid 20th century cui et al 2020 trojanowicz et al 2018 they are a growing society concern due to their wide distribution persistence and high potential for bioaccumulation in the environment cui et al 2020 jin et al 2015 page et al 2019 pfas are frequently detected in aquatic ecosystems and thus pose a serious risk to human health li et al 2020 pfas are extremely resistant to conventional water treatment technologies owing to the exceptional strength of the carbonfluorine bond cf bond energy of 530 kj mol vecitis et al 2008b to date only partial defluorination i e remove fluorine atom from pfas molecules has been reported from most treatment technologies although the degradation e g cutoff of cooh head rate can reach up to 100 the produced shorter chain intermediates containing several cf bonds are likely to be even more recalcitrant and toxic than the precursor molecule appelo et al 2010 liu et al 2021 therefore complete defluorination i e decomposing all cf bonds into innoxious inorganic products to achieve zero toxicity should be the goal in pfas remediation however this remains a great challenge liu et al 2021 ultrasound us is soundwaves with frequency ranging from 20 khz to 2 mhz and can degrade a range of recalcitrant organic pollutants including pfas azam et al 2020 chatel 2019 mason et al 1988 applying us to liquids generates repeating patterns of compressions and rarefactions leading to the nucleation growth and implosive collapse of gas and vapor filled bubbles i e cavitation bubbles during bubble collapse a localized hot spot is formed where the temperature and the pressure inside the bubble increase to 5000 6000 k and 1000 2000 atms respectively while the temperature at the bubble liquid interface remains 1000 1500 k gole et al 2018 pollet 2010 suslick et al 1990 pyrolytic cleavage of recalcitrant organic pollutants thus occurs either within the bubble or at the bubble water interface furthermore hydrogen h and hydroxyl oh radicals eq 1 are produced inside the bubble and react directly with volatile pollutants in the gas phase or are released to the interfacial region and into the bulk solution kidak et al 2018 wu 2005 1 h 2 o o h h due to their surfactant property pfas tend to accumulate at bubble water interfaces indicating the suitability of us to defluorinate pfas hence accumulation at the interface is the first step prior to pyrolytic degradation or radical oxidation by cavitation it is generally accepted that pfas defluorination by us irradiation is initiated by breakage of the hydrophilic tail e g cooh to cnf2n 1 followed by stepwise elimination of the cf2 unit cao et al 2020 lei et al 2020 vecitis et al 2008b according to this mechanism fluoride elimination is accomplished through the reaction of cnf2n 1 with oh to form cn 1f2n 1cof which then decomposes to the short chain analogue cn 1f2n 1cooh although previous studies proved the excellent us performance for pfas degradation full defluorination at low frequencies is still an issue often necessitating additives such as io4 lee et al 2016 to promote full mineralization us is often coupled with sulfate so4 radicals that have a higher redox potential and longer lifetime than oh radicals 2 6 3 1 vnhe 30 40 ms compared to 1 9 2 7 vnhe 1 μs supplementing us with so4 thereby replacing oh is believed to improve oxidative pollutant removal by us duan et al 2018 ike et al 2018 lee et al 2020 oh et al 2016 liu et al found that so4 can render 93 5 degradation or 43 6 defluorination of pfoa after 30 h liu et al 2012 enhanced defluorination by so4 occurs due to the transfer of one electron from pfoa to so4 to form c7h15 liu et al 2012 yin et al 2016 this can also be extended to pfos removal as it can easily be converted to pfoa kim et al 2019 so4 supplementation can therefore in theory reduce energy consumption for pfas degradation the synergistic effects of us and so4 were demonstrated for pfas degradation 99 9 under single frequency treatment 20 khz where a synergistic index of 2 16 the defluorination ratio of us so4 to us alone 33 2 14 6 was observed lei et al 2020 however for full defluorination of pfas an even greater synergy would be required and key mechanistic questions regarding effective defluorination with so4 need to be addressed these include how so4 contributes to pfas defluorination under us irradiation how pfas and so4 anions interact with the bubble interface and how defluorination occurs with regards to the location in the cavitation bubble to answer these we investigated the application of a low frequency us system 20 khz horn system with enlarged power input to achieve complete defluorination of pfoa as a representative pfas persulfate s2o8 2 ps was used as the so4 precursor which is converted at the bubble water interface to so4 eq 2 wei et al 2017 2 s 2 o 8 2 2 s o 4 radical quenching tests in the us system as well as pfoa defluorination and degradation in the uv h2o2 and uv ps systems were performed to assess the roles of oh and so4 under us irradiation a defluorination kinetics fitted langmuir type model was used to describe the approach and partitioning behavior of pfoa in the presence of ps on the cavitation bubbles theoretical calculations of the cc and cf bond dissociation energies bdes and bond lengths were carried out to elucidate the defluorination mechanism by cavitation we hope these findings could fill a gap in understanding the mechanism of pfas defluorination by cavitation while providing a new perspective for pfas treatment in us based processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and solution preparation detailed chemical information table s1 and preparation of stock solution s1 are presented in the supporting information si 2 2 us based treatment fig s1 depicts the schematic of the laboratory scale experimental setup used in this study us based batch experiments were carried out under ambient pressure in a 100 ml cylindrical water jacketed glass reactor equipped with a 20 00 0 20 khz ultrasonic horn system ccy 20 fr mxmoonant with a stainless steel probe diameter 2 cm for a typical run the pfoa and ps stock solution was first diluted to the predetermined concentration i e 1 207 2 415 6 037 12 08 and 24 15 μm for pfoa and 0 5 1 2 5 5 8 and 10 mm for ps in a volume of 50 ml and then transfer this solution into the jacketed reactor next the ultrasound probe was immersed in the prepared solution at a depth of 1 cm and the cooling water water cooler cwp 100 green line thermotechnika crown cool was recirculated to keep the solution temperature at 17 0 1 0 temperature variation is shown in fig s2 to prevent the generation of so4 from thermal activation of ps park et al 2016 us based experiments were initiated by starting us irradiation on and off mode 5 min on and 2 min off blank test was carried out under the same conditions without us irradiation radicals

at the designated time so4 and oh were quenched with thiosulfate fagan et al 2020 and tba li et al 2013 respectively prior to analysis all experiments were performed in duplicate 2 4 sample analysis the concentration of fluoride ions was measured using ion chromatography ic dionex aquion ca usa equipped with an analytic column dionex ionpac as23 the parameters for each loop were illustrated in table s2 the defluorination rate was calculated with eq 3 3 d e f l u o r i n a t i o n r a t e f p f o a 0 15 100 where f is the concentration of fluoride released from parent pfoa molecule μm pfoa 0 is the initial concentration of pfoa μm and factor 15 corresponds to the number of cf bonds in pfoa molecule pfoa and decomposition intermediates were analyzed by an ultra high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry uhplc qtof ms the details are presented in the s2 ps in aqueous was measured by a modified spectrophotometric method using ki the detailed steps and the calibration curve are shown in s3 and fig s3 liang et al 2008 system ph and temperature were measured using a ph meter md 8000 l phenomenal 2 5 competitive adsorption model at the bubble water interface given the extremely short existence of the cavitation bubble and the instantaneous partitioning and pyrolysis of the attached pfoa at the bubble water interface a heterogeneous kinetic model based on a langmuir type adsorption mechanism was applied to model the behavior of pfoa towards the bubble water interface chiha et al 2010 the details of the model are described in the s4 the linear forms used to calculate equilibrium constant k defined as the ratio of the pfoa adsorption and desorption rate constants were found in table s3 2 6 theoretical calculations theoretical calculations were used to provide the detailed pyrolysis pathway after the partitioning of pfoa at the bubble water interface first bdes of cc and cf bonds in pfoa structure as a function of the temperature 300 k to 5000 k and pressure 0 atm to 2000 atm were calculated to speculate the initial steps of defluorination the bde for each bond in the pfoa molecule was calculated with eq 4 details are provided in s5 4 b d e h r a d i c a l f r a g m e n t 1 h r a d i c a l f r a g m e n t 2 h p a r e n t p f o a where h represents the enthalpy of formation at a certain temperature liu et al 2018 then the ab initio molecular dynamics aimd simulations were used to estimate the bond length change of the cc and cf bonds in pfoa structure at different temperatures details are provided in s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 suppression of pfoa defluorination by ps in us system 3 1 1 pfoa defluorination in us and us ps systems defluorination of pfoa was examined under us irradiation in the presence and absence of ps fig 1 a shows that us irradiation efficiently defluorinated pfoa 50 across a wide us power range 100 900 w at 20 00 0 50 khz the defluorination extent reached 90 06 2 h at a power input of 900 w where the parent pfoa was completely degraded fig s4 the increased cleavage of the cf bond with us power intensity can be attributed to the increased amplitude of the ultrasonic wave which generates more cavitation bubbles and accordingly more sites for pfoa partitioning lei et al 2020 ren et al 2019 furthermore more energy is released following collapse of more cavitation bubbles this increases localized temperatures and pressures lei et al 2020 ren et al 2019 leads to greater radical production eq 1 henglein 1987 and enhances pfoa defluorination at the bubble water interface and in the gaseous phase full pfoa defluorination was achieved by increasing the length of us treatment to 4 h at the highest power input previous study reported complete defluorination of pfos by sole us treatment at frequencies varied from 400 khz to 1000 khz within 4 h but almost no f released at the low frequency of 44 khz james wood et al 2020 their explanation of defluorination reaction by e aq is rather speculative nevertheless full defluorination of pfas by low frequency us often needs additives e g io4 45 mm 40 khz 120 w 2 h reaction time to synergize the treatments lee et al 2016 no fluorine ions fig 1a and no degradation fig s4 were detected by 1 mm ps treatment alone demonstrating that ps alone cannot defluorinate or decompose pfoa however providing 1 mm ps reduced the defluorination extent by 8 99 and 17 01 at us power inputs of 100 w and 900 w respectively this contrasts with what was previously reported for combining us and ps treatments fagan et al 2020 lu et al 2019 according to eq 2 so4 production increases in proportion with ps concentration although excessive ps might consume the produced so4 and oh eqs 5 and 6 here ps supplementation decreased pfoa defluorination rates 84 54 33 84 at all ps concentrations fig 1b regardless of radical yield indicating that so4 oh may not account for the cleavage of cf bonds 5 s 2 o 8 2 s o 4 s o 4 2 s 2 o 8 6 s 2 o 8 2 o h o h s 2 o 8 3 1 2 pfoa defluorination kinetics the pfoa defluorination kinetics were conducted under different conditions in the us ps system fig s5 and fig 2 in all experimental conditions pfoa defluorination was fitted by the zero kinetic model eq 7 7 r 0 d f d t k 0 where r 0 is the defluorination rate of pfoa in the zero kinetic model k 0 μm min is the corresponding rate constant of pfoa defluorination and f is the fluoride concentration released from pfoa molecules fig s6 one probable reason could be that organo fluorine 15 times of pfoa molecules is in excess during the reactions which makes defluorination independent of pfoa concentration hu et al 2018 within t 30 min increasing us power from 100 900 w increased defluorination efficiencies by 41 78 fig s5a and k 0 values by 37 03 fig 2a this further suggests that increasing the amplitude of the ultrasonic wave promotes pfoa defluorination moreover the well fitted zero order kinetics for pfoa defluorination at different us power inputs in the us ps system implies that pfoa defluorination is only limited by the bubble water interfacial adsorption sites vecitis et al 2008a even in the presence of so4 in us ps system as shown in fig 2b and fig s5b decreasing pfoa defluorination was observed with increasing ps dosage fig s5c shows a maximal defluorination of 24 02 at an initial pfoa concentration of 2 415 μm but decreased to 10 69 as pfoa concentration increased to 24 15 μm additionally the k 0 values decreased from 0 1450 μm min to 0 06455 μm min with an increase in pfoa concentration from 2 415 μm to 24 15 μm fig 2c as an anion s2o8 2 cannot be adsorbed at the hydrophobic bubble water surface but can approach to the interface as close as possible i e partitioning to the interface thus we hypothesized that the ps induced inhibition on pfoa defluorination kinetics originates from the interaction of ps with the cavitation bubbles due to their nonvolatile property at ambient temperature we can infer that pfoa accumulation and ps activation both occur at the bubble water interface with the same us power the interface area of cavitation bubbles in the bulk solution available for pfoa and ps partitioning should be the same we measured ps consumptions under us irradiation with and without pfoa table s4 the results show that 56 19 of ps was converted to so4 in milliq water while it was only 22 96 in the presence of pfoa this demonstrates the pfoa and ps competed for the adsorption sites at the bubble water interface since the same us power gives the same total energy input at a fixed period more available ps would consume additional us power for ps activation to so4 leaving less energy for pfoa decomposition it should be noted that the surface tension of cavitation bubbles is reduced by increasing salt concentration as described by lin et al 2015 for us sodium sulfate na2so4 leading to more cavitation bubbles and thus more pfoa degradation this however contradicts the expectation that less pfoa partitioning to the cavitation bubble by increasing sulfate concentration therefore a clear explanation is missing to scrutinize the roles of radicals and bubble surfaces in the defluorination process of pfoa 3 2 competition between ps and pfoa at the bubble water interface the competitive adsorption model was used to verify that pfoa defluorination under us irradiation is partitioning dependent and to quantitatively evaluate the effect of ps on the partitioning behavior of pfoa towards the bubble water interface first we calculated the gibbs energy change go of the us ps system with two ps dosages details are described in s7 hu et al 2018 liu 2009 the g for us 900 w ps 1 mm and us 900 w ps 10 mm were 34 07 0 12 and 32 69 0 11 kj mol table s5 respectively implying the partitioning of pfoa on the bubble interface in the presence of ps was spontaneous and feasible a langmuir type competitive adsorption model was then used to present the affinity of pfoa towards cavitation bubble at different ps concentrations the experimental data fig 3 fitted well with the form 2 table s3 with r2 of 0 9804 1 mm ps and 0 9730 10 mm ps demonstrating the defluorination of pfoa is partitioning dependent under us irradiation the calculated results based on form 2 were illustrated in table s6 the k is defined as the ratio of the rate constants for adsorption and desorption of pfoa at the bubble water interface s4 which describes whether the pfoa molecules are concentrated or not on the interface burns et al 2008 lu et al 2019 nanzai et al 2009 okitsu et al 2005 with the addition of 10 mm ps the k was approximately half that at 1 mm ps demonstrating that raising ps negatively affects the affinity between pfoa and the bubble water interface the ps can also partitioning to the bubble interface and thus competes with pfoa at the adsorption site adding ps to us systems can hinder the attachment of pfoa to the bubble water interface resulting in reduced defluorination in addition the activation of ps in us system is driven by the us energy transfer that can break the peroxide bond bde 92 kj mol of ps to generate two units of so4 benson 1978 lee et al 2020 okitsu et al 2005 hence the activation of ps reduces the energy available to pfoa further lowering the defluorination rate 3 3 exclusion of radicals on pfoa defluorination after pfoa was adsorbed onto the bubbles defluorination can undergo three possible pathways 1 direct oxidation by ps excluded already 2 oxidation by radicals and 3 pyrolysis under high temperature it is previously reported that the pfoa defluorination by so4 starts from decarboxylation with a formation of an unstable perfluoroalkyl radical c7f15 which then reacts with oh kim et al 2019 yang et al 2020 yin et al 2016 under us irradiation it is postulated that pfoa decomposes to c7f15 and cooh that react with so4 oh to allow radical enhanced defluorination lei et al 2020 to investigate how free radicals work in pfoa defluorination without the energy provided by us experiments were conducted without us irradiation so4 and oh were generated from activating ps and h2o2 by uv irradiation eqs 8 and 9 respectively 8 s 2 o 8 2 hv 2 s o 4 9 h 2 o 2 h v 2 o h no defluorination was observed with uv treatment alone and the defluorination rates in uv ps and uv h2o2 systems were all below 5 00 suggesting that both so4 and oh had a negligible contribution in fluorine elimination fig 4 a and 4b however some degradation of pfoa by uv 19 20 uv ps 28 03 and uv h2o2 21 43 was observed demonstrating that the 254 nm uv irradiation can break cc bonds promoted by so4 and oh fig s4 compared to us uv showed a higher ps conversion efficiency table s4 however the pfoa defluorination and degradation rates by uv ps 2 020 and 21 43 were much lower than us ps 78 58 and 92 60 under the same treatment time this further supports our conclusion that the excellent pfoa defluorination performance was mainly attributed to us irradiation and the role of so4 was insignificant this was further corroborated by radical quenching experiments fig 4c where no change in the defluorination and degradation of pfoa was detected after adding scavengers in the scavenger tests the potential influence of added scavengers to cavitation process and hot spot should not be overlooked due to their volatile property both methanol and tba are possible to evaporate into the cavitation bubble and then lower the collapse temperature hao et al 2014 and thus a reduced pfoa defluorination however from another perspective they are also surfactants capable of reducing the surface tension resulting in a reduced cavitation threshold and consequently an increased amount of cavitation bubbles merouani et al 2010 which favors the pfoa defluorination since we did not observe any obvious defluorination degradation changes with methanol tba and methanol tba mixture addition respectively we considered the changes in cavitational processes are negligible derived from competition of scavengers for partitioning to interface in conclusion it is likely that the high pfoa defluorination depended on the concentration and intensity of cavitation bubbles rather than the presence of oxidizing radicals it is reported that non equilibrium plasma may occur in noble gasses saturated water pflieger et al 2017 our experiments were not aerated by any noble gas and were conducted in air atmosphere resulting in an o2 rich system even if non equilibrium plasma exists its formed e aq would be easily quenched by the o2 or the h ph around 4 see fig s8 thus we did not consider the contribution of the non equilibrium plasma as well as the e aq to pfoa defluorination 3 4 theoretical calculation of pyrolytic defluorination within cavitation bubbles 3 4 1 changes of bdes of cc and cf bonds experimental results have demonstrated that the pfoa defluorination is likely dominated by pyrolysis at either bubble water interface or in the gaseous phase not by radical oxidations nonetheless it is impossible to capture the real reaction intermediates by lc ms due to the extremely short lived cavitation bubbles in addition the shedding of the ionizable group is another limitation that makes the pfas fragmentation undetectable by ms liu et al 2018 in our case only perfluorobutanoic acid pfba and perfluoropropionic acid pfpra were possibly detected but below the quantitation limit ms spectrum is shown in fig s9 hence the bdes of cc and cf bonds of pfoa were calculated to provide insights into the initial step of pyrolysis driven defluorination as shown in fig 5 the cc bdes 69 50 86 16 kcal mol are much lower than the cf bdes 110 23 120 65 kcal mol while the influence of pressure was minor the elevated temperature could reduce the bdes of pfoa suggesting the bond breakage is more readily to occur when pfoa molecules approach to the center of the cavitation bubble specifically compared to the cf bdes the cc bdes were more sensitive to temperature change e g when temperature increased from 300 k to 5000 k the c1c2 bdes decreased from 90 19 kcal mol to 73 08 kcal mol while c1f1 bdes reduced from 120 65 kcal mol to 117 58 kcal mol the pfoa mainly exist both in neutral and anionic forms at ph around 4 fig s8 since its pk a value is determined to be 3 8 burns et al 2008 thus the changes of bdes of cc and cf bonds for neutral and anionic pfoa as well as their intermediates pfba and pfpra were calculated figs s10 s11 and s12 the same trend was observed for pfoa and its intermediates for different forms in the process of approaching the localized hot spot hence we considered that the formed fluorocarbon intermediates undergo similar pyrolysis pathway as pfoa in the hot spot for pfoa molecule at any temperature the cc bdes decreased in the sequence of c1 c2 c2 c3 c5 c6 c3 c4 c4 c5 c6 c7 c7 c8 this also represents the cleavage order because the bond with lower bde is easier to break under the same conditions thus decarboxylation at c7c8 is the most likely initial step regarding cf bond the breakage was supposed to start from the weakest c7f7 bond followed by c3f3 c5f5 c4f4 c2f2 c6f6 and c1f1 note that the specific bdes values for bonds were different for neutral or anionic pfas form under the same temperature figs s10 s11 and s12 thus a different cleavage order may proceed for instance the c7c8 and c3c4 bonds possess the highest and lowest bdes of cc bonds in the anionic pfoa fig s11 since 100 defluorination rate was obtained it is reasonable to assume that almost all cc and cf bonds can cleave once the pfoa molecule approaches to the bubble water interface or enters the bubble core 3 4 2 pyrolysis driven pfoa defluorination inside cavitation bubble to map a comprehensive image of pfoa decomposition at the cavitation bubble we further calculated the time dependent cc and cf bond lengths at different temperatures by aimd simulations the cavitation occurs in microseconds such that the localized hot spot is formed at the instant of adiabatic implosion followed by a cooling rate over 1010 k s xu et al 2013 ye et al 2018 therefore our simulation was built based on this transient state in femtosecond level fs 10 15 s the notable increase in bond length presents the possibility of bond breakage and the corresponding time reveals the ease of bond breakage i e the shorter time the easier it is to break since pfas are always categorized as nonvolatile substances under ambient conditions the consensus is that in situ decomposition occurs after partitioning at the bubble water interface vecitis et al 2008b however to our surprise all the bond lengths were virtually unchanged even when the temperature was elevated to 2500 k for neutral pfoa which is almost twice the interfacial temperature 1000 1500 k at the bubble water interface fig s14 regarding the anionic pfoa the breakage of bonds begins at 1500 k after 8000 fs for c7c8 and c6f1 only fig s16 this temperature is much higher as compared to previous studies that the thermal decomposition of pfas began at 473 15 573 15 k by sole thermal treatment xiao et al 2021 it should be noted that our simulation was carried out in fs level while hours or even days of thermal treatment were necessary to obtain a complete decomposition of parent pfas and its decomposed short chain analogue crownover et al 2019 xiao et al 2021 further the experimental result of complete defluorination suggests the defluorination reaction did not occur at the interface although the aimd simulation was conducted in ideal conditions a fact that may have been overlooked is that the temperature at the bubble water interface is much higher than the pfoa boiling point about 465 55 k which allows the attached pfoa molecules to evaporate into the cavitation bubble likewise the relatively long lifetime 50 μs of cavitation bubbles in our 20 khz system may allow enough time for the pfoa to enter the gas phase furthermore the collapse of cavitation bubbles near the inner wall of reactor are asymmetric making it possible for the nonvolatile pfoa to enter the gas phase by the nanodroplet injection suslick et al 2018 xu et al 2009 moreover the surfactant property of pfoa also contributes to the asymmetric collapse fagan et al 2022 wu et al 2021 hence we hypothesized the decomposition of pfoa mainly occurs inside the cavitation bubble to verify this hypothesis we further increased the simulation temperature an almost simultaneous cleavage of the c2c3 and c1f1 2 bonds in neutral pfoa at approximate 7000 0 fs fig 6 a and 6d was observed under 3000 k while the other bonds remained stable within 10 000 0 fs the decomposition of anionic pfoa are more readily but only limited bond breakage was observed at 3000 k within 10 000 0 fs fig s16 this result strongly indicates the cleavage of bonds actually occurs inside of cavitation bubble and starts from the region close to the interface since the undecomposed pfoa molecules are able to diffuse to the bubble center we continued to increase the simulation temperature obviously the raised temperature makes the bond breakage more likely to happen fig 6a and 6d vs fig 6b 6c 6e and 6f and hence leads to a more complete defluorination snapshots at the end of the simulation are shown in fig s17 under 4000 k all the cc bonds except for c1c2 and more than half of the cf bonds can break and the breaking points were advanced for instance in comparison with that of 3000 k the initial breakage of the cc bond was shortened from approximate 6890 0 fs c2c3 3000 k to 756 0 fs c4c5 4000 k and 166 0 fs c4c5 5000 k while cf bond was from approximate 7140 0 fs c1f1 2 3000 k to 1448 0 fs c6f6 1 4000 k and 173 0 fs c7f7 2 5000 k this trend was more obvious at an even higher temperature of 8000 k the bond length change for neutral pfoa is depicted in fig s14 the details of bond breakage along the temperature are described in s8 although the increased temperature enables easier bond cleavage not all the bonds could be promoted taking the c4f4 2 bond as an example it kept stable at 3000 k and could break at 3870 0 fs at 4000 k 332 0 fs at 5000 k but 603 0 fs at 8000 k besides the breakage of all bonds occurs at the fs level indicating either defluorination or degradation process of pfoa is instantaneous within lifetime of cavitation bubbles micro second level meanwhile the defluorination intermediates generated should undergo in situ decomposition as well in the localized hot spot as evidenced by the high defluorination efficiencies the volatility rendered by the extremely high temperature makes the intermediates trapped in the gas phase preventing the formed short chain pfas from entering the bulk solution nevertheless some intermediates may still transfer back into the bulk solution as detected by the lc ms e g pfba and pfpra in our research previous study also reports that intermediates could be released from the hot spot e g pfhxa pfpa pfhpa pfba and pfpra were detected during 20 khz us treatment with a power input range of 150 375 w panda et al 2019 therefore combined with the aimd results we proposed a pyrolysis driven pfoa defluorination mechanism inside the cavitation bubble fig 7 primarily temperature determines the pathway and the initial cleavage of the cc bond always precedes before the cf bond which is in accordance with the bdes results however the fluorocarbon intermediates a k a perfluoroalkyl radical differ in different temperature c2c3 breakage at 3000 k and c4c5 breakage at 4000 5000 k the generated perfluoroalkyl radicals may be in situ decomposed or move toward the cavitation bubble core where the higher temperature allows for more effective cf cleavage until the formation of cf2 and cf radicals those radicals are still present at 4000 k but can break rapidly at 5000 k on the other hand the pfca radicals undergo decarboxylation to form perfluoroalkyl radicals that go through the same defluorination steps the leaving f generated from the breakage of the cf bond converts to f only when it is released to the liquid phase noted the cleavage of one cf bond makes the other f linking to the same carbon atom not equivalent e g the initial step of defluorination of pfoa at 4000 k occurred at c6f6 1 1448 0 fs but the c6f6 2 was stable since the results of the radical quenching test showed the contribution of oh was very minor we did not consider the oh involved defluorination pathway besides structures with multiple free electrons are likely to form unsaturated bonds and we gave examples in fig 7 the simulation results at different temperature files indicate the attachment of pfoa at the bubble water interface is the first but also the rate limiting step for pfoa decomposition which verifies the use of the competitive adsorption model to describe the behavior of pfoa towards the bubble water interface 4 conclusions the u s epa recently reduced health advisories limit of pfoa from 0 07 ng l epa 2016 to nearly zero 0 004 ng l epa 2022 requiring the development of zero fluoro pollution technologies in this paper us technology has shown great potential to achieve 100 pfoa defluorination without producing toxic byproducts the following conclusions are drawn our experimental and adsorption modeling results verified that pfoa defluorination rates rely on pfoa partitioning onto the cavitation bubble thus the availability of bubble water interface for pfoa partitioning is critically important additionally in the future combining different parameters such as s2o8 2 ions into the model could be a direction for extending it to a more universal interaction model we observed that ps in fact competed with pfoa for the adsorption sites and suppressed pfoa decomposition therefore when implementing us for defluorination of pfas any addition of chemicals that need to be activated at the bubble water interface should be carefully scrutinized for their potential adverse effects on the decomposition of any volatile hydrophobic target pollutants our theoretical calculations proved the pfoa defluorination mainly occurs inside the cavitation bubble and is initiated by extreme high temperatures most intermediates are also trapped in the cavitation bubble this indicates low frequency us is a viable approach for achieving complete defluorination of a variety of pfas and ultimately the zero pollution goal in summary the innovation points for this study are 1 demonstrating full defluorination of pfoa in low frequency us system without any additives 2 offering a different thought of persulfate s roles in ultrasonic pfoa defluorination and 3 proposing an updated mechanistic explanation of pfoa decomposition at different locations of the cavitation bubbles the combined experimental and theoretical results presented in this study provide a blueprint for further refinement of us technology to enable its energy and cost effective implementation for complete defluorination of one of societies priority contaminants since pfas is generally present at trace levels pre concentration using nanofiltration or foaming methods before degradation is necessary and would increase economic feasibility this suggests the possibility of scaling the us process for pfas

14863,the microbial activities in sewer biofilms are recognized as a major reason for sewer pipe corrosion malodor and greenhouse gas emissions however conventional methods to control sewer biofilm activities were based on the inhibitory or biocidal effect of chemicals and often required long exposure time or high dosing rates due to the protection of sewer biofilm structure therefore this study attempt to use ferrate fe vi a green and high valent iron at low dosing rates to damage the sewer biofilm structure so as to enhance sewer biofilm control efficiency the results showed the biofilm structure started to crush when the fe vi dosage was 15 mg fe vi l and the damage enhanced with the increasing dosage the determination of extracellular polymeric substances eps showed that fe vi treatment at 15 45 mgfe l mainly decreased the content of humic substances hs in biofilm eps this is because the functional groups such as c o oh and c o which held the large molecular structure of hs were the primary target of fe vi treatment as suggested by 2d fourier transform infrared spectra as a result the coiled chain of eps maintained by hs was turned to extended and dispersed and consequently led to a loosed biofilm structure the xdlvo analysis suggested that both the microbial interaction energy barrier and secondary energy minimum were increased after fe vi treatment suggesting that the treated biofilm was less likely to aggregate and easier to be removed by the shear stress caused by high wastewater flow moreover combined fe vi and free nitrous acid fna dosing experiments showed for achieving 90 inactivation the fna dosing rate could be reduced by 90 with the exposure time decreasing by 75 at a low fe vi dosing rate and the total cost was substantially decreased these results suggested that applying low rate fe vi dosing for sewer biofilm structure destruction is expected to be an economical way to facilitate sewer biofilm control graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biofilm structure ferrate extracellular polymeric substances humic substances biofilm control sewer management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sewer systems are among the most critical infrastructure assets for modern urban society and provide essential human health protection pikaar et al 2014 however the generation of sulfide in sewers can cause pipe corrosion which would lead to loss of concrete mass cracking of the sewer pipes and ultimately structural collapse sewer pipes suffering from corrosion often require premature replacement or rehabilitation which involves very high costs at many billion dollars every year jiang et al 2015 sun et al 2015 also the emission of sulfide from sewers can cause odor problems in the surrounding area and pose health risks to sewer workers in addition methane a potent greenhouse gas was also found to be generated in sewers it has been estimated that methane emissions from sewers contribute 34 to the total greenhouse gas footprint of wastewater systems willis 2017 the anaerobic microorganisms inhabited in biofilms attached to the sewer pipe are found mainly responsible for sulfide and methane production in sewers jiang et al 2015 sun et al 2014a thus for sewer odor corrosion and methane mitigation it is believed that controlling the sewer biofilm to prevent sulfide and methane generation is more favorable than reducing them after production jiang et al 2011b jiang et al 2015 to this end different biocides were investigated to kill or inhibit the microorganisms in sewer biofilms gardner and stewart 2002 jiang et al 2011a xu et al 2012 zuo et al 2020 however although many biocides have strong biocidal effects on planktonic microbes to kill or inactivate the microorganisms in sewer biofilms with a satisfactory ratio prolonged reaction time or increased dosing rate should be applied for example jiang et al found that to achieve over 90 of inactivation efficiency 0 3 mgn l of free nitrous acids equivalent to 120 mgn no2 at ph 6 with 24 hour continuous dosing was required in addition our previous investigation showed that although fe vi treatment could reduce the reaction time to less than 1 hour multiple dosing with a total dosage of 180 mgfe l is required yan et al 2020 therefore investigations are required to effectively decrease the reaction time and dosage of biocides in order to further reduce the chemical cost of sewer biofilm control the high tolerance of microorganisms in sewer biofilm to the biocides was mainly because of the protection effect caused by the intact biofilm structure actually biofilm is a protected mode of microbial growth in which microorganisms inhabited in an enclosed matrix to survive in hostile or adverse living environments as the toxic substances are hard to be penetrated flemming and wuertz 2019 to maintain an intact and stable biofilm structure extracellular polymeric substances eps secreted by microorganisms play a critical role eps mainly consists of high molecular weight organic polymers including protein pn polysaccharides ps humic substances hs extracellular deoxyribonucleic acid edna etc flemming and wingender 2010 li et al 2019 in addition eps can either be tightly or loosely bound to cells referred as to tb eps and lb eps eps establishes the functional and structural integrity of biofilms through weak physicochemical forces and confers cohesion and viscoelasticity to the biofilm structure di martino 2018 thus to enhance the inactivation effects of biocides on the microorganisms in sewer biofilm loosed biofilm structures may be preferred and the eps should be targeted first ferrate fe vi is a high valent tetraoxy iron and has a strong oxidizing ability with a redox potential fe vi fe iii couple up to 2 2 v jiang 2007 studies showed that fe vi could react with different types of organics without the generation of produce any mutagenic carcinogenic by products huang et al 2018 ni et al 2020 shao et al 2019 sharma 2013 our previous study showed that the multiple dosing of fe vi to sewer biofilm reactors can result in more solids in the effluent indicating that fe vi may be also effective in sewer biofilm structure destruction yan et al 2020 however so far it still lacks direct evidence of the impact of fe vi on sewer biofilm structure and the mechanisms of how fe vi may interact with sewer biofilm eps to destroy biofilm structure are unclear therefore this study aims to explore the impact of fe vi treatment on the structure of sewer biofilms morphological features of the biofilm and the architecture of eps after fe vi treatment were directly visualized by scanning electron microscope sem and the multiple fluorescence labeling coupled with a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm the change in sewer biofilm eps compositions and the reaction priority of fe vi with different functional groups in eps was also investigated to reveal the mechanisms of the interaction between fe vi and the biofilm further the variations of microbial interaction forces in the sewer biofilm and the potential enhancement of inactivation efficiencies by biocides after fe vi treatment were also evaluated the results of this study are expected to provide a fundamental understanding of how fe vi interacted with microbial biofilms and to facilitate the development of more effective and economical sewer biofilm control strategies based on the fe vi application 2 materials and methods 2 1 sewer biofilm setup and operation three lab scale reactors were set up in parallel to simulate the sewer system and develop sewer biofilms under anaerobic conditions figure s1 supporting information the reactors were made of perspex tm with an effective volume of 1l a diameter of 80 mm and a height of 200 mm three stainless steel rods were mounted inside the reactors and plastic carriers 1 cm diameter were clustered on the rods for biofilm development biofilms were attached to the carrier surfaces and reactors wall with an area of approximately 0 1 m2 the carriers could be taken out which allowed the sampling of intact biofilms the reactors were fed with domestic wastewater collected from a wet well every three days in yangpu district shanghai china the wastewater was transported to the laboratory immediately and stored in a freezer at 4 c the sewage typically contained sulfide at a concentration of 1 2 mg s l sulfate at a concentration of 30 40 mg s l and volatile fatty acid vfa at 50 100 mg cod l a peristaltic pump was used to deliver one reactor volume of sewage into each reactor every 6 hours and the sewage was heated to 20 c before entering the reactors a magnetic stirrer was placed under each reactor to provide continuous mixing 250 rpm which produce a moderated shear force and avoid solids from settling at the bottom batch tests were carried out to determine the sulfide and methane production rates i e spr and mpr every two weeks fresh wastewater was pumped into reactors for 6 min to thoroughly replace the liquid in the reactor at the beginning of the test and then sampled at 0 20 40 and 60 min for the analysis of dissolved sulfide and methane concentrations with the methods described in section 2 7 spr and mpr were calculated using linear regression of sulfide and methane concentrations relative stable spr and mpr suggest that the reactor reached the pseudo steady state and the following experiment commenced 2 2 fe vi treatment experiment the pseudo steady state biofilms were treated with fe vi to assess its effect on sewer biofilm structure and eps fractions a plastic carrier with attached biofilms was transferred into a 50 ml tube filled with filtered 0 45 μm wastewater different volumes of fe vi stock solution 1g fe l prepared by potassium ferrate k2feo4 purchased from weebeyond scientific trade co ltd shanghai were added into the tube to achieve the concentration of 15 30 45 mg fe l respectively it has been reported that fe vi dosing rate of 180 mg fe l should be added to reach a satisfactory biocidal effect on sewer biofilm as the fe vi should penetrate both the biofilm layer and the intact microbial cell wall however the purpose of this study is to destruct biofilm structure and fe vi does not need to penetrate the cell wall as a result lower fe vi dosing rates were tested the purity of potassium ferrate was checked by the colorimetric method as described by luo et al 2011 when making the stock solution the stock solution was made at ph 10 and the concentration was also checked to avoid mistakes the fe vi stock solution was used for the experiment shortly after preparation to avoid possible fe vi loss in storage the tubes after fe vi addition were then capped to avoid contact with air and gently mixed by an orbital shaker at 60 rpm for 15 min in the meantime another carrier was placed into a tube filled with fresh sewage and was also mixed under the same condition to serve as the control at the end of the test the carrier was taken out from the solution with fe vi and stored in fresh sewage for morphology observation and eps analysis as described in the following sections 2 3 scanning electron microscopy for biofilm morphology observation the effect of fe vi treatment on biofilm morphology and surface characterization was explored by scanning electron microscopy sem after fe vi treatment a small piece of biofilm with the substrate approximately 1 cm 1 cm was cut off from the carrier carefully and fixed with 2 5 glutaraldehyde at 4 c for 12h then the biofilm sample was washed three times with 0 1 m phosphate buffer saline pbs solution before it being fixed for 2 h by 1 osmic acid and washed with pbs solution again afterward different concentrations of ethanol 30 50 70 80 90 and 95 were used to dehydrate the biofilm for 15 min and then the biofilm was treated with 100 ethanol twice for 20 minutes each time followed by the mixture of isoamyl acetate v v 1 1 treats the sample for 30 minutes and then isoamyl acetate for 1 h finally it was dried with a critical point drier for sem observation sigma 300 zeiss germany 2 4 multiple fluorescence labeling and confocal laser scanning microscope observation multiple fluorescence labeling and clsm observation were conducted to determine the spatial distribution of sewer biofilm eps along the biofilm depth before the fluorescence labeling the biofilm samples with fe vi treatment 45 mg fe l and the control group were cryosectioned according to the method described in a previous study sun et al 2014b briefly the samples were washed with pbs 3 times and then embedded in tissue tek oct compound sakura japan after that the biofilm sample was settled on the base of the oct molds and frozen at 20 c and then the frozen biofilm was cryosectioned in a cryostat cm1950 leica microsystems germany the cryosectioned samples were mounted on slides and incubated with fluoresceinisothiocyanate fitc concanavalin con a tetramethylrhodamine conjugate solution and calcofluor white to stain the protein α d glucopyranose polysaccharides and β d glucopyranose polysaccharides respectively according to the method described by mu et al 2012 specifically fluoresceinisothiocyanate fitc 1mg ml in dmso 50 ul was first added to the samples for 30 min next the samples were incubated with concanavalin con a tetramethylrhodamine conjugate solution 0 25 mg ml in 0 01 m pbs buffer ph 7 2 for 60 min followed by adding calcofluor white 30 mg ml in 0 01 m pbs buffer ph 7 2 for another 30 min to stain α d glucopyranose polysaccharides and β d glucopyranose polysaccharides respectively the staining procedure was operated in dark at room temperature and the excess dye solution was washed with 0 01 m pbs buffer after each staining the excitation and emission wavelength for dyes and targets are shown in table s1 in si the stained slide was observed with a confocal laser scanning microscope nikon a1r japan ten locations were randomly selected on the slide photographed 2 5 eps extraction and analysis the eps extraction was conducted using the modified oscillation ultrasound method followed by the cation exchange resin cer technique as described by liu et al 2010 the biofilm was detached from the carrier by vigorous shaking and vortex mixing for 4 min with a ratio of 1 carrier to 2 ml water after that the suspension was centrifuged at 4000 g for 15 min and then the pellet was washed twice with pbs solution then the pellet was resuspended to a predetermined volume and then sonicated for 2 min at 60w the solution was horizontally oscillated for 10 min and then ultrasound was performed again under the same condition after that the lb eps was harvested by centrifugation at 10000 g at 4 c for 15 min the residue was resuspended and then treated with 60g g ds cation exchange resin macklin china and the mixture was agitated overnight on a magnetic stirrer at 4 c tb eps was harvested by centrifugation at 10000 g at 4 c for 15 min both lb eps and tb eps were filtrated through 0 45 μm membrane before the chemical analysis as described in section 2 7 the total eps mixture of lb eps and tb eps was also applied for fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis ftir the total eps was firstly dried to power for 48h using a freeze dryer scientz china after that the eps samples and dried kbr were mixed 1 100 and homogenized in an agate grinder 100 mg of the mixture was compressed and analyzed using a spectrum nicolet is50 ftir spectrometer thermofisher america the spectrum was obtained by scanning at the ranging 4000 400 cm 1 for 32 times with a resolution of 4 cm 1 2 dementional 2d correlation spectroscopy was conducted by 2dshige software kwanseigakuin university japan 2 6 extended dlvo xdlvo analysis the extended dlvo theory was employed to calculate the microbial interaction energy in the biofilm with and without fe vi treatment according to the xdlvo theory the total interactions wtot include three van der waals energy wlw electrostatic energy wel and acid base energy wab eq 1 which represent the electrodynamic

treatment tests by fe vi and fna to verify the damaging effect of biofilm structure by fe vi and develop a more efficient and cost effective sewer biofilm strategy fna was employed combined with fe vi to inactivate microorganisms in the sewer biofilm the procedure for fe vi and fna treatment is the same as that described in section 2 2 after fe vi treatment the liquid in the tube was replaced by the fresh wastewater and fna treatment was applied the dosing rate and exposure time for fna treatment are summarized in table 1 while the exposure time for fe vi treatment was kept at 15 min thereafter the viability of bacterial cells in biofilm was detected using live dead staining with the methods described in our previous study zhang et al 2022 briefly the biofilm samples were detached from the carriers in the filtered sewage then the suspension was incubated with live dead baclight bacterial viability kits molecular probes l 7012 the stained suspension was observed and taken 20 randomly selected area images using a fluorescence microscope eclipse 80i nikon corp japan with a halogen lamp 30 w 6 v the ratio of live and dead microorganisms was indicated by the relative abundance of green and red pixels via the image analysis software daime version 1 3 2 8 chemical analysis the sulfate concentration was measured by an ion chromatograph with a conductivity dector dionex ics 1000 sun et al 2018 and the sulfide concentration was determined by the methylene blue method sharma et al 1997 the dissolved methane was determined using gas chromatography equipped with a flame ionization detector the protein pn and humic like substances hs were determined using the modified lowry method with bovine serum albumin and humwic acid as the standards qian et al 2017 wang et al 2019 the polysaccharide ps was measured using the anthrone method with glucose as the standard lowry et al 1951 the dna was determined using dipheylamine colorimetric method with calf thymus dna sigma as the standard burton 1955 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of fe vi treatment on sewer biofilm morphology the sewer biofilm morphologies with and without fe vi treatment were compared in fig 1 the sem images showed that for untreated biofilm the intact microbial cells were arranged closely with a large amount of filiform or gel like substances wrapped around fig 1a these substances commonly recognized as a mixture of eps and other organic matter help to maintain a stable biofilm structure and protect microorganisms from external disturbance frieri et al 2017 however after fe vi treatment at 15 30 mg fe l the filiform substances were broken into pieces and the amount of gel like matter was also reduced fig 1b and c meanwhile large cavities were formed on the surface of the biofilm when the fe vi dosage was further increased to 45 mg l the biofilm structure could be severely damaged with microbe cells being bared and shriveled the ruptures and erosion spots also appeared on the cell surface fig 1d this result suggested that fe vi treatment can change the morphological characteristics of the sewer biofilm with microbial cell distribution being more discrete as a result the microorganisms in the biofilm may be more vulnerable to environmental shocks and the overall structures of the biofilm could become unstable it is well known that to maintain a stable biofilm structure and protect microbes inside eps plays a critical role luongo and zhang 2010 therefore in the following sections the interaction of fe vi with eps of the sewer biofilm was investigated to provide more insights into how fe vi affected the sewer biofilm structures 3 2 fe vi treatment changes the compositions and spatial distribution of eps in sewer biofilms 3 2 1 variation in eps compositions caused by fe vi treatment the compositions of eps i e pn ps hs and edna in both the lb and tb layers were measured to reveal a comprehensive understanding of the effect of fe vi treatment as shown in fig 2 a the total eps in the untreated biofilm was 0 16 g gvss with the content of tb eps being 2 7 times higher than that of lb eps after being treated with fe vi the total eps decreased gradually to 0 12 g gvss with the fe vi concentration increased to 45 mg fe l however the content of lb eps remained at a similar level after fe vi treatment therefore the decrease in the total eps was mainly a result of the decline in tb eps content which was reduced by 8 to 32 when fe vi concentration increased from 15 mg fe l to 45 mg fe l the eps wrapped around the microbial cells was distributed in a dynamic stratified way with tb eps existing close to the cells while lb eps located farther from the cells the reduction in tb eps suggested that fe vi at tested concentrations 15 45 mg fe l could penetrate and react with the inner layer of the eps as a result the bonding of tb eps with microbial cells was loosed and the tb eps was shifted into the lb eps making the lb eps amount stable however since tb eps played a more important role in microbial flocculation and aggregation jia et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 the reduction in tb eps content could pose a more adverse impact on a stable biofilm structure compared with lb eps the proportions of ps pn hs and dna in the tb eps and lb eps fractions with and without fe vi treatment were compared in fig 3 b and c the results showed that pn and hs were the main component of eps in untreated sewer biofilm which were followed by ps and edna after fe vi treatment the content of hs showed the most considerable reduction among these four compounds the hs in the tb eps decreases gradually from 0 054 g gvss to 0 03 g gvss when the fe vi dosage reached 45 mg fe l meanwhile the hs in the lb eps also reduced from 0 01 g gvss to 0 006 g gvss resulting in the total hs content decreasing by 44 at the fe vi dosage of 45 mg fe l ps content also decreased in both tb eps and lb eps after fe vi treatment however unlike the progressive decrease of hs with the increase of fe vi dosage the decrease in ps with the fe vi dosage increase to 15 30 mg fe l was less significant within 5 the obvious ps reduction was achieved when the fe vi dosage reach 45 mg fe l with an overall reduction ratio of 34 41 and 23 for tb eps and lb eps respectively as for pn and edna relatively significant decreases of 16 and 30 in tb eps were observed with fe vi dosage of 90 mg fe l however at this dosage their contents in lb eps were slightly increased and as a result the total decrease of pn and edna in the eps was only about 7 and 8 respectively this result suggested that fe vi altered the eps structure so that some pn and dna in the tb eps were shifted to the lb eps this is consistent with a stable lb eps concentration after fe vi treatment as shown in fig 2a 3 2 2 reaction priority of functional groups in eps with fe vi treatment the 2 d ftir analysis was applied to reveal the changes of functional groups in sewer biofilm eps by fe vi treatment with the increase of the dosage fig 3 the synchronous map showed that all the cross peaks were positively correlated suggesting that the dominant functional groups in the eps were reduced with fe vi treatment meanwhile the combining analysis of asynchronous and synchronous maps could tell the reaction priority of these functional groups with fe vi dosage increasing as indicated in fig 3 the peaks at 1040 1080 1120 1160 cm 1 were mostly sensitive to fe vi treatment the peaks at 1040 1080 cm 1 were identified as c o c in aromatic or aliphatic ethers and bands at 1120 1160 cm 1 were mainly caused by stretching vibration of c oh in alcohol phenol groups as well as polysaccharides noble et al 1974 yin et al 2015 the peak at 1650 cm 1 also showed significant sensitivity by fe vi treatment which was then followed by peaks at 1450 1520 cm 1 the peaks at 1650 cm 1 were commonly caused by the stretching vibration of c o in carboxyl ketones and quinone groups while peaks at 1450 1520 cm 1 were featured peaks of aromatic conjugated structures ricci et al 2015 sen and chandra 2007 on the other hand the peaks at 1720 1860 1380 1250 980 cm 1 were more resistant to fe vi treatment these peaks were mainly caused by the stretching vibration of c o in anhydride or ester 1720 1860 cm 1 bending vibration of c h in alkyl and aryl 1380 980 cm 1 and stretching vibration of c n in amine 1250 cm 1 ricci et al 2015 sharif and ahmad 2020 as the typical hs structure was formed based on a motif of aromatic quinones nuclei linked by ether bonds with phenolic and carboxylic substituents stevenson 1994 the venerable of c o c in aromatic ethers c oh in alcohol phenol groups c o in carboxyl and quinone groups as well as aromatic conjugated structures to fe vi treatment as indicated by 2d ftir may explain why hs content was decreased more significantly after fe vi treatment compared to other substances as observed in fig 2 3 2 3 variation in spatial distributions of eps after fe vi treatment the architecture of eps in sewer biofilm was visualized using multiple fluorescence labeling combined with the clsm technique in this study proteins α d glucopyranose polysaccharides and β d glucopyranose polysaccharides in the biofilm eps were stained with green red and blue fluorescence respectively as shown in fig 4 in untreated sewer biofilm proteins accounted for a higher fraction than polysaccharides and they could be presented in the depths of the biofilm on the other hand the polysaccharides were mainly located near the biofilm surface after fe vi treatment at 45 mg fe l the content of polysaccharides especially those close to the biofilm surface decreased significantly while the content of protein decreased by a less extent it could be reasonable as the substances at the biofilm surface could more readily react with fe vi than those near the substratum given the penetration of fe vi into the biofilm could be limited also the c o and oh groups in the polysaccharides were more sensitive to fe vi oxidation than c n in proteins as discussed in section 3 2 2 moreover the comparison of clsm images showed that sewer biofilm without fe vi treatment presented in a dense structure with eps arranged closely whereas after fe vi exposure more holes appeared in the inner part of the biofilm this result was consistent with the morphology observation illustrated by the sem images fig 1 further confirming that fe vi treatment damaged the sewer biofilm resulting in a loose structure inside the biofilm 3 3 the changes of microbial interaction energy after fe vi treatment based on xdlvo analysis sewer biofilm could be considered as the aggregation of abundant microbes and its structure namely the aggregation state was determined based on microbial interaction energy according to a thermodynamics viewpoint thus in this study the xdlvo model was applied to predict the microbial interaction energy change according to fe vi treatment in order to provide a theoretical explanation of how fe vi treatment affects the sewer biofilm structure and the consequence after treatment in the xdlvo theory the total microbial interaction energy wtot was described as a sum up of the van der waals energy wlw electrostatic double layer energy wel and lewis acid base interactions energy wab as a function of separation distance bos et al 1999 as shown in fig 5 a the negativity of wlw slightly decreased after fe vi treatment indicating a weaker attraction between cells however the van der waals attraction decreased over a short range thus its contribution to the total microbial interaction energy was not significant fig 5b compared the profiles of wel along the separation distances suggesting electrical double layer repulsion was decreased after fe vi treatment wel is highly related to the zeta potential of the microbial cells xu et al 2016 and our results showed that the negativity of the zeta potential increased from 15 6 to 16 7 mv after fe vi treatment the reduction could probably be due to the increase in surface negative charge and consequently induced electrostatic repulsion for cell to cell interactions ozkan and berberoglu 2013 as presented in fig 5c wab is the predominant contributor to the total interaction energy as it is much higher than wlw and wel the wab can be hydrophobic attraction or hydrophilic repulsion bayoudh et al 2009 and the positive wab in this study suggested a repulsive interaction the increase of wab after fe vi treatment indicated an increased repulsion between the biofilm cells the total microbial interaction profiles with and without fe vi treatment were compared in fig 5d the summit in the profile referred to the energy barrier of the microbial interaction which means to stably aggregate the microbial cell should have sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the barrier fig 5b showed that the biofilm after fe vi treatment exhibited much higher energy barriers 1 57 103 kt compared with the untreated one 8 64 102 kt this indicated that the cells in the biofilm are more difficult to approach each other after fe vi treatment moreover the inset of fig 5d showed the secondary energy minimum which could represent the ability of cells to detach from biofilm redman et al 2004 the secondary energy minimum of the untreated biofilm was 1 4 kt while it increased to 1 0 kt after fe vi treatment therefore after fe vi treatment the sewer biofilm would become less stable in the structure with a deteriorated adhesion and aggregation ability 3 4 fe vi treatment enhanced the inactivation efficiency of biocides on sewer biofilms using biocides to suppress sewer biofilm activities is a preferred practice for sulfide and methane control in sewers however a high concentration of biocides or long exposure time were often required to achieve a satisfying inactivation efficiency jiang et al 2011b based on the effect of fe vi treatment on biofilm structures as revealed above it is worthwhile to evaluate if the inactivation efficiency of biocides could be improved after fe vi treatment thus in this study a cost efficient and environmentally friendly biocide free nitrous acids fna were applied and the synergistic inactivation effect of fe vi and fna on sewer biofilm was explored as shown in fig 6 the inactivation efficiencies with fna treatment only were limited in the range of 3 9 14 9 for one hour exposure and 25 5 29 6 for three hour exposure when the fna dosage was 0 025 0 15 mgn l after fe vi treatment at 15 mg fe l the inactivation efficiencies were increased to 14 1 47 0 for one hour exposure and 52 7 55 3 for three hour exposure with the same fna dosing rate when the fe vi dosage was increased to 30 mg fe l the inactivation efficiencies were further enhanced to 77 5 88 0 for one hour exposure and 92 5 98 5 for three hour exposure however for fna treatment only 0 26 mgn l with 12 hour exposure was required to achieve a similar inactivation efficiency 90 jiang et al 2011b it is clear that inactivation efficiency was considerably elevated with the application of fe vi assuming that the theoretical inactivation efficiency of the combined fe vi and fna treatment was the product of inactivation efficiencies of the separated fe vi treatment and fna treatment as indicated by asterisks in fig 6 thus the synergistic inactivation efficiencies of fna and fe vi at 15 mg fe l were generally about 20 27 higher than theoretical inactivation efficiency in all cases except for fna dosage of 0 025 mgn l with one hour exposure fig 6 furthermore fe vi treatment at 30 mg fe l could enhance the synergistic inactivation efficiency by 45 51 compared with the theoretical values the results suggested that the enhanced inactivation efficiency was mainly related to fe vi dosage but regardless to fna dosage and its exposure time this further confirmed the important role of fe vi in enhancing the inactivation efficiency of biocides with reduced dosage and exposure time 4 discussion 4 1 key mechanisms of how fe vi treatment causing sewer biofilm destruction the results of this study suggested that fe vi treatment could effectively damage the sewer biofilm structure mainly through the destruction of humic substances as the most abundant organic matter in the eps of the sewer biofilm fig 2 hs could play a critical role in maintaining a stable biofilm structure in terms of conformation hs is reported to consist of a skeleton of alkyl or aromatic units cross linked via c o with many groups such as carboxylic phenolic and alcoholic hydroxyls ketones quinine etc lipczynska kochany 2018 sutton and sposito 2005 meanwhile the moieties in hs could also hold together by low energy bonds such as van der waals ion dipole forces and hydrogen bonds nuzzo et al 2013 trevisan et al 2010 the hs were reported to have a strong ability to form complexes with micro aggregates and organic substances through electrostatic interactions bridging interactions and steric interactions calabi floody et al 2011 kang and xing 2008 xu et al 2020 thus in sewer biofilm matrix the high abundance of humic substances could adsorb other organic substances such as protein polysaccharide and edna to form a random coil dense structure wrapped around microbial cells through highly cross linked chains however after fe vi treatment the hs in sewer biofilm eps was largely decreased fig 3 the results of this study suggested that fe vi may cause hs decrease in multiple ways fig 7 firstly the 2d ftir analysis suggested the c o bonds in aromatic or aliphatic ethers are venerable to fe vi treatment and thus the large molecular structure of hs could be breakdown directly additionally the functional groups such as oh and c o in the hs were also sensitive to fe vi treatment meanwhile our previous study showed that the ph of the wastewater after fe vi treatment could increase over 9 yan et al 2020 the destruction of these functional groups together with the increase in ph could lead to the destruction of intermolecular hydrogen bonds which are also responsible for a stable hs structure piccolo and celano 1994 the decrease of the hydrogen bonds after fe vi treatment also could be supported by the decrease of the band at 3460 cm 1 in the ftir spectra figure s2 moreover the featured peaks of aromatic conjugated structures were also attacked by fe vi treatment fig 4 the breakage of the aromatic conjugated structures may decrease the π π interaction and contribute to the crush of coiled hs pseudo micelles the fragmented hs in tb eps after fe vi treatment could be transformed into lb eps and released into the wastewater water it has been reported that without hs the coiled chain extracellular organic matter was turned extended and the spatial shape would become more dispersed xu et al 2020 such structure of eps would consequently result in a loosed biofilm structure fig 7 the result of our study further suggested that the high hs content can be a typical characteristic of sewer biofilm which accounted for 40 of the total eps fraction the high hs composition in sewer biofilm was also reported by jahn et al 1998 who observed that the highest hs proportion in eps could reach 53 8 in the biofilm collected from a gravity sewer in demark in comparison the hs in eps of activated sludge was normally about 20 or even lower sheng et al 2010 the higher hs fraction in sewer biofilm might be related to the much longer retention time of the biofilm in sewers than that of activated sludge in wwtp the high retention time favored the decomposition of the adsorbed cellulose and lignin which is a relatively slow microbial process but is considered as the first stage of humification polak et al 2009 as our results suggested that fe vi is more effective to remove hs than pn and ps in the eps the fe vi treatment could be more applicable to remove disintegrate biofilms or sludge flocs with high hs content 4 2 fe vi dosing at low rates facilitates the sewer biofilm control in multiple ways fe vi has been proven to effectively kill the microorganisms in sewer biofilm but to achieve a satisfactory biocidal effect for sewer biofilm control a relatively high dosing rate is required however the results of this study indicated the low rate fe vi dosing could result in a loose biofilm structure by destroying the eps which can also facilitate sewer biofilm control in different ways firstly the loosed biofilm structure caused by fe vi dosing could reduce the mechanical stability of sewer biofilms this is confirmed by the xdlvo analysis as the secondary energy minimum was increased after fe vi treatment fig 4d as a consequence the sewer biofilm could be more easily to be detached by external forces such as shear stress caused by high sewerage flow fig 7 our preliminary experimental results showed that the detachment ratios of the biofilm after fe vi treatment at 15 45 mgfe l were 1 4 2 3 times as high as that of the untreated biofilm figure s3 with the water shear stress created by an orbital shaker at 250 rpm on this basis a new and low cost solution for sewer biofilm control could be proposed by the combined effect of fe vi and wastewater flushing namely after applying a suitable rate of fe vi treatment the loosed sewer biofilm could be eroded by the wastewater flushing resulting in a relatively clean sewer wall to prevent sulfide and methane production in practice for pressure sewers the fe vi could be dosed when the wastewater flow rate was low afterward the pump at the beginning of the sewer could be regulated to a high flow rate so that the loosed biofilm after fe vi treatment can be detached by the high shears created by high flow as for gravity sewers the fe vi would preferably be dosed when the flow rate was high in this case the water level in the sewer pipe is high and as a result most biofilm covered on the sewer wall could be reacted with fe vi the flush flow in the gravity sewer could be created by applying some self flushing devices schaffner and steinhardt 2011 shahsavari et al 2017 the detached microorganisms are not expected to stay in sewers for long period as they would flow with the wastewater to the treatment facilities since a self clean velocity should be maintained during the sewer operation even if some blocks may deposit in sewers they could be removed through routine dredging as the shear stress caused by wastewater can be different in sewers efforts are worth being dedicated in the future to investigate the co effect of shear stress and fe vi dosing rates on sewer biofilm removal to optimize fe vi dosage under different conditions in addition the low rate fe vi dosing could also facilitate sewer biofilm control by enhancing the inactivation efficiency of biocides on microorganisms in the biofilm fig 6 previous studies have summarized potential reasons for a high level of biofilms resistance to different biocide among which an important mechanism involved the diffusion limitations bridier et al 2011 multiple layers of cells and eps may constitute a complex and compact structure within which biocides were difficult to penetrate and reach internal layers thus hampering their efficacy moreover biocide molecules may simply adsorb to matrix components such as eps in biofilms and their penetration were hindered however when fe vi was applied to the biofilm it disrupted the compositions and integrity of eps and disaggregated biofilm clumps moreover as the functional groups of humic acids in eps were largely destroyed by fe vi its adsorption ability was consequently reduced thus the biocide added after fe vi treatment could augment its penetration and reach the internal layer of biofilm and inactivation efficiency could be enhanced fig 7 the enhanced efficiency indicated that both the dosing rate and exposure time of the biocide could be reduced and consequently the chemical cost can be saved it has been reported that the single fe vi dosing and single fna dosing were the two most economical chemical dosing methods for sulfide control 1 6 2 2 kg s jiang et al 2011a yan et al 2020 for other chemicals such as ferric ferrous and nitrate the cost of 5 24 kg s can be reached bertrán et al 2007 nielsen et al 2005 rodríguez gómez et al 2005 saracevic et al 2007 as revealed in section 3 4 to achieve a similar inactivation efficiency 90 compared to fna treatment only 0 26 gn l with a reaction time of 12h the pre fe vi dosing at 30 mgfe l for 15 min would reduce the fna dosing rate by 90 0 025 mgn l with fe vi pre dosing vs 0 26 gn l without and the exposure time by 75 3h with fe vi pre dosing vs 12h without thus it could be estimated that the total chemical cost for combined fe vi 30mgfe l for 15 min and fna dosing 0 025 mgn l for 12h was about 14 of that for dosing fna only and 20 of that for dosing fe vi only jiang et al 2011a yan et al 2020 thus applying low rate fe vi dosing in sewers is expected to facilitate sewer biofilm control to prevent odor corrosion and greenhouse gas emissions in an economical way 5 conclusions this study investigated the effect of ferrate fe vi dosing on sewer biofilm structure so as to facilitate sewer biofilm control for corrosion odor and greenhouse gas mitigation the main conclusions are low rate fe vi dosing can cause the destructive effect on the sewer biofilm structure with the effect enhanced with the increasing dosing rate fe vi dosing primarily reduced the content of humic substances hs in sewer biofilm eps as a result the coiled chain of eps maintained by hs was turned dispersed and consequently led to a loosed biofilm structure the reduction of hs in eps was mainly ascribed to that key functional groups for holding malmolecular hs such as c o oh and c o were more vulnerable to fe vi treatment fe vi treatment enhanced the microbial interaction energy barriers in the biofilm which suggested that the biofilm can be easier to remove by high wastewater flow the low rate fe vi dosing can enhance the inactivation effects of other biocides on sewer biofilm with reduced dosing rate and exposure time suggesting an economical way

14863,the microbial activities in sewer biofilms are recognized as a major reason for sewer pipe corrosion malodor and greenhouse gas emissions however conventional methods to control sewer biofilm activities were based on the inhibitory or biocidal effect of chemicals and often required long exposure time or high dosing rates due to the protection of sewer biofilm structure therefore this study attempt to use ferrate fe vi a green and high valent iron at low dosing rates to damage the sewer biofilm structure so as to enhance sewer biofilm control efficiency the results showed the biofilm structure started to crush when the fe vi dosage was 15 mg fe vi l and the damage enhanced with the increasing dosage the determination of extracellular polymeric substances eps showed that fe vi treatment at 15 45 mgfe l mainly decreased the content of humic substances hs in biofilm eps this is because the functional groups such as c o oh and c o which held the large molecular structure of hs were the primary target of fe vi treatment as suggested by 2d fourier transform infrared spectra as a result the coiled chain of eps maintained by hs was turned to extended and dispersed and consequently led to a loosed biofilm structure the xdlvo analysis suggested that both the microbial interaction energy barrier and secondary energy minimum were increased after fe vi treatment suggesting that the treated biofilm was less likely to aggregate and easier to be removed by the shear stress caused by high wastewater flow moreover combined fe vi and free nitrous acid fna dosing experiments showed for achieving 90 inactivation the fna dosing rate could be reduced by 90 with the exposure time decreasing by 75 at a low fe vi dosing rate and the total cost was substantially decreased these results suggested that applying low rate fe vi dosing for sewer biofilm structure destruction is expected to be an economical way to facilitate sewer biofilm control graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biofilm structure ferrate extracellular polymeric substances humic substances biofilm control sewer management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sewer systems are among the most critical infrastructure assets for modern urban society and provide essential human health protection pikaar et al 2014 however the generation of sulfide in sewers can cause pipe corrosion which would lead to loss of concrete mass cracking of the sewer pipes and ultimately structural collapse sewer pipes suffering from corrosion often require premature replacement or rehabilitation which involves very high costs at many billion dollars every year jiang et al 2015 sun et al 2015 also the emission of sulfide from sewers can cause odor problems in the surrounding area and pose health risks to sewer workers in addition methane a potent greenhouse gas was also found to be generated in sewers it has been estimated that methane emissions from sewers contribute 34 to the total greenhouse gas footprint of wastewater systems willis 2017 the anaerobic microorganisms inhabited in biofilms attached to the sewer pipe are found mainly responsible for sulfide and methane production in sewers jiang et al 2015 sun et al 2014a thus for sewer odor corrosion and methane mitigation it is believed that controlling the sewer biofilm to prevent sulfide and methane generation is more favorable than reducing them after production jiang et al 2011b jiang et al 2015 to this end different biocides were investigated to kill or inhibit the microorganisms in sewer biofilms gardner and stewart 2002 jiang et al 2011a xu et al 2012 zuo et al 2020 however although many biocides have strong biocidal effects on planktonic microbes to kill or inactivate the microorganisms in sewer biofilms with a satisfactory ratio prolonged reaction time or increased dosing rate should be applied for example jiang et al found that to achieve over 90 of inactivation efficiency 0 3 mgn l of free nitrous acids equivalent to 120 mgn no2 at ph 6 with 24 hour continuous dosing was required in addition our previous investigation showed that although fe vi treatment could reduce the reaction time to less than 1 hour multiple dosing with a total dosage of 180 mgfe l is required yan et al 2020 therefore investigations are required to effectively decrease the reaction time and dosage of biocides in order to further reduce the chemical cost of sewer biofilm control the high tolerance of microorganisms in sewer biofilm to the biocides was mainly because of the protection effect caused by the intact biofilm structure actually biofilm is a protected mode of microbial growth in which microorganisms inhabited in an enclosed matrix to survive in hostile or adverse living environments as the toxic substances are hard to be penetrated flemming and wuertz 2019 to maintain an intact and stable biofilm structure extracellular polymeric substances eps secreted by microorganisms play a critical role eps mainly consists of high molecular weight organic polymers including protein pn polysaccharides ps humic substances hs extracellular deoxyribonucleic acid edna etc flemming and wingender 2010 li et al 2019 in addition eps can either be tightly or loosely bound to cells referred as to tb eps and lb eps eps establishes the functional and structural integrity of biofilms through weak physicochemical forces and confers cohesion and viscoelasticity to the biofilm structure di martino 2018 thus to enhance the inactivation effects of biocides on the microorganisms in sewer biofilm loosed biofilm structures may be preferred and the eps should be targeted first ferrate fe vi is a high valent tetraoxy iron and has a strong oxidizing ability with a redox potential fe vi fe iii couple up to 2 2 v jiang 2007 studies showed that fe vi could react with different types of organics without the generation of produce any mutagenic carcinogenic by products huang et al 2018 ni et al 2020 shao et al 2019 sharma 2013 our previous study showed that the multiple dosing of fe vi to sewer biofilm reactors can result in more solids in the effluent indicating that fe vi may be also effective in sewer biofilm structure destruction yan et al 2020 however so far it still lacks direct evidence of the impact of fe vi on sewer biofilm structure and the mechanisms of how fe vi may interact with sewer biofilm eps to destroy biofilm structure are unclear therefore this study aims to explore the impact of fe vi treatment on the structure of sewer biofilms morphological features of the biofilm and the architecture of eps after fe vi treatment were directly visualized by scanning electron microscope sem and the multiple fluorescence labeling coupled with a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm the change in sewer biofilm eps compositions and the reaction priority of fe vi with different functional groups in eps was also investigated to reveal the mechanisms of the interaction between fe vi and the biofilm further the variations of microbial interaction forces in the sewer biofilm and the potential enhancement of inactivation efficiencies by biocides after fe vi treatment were also evaluated the results of this study are expected to provide a fundamental understanding of how fe vi interacted with microbial biofilms and to facilitate the development of more effective and economical sewer biofilm control strategies based on the fe vi application 2 materials and methods 2 1 sewer biofilm setup and operation three lab scale reactors were set up in parallel to simulate the sewer system and develop sewer biofilms under anaerobic conditions figure s1 supporting information the reactors were made of perspex tm with an effective volume of 1l a diameter of 80 mm and a height of 200 mm three stainless steel rods were mounted inside the reactors and plastic carriers 1 cm diameter were clustered on the rods for biofilm development biofilms were attached to the carrier surfaces and reactors wall with an area of approximately 0 1 m2 the carriers could be taken out which allowed the sampling of intact biofilms the reactors were fed with domestic wastewater collected from a wet well every three days in yangpu district shanghai china the wastewater was transported to the laboratory immediately and stored in a freezer at 4 c the sewage typically contained sulfide at a concentration of 1 2 mg s l sulfate at a concentration of 30 40 mg s l and volatile fatty acid vfa at 50 100 mg cod l a peristaltic pump was used to deliver one reactor volume of sewage into each reactor every 6 hours and the sewage was heated to 20 c before entering the reactors a magnetic stirrer was placed under each reactor to provide continuous mixing 250 rpm which produce a moderated shear force and avoid solids from settling at the bottom batch tests were carried out to determine the sulfide and methane production rates i e spr and mpr every two weeks fresh wastewater was pumped into reactors for 6 min to thoroughly replace the liquid in the reactor at the beginning of the test and then sampled at 0 20 40 and 60 min for the analysis of dissolved sulfide and methane concentrations with the methods described in section 2 7 spr and mpr were calculated using linear regression of sulfide and methane concentrations relative stable spr and mpr suggest that the reactor reached the pseudo steady state and the following experiment commenced 2 2 fe vi treatment experiment the pseudo steady state biofilms were treated with fe vi to assess its effect on sewer biofilm structure and eps fractions a plastic carrier with attached biofilms was transferred into a 50 ml tube filled with filtered 0 45 μm wastewater different volumes of fe vi stock solution 1g fe l prepared by potassium ferrate k2feo4 purchased from weebeyond scientific trade co ltd shanghai were added into the tube to achieve the concentration of 15 30 45 mg fe l respectively it has been reported that fe vi dosing rate of 180 mg fe l should be added to reach a satisfactory biocidal effect on sewer biofilm as the fe vi should penetrate both the biofilm layer and the intact microbial cell wall however the purpose of this study is to destruct biofilm structure and fe vi does not need to penetrate the cell wall as a result lower fe vi dosing rates were tested the purity of potassium ferrate was checked by the colorimetric method as described by luo et al 2011 when making the stock solution the stock solution was made at ph 10 and the concentration was also checked to avoid mistakes the fe vi stock solution was used for the experiment shortly after preparation to avoid possible fe vi loss in storage the tubes after fe vi addition were then capped to avoid contact with air and gently mixed by an orbital shaker at 60 rpm for 15 min in the meantime another carrier was placed into a tube filled with fresh sewage and was also mixed under the same condition to serve as the control at the end of the test the carrier was taken out from the solution with fe vi and stored in fresh sewage for morphology observation and eps analysis as described in the following sections 2 3 scanning electron microscopy for biofilm morphology observation the effect of fe vi treatment on biofilm morphology and surface characterization was explored by scanning electron microscopy sem after fe vi treatment a small piece of biofilm with the substrate approximately 1 cm 1 cm was cut off from the carrier carefully and fixed with 2 5 glutaraldehyde at 4 c for 12h then the biofilm sample was washed three times with 0 1 m phosphate buffer saline pbs solution before it being fixed for 2 h by 1 osmic acid and washed with pbs solution again afterward different concentrations of ethanol 30 50 70 80 90 and 95 were used to dehydrate the biofilm for 15 min and then the biofilm was treated with 100 ethanol twice for 20 minutes each time followed by the mixture of isoamyl acetate v v 1 1 treats the sample for 30 minutes and then isoamyl acetate for 1 h finally it was dried with a critical point drier for sem observation sigma 300 zeiss germany 2 4 multiple fluorescence labeling and confocal laser scanning microscope observation multiple fluorescence labeling and clsm observation were conducted to determine the spatial distribution of sewer biofilm eps along the biofilm depth before the fluorescence labeling the biofilm samples with fe vi treatment 45 mg fe l and the control group were cryosectioned according to the method described in a previous study sun et al 2014b briefly the samples were washed with pbs 3 times and then embedded in tissue tek oct compound sakura japan after that the biofilm sample was settled on the base of the oct molds and frozen at 20 c and then the frozen biofilm was cryosectioned in a cryostat cm1950 leica microsystems germany the cryosectioned samples were mounted on slides and incubated with fluoresceinisothiocyanate fitc concanavalin con a tetramethylrhodamine conjugate solution and calcofluor white to stain the protein α d glucopyranose polysaccharides and β d glucopyranose polysaccharides respectively according to the method described by mu et al 2012 specifically fluoresceinisothiocyanate fitc 1mg ml in dmso 50 ul was first added to the samples for 30 min next the samples were incubated with concanavalin con a tetramethylrhodamine conjugate solution 0 25 mg ml in 0 01 m pbs buffer ph 7 2 for 60 min followed by adding calcofluor white 30 mg ml in 0 01 m pbs buffer ph 7 2 for another 30 min to stain α d glucopyranose polysaccharides and β d glucopyranose polysaccharides respectively the staining procedure was operated in dark at room temperature and the excess dye solution was washed with 0 01 m pbs buffer after each staining the excitation and emission wavelength for dyes and targets are shown in table s1 in si the stained slide was observed with a confocal laser scanning microscope nikon a1r japan ten locations were randomly selected on the slide photographed 2 5 eps extraction and analysis the eps extraction was conducted using the modified oscillation ultrasound method followed by the cation exchange resin cer technique as described by liu et al 2010 the biofilm was detached from the carrier by vigorous shaking and vortex mixing for 4 min with a ratio of 1 carrier to 2 ml water after that the suspension was centrifuged at 4000 g for 15 min and then the pellet was washed twice with pbs solution then the pellet was resuspended to a predetermined volume and then sonicated for 2 min at 60w the solution was horizontally oscillated for 10 min and then ultrasound was performed again under the same condition after that the lb eps was harvested by centrifugation at 10000 g at 4 c for 15 min the residue was resuspended and then treated with 60g g ds cation exchange resin macklin china and the mixture was agitated overnight on a magnetic stirrer at 4 c tb eps was harvested by centrifugation at 10000 g at 4 c for 15 min both lb eps and tb eps were filtrated through 0 45 μm membrane before the chemical analysis as described in section 2 7 the total eps mixture of lb eps and tb eps was also applied for fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis ftir the total eps was firstly dried to power for 48h using a freeze dryer scientz china after that the eps samples and dried kbr were mixed 1 100 and homogenized in an agate grinder 100 mg of the mixture was compressed and analyzed using a spectrum nicolet is50 ftir spectrometer thermofisher america the spectrum was obtained by scanning at the ranging 4000 400 cm 1 for 32 times with a resolution of 4 cm 1 2 dementional 2d correlation spectroscopy was conducted by 2dshige software kwanseigakuin university japan 2 6 extended dlvo xdlvo analysis the extended dlvo theory was employed to calculate the microbial interaction energy in the biofilm with and without fe vi treatment according to the xdlvo theory the total interactions wtot include three van der waals energy wlw electrostatic energy wel and acid base energy wab eq 1 which represent the electrodynamic

treatment tests by fe vi and fna to verify the damaging effect of biofilm structure by fe vi and develop a more efficient and cost effective sewer biofilm strategy fna was employed combined with fe vi to inactivate microorganisms in the sewer biofilm the procedure for fe vi and fna treatment is the same as that described in section 2 2 after fe vi treatment the liquid in the tube was replaced by the fresh wastewater and fna treatment was applied the dosing rate and exposure time for fna treatment are summarized in table 1 while the exposure time for fe vi treatment was kept at 15 min thereafter the viability of bacterial cells in biofilm was detected using live dead staining with the methods described in our previous study zhang et al 2022 briefly the biofilm samples were detached from the carriers in the filtered sewage then the suspension was incubated with live dead baclight bacterial viability kits molecular probes l 7012 the stained suspension was observed and taken 20 randomly selected area images using a fluorescence microscope eclipse 80i nikon corp japan with a halogen lamp 30 w 6 v the ratio of live and dead microorganisms was indicated by the relative abundance of green and red pixels via the image analysis software daime version 1 3 2 8 chemical analysis the sulfate concentration was measured by an ion chromatograph with a conductivity dector dionex ics 1000 sun et al 2018 and the sulfide concentration was determined by the methylene blue method sharma et al 1997 the dissolved methane was determined using gas chromatography equipped with a flame ionization detector the protein pn and humic like substances hs were determined using the modified lowry method with bovine serum albumin and humwic acid as the standards qian et al 2017 wang et al 2019 the polysaccharide ps was measured using the anthrone method with glucose as the standard lowry et al 1951 the dna was determined using dipheylamine colorimetric method with calf thymus dna sigma as the standard burton 1955 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of fe vi treatment on sewer biofilm morphology the sewer biofilm morphologies with and without fe vi treatment were compared in fig 1 the sem images showed that for untreated biofilm the intact microbial cells were arranged closely with a large amount of filiform or gel like substances wrapped around fig 1a these substances commonly recognized as a mixture of eps and other organic matter help to maintain a stable biofilm structure and protect microorganisms from external disturbance frieri et al 2017 however after fe vi treatment at 15 30 mg fe l the filiform substances were broken into pieces and the amount of gel like matter was also reduced fig 1b and c meanwhile large cavities were formed on the surface of the biofilm when the fe vi dosage was further increased to 45 mg l the biofilm structure could be severely damaged with microbe cells being bared and shriveled the ruptures and erosion spots also appeared on the cell surface fig 1d this result suggested that fe vi treatment can change the morphological characteristics of the sewer biofilm with microbial cell distribution being more discrete as a result the microorganisms in the biofilm may be more vulnerable to environmental shocks and the overall structures of the biofilm could become unstable it is well known that to maintain a stable biofilm structure and protect microbes inside eps plays a critical role luongo and zhang 2010 therefore in the following sections the interaction of fe vi with eps of the sewer biofilm was investigated to provide more insights into how fe vi affected the sewer biofilm structures 3 2 fe vi treatment changes the compositions and spatial distribution of eps in sewer biofilms 3 2 1 variation in eps compositions caused by fe vi treatment the compositions of eps i e pn ps hs and edna in both the lb and tb layers were measured to reveal a comprehensive understanding of the effect of fe vi treatment as shown in fig 2 a the total eps in the untreated biofilm was 0 16 g gvss with the content of tb eps being 2 7 times higher than that of lb eps after being treated with fe vi the total eps decreased gradually to 0 12 g gvss with the fe vi concentration increased to 45 mg fe l however the content of lb eps remained at a similar level after fe vi treatment therefore the decrease in the total eps was mainly a result of the decline in tb eps content which was reduced by 8 to 32 when fe vi concentration increased from 15 mg fe l to 45 mg fe l the eps wrapped around the microbial cells was distributed in a dynamic stratified way with tb eps existing close to the cells while lb eps located farther from the cells the reduction in tb eps suggested that fe vi at tested concentrations 15 45 mg fe l could penetrate and react with the inner layer of the eps as a result the bonding of tb eps with microbial cells was loosed and the tb eps was shifted into the lb eps making the lb eps amount stable however since tb eps played a more important role in microbial flocculation and aggregation jia et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 the reduction in tb eps content could pose a more adverse impact on a stable biofilm structure compared with lb eps the proportions of ps pn hs and dna in the tb eps and lb eps fractions with and without fe vi treatment were compared in fig 3 b and c the results showed that pn and hs were the main component of eps in untreated sewer biofilm which were followed by ps and edna after fe vi treatment the content of hs showed the most considerable reduction among these four compounds the hs in the tb eps decreases gradually from 0 054 g gvss to 0 03 g gvss when the fe vi dosage reached 45 mg fe l meanwhile the hs in the lb eps also reduced from 0 01 g gvss to 0 006 g gvss resulting in the total hs content decreasing by 44 at the fe vi dosage of 45 mg fe l ps content also decreased in both tb eps and lb eps after fe vi treatment however unlike the progressive decrease of hs with the increase of fe vi dosage the decrease in ps with the fe vi dosage increase to 15 30 mg fe l was less significant within 5 the obvious ps reduction was achieved when the fe vi dosage reach 45 mg fe l with an overall reduction ratio of 34 41 and 23 for tb eps and lb eps respectively as for pn and edna relatively significant decreases of 16 and 30 in tb eps were observed with fe vi dosage of 90 mg fe l however at this dosage their contents in lb eps were slightly increased and as a result the total decrease of pn and edna in the eps was only about 7 and 8 respectively this result suggested that fe vi altered the eps structure so that some pn and dna in the tb eps were shifted to the lb eps this is consistent with a stable lb eps concentration after fe vi treatment as shown in fig 2a 3 2 2 reaction priority of functional groups in eps with fe vi treatment the 2 d ftir analysis was applied to reveal the changes of functional groups in sewer biofilm eps by fe vi treatment with the increase of the dosage fig 3 the synchronous map showed that all the cross peaks were positively correlated suggesting that the dominant functional groups in the eps were reduced with fe vi treatment meanwhile the combining analysis of asynchronous and synchronous maps could tell the reaction priority of these functional groups with fe vi dosage increasing as indicated in fig 3 the peaks at 1040 1080 1120 1160 cm 1 were mostly sensitive to fe vi treatment the peaks at 1040 1080 cm 1 were identified as c o c in aromatic or aliphatic ethers and bands at 1120 1160 cm 1 were mainly caused by stretching vibration of c oh in alcohol phenol groups as well as polysaccharides noble et al 1974 yin et al 2015 the peak at 1650 cm 1 also showed significant sensitivity by fe vi treatment which was then followed by peaks at 1450 1520 cm 1 the peaks at 1650 cm 1 were commonly caused by the stretching vibration of c o in carboxyl ketones and quinone groups while peaks at 1450 1520 cm 1 were featured peaks of aromatic conjugated structures ricci et al 2015 sen and chandra 2007 on the other hand the peaks at 1720 1860 1380 1250 980 cm 1 were more resistant to fe vi treatment these peaks were mainly caused by the stretching vibration of c o in anhydride or ester 1720 1860 cm 1 bending vibration of c h in alkyl and aryl 1380 980 cm 1 and stretching vibration of c n in amine 1250 cm 1 ricci et al 2015 sharif and ahmad 2020 as the typical hs structure was formed based on a motif of aromatic quinones nuclei linked by ether bonds with phenolic and carboxylic substituents stevenson 1994 the venerable of c o c in aromatic ethers c oh in alcohol phenol groups c o in carboxyl and quinone groups as well as aromatic conjugated structures to fe vi treatment as indicated by 2d ftir may explain why hs content was decreased more significantly after fe vi treatment compared to other substances as observed in fig 2 3 2 3 variation in spatial distributions of eps after fe vi treatment the architecture of eps in sewer biofilm was visualized using multiple fluorescence labeling combined with the clsm technique in this study proteins α d glucopyranose polysaccharides and β d glucopyranose polysaccharides in the biofilm eps were stained with green red and blue fluorescence respectively as shown in fig 4 in untreated sewer biofilm proteins accounted for a higher fraction than polysaccharides and they could be presented in the depths of the biofilm on the other hand the polysaccharides were mainly located near the biofilm surface after fe vi treatment at 45 mg fe l the content of polysaccharides especially those close to the biofilm surface decreased significantly while the content of protein decreased by a less extent it could be reasonable as the substances at the biofilm surface could more readily react with fe vi than those near the substratum given the penetration of fe vi into the biofilm could be limited also the c o and oh groups in the polysaccharides were more sensitive to fe vi oxidation than c n in proteins as discussed in section 3 2 2 moreover the comparison of clsm images showed that sewer biofilm without fe vi treatment presented in a dense structure with eps arranged closely whereas after fe vi exposure more holes appeared in the inner part of the biofilm this result was consistent with the morphology observation illustrated by the sem images fig 1 further confirming that fe vi treatment damaged the sewer biofilm resulting in a loose structure inside the biofilm 3 3 the changes of microbial interaction energy after fe vi treatment based on xdlvo analysis sewer biofilm could be considered as the aggregation of abundant microbes and its structure namely the aggregation state was determined based on microbial interaction energy according to a thermodynamics viewpoint thus in this study the xdlvo model was applied to predict the microbial interaction energy change according to fe vi treatment in order to provide a theoretical explanation of how fe vi treatment affects the sewer biofilm structure and the consequence after treatment in the xdlvo theory the total microbial interaction energy wtot was described as a sum up of the van der waals energy wlw electrostatic double layer energy wel and lewis acid base interactions energy wab as a function of separation distance bos et al 1999 as shown in fig 5 a the negativity of wlw slightly decreased after fe vi treatment indicating a weaker attraction between cells however the van der waals attraction decreased over a short range thus its contribution to the total microbial interaction energy was not significant fig 5b compared the profiles of wel along the separation distances suggesting electrical double layer repulsion was decreased after fe vi treatment wel is highly related to the zeta potential of the microbial cells xu et al 2016 and our results showed that the negativity of the zeta potential increased from 15 6 to 16 7 mv after fe vi treatment the reduction could probably be due to the increase in surface negative charge and consequently induced electrostatic repulsion for cell to cell interactions ozkan and berberoglu 2013 as presented in fig 5c wab is the predominant contributor to the total interaction energy as it is much higher than wlw and wel the wab can be hydrophobic attraction or hydrophilic repulsion bayoudh et al 2009 and the positive wab in this study suggested a repulsive interaction the increase of wab after fe vi treatment indicated an increased repulsion between the biofilm cells the total microbial interaction profiles with and without fe vi treatment were compared in fig 5d the summit in the profile referred to the energy barrier of the microbial interaction which means to stably aggregate the microbial cell should have sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the barrier fig 5b showed that the biofilm after fe vi treatment exhibited much higher energy barriers 1 57 103 kt compared with the untreated one 8 64 102 kt this indicated that the cells in the biofilm are more difficult to approach each other after fe vi treatment moreover the inset of fig 5d showed the secondary energy minimum which could represent the ability of cells to detach from biofilm redman et al 2004 the secondary energy minimum of the untreated biofilm was 1 4 kt while it increased to 1 0 kt after fe vi treatment therefore after fe vi treatment the sewer biofilm would become less stable in the structure with a deteriorated adhesion and aggregation ability 3 4 fe vi treatment enhanced the inactivation efficiency of biocides on sewer biofilms using biocides to suppress sewer biofilm activities is a preferred practice for sulfide and methane control in sewers however a high concentration of biocides or long exposure time were often required to achieve a satisfying inactivation efficiency jiang et al 2011b based on the effect of fe vi treatment on biofilm structures as revealed above it is worthwhile to evaluate if the inactivation efficiency of biocides could be improved after fe vi treatment thus in this study a cost efficient and environmentally friendly biocide free nitrous acids fna were applied and the synergistic inactivation effect of fe vi and fna on sewer biofilm was explored as shown in fig 6 the inactivation efficiencies with fna treatment only were limited in the range of 3 9 14 9 for one hour exposure and 25 5 29 6 for three hour exposure when the fna dosage was 0 025 0 15 mgn l after fe vi treatment at 15 mg fe l the inactivation efficiencies were increased to 14 1 47 0 for one hour exposure and 52 7 55 3 for three hour exposure with the same fna dosing rate when the fe vi dosage was increased to 30 mg fe l the inactivation efficiencies were further enhanced to 77 5 88 0 for one hour exposure and 92 5 98 5 for three hour exposure however for fna treatment only 0 26 mgn l with 12 hour exposure was required to achieve a similar inactivation efficiency 90 jiang et al 2011b it is clear that inactivation efficiency was considerably elevated with the application of fe vi assuming that the theoretical inactivation efficiency of the combined fe vi and fna treatment was the product of inactivation efficiencies of the separated fe vi treatment and fna treatment as indicated by asterisks in fig 6 thus the synergistic inactivation efficiencies of fna and fe vi at 15 mg fe l were generally about 20 27 higher than theoretical inactivation efficiency in all cases except for fna dosage of 0 025 mgn l with one hour exposure fig 6 furthermore fe vi treatment at 30 mg fe l could enhance the synergistic inactivation efficiency by 45 51 compared with the theoretical values the results suggested that the enhanced inactivation efficiency was mainly related to fe vi dosage but regardless to fna dosage and its exposure time this further confirmed the important role of fe vi in enhancing the inactivation efficiency of biocides with reduced dosage and exposure time 4 discussion 4 1 key mechanisms of how fe vi treatment causing sewer biofilm destruction the results of this study suggested that fe vi treatment could effectively damage the sewer biofilm structure mainly through the destruction of humic substances as the most abundant organic matter in the eps of the sewer biofilm fig 2 hs could play a critical role in maintaining a stable biofilm structure in terms of conformation hs is reported to consist of a skeleton of alkyl or aromatic units cross linked via c o with many groups such as carboxylic phenolic and alcoholic hydroxyls ketones quinine etc lipczynska kochany 2018 sutton and sposito 2005 meanwhile the moieties in hs could also hold together by low energy bonds such as van der waals ion dipole forces and hydrogen bonds nuzzo et al 2013 trevisan et al 2010 the hs were reported to have a strong ability to form complexes with micro aggregates and organic substances through electrostatic interactions bridging interactions and steric interactions calabi floody et al 2011 kang and xing 2008 xu et al 2020 thus in sewer biofilm matrix the high abundance of humic substances could adsorb other organic substances such as protein polysaccharide and edna to form a random coil dense structure wrapped around microbial cells through highly cross linked chains however after fe vi treatment the hs in sewer biofilm eps was largely decreased fig 3 the results of this study suggested that fe vi may cause hs decrease in multiple ways fig 7 firstly the 2d ftir analysis suggested the c o bonds in aromatic or aliphatic ethers are venerable to fe vi treatment and thus the large molecular structure of hs could be breakdown directly additionally the functional groups such as oh and c o in the hs were also sensitive to fe vi treatment meanwhile our previous study showed that the ph of the wastewater after fe vi treatment could increase over 9 yan et al 2020 the destruction of these functional groups together with the increase in ph could lead to the destruction of intermolecular hydrogen bonds which are also responsible for a stable hs structure piccolo and celano 1994 the decrease of the hydrogen bonds after fe vi treatment also could be supported by the decrease of the band at 3460 cm 1 in the ftir spectra figure s2 moreover the featured peaks of aromatic conjugated structures were also attacked by fe vi treatment fig 4 the breakage of the aromatic conjugated structures may decrease the π π interaction and contribute to the crush of coiled hs pseudo micelles the fragmented hs in tb eps after fe vi treatment could be transformed into lb eps and released into the wastewater water it has been reported that without hs the coiled chain extracellular organic matter was turned extended and the spatial shape would become more dispersed xu et al 2020 such structure of eps would consequently result in a loosed biofilm structure fig 7 the result of our study further suggested that the high hs content can be a typical characteristic of sewer biofilm which accounted for 40 of the total eps fraction the high hs composition in sewer biofilm was also reported by jahn et al 1998 who observed that the highest hs proportion in eps could reach 53 8 in the biofilm collected from a gravity sewer in demark in comparison the hs in eps of activated sludge was normally about 20 or even lower sheng et al 2010 the higher hs fraction in sewer biofilm might be related to the much longer retention time of the biofilm in sewers than that of activated sludge in wwtp the high retention time favored the decomposition of the adsorbed cellulose and lignin which is a relatively slow microbial process but is considered as the first stage of humification polak et al 2009 as our results suggested that fe vi is more effective to remove hs than pn and ps in the eps the fe vi treatment could be more applicable to remove disintegrate biofilms or sludge flocs with high hs content 4 2 fe vi dosing at low rates facilitates the sewer biofilm control in multiple ways fe vi has been proven to effectively kill the microorganisms in sewer biofilm but to achieve a satisfactory biocidal effect for sewer biofilm control a relatively high dosing rate is required however the results of this study indicated the low rate fe vi dosing could result in a loose biofilm structure by destroying the eps which can also facilitate sewer biofilm control in different ways firstly the loosed biofilm structure caused by fe vi dosing could reduce the mechanical stability of sewer biofilms this is confirmed by the xdlvo analysis as the secondary energy minimum was increased after fe vi treatment fig 4d as a consequence the sewer biofilm could be more easily to be detached by external forces such as shear stress caused by high sewerage flow fig 7 our preliminary experimental results showed that the detachment ratios of the biofilm after fe vi treatment at 15 45 mgfe l were 1 4 2 3 times as high as that of the untreated biofilm figure s3 with the water shear stress created by an orbital shaker at 250 rpm on this basis a new and low cost solution for sewer biofilm control could be proposed by the combined effect of fe vi and wastewater flushing namely after applying a suitable rate of fe vi treatment the loosed sewer biofilm could be eroded by the wastewater flushing resulting in a relatively clean sewer wall to prevent sulfide and methane production in practice for pressure sewers the fe vi could be dosed when the wastewater flow rate was low afterward the pump at the beginning of the sewer could be regulated to a high flow rate so that the loosed biofilm after fe vi treatment can be detached by the high shears created by high flow as for gravity sewers the fe vi would preferably be dosed when the flow rate was high in this case the water level in the sewer pipe is high and as a result most biofilm covered on the sewer wall could be reacted with fe vi the flush flow in the gravity sewer could be created by applying some self flushing devices schaffner and steinhardt 2011 shahsavari et al 2017 the detached microorganisms are not expected to stay in sewers for long period as they would flow with the wastewater to the treatment facilities since a self clean velocity should be maintained during the sewer operation even if some blocks may deposit in sewers they could be removed through routine dredging as the shear stress caused by wastewater can be different in sewers efforts are worth being dedicated in the future to investigate the co effect of shear stress and fe vi dosing rates on sewer biofilm removal to optimize fe vi dosage under different conditions in addition the low rate fe vi dosing could also facilitate sewer biofilm control by enhancing the inactivation efficiency of biocides on microorganisms in the biofilm fig 6 previous studies have summarized potential reasons for a high level of biofilms resistance to different biocide among which an important mechanism involved the diffusion limitations bridier et al 2011 multiple layers of cells and eps may constitute a complex and compact structure within which biocides were difficult to penetrate and reach internal layers thus hampering their efficacy moreover biocide molecules may simply adsorb to matrix components such as eps in biofilms and their penetration were hindered however when fe vi was applied to the biofilm it disrupted the compositions and integrity of eps and disaggregated biofilm clumps moreover as the functional groups of humic acids in eps were largely destroyed by fe vi its adsorption ability was consequently reduced thus the biocide added after fe vi treatment could augment its penetration and reach the internal layer of biofilm and inactivation efficiency could be enhanced fig 7 the enhanced efficiency indicated that both the dosing rate and exposure time of the biocide could be reduced and consequently the chemical cost can be saved it has been reported that the single fe vi dosing and single fna dosing were the two most economical chemical dosing methods for sulfide control 1 6 2 2 kg s jiang et al 2011a yan et al 2020 for other chemicals such as ferric ferrous and nitrate the cost of 5 24 kg s can be reached bertrán et al 2007 nielsen et al 2005 rodríguez gómez et al 2005 saracevic et al 2007 as revealed in section 3 4 to achieve a similar inactivation efficiency 90 compared to fna treatment only 0 26 gn l with a reaction time of 12h the pre fe vi dosing at 30 mgfe l for 15 min would reduce the fna dosing rate by 90 0 025 mgn l with fe vi pre dosing vs 0 26 gn l without and the exposure time by 75 3h with fe vi pre dosing vs 12h without thus it could be estimated that the total chemical cost for combined fe vi 30mgfe l for 15 min and fna dosing 0 025 mgn l for 12h was about 14 of that for dosing fna only and 20 of that for dosing fe vi only jiang et al 2011a yan et al 2020 thus applying low rate fe vi dosing in sewers is expected to facilitate sewer biofilm control to prevent odor corrosion and greenhouse gas emissions in an economical way 5 conclusions this study investigated the effect of ferrate fe vi dosing on sewer biofilm structure so as to facilitate sewer biofilm control for corrosion odor and greenhouse gas mitigation the main conclusions are low rate fe vi dosing can cause the destructive effect on the sewer biofilm structure with the effect enhanced with the increasing dosing rate fe vi dosing primarily reduced the content of humic substances hs in sewer biofilm eps as a result the coiled chain of eps maintained by hs was turned dispersed and consequently led to a loosed biofilm structure the reduction of hs in eps was mainly ascribed to that key functional groups for holding malmolecular hs such as c o oh and c o were more vulnerable to fe vi treatment fe vi treatment enhanced the microbial interaction energy barriers in the biofilm which suggested that the biofilm can be easier to remove by high wastewater flow the low rate fe vi dosing can enhance the inactivation effects of other biocides on sewer biofilm with reduced dosing rate and exposure time suggesting an economical way

14864,in our previous study quorum quenching qq bacteria can effectively enhance methane production in an anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr while mitigating membrane biofouling however the mechanism of such enhancement is unclear in this study we analyzed the potential effects from separated hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis steps the cumulative methane production improved by 26 13 22 54 48 70 and 44 93 at qq bacteria dosage of 0 5 1 5 and 10 mg strain g beads respectively it was found that the presence of qq bacteria enhanced acidogenesis step resulting in higher volatile fatty acids vfa production while it had no obvious influence on hydrolysis acetogenesis and methanogenesis steps the substrate glucose conversion efficiency in acidogenesis step was also accelerated 1 45 folds vs control within first eight hours the abundance of hydrolytic fermentation gram positive bacteria and several acidogenic bacteria such as hungateiclostridiaceae was promoted in qq amended culture which enhanced vfa production and accumulation although the abundance of acetoclastic methanogen methanosaeta reduced by 54 2 on the 1st day of qq beads addition the overall performance of methane production was not affected this study revealed that qq had a greater impact on the acidogenesis step in the anaerobic digestion process though the microbial community in acetogenesis and methanogenesis steps was altered this work can provide a theoretical basis for using qq technology to slow down the rate of membrane biofouling in anaerobic membrane bioreactors while increasing methane production and maximizing economic benefits graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords quorum quenching methane production acidogenesis anaerobic digestion microbial shift data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction quorum quenching qq mechanism is based on the reduction of quorum sensing qs signal molecules such as acyl homoserine lactones ahl dong et al 2001 in the microbial environment such reduction is carried out by qs degradation enzymes or transferases qq can effectively suppress the presence of qs and in turn reduce extracellular polymeric substances eps secretion and control the adhesion of the membrane biocake layer kim et al 2013 qq was firstly applied in the aerobic membrane reactor mbr for fouling control yeon et al 2009 found that the content of ahl was reduced along with the eps upon the addition of ahl degrading enzyme in the mbr subsequently kim et al 2011 and oh et al 2013 successfully extended the operating time of aerobic mbr using embedded qq bacteria many studies discussed that qs phenomenon also exists in anaerobic environment for example exogenous signal molecules were used to accelerate granulation or increase methane production ma et al 2018 explored the role of ahl based qs system in anaerobic granulation process and suggested that extracellular polymeric substances eps production and sludge particle size were all strongly positively correlated with ahl level du et al 2021 found that ahl was the most probable quorum sensing signal in methanogens nguyen et al 2019 suggested that the qs of gram negative bacteria was downregulated by aiim lactonase quorum quenching enzyme in anaerobic fermentation two novel qq strains ks2 and ks10 genus pseudomonas were isolated from anaerobic digester sludge by shah and choo 2020 and used for biofilm formation control interestingly liu et al 2019 discovered that the qq strain microbacterium sp not only mitigated the membrane biofouling of anmbr but also significantly increased methane production it was the first time for us to detect the enhanced anaerobic performance and how the addition of qq affects the anaerobic process is worth exploring in our previous work we found that the presence of the qq strain increased the total abundance of fermentative and acetogenic genera by 0 61 and 3 8 times respectively but had very minor impact on the abundance of methanogens liu et al 2020a it was also found that qq bacteria can greatly increase the abundance of gram positive acidogenic bacteria and suppress the gram negative acidogenic bacteria homo acetogenic treponema was also enriched 9 01 in the presence of qq strain suggesting that apart from hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathway extra ch4 could be also produced from the additional acetate synthesized via homo acetogenic pathway zhang et al 2009 however our previous study did not provide sufficient evidence on how qq affected the syntrophic communications among those functional microbes the four steps involved in anaerobic digestion namely hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis may be all or not interfered by qq bacteria hence the objectives of this study are 1 to explore the effect of different qq bacteria dosage on methane production of anaerobic digestion process 2 to explore which of the four stages of anaerobic digestion would be affected by the addition of qq bacteria and 3 to study the effect of qq bacteria on microbial communities in four stages the results may provide a theoretical basis for better use of qq technology in anaerobic systems 2 methods and materials 2 1 qq beads preparation microbacterium sp 16s rrna gene accession number is kr058846 waheed et al 2017 which has ahls degrading capability was used for qq beads preparation the preparation procedure followed the method described in lee et al 2016 briefly fresh microbacterium sp culture was cultivated in luria bertani lb broth till an optical density of 1 00 600 nm the cells were collected and re suspended in a phosphate buffer solution pbs to prepare qq beads a certain amount of qq bacterial suspension was mixed with sterile sodium alginate powder activated carbon pac and polyvinyl alcohol pva and the mixture was dripped into cacl2 boric acid solution to form beads five qq strain contents were prepared i e 0 0 5 1 0 5 0 and 10 0 mg strain g beads denoted as qq0 qq0 5 qq1 qq5 and qq10 respectively finally qq beads were incubated in 0 5 mol l sodium sulfate solution for 4 h and transferred to glucose solution for further incubation of 24 h the average size of qq beads was approximately 4 3 mm 2 2 effect of qq strain dosage on methane production each type of qq beads was added into 3 anaerobic reactors at a volume ratio of 2 v beads v reactor liu et al 2019 in total 15 reactors were set up for this experiment other than qq beads the reactors with working volume of 400 ml were seeded with anaerobic sludge at mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration of 5000 mg l synthetic wastewater with cod of 500 mg l was added into the reactors to initiate the reaction the composition of synthetic wastewater can be found in table s1 liu et al 2019 all the reactors were then operated in the automatic methane potential analysis systems ampts bioprocess control sweden and methane production was automatically recorded sludge mixed liquor was drawn from each reactor on the 2nd 4th 10th and 14th day operation the samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm filter and filtrate was collected for vfa measurement dna samples were collected on 14th day and stored in 80 c freezer 2 3 mechanism study in order to understand the qq effect on each anaerobic reaction step a series of batch experiment was designed using model compounds as substrates huang et al 2020 the anaerobic sludge used in hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis experiment was treated with a sufficient amount of sodium bromoethane sulfate for two days in advance to inhibit the activity of methanogens the hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis activity tests were conducted in serum bottles with a volume of 100 ml as for methanogenesis

groups realized at 128 20 13 80 161 70 14 83 157 10 6 4 190 63 3 50 and 185 80 6 05 ml respectively followed by a methane yield of 32 73 4 44 44 54 1 82 37 94 1 67 47 93 0 41 and 44 10 0 46 ml mmol c was also calculated and suggested that the dosage of qq bacteria at 5 mg strain g beads was the most representative this confirms that the addition of qq bacteria could promote the methane production which is consistent with our previous study liu et al 2019 the results also show that the higher the qq bacteria dosage the more efficient the methane production in the anaerobic process is the effective conversion of organic substrates during anaerobic digestion is crucial to ensure a stable methane production fig 1b shows the effect of qq bacteria dosage on the accumulation and conversion of vfa only three types of vfa were detected namely acetate hac fig 1b propionic acid hpr and isovaleric acid iso cap fig s1 the concentrations of hpr and iso cap were very low thus only acetate profiles are discussed here on the second day the accumulation of acetate was 6 23 6 57 7 59 7 41 and 7 81 mmol l in the five groups reactors the acetate concentration in qq1 qq5 and qq10 groups was 18 94 25 36 higher than that of qq0 the acetate concentration in qq0 quickly dropped to 2 25 mmol l performed the fastest consumption rate on the fourth day compared to other groups followed by the qq0 5 group which was 4 02 mmol l the acetate concentration of qq1 qq5 and qq10 remained at 5 88 6 43 mmol l when the operation continued to the tenth day the concentration of acetate in qq0 and qq0 5 was comparable and its concentration in qq10 was still the highest the methane production in the qq bacteria added reactors was all higher than that of qq0 reactors at the end of the operation vfas were all almost depleted in this experiment the correlation between acetate concentration and methane production is not very clear in the first ten days the consumption rate of acetate in the qq0 group was the highest but its cumulative methane production was the lowest we hypothesize that the addition of qq bacteria increased available carbon source for methane production or inhibited the pathways of acetate consumption by other bacteria hence methane production was enhanced with presence of qq bacteria this will be discussed in the next section where four anaerobic reactions are separately verified from above results the methane production performance was comparably the highest in qq5 and qq10 groups therefore from the economic point of view 5 mg strain g beads was chosen for the subsequent experiments 3 2 mechanism investigation 3 2 1 hydrolysis in the hydrolysis experiment bovine serum albumin and dextran were used as carbon source to verify the effect of qq on hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis the protein content in hdct and hdqq increased after one day cultivation with slightly higher increase in hdct fig 2 a subsequently protein consumption rates were similar in both groups of reactors no significant difference p 0 936 0 05 was found for polysaccharides degradation between hdct and hdqq fig 2b interestingly vfa profiles were distinguishably different the acetate concentration in hdct increased sharply to 0 45 mmol g vss during the first eight hours operation and declined to 0 21 mmol g vss in the next 16 h fig 2c then it slowly increased to 0 91 mmol g vss till the end of the experiment on the other hand the acetate concentration in hdqq continuously increased since beginning to 1 87 mmol g vss at the 120 h which was about 2 fold higher than that of hdct the final concentration of butyric acid in hdqq were 2 times higher than that in hdct 0 07 vs 0 03 mmol g vss fig 2e the final concentration of propionic acid was at similar level 1 05 mmol g vss though it was observed higher in hdqq during the operation fig 2d it is speculated that the addition of qq either promoted hydrolysis and or acidogenesis process or inhibited the vfa consumption process e g acetogenesis or other pathways given the protein and polysaccharides changes were similar in the two groups of reactors it can be concluded that hydrolysis step was not significantly affected by the qq bacteria addition according to toc profile fig 2f the toc concentration in hdqq remained relatively stable in the first 120 h while the immediate reduction was found in hdct once the primary carbon source was depleted toc was rapidly consumed in both hdqq and hdct reactors with the consumption rates of 0 99 mg g vss d vs 1 30 mg g vss d respectively this suggests that acidogenesis was likely promoted in hdqq while it is not clear if acetogenesis was affected at this stage 3 2 2 acidogenesis in the acidogenesis experiment glucose and glutamate were used as carbon source to verify the effect of qq on acidogenesis and acetogenesis it was found that the consumption rate of glucose in adqq was faster than that in adct in the first eight hours fig 3 b indicating that the addition of qq bacteria promoted the conversion of glucose and thus enhanced the activity of acidogenic bacteria though primary substrates were mostly depleted in the first 24 h net vfa production continued afterwards acetate concentration did not show significant difference between adct and adqq in the first three days with slightly higher accumulation in adqq fig 3c it is noteworthy that acetate was reduced in adct thereafter while that in adqq remained the increasing trend the results indicate that acetate may be partially consumed by other non methanogens in the adct since methanogenesis was inhibited while such consumption was difficult to confirm in adqq meanwhile no obvious difference was obtained in propionic acid profiles which suggests that the presence of qq did not affect the conversion path of propionate to acetate fig 3d the increase of toc in adqq corresponds to the accumulation of acetate fig 3e after five days operation the consumption rates of toc in both reactors were comparable 1 27 vs 1 96 mg g vss d therefore the additional available organic carbon or vfas in qq reactors may provide more substrate for subsequent methane production fig 1 based on the observation it can be concluded that qq bacteria can accelerate the degradation of glucose and at the same time it can also enhance the conversion efficiency of organic matter into acetate the acceleration on the substrate degradation in acidogenesis step was considered as the main reason for the increase of methane production in anaerobic digestion and this was further analyzed from the perspective of abundance of functional microorganisms 3 2 3 acetogenesis when butyrate or propionate was added to the reactors the final acetate concentration in atct and atqq did not differ much fig 4 a though it was slightly reduced in the first 24 h in atct the trends of butyrate or propionate profiles were also roughly similar in atct and atqq data not shown finally the toc concentration in the two reactors was also comparable fig 4b these results suggest that the addition of qq bacteria had minimal impact on acetogenesis and the presence of qq bacteria did not impact on the acetate consumption by the non methanogens consumer either 3 2 4 methanogenesis when sodium acetate was used as the only carbon source with or without qq beads there was no significant difference in total methane production between qq group meqq and non qq group mect in the first 12 h fig 5 a the methane production in mect slowed down after 12 h operation and finally stopped at the 60th hour with a final methane production and yield of 47 30 0 15 ml g vss and 32 94 0 10 ml mmol c the methane production in meqq continued until 72 h with a methane production and yield of 50 95 0 80 ml g vss and 40 17 0 63 ml mmol c the amount of methane produced in the two groups did not show a statistically significant difference p 0 510 0 05 indicating that the existence of qq did not have significant impact on the activities of methanogens thus the additional methane production from the ad systems was likely due to the additional carbon source produced from the previous step namely acidogenesis 3 3 microbial community responses 3 3 1 α diversity the microbial communities changes of functional microbes involved in hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis processes were investigated the shannon index of hdct and hdqq were similar on the third and fourteenth days fig s2 however shannon index decreased in adqq and atqq on the third day in acidogenesis and acetogenesis processes and then increased significantly after 14 days operation as compared to control cases the shannon index in ct and qq of methanogenesis experiment were all maintained around 4 35 0 21 the results demonstrated that qq bacteria did not have a significant impact on the microbial α diversity in the hydrolysis and methanogenesis steps but had a greater impact on acidogenesis and acetogenesis 3 3 2 microbial composition shift in hydrolysis experiment top 50 microbes at the genus level involved in hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis were selected to analyze the effects of qq on the functional flora in the three steps fig 6 a given bes was added in the experiment the abundance of methanogens was below 0 01 and their activity were completely inhibited thus the abundance of methanogens is not discussed in this section in the hydrolysis experiment macellibacteroides were dominant with an abundance of 57 61 46 92 34 96 and 33 90 in hdct3 hdqq3 hdct14 and hdqq14 respectively chen and chang 2017 revealed that mono and disaccharides could be utilized by genus macellibacteroides and fermented into acetate butyrate and iso butyrate via glucose metabolism macellibacteroides was found enriched in ahl fed reactors liu et al 2020b but less abundant in the reactors with qq bacteria hadi et al 2021 in this study the presence of qq bacteria only reduced macellibacteroides abundance in the first three days and its abundance dropped to a similar level on the 14th day in both groups it is worth noting that the abundance of genus norank f paludibacteraceae norank f rikenellaceae flexilinea paludibacter all increased with the presence of qq bacteria the abundance of dmer64 petrimonas blvii28 wastewater sludge group sedimentibacter anaerocella and enterococcus reduced instead flexilinea gram positive bacteria and blvii28 wastewater sludge group gram negative bacteria were both reported as fermenter in anaerobic digestion which can convert complex organic compounds to acetate or h2 jiang et al 2020 sun et al 2016 paludibacter belongs to family paludibacteraceae can utilize various soluble carbohydrates and sugars to produce short chain vfa ueki et al 2006 spring et al 2020 proposed that family paludibacteraceae can use carbohydrates as a substrate genera involved in family rikenellaceae were all fermenters that can convert carbohydrates or proteins to organic acids su et al 2014 although genus norank f rikenellaceae dmer64 and anaerocella belong to the same family rikenellaceae the effects of qq on the three of them were different the abundance of petrimonas as a typically hydrolyser wang et al 2020 was commonly found in qs enriched system liu et al 2020b and peng et al 2021 the ahl profiles fig s3 suggest that c12 hslwas the dominant ahl type in the studied ad system and the content of c12 hsl completely disappeared due to qq s presence anaerocella were capable of degrading amino acids to vfa abe et al 2012 it was noted that dmer64 blvii28 wastewater sludge group sedimentibacter and anaerocella only enriched in reactor hdct fig s3a which suggested that qq may inhibit the growth of those genera but promoted other genera e g flexilinea clostridium sensu stricto 9 dev114 that only enriched in reactor hdqq another interesting observation is that two hydrolytic fermentation bacteria genus longilinea and bacteroides were only affected by qq initially and returned to the similar level as hdct at later stage this suggests those bacteria can resist the effects from qq bacteria loogilinea was proven to be an ahl mediated genus he et al 2016 and had the ability to metabolize carbohydrates and produce acetate yamada et al 2007 3 3 3 microbial composition shift in acidogenesis experiment the abundance of hungateiclostridiaceae a fermenter that can convert sugar to acetate and h2 zhang et al 2018 was significantly enriched in adqq 47 75 compared to adct 0 01 it suggested that the presence of qq bacteria encouraged the growth of hungateiclostridiaceae which corresponds to the result of higher glucose degradation rate and then generated higher acetate content in the adqq reactor during the acidogenesis step fig 3b and c redundancy analysis rda also suggested that acetate content was performed strongly positive relationship with hungateiclostridiaceae fig s5a ruminiclostridium and clostridium sensu stricto 12 were also highly enriched in adqq and previous hdqq this is the first report on the enrichment of these three bacteria which were induced by the presence of qq bacteria at this stage there is no direct evidence to prove whether the three bacteria are qs based bacteria the abundance of macellibacteroides clostridium sensu stricto 1 bacteroides and sphaerochaeta declined because of the presence of qq among them clostridium sensu stricto 1 as the primary hydrogen producing bacteria were reported to dominate in the environment with high qs activity sun et al 2020 which performed positive relationships with ahl contents in this study fig s4 except sphaerochaeta the rest four were reported to have qs activities to date it is not clear if sphaerochaeta is related to qs or qq notwithstanding they were revealed to play a key role in fermenting short chain organics to sugars and vfas mäkinen et al 2013 similar with hydrolysis experiment genus longilinea was only affected by qq in a short period and returned to the same level as control group in acidogenesis step it can be concluded that the addition of qq led the abundance of bacteria such as hungateiclostridiaceae and ruminiclostridium to increase and thus accelerated the conversion of substrates to acetate 3 3 4 microbial composition shift in acetogenesis experiment contrary to the results in hydrolysis and acidogenesis experiments norank f paludibacteraceae abundance was promoted significantly in acetogenesis experiment with the presence of qq whose abundance trend was consistent with that in the hydrolysis experiment indicating that this bacterium was indeed negatively affected by qq fig s3c there was no report on the relationship between this genus and qq bacteria which requires further investigation second the reduced abundance of desulfomicrobium norank f anaerolineaceae and syntrophomonas due to qq s presence was also found in our previous research liu et al 2020a desulfomicrobium is capable of reducing sulfate to hydrogen sulfide by consuming vfa as electron donor qian et al 2015 genus syntrophomonas mainly degrades butyrate into acetate and produce h2 sieber et al 2010 genus ottowia a hydrolyser whose abundance was reduced significantly due to qq s presence although the abundance of these vfa consumers decreased other acetate consumer genus such as norank f paludibacteraceae increased hence it was possible that the net vfa accumulation remained similar loogilinea s abundance were slightly reduced when qq bacteria was introduced with an abundance of 8 90 and 5 16 in atct3 and atqq3 respectively this observation was different compared to hydrolysis and acidogenesis experiments suggesting that genera loogilinea could be easily affected by qq with vfa as substrate similar change was found for norank f synergistaceae synergistaceae is a syntrophic acetate oxidating bacterium in this study the abundance of synergistaceae declined in adqq3 2 95 in the first a few days and resumed to initial level at the later stage while its abundance in atct remained stable 3 3 5 microbial composition shift in methanogenesis experiment dmer64 was dominant in methanogenesis experiment with an abundance of 15 25 22 22 16 88 and 15 17 in mect1 meqq1 mect8 and meqq8 respectively fig 7 a dmer64 again were inhibited at later stage of meqq operation though a short term increase was observed the results were consistent with that in hydrolysis and acetogenesis experiments longilinea displayed a similar trend as that in the hydrolysis experiment genus norank f paludibacteraceae was only detected in meqq8 with an abundance of 11 04 confirming again that qq can promote the growth of this genus significantly other bacteria did not seem to be affected by qq s presence this is reasonable that many of the bacteria would not have substrates to grow in this methanogenesis experiment with acetate as sole carbon source for archaeal genera when qq beads were added on the first day the abundance of methanosaeta methanolinea and methanobacterium all showed different extents of reduction which suggested that the effect of qq on methanogens was a relatively fast process typically methanosaeta as an acetate utilizer can convert acetate to methane and carbon dioxide its abundance decreased by 54 20 when qq beads were added into sludge indicating that methanosaeta activity were likely mediated by ahl since the ahl c12 hsl content in qq group was wiped out on day 3 fig s3 our previous study also showed that the methanosaeta s abundance declined in qq culture with low ahl level liu et al 2019 2020a besides qq strain had a minor effect on genera methanobacterium a hydrogenotrophic methanogen whose abundance was low but stable at 0 42 by the eighth day the abundance of methanogens in mect8 decreased by over 50 while its abundance in meqq8 showed a certain increase trend instead the final abundance of the key methanogens was comparable in both reactors 3 3 6 the relationship of microbial composition and performance the introduction of qq had both negative and positive impacts on the microbial community in the four steps of anaerobic reactions for hydrolysis and acidogenesis the abundance of gram positive bacteria increased and the abundance of gram negative bacteria decreased due to qq s presence resulting in different system performance for example in hydrolysis experiment although qq promoted gram positive bacteria and depressed gram negative bacteria it did not affect the degradation performance of bsa and dextran indicating that the introduction of qq did not affect the hydrolysis step but affected the subsequent acidogenesis step this was because vfa contents in hdqq were significantly higher than that in hdct it is important to emphasize that in acidogenesis experiment acetate content was higher in adqq mainly because of the enrichment of hungateiclostridiaceae ruminiclostridium and clostridium sensu stricto 12 fig 5 followed by higher degradation of glucose this resulted in higher net accumulation of acetate rda also revealed that genus hungateiclostridiaceae performed a strongly positive relationship with glucose degradation rate fig s5a this is likely the main reason why qq increased methane production in anaerobic digestion it was noteworthy that changes in the microbial community during the acetogenesis step did not induce changes in net acetate accumulation in atct and atqq fig 6 it was likely that qq mainly affected the microbial activities in the hydrolysis and acidogenesis experiments rather than the acetogenesis experiment pca analysis also showed that the addition of qq greatly changed the native microbial community fig 8 this is further confirmed in the methanogenesis experiment the methane production in ct and qq reactors was significantly different when the synthetic wastewater was used as carbon source figs 1 and 2 while such difference did not appear when acetate was added as sole carbon source fig 3 furthermore rda of methanogenesis suggested that the ch4 production was largely not positively associated with changes in the abundance of methanogens fig s5b overall it could be concluded that acidogenesis step was promoted among the four anaerobic reaction steps which guaranteed more vfas to be utilized by methanogens for methane production 4 conclusions in this study the impacts of qq bacteria on the activities of the four anaerobic reaction steps and microbial community were revealed the conclusions are as follows 1 qq bacteria would improve the cumulative methane production the optimal dosage in this study was found to be 5 mg strain g beads 2 more vfas were available for methanogenesis process with the presence of qq bacteria 3 qq bacteria promoted acidogenesis reaction kinetics glucose consumption as well as carbon conversion efficiency while hydrolysis acetogenesis and methanogenesis steps were hardly affected 4 hydrolytic fermentation gram positive bacteria e g norank f paludibacteraceae flexilinea paludibacter and a few acidogenic bacteria e g unclassified f hungateiclostridiaceae were enriched in qq reactors 5 the microbial community changes in the acetogenesis and methanogenesis experiment did not affect the performance of these two steps

14864,in our previous study quorum quenching qq bacteria can effectively enhance methane production in an anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr while mitigating membrane biofouling however the mechanism of such enhancement is unclear in this study we analyzed the potential effects from separated hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis steps the cumulative methane production improved by 26 13 22 54 48 70 and 44 93 at qq bacteria dosage of 0 5 1 5 and 10 mg strain g beads respectively it was found that the presence of qq bacteria enhanced acidogenesis step resulting in higher volatile fatty acids vfa production while it had no obvious influence on hydrolysis acetogenesis and methanogenesis steps the substrate glucose conversion efficiency in acidogenesis step was also accelerated 1 45 folds vs control within first eight hours the abundance of hydrolytic fermentation gram positive bacteria and several acidogenic bacteria such as hungateiclostridiaceae was promoted in qq amended culture which enhanced vfa production and accumulation although the abundance of acetoclastic methanogen methanosaeta reduced by 54 2 on the 1st day of qq beads addition the overall performance of methane production was not affected this study revealed that qq had a greater impact on the acidogenesis step in the anaerobic digestion process though the microbial community in acetogenesis and methanogenesis steps was altered this work can provide a theoretical basis for using qq technology to slow down the rate of membrane biofouling in anaerobic membrane bioreactors while increasing methane production and maximizing economic benefits graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords quorum quenching methane production acidogenesis anaerobic digestion microbial shift data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction quorum quenching qq mechanism is based on the reduction of quorum sensing qs signal molecules such as acyl homoserine lactones ahl dong et al 2001 in the microbial environment such reduction is carried out by qs degradation enzymes or transferases qq can effectively suppress the presence of qs and in turn reduce extracellular polymeric substances eps secretion and control the adhesion of the membrane biocake layer kim et al 2013 qq was firstly applied in the aerobic membrane reactor mbr for fouling control yeon et al 2009 found that the content of ahl was reduced along with the eps upon the addition of ahl degrading enzyme in the mbr subsequently kim et al 2011 and oh et al 2013 successfully extended the operating time of aerobic mbr using embedded qq bacteria many studies discussed that qs phenomenon also exists in anaerobic environment for example exogenous signal molecules were used to accelerate granulation or increase methane production ma et al 2018 explored the role of ahl based qs system in anaerobic granulation process and suggested that extracellular polymeric substances eps production and sludge particle size were all strongly positively correlated with ahl level du et al 2021 found that ahl was the most probable quorum sensing signal in methanogens nguyen et al 2019 suggested that the qs of gram negative bacteria was downregulated by aiim lactonase quorum quenching enzyme in anaerobic fermentation two novel qq strains ks2 and ks10 genus pseudomonas were isolated from anaerobic digester sludge by shah and choo 2020 and used for biofilm formation control interestingly liu et al 2019 discovered that the qq strain microbacterium sp not only mitigated the membrane biofouling of anmbr but also significantly increased methane production it was the first time for us to detect the enhanced anaerobic performance and how the addition of qq affects the anaerobic process is worth exploring in our previous work we found that the presence of the qq strain increased the total abundance of fermentative and acetogenic genera by 0 61 and 3 8 times respectively but had very minor impact on the abundance of methanogens liu et al 2020a it was also found that qq bacteria can greatly increase the abundance of gram positive acidogenic bacteria and suppress the gram negative acidogenic bacteria homo acetogenic treponema was also enriched 9 01 in the presence of qq strain suggesting that apart from hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathway extra ch4 could be also produced from the additional acetate synthesized via homo acetogenic pathway zhang et al 2009 however our previous study did not provide sufficient evidence on how qq affected the syntrophic communications among those functional microbes the four steps involved in anaerobic digestion namely hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis may be all or not interfered by qq bacteria hence the objectives of this study are 1 to explore the effect of different qq bacteria dosage on methane production of anaerobic digestion process 2 to explore which of the four stages of anaerobic digestion would be affected by the addition of qq bacteria and 3 to study the effect of qq bacteria on microbial communities in four stages the results may provide a theoretical basis for better use of qq technology in anaerobic systems 2 methods and materials 2 1 qq beads preparation microbacterium sp 16s rrna gene accession number is kr058846 waheed et al 2017 which has ahls degrading capability was used for qq beads preparation the preparation procedure followed the method described in lee et al 2016 briefly fresh microbacterium sp culture was cultivated in luria bertani lb broth till an optical density of 1 00 600 nm the cells were collected and re suspended in a phosphate buffer solution pbs to prepare qq beads a certain amount of qq bacterial suspension was mixed with sterile sodium alginate powder activated carbon pac and polyvinyl alcohol pva and the mixture was dripped into cacl2 boric acid solution to form beads five qq strain contents were prepared i e 0 0 5 1 0 5 0 and 10 0 mg strain g beads denoted as qq0 qq0 5 qq1 qq5 and qq10 respectively finally qq beads were incubated in 0 5 mol l sodium sulfate solution for 4 h and transferred to glucose solution for further incubation of 24 h the average size of qq beads was approximately 4 3 mm 2 2 effect of qq strain dosage on methane production each type of qq beads was added into 3 anaerobic reactors at a volume ratio of 2 v beads v reactor liu et al 2019 in total 15 reactors were set up for this experiment other than qq beads the reactors with working volume of 400 ml were seeded with anaerobic sludge at mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration of 5000 mg l synthetic wastewater with cod of 500 mg l was added into the reactors to initiate the reaction the composition of synthetic wastewater can be found in table s1 liu et al 2019 all the reactors were then operated in the automatic methane potential analysis systems ampts bioprocess control sweden and methane production was automatically recorded sludge mixed liquor was drawn from each reactor on the 2nd 4th 10th and 14th day operation the samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm filter and filtrate was collected for vfa measurement dna samples were collected on 14th day and stored in 80 c freezer 2 3 mechanism study in order to understand the qq effect on each anaerobic reaction step a series of batch experiment was designed using model compounds as substrates huang et al 2020 the anaerobic sludge used in hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis experiment was treated with a sufficient amount of sodium bromoethane sulfate for two days in advance to inhibit the activity of methanogens the hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis activity tests were conducted in serum bottles with a volume of 100 ml as for methanogenesis activity anaerobic sludge from section 2 2 was used in this step without sodium bromoethane sulfate treatment the methanogenesis step was also carried out in ampts hydrolysisstep 80 ml of seed anaerobic sludge 20 ml of inorganic nutrients table s2 and 2 volume volume beads embedded with and without qq bacteria were separately added to two groups of serum bottle reactors the group without qq bacteria was named hdct as control group the other group with qq bacteria beads 5 0 mg strain g beads was named hdqq each group consisted of triplicates the bovine serum albumin bsa 4 g l and dextran 0 9 g l in synthetic water table s2 were served as model protein and model polysaccharide respectively all serum bottles were purged with n2 10 min and then incubated in a 35 1 c incubator with shaking speed of 150 rpm hdct and hdqq were sampled on day 3 and 14 for dna extraction and at 0 h 8 h 24 h 72 h and 120 h for vfa and eps analysis eps extraction methods were according to waheed et al 2017 acidogenesisstep evaluation of acidification activity was performed with the same experimental set up as above however the organic carbon source in the synthetic wastewater was replaced with 0 9

was replaced with 1 g l of butyrate or propionate the rest of the operating conditions were the same two groups of reactors were named atct and atqq respectively samples were taken on day 3 and 14 for

without qq bacteria were separately added to two groups of ampts reactors the group with empty beads was named mect as control group the other group with qq bacteria beads 5 0 mg strain g beads was named meqq each group consisted of triplicates all ampts reactors were purged with n2 10 min ch4 production were recorded automatically sludge samples were collected on day 1 and 8 for dna extraction

statistical significance analysis independent samples t test was analyzed with statistical package for social sciences software 3 results and discussion 3 1 the effect of qq strain dosage on methane production the methane production profile of the 15 anaerobic reactors was automatically recorded by the ampts fig 1 a displays that the methane production from qq1 group was the lowest during the first six days operation with an average methane production of 89 10 4 14 ml the corresponding average cumulative methane production was 92 8 6 29 121 63 6 50 119 07 4 52 and 109 40 5 00 ml in qq0 qq0 5 qq5 and qq10 groups respectively from day 7 the methane production of qq0 group stabilized while the other four groups continued to increase and the cumulative methane production on day 11 was in the following order 5 mg strain g beads 10 mg strain g beads 0 5 mg strain g beads 1 mg strain g beads 0 mg strain g beads the final average cumulative methane production in qq0 qq0 5 qq1 qq5 and qq10 groups realized at 128 20 13 80 161 70 14 83 157 10 6 4 190 63 3 50 and 185 80 6 05 ml respectively followed by a methane yield of 32 73 4 44 44 54 1 82 37 94 1 67 47 93 0 41 and 44 10 0 46 ml mmol c was also calculated and suggested that the dosage of qq bacteria at 5 mg strain g beads was the most representative this confirms that the addition of qq bacteria could promote the methane production which is consistent with our previous study liu et al 2019 the results also show that the higher the qq bacteria dosage the more efficient the methane production in the anaerobic process is the effective conversion of organic substrates during anaerobic digestion is crucial to ensure a stable methane production fig 1b shows the effect of qq bacteria dosage on the accumulation and conversion of vfa only three types of vfa were detected namely acetate hac fig 1b propionic acid hpr and isovaleric acid iso cap fig s1 the concentrations of hpr and iso cap were very low thus only acetate profiles are discussed here on the second day the accumulation of acetate was 6 23 6 57 7 59 7 41 and 7 81 mmol l in the five groups reactors the acetate concentration in qq1 qq5 and qq10 groups was 18 94 25 36 higher than that of qq0 the acetate concentration in qq0 quickly dropped to 2 25 mmol l performed the fastest consumption rate on the fourth day compared to other groups followed by the qq0 5 group which was 4 02 mmol l the acetate concentration of qq1 qq5 and qq10 remained at 5 88 6 43 mmol l when the operation continued to the tenth day the concentration of acetate in qq0 and qq0 5 was comparable and its concentration in qq10 was still the highest the methane production in the qq bacteria added reactors was all higher than that of qq0 reactors at the end of the operation vfas were all almost depleted in this experiment the correlation between acetate concentration and methane production is not very clear in the first ten days the consumption rate of acetate in the qq0 group was the highest but its cumulative methane production was the lowest we hypothesize that the addition of qq bacteria increased available carbon source for methane production or inhibited the pathways of acetate consumption by other bacteria hence methane production was enhanced with presence of qq bacteria this will be discussed in the next section where four anaerobic reactions are separately verified from above results the methane production performance was comparably the highest in qq5 and qq10 groups therefore from the economic point of view 5 mg strain g beads was chosen for the subsequent experiments 3 2 mechanism investigation 3 2 1 hydrolysis in the hydrolysis experiment bovine serum albumin and dextran were used as carbon source to verify the effect of qq on hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis the protein content in hdct and hdqq increased after one day cultivation with slightly higher increase in hdct fig 2 a subsequently protein consumption rates were similar in both groups of reactors no significant difference p 0 936 0 05 was found for polysaccharides degradation between hdct and hdqq fig 2b interestingly vfa profiles were distinguishably different the acetate concentration in hdct increased sharply to 0 45 mmol g vss during the first eight hours operation and declined to 0 21 mmol g vss in the next 16 h fig 2c then it slowly increased to 0 91 mmol g vss till the end of the experiment on the other hand the acetate concentration in hdqq continuously increased since beginning to 1 87 mmol g vss at the 120 h which was about 2 fold higher than that of hdct the final concentration of butyric acid in hdqq were 2 times higher than that in hdct 0 07 vs 0 03 mmol g vss fig 2e the final concentration of propionic acid was at similar level 1 05 mmol g vss though it was observed higher in hdqq during the operation fig 2d it is speculated that the addition of qq either promoted hydrolysis and or acidogenesis process or inhibited the vfa consumption process e g acetogenesis or other pathways given the protein and polysaccharides changes were similar in the two groups of reactors it can be concluded that hydrolysis step was not significantly affected by the qq bacteria addition according to toc profile fig 2f the toc concentration in hdqq remained relatively stable in the first 120 h while the immediate reduction was found in hdct once the primary carbon source was depleted toc was rapidly consumed in both hdqq and hdct reactors with the consumption rates of 0 99 mg g vss d vs 1 30 mg g vss d respectively this suggests that acidogenesis was likely promoted in hdqq while it is not clear if acetogenesis was affected at this stage 3 2 2 acidogenesis in the acidogenesis experiment glucose and glutamate were used as carbon source to verify the effect of qq on acidogenesis and acetogenesis it was found that the consumption rate of glucose in adqq was faster than that in adct in the first eight hours fig 3 b indicating that the addition of qq bacteria promoted the conversion of glucose and thus enhanced the activity of acidogenic bacteria though primary substrates were mostly depleted in the first 24 h net vfa production continued afterwards acetate concentration did not show significant difference between adct and adqq in the first three days with slightly higher accumulation in adqq fig 3c it is noteworthy that acetate was reduced in adct thereafter while that in adqq remained the increasing trend the results indicate that acetate may be partially consumed by other non methanogens in the adct since methanogenesis was inhibited while such consumption was difficult to confirm in adqq meanwhile no obvious difference was obtained in propionic acid profiles which suggests that the presence of qq did not affect the conversion path of propionate to acetate fig 3d the increase of toc in adqq corresponds to the accumulation of acetate fig 3e after five days operation the consumption rates of toc in both reactors were comparable 1 27 vs 1 96 mg g vss d therefore the additional available organic carbon or vfas in qq reactors may provide more substrate for subsequent methane production fig 1 based on the observation it can be concluded that qq bacteria can accelerate the degradation of glucose and at the same time it can also enhance the conversion efficiency of organic matter into acetate the acceleration on the substrate degradation in acidogenesis step was considered as the main reason for the increase of methane production in anaerobic digestion and this was further analyzed from the perspective of abundance of functional microorganisms 3 2 3 acetogenesis when butyrate or propionate was added to the reactors the final acetate concentration in atct and atqq did not differ much fig 4 a though it was slightly reduced in the first 24 h in atct the trends of butyrate or propionate profiles were also roughly similar in atct and atqq data not shown finally the toc concentration in the two reactors was also comparable fig 4b these results suggest that the addition of qq bacteria had minimal impact on acetogenesis and the presence of qq bacteria did not impact on the acetate consumption by the non methanogens consumer either 3 2 4 methanogenesis when sodium acetate was used as the only carbon source with or without qq beads there was no significant difference in total methane production between qq group meqq and non qq group mect in the first 12 h fig 5 a the methane production in mect slowed down after 12 h operation and finally stopped at the 60th hour with a final methane production and yield of 47 30 0 15 ml g vss and 32 94 0 10 ml mmol c the methane production in meqq continued until 72 h with a methane production and yield of 50 95 0 80 ml g vss and 40 17 0 63 ml mmol c the amount of methane produced in the two groups did not show a statistically significant difference p 0 510 0 05 indicating that the existence of qq did not have significant impact on the activities of methanogens thus the additional methane production from the ad systems was likely due to the additional carbon source produced from the previous step namely acidogenesis 3 3 microbial community responses 3 3 1 α diversity the microbial communities changes of functional microbes involved in hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis processes were investigated the shannon index of hdct and hdqq were similar on the third and fourteenth days fig s2 however shannon index decreased in adqq and atqq on the third day in acidogenesis and acetogenesis processes and then increased significantly after 14 days operation as compared to control cases the shannon index in ct and qq of methanogenesis experiment were all maintained around 4 35 0 21 the results demonstrated that qq bacteria did not have a significant impact on the microbial α diversity in the hydrolysis and methanogenesis steps but had a greater impact on acidogenesis and acetogenesis 3 3 2 microbial composition shift in hydrolysis experiment top 50 microbes at the genus level involved in hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis were selected to analyze the effects of qq on the functional flora in the three steps fig 6 a given bes was added in the experiment the abundance of methanogens was below 0 01 and their activity were completely inhibited thus the abundance of methanogens is not discussed in this section in the hydrolysis experiment macellibacteroides were dominant with an abundance of 57 61 46 92 34 96 and 33 90 in hdct3 hdqq3 hdct14 and hdqq14 respectively chen and chang 2017 revealed that mono and disaccharides could be utilized by genus macellibacteroides and fermented into acetate butyrate and iso butyrate via glucose metabolism macellibacteroides was found enriched in ahl fed reactors liu et al 2020b but less abundant in the reactors with qq bacteria hadi et al 2021 in this study the presence of qq bacteria only reduced macellibacteroides abundance in the first three days and its abundance dropped to a similar level on the 14th day in both groups it is worth noting that the abundance of genus norank f paludibacteraceae norank f rikenellaceae flexilinea paludibacter all increased with the presence of qq bacteria the abundance of dmer64 petrimonas blvii28 wastewater sludge group sedimentibacter anaerocella and enterococcus reduced instead flexilinea gram positive bacteria and blvii28 wastewater sludge group gram negative bacteria were both reported as fermenter in anaerobic digestion which can convert complex organic compounds to acetate or h2 jiang et al 2020 sun et al 2016 paludibacter belongs to family paludibacteraceae can utilize various soluble carbohydrates and sugars to produce short chain vfa ueki et al 2006 spring et al 2020 proposed that family paludibacteraceae can use carbohydrates as a substrate genera involved in family rikenellaceae were all fermenters that can convert carbohydrates or proteins to organic acids su et al 2014 although genus norank f rikenellaceae dmer64 and anaerocella belong to the same family rikenellaceae the effects of qq on the three of them were different the abundance of petrimonas as a typically hydrolyser wang et al 2020 was commonly found in qs enriched system liu et al 2020b and peng et al 2021 the ahl profiles fig s3 suggest that c12 hslwas the dominant ahl type in the studied ad system and the content of c12 hsl completely disappeared due to qq s presence anaerocella were capable of degrading amino acids to vfa abe et al 2012 it was noted that dmer64 blvii28 wastewater sludge group sedimentibacter and anaerocella only enriched in reactor hdct fig s3a which suggested that qq may inhibit the growth of those genera but promoted other genera e g flexilinea clostridium sensu stricto 9 dev114 that only enriched in reactor hdqq another interesting observation is that two hydrolytic fermentation bacteria genus longilinea and bacteroides were only affected by qq initially and returned to the similar level as hdct at later stage this suggests those bacteria can resist the effects from qq bacteria loogilinea was proven to be an ahl mediated genus he et al 2016 and had the ability to metabolize carbohydrates and produce acetate yamada et al 2007 3 3 3 microbial composition shift in acidogenesis experiment the abundance of hungateiclostridiaceae a fermenter that can convert sugar to acetate and h2 zhang et al 2018 was significantly enriched in adqq 47 75 compared to adct 0 01 it suggested that the presence of qq bacteria encouraged the growth of hungateiclostridiaceae which corresponds to the result of higher glucose degradation rate and then generated higher acetate content in the adqq reactor during the acidogenesis step fig 3b and c redundancy analysis rda also suggested that acetate content was performed strongly positive relationship with hungateiclostridiaceae fig s5a ruminiclostridium and clostridium sensu stricto 12 were also highly enriched in adqq and previous hdqq this is the first report on the enrichment of these three bacteria which were induced by the presence of qq bacteria at this stage there is no direct evidence to prove whether the three bacteria are qs based bacteria the abundance of macellibacteroides clostridium sensu stricto 1 bacteroides and sphaerochaeta declined because of the presence of qq among them clostridium sensu stricto 1 as the primary hydrogen producing bacteria were reported to dominate in the environment with high qs activity sun et al 2020 which performed positive relationships with ahl contents in this study fig s4 except sphaerochaeta the rest four were reported to have qs activities to date it is not clear if sphaerochaeta is related to qs or qq notwithstanding they were revealed to play a key role in fermenting short chain organics to sugars and vfas mäkinen et al 2013 similar with hydrolysis experiment genus longilinea was only affected by qq in a short period and returned to the same level as control group in acidogenesis step it can be concluded that the addition of qq led the abundance of bacteria such as hungateiclostridiaceae and ruminiclostridium to increase and thus accelerated the conversion of substrates to acetate 3 3 4 microbial composition shift in acetogenesis experiment contrary to the results in hydrolysis and acidogenesis experiments norank f paludibacteraceae abundance was promoted significantly in acetogenesis experiment with the presence of qq whose abundance trend was consistent with that in the hydrolysis experiment indicating that this bacterium was indeed negatively affected by qq fig s3c there was no report on the relationship between this genus and qq bacteria which requires further investigation second the reduced abundance of desulfomicrobium norank f anaerolineaceae and syntrophomonas due to qq s presence was also found in our previous research liu et al 2020a desulfomicrobium is capable of reducing sulfate to hydrogen sulfide by consuming vfa as electron donor qian et al 2015 genus syntrophomonas mainly degrades butyrate into acetate and produce h2 sieber et al 2010 genus ottowia a hydrolyser whose abundance was reduced significantly due to qq s presence although the abundance of these vfa consumers decreased other acetate consumer genus such as norank f paludibacteraceae increased hence it was possible that the net vfa accumulation remained similar loogilinea s abundance were slightly reduced when qq bacteria was introduced with an abundance of 8 90 and 5 16 in atct3 and atqq3 respectively this observation was different compared to hydrolysis and acidogenesis experiments suggesting that genera loogilinea could be easily affected by qq with vfa as substrate similar change was found for norank f synergistaceae synergistaceae is a syntrophic acetate oxidating bacterium in this study the abundance of synergistaceae declined in adqq3 2 95 in the first a few days and resumed to initial level at the later stage while its abundance in atct remained stable 3 3 5 microbial composition shift in methanogenesis experiment dmer64 was dominant in methanogenesis experiment with an abundance of 15 25 22 22 16 88 and 15 17 in mect1 meqq1 mect8 and meqq8 respectively fig 7 a dmer64 again were inhibited at later stage of meqq operation though a short term increase was observed the results were consistent with that in hydrolysis and acetogenesis experiments longilinea displayed a similar trend as that in the hydrolysis experiment genus norank f paludibacteraceae was only detected in meqq8 with an abundance of 11 04 confirming again that qq can promote the growth of this genus significantly other bacteria did not seem to be affected by qq s presence this is reasonable that many of the bacteria would not have substrates to grow in this methanogenesis experiment with acetate as sole carbon source for archaeal genera when qq beads were added on the first day the abundance of methanosaeta methanolinea and methanobacterium all showed different extents of reduction which suggested that the effect of qq on methanogens was a relatively fast process typically methanosaeta as an acetate utilizer can convert acetate to methane and carbon dioxide its abundance decreased by 54 20 when qq beads were added into sludge indicating that methanosaeta activity were likely mediated by ahl since the ahl c12 hsl content in qq group was wiped out on day 3 fig s3 our previous study also showed that the methanosaeta s abundance declined in qq culture with low ahl level liu et al 2019 2020a besides qq strain had a minor effect on genera methanobacterium a hydrogenotrophic methanogen whose abundance was low but stable at 0 42 by the eighth day the abundance of methanogens in mect8 decreased by over 50 while its abundance in meqq8 showed a certain increase trend instead the final abundance of the key methanogens was comparable in both reactors 3 3 6 the relationship of microbial composition and performance the introduction of qq had both negative and positive impacts on the microbial community in the four steps of anaerobic reactions for hydrolysis and acidogenesis the abundance of gram positive bacteria increased and the abundance of gram negative bacteria decreased due to qq s presence resulting in different system performance for example in hydrolysis experiment although qq promoted gram positive bacteria and depressed gram negative bacteria it did not affect the degradation performance of bsa and dextran indicating that the introduction of qq did not affect the hydrolysis step but affected the subsequent acidogenesis step this was because vfa contents in hdqq were significantly higher than that in hdct it is important to emphasize that in acidogenesis experiment acetate content was higher in adqq mainly because of the enrichment of hungateiclostridiaceae ruminiclostridium and clostridium sensu stricto 12 fig 5 followed by higher degradation of glucose this resulted in higher net accumulation of acetate rda also revealed that genus hungateiclostridiaceae performed a strongly positive relationship with glucose degradation rate fig s5a this is likely the main reason why qq increased methane production in anaerobic digestion it was noteworthy that changes in the microbial community during the acetogenesis step did not induce changes in net acetate accumulation in atct and atqq fig 6 it was likely that qq mainly affected the microbial activities in the hydrolysis and acidogenesis experiments rather than the acetogenesis experiment pca analysis also showed that the addition of qq greatly changed the native microbial community fig 8 this is further confirmed in the methanogenesis experiment the methane production in ct and qq reactors was significantly different when the synthetic wastewater was used as carbon source figs 1 and 2 while such difference did not appear when acetate was added as sole carbon source fig 3 furthermore rda of methanogenesis suggested that the ch4 production was largely not positively associated with changes in the abundance of methanogens fig s5b overall it could be concluded that acidogenesis step was promoted among the four anaerobic reaction steps which guaranteed more vfas to be utilized by methanogens for methane production 4 conclusions in this study the impacts of qq bacteria on the activities of the four anaerobic reaction steps and microbial community were revealed the conclusions are as follows 1 qq bacteria would improve the cumulative methane production the optimal dosage in this study was found to be 5 mg strain g beads 2 more vfas were available for methanogenesis process with the presence of qq bacteria 3 qq bacteria promoted acidogenesis reaction kinetics glucose consumption as well as carbon conversion efficiency while hydrolysis acetogenesis and methanogenesis steps were hardly affected 4 hydrolytic fermentation gram positive bacteria e g norank f paludibacteraceae flexilinea paludibacter and a few acidogenic bacteria e g unclassified f hungateiclostridiaceae were enriched in qq reactors 5 the microbial community changes in the acetogenesis and methanogenesis experiment did not affect the performance of these two steps
