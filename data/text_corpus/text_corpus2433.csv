characterization of studied area the study area fig 1 is geographically located at 27 05 42 s 52 37 04 w in the west region of santa catarina state with an average elevation of 674 m above sea level the climate is subtropical mesothermal humid the average annual temperature changes from 17 9 to 19 8 c and the annual rainfall varies from 1 430 to 2 020 mm peel et al 2007 procedures for well selection collection and analysis of water samples a number of 100 well were defined fig 1 with 50 wells in the urban zone and 50 wells in the rural area the relation of wells for collection followed the representativeness criteria of the rural and urban studied area according to instituto brasileiro de geografia e estatística ibge 2013 the samples were collected in triplicate march september and november 2014 only tubular wells used for human or human animal consumption were evaluated for geographic location of wells garmin gps global positioning system etrex summit model was used the sampling procedure followed the standard methods for water and wastewater examination according to apha apha awwa wef 2012 heavy metals analyses cd cu fe mg mn pb and zn was carried out by atomic absorption spectroscopy aas as showed in table 1 to the determination of no3 e no2 was used spectrophotometer uv vis with maximal absorbance at 220 nm and 543 nm respectively to nh4 analysis an ammonia meter quimis was used the physical chemical analysis was carried out following standard methods for water and wastewater examination apha awwa wef 2012 2 2 statistical analysis matrix y of well sites objects physical and chemical parameters descriptors was used as a response matrix in all analyses before the spatial analyses the y matrix by scaling x to zero mean and unit variance was transformed in order to compare with different units borcard et al 2011 a moran s eigenvector maps mem approach was used to decompose the spatial relation among the wells into all possible scales of spatial extent legendre and gauthier 2014 the mem results were used in a canonical ordination rda to analyze the spatial distribution of wells described by physical and chemical parameters by means of resampling of matrix y a significant result α 5 of the observed test compared to the randomized values indicates the existence of a spatial dependency between wells for the distance based analyzes of environmental effects was performed a square root transformation on y matrix to reduce the importance of observations with very high values permutational multivariate anovas based on gower distances were used to access the influence of the factors 1 altitude 2 facies type and 3 patch type and bonferroni correction on the original p value of 0 05 changed to 0 017 to account for the multiple testing problem was used borcard et al 2011 principal coordinate analysis pcoa was performed to characterize the pattern distribution of wells based on the physical and chemical parameters pcoa analysis was performed using multiv v 2 63b software pillar 2006 and the other analyzes were performed using r v 3 2 1 lenth 2016 2 3 methodology for map development for the maps development through data from the 100 wells arcgis 9 3 software was used the localization map was performed by the interpolation of landsat 7 satellite image bands r3b2g1 and google earth 2011 digital image processing by arcmap 10 extension for the generation of the potentiometric direction trend of underground water flow and geostatistical maps estimating the distribution of fe mn and no3 the spatial analyst extension was used the maps were developed by kriging ordinary methods and variogram spherical with anisotropic method due to the aquifer type for groundwater flow lines fig 7 archydro ground water extension was used where was performed the hydropower interpolation h ground level static well level potentiometric profile in the wells with potentiometric model of the aquifer indicating the underground flow and discharge data from the wells 3 results and discussion 3 1 well characteristics from the results it was observed the average depth of the wells in the rural area was smaller than the urban area difference of 30 m especially due to the difference of wells number from each zone since in the urban area the number of wells is higher than in the rural area this situation can favor the reduction of the groundwater in addition reducing the flow rate of lower depth wells custodio and da silva 2008 mattiuzi et al 2016 these factors may have a direct influence on the depth of the wells because with the lowering of the groundwater the depths of the wells tend to be deeper in the search for water resources in relation to groundwater quality 85 wells from 100 showed parameters that exceeded maximum allowed value according to current brazilian legislation brasil 2011 for the heavy metals cd cu mg pb e zn and nitrogenate compounds no3 no2 nh4 all wells had concentrations within the limits for human consumption table 2 regarding to the environmental effects no influence of altitude was verified f1 94 2 10 p 0 055 for the facies type paranapanema and chapecó no relationship in the physical and chemical composition of water samples f1 94 0 99 p 0 44 was observed on the other hand the zone type rural or urban had a significant effect on the distributions of the parameters f1 94 7 26 p 0 001 with a gradient of variation along axis 1 which divides the urban wells from the rural most of urban wells were associated with an increase in the no3 cd cu e de nh4 while most of rural wells were associated to the fe mn and ph fig 2 axis 1 explains 14 of the data and axis 2 corresponds to 8 5 with a data total of 22 6 the main variables associated with axis 1 are ph fe and mn and for axis 2 cu cd no3 and nh4 fig 3 fe mn and no3 was observed in all studied wells n 100 and the presence of mg in 97 wells the observed results can be related to the region geological characteristics basalt with chemical composition characterized by high levels of mg fe and sio2 pinto and hartmann 2011 for this reason the physical and chemical weathering through the water percolation and contacts with basaltic spills can dissolve minerals present in the igneous rock bittencourt et al 2003 for fe fig 3a and mn content fig 3c the observed variation between rural and urban zones was lower the higher concentration of fe and mn observed in the rural zones can be related to the lower exploration of hydric resources compared to the urban area based on number of actives well and for this reason the water circulation is smaller with a higher contact time with the rocks contributing to the solution and mineral carrying promoting the mineralization of water due to the attenuated physical and chemical weathering of the basaltic rock bittencourt et al 2003 pacheco and van der weijden 2014 for the urban zone this effect probably occurs in a different way since the greatest concentration of wells in this area the renewal of the underground water resource occurs quickly and the contact time with the basaltic rock is smaller when compared to rural areas in relation to cu metal it was observed in 30 wells figs 3f 24 located at urban area 12 well residential area 8 industrial area and 4 intermediary areas in general anthropic pollution due to population concentration and the large number of industries can contribute to a high number of wells in the urban area with cu presence chai et al 2014 li et al 2013 the occurrence of cu in low concentrations in groundwater may be related to the type of rock that forms the aquifer and in the studied area is related to the magmatic facies paranapanema pinto et al 2011 with probable cu dissolution in the groundwater another possible of cu presence can be associated with the type of pipeline used to conduct the underground water resource since in most of the wells galvanized pipe is used using cu coating to avoid oxidation process quality 2011 the concentration of cu did not exceed the maximum value allowed by brazilian legislation table 1 from the geostatistical analysis of fe distribution the metal showed a homogeneous arrangement in the urban and rural studied areas located at north side with a tendency to increase to the south side fig 4 the area with highest fe concentration has a largely conserved vegetation cover area and a relatively low number of active wells compared to the urban area from these premises we suggest that the increase in the fe content possibly occurs due to the longer residence time of the groundwater in the saturated zone carrying more metal through the chemical and physical weathering maher 2010 mocellin and fonseca 2009 co2 presence increased to the vegetation cover due to the organic material decomposition basiliko et al 2006 consequently converting co2 to carbonic acid reaching the saturated zone dissolving fe to the groundwater custodio and da silva 2008 also in relation to co2 presence due to the organic material decomposition lower ph values observed in the urban area can be related to the infiltration of organic material from the surface which can decrease ph due to the oxidation process silva et al 2014 another aspect to be considered is the excess of active wells in the urban zone with possible overexploitation which can influence the variation of the underground flow and the recharge velocity from the surface increasing the co2 concentration in the water consequently decreasing the ph cruz and peixoto 1991 for mn fig 5 the geostatistical analysis showed a lower concentration in the urban zone compared to the rural zone with the same effect occurring in the urban zone at the north of the area area in the rural zone these areas have a large number of wells which is possibly related to the decrease of mn concentration due to over exploitation and to the fact that the replacement time of groundwater is faster than areas more conserved and with less active wells in this way the residence time of the water in the aquifer decreases and the chemical and physical weathering caused by the contact of water and rock is also reduced reducing the concentration of the metal in the demarcated studied areas on the map for the no3 higher concentration in the urban area 2 26 mg l compared to the rural area was observed 1 01 mg l as showed in fig 6 in general the presence of no3 in groundwater may occur naturally at low concentrations due to the decomposition of organic compounds but concentration above 5 mg l may be indicative of groundwater contamination by human activity sewage septic tanks garbage dumps cemeteries nitrogen fertilization or animal waste gu et al 2013 singhal and gupta 2010 in the rural area the application of nitrogen fertilizers can also be related to the presence of no3 karandish et al 2017 the high solubility of no3 in water and the low retention in the soil in areas with saturation of the soil by nitrogenous compounds drought and low temperatures are factors that decreasing no3 evaporation increasing the concentration ju et al 2006 wick et al 2012 3 2 groundwater flow analysis the flow tendency of the groundwater showed to follow soil topographic converging to the main watercourses of the region uruguay river irani river san jose slab fig 7 demonstrating that it is a free behavior aquifer to semi finite this type of underground flow contributes to the rivers recharge which becomes a constant source of water even in times of drought called effluent course meixner et al 2016 the underground flow showed a tendency to follow the north south direction with possible recharge zones mainly due to atmospheric precipitations röper et al 2012 factors that contribute to the occurrence of water infiltration and supply the aquifer dahan et al 2008 areas of a possible reversal of groundwater flow marked area with circles in fig 7 were observed areas that receiving water resources from the west and north regions creating the inversion of groundwater flow due to the recharge from several directions in addition this area may have a direct influence on possible leaks in the water and sewage distribution network that may contribute to the alteration of the underground flow in general it was understood that the analysis of the groundwater flow and aquifer potentiometry should be assessed regionally in the macro area with a larger number of wells but the analysis of flow behavior assist in the warning environmental impacts associated with potential risks as well as be an asset for the management of environmental protection areas and aquifer recharge areas basu and van meter 2014 4 conclusion the evaluation of the groundwater quality in the studied area indicated that the underground water resource of the sampled wells it was satisfactory with attention to the concentrations of fe and mn the high values of fe and mn were related to the characteristics of the region geological formations not discarded constructive problems with the wells which may be contributed to the ions increase since the soil is directly correlated with the decrease and or increase of fe and mn content in the groundwater the cu no2 e no3 did not exceed the maximum value for human consumption but high detected levels become an alert especially in the urban areas which showed greater concentrations in relation to the rural areas the geostatistical analysis of the data proved great value for the decision support of the water management agencies collaborating for a more careful evaluation pointing out possible areas of anthropic or natural contamination and being an auxiliary tool for the study of potential recharge areas of aquifers declaration of competing interest the

concentration is found to be 206 μg l in chakdah few ground water samples have been identified with presence of elevated level of nitrate 45 57 6 mg l particularly from four blocks krishnanagar i nabadwip kaliganj and chapra in the district no sample has been identified with uranium concentration range 0 21 20 9 μg l beyond its permissible limit 30 μg l as recommended by who presence of high concentrations of cl no3 and especially hco3 ions in groundwater and their positive interdependence with each other may magnify uranium contamination in future through dissolution of uranium as they are good carrier of uranium the fluoride concentration has been observed within its recommended value in drinking water there is a strong possibility for cancer risk through as and u in drinking water

future graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater physico chemical parameters toxic contaminants distribution water quality index health risk assessment 1 introduction groundwater being one of the most abundant and precious natural resources in india is mostly used for domestic and irrigation purposes in both rural and urban areas chakraborti et al 2011 for the tremendous growing population in india the demand of freshwater is increasing rapidly which results the amount of groundwater being in a critical condition it has to be also noted that india is the largest user of groundwater in the world world bank 2012 reports say that more than 33 of total groundwater resources in this country are not safe for drinking chakraborti et al 2010 times of india 2010 a significant amount of population of the villages of west bengal india is directly dependent on groundwater for drinking cooking and other household purposes due to over exploitation of this resource a number of aquifers are unsustainable now similarly the quality of groundwater is also a primary concern for all healthy livings because almost 80 of diseases in human beings are water borne das and nag 2015 ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 unesco 2007 day by day a number of intrusive toxic pollutants are polluting groundwater from various sources whether natural through mineralization or anthropogenic through agricultural and industrial activities which causes a serious threat to health wu and sun 2016 arsenic as and fluoride f are two geogenic lethal elements which pollute the aquifers and sometimes these two elements deteriorate the quality of groundwater being present simultaneously kumar et al 2016 rasool et al 2015 groundwater arsenic is generally to blame for the local geochemical environment of the aquifers and nearby soil in more detail natural arsenic comes into groundwater from oxidation of arsenic bearing minerals or reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydroxide depending upon various hydrogeochemical conditions nickson et al 2000 several sites of india like west bengal bihar uttar pradesh jharkhand chattisgarh assam manipur are reported with groundwater arsenic contamination since past 20 30 years chakraborti et al 2018 rahman et al 2009 nine districts of west bengal india are severely suffering from as contamination in groundwater i e around 6 million people are at high health risk because of as contaminated drinking water chowdhury et al 2000 2001 dey et al 2014 rahaman et al 2013 more than 40 of estimated indian population is suffering from f causing diseases chakraborti et al 2016 especially the people of south indian districts who are facing a serious health problem due to fluoride contamination in groundwater raj and shaji 2017 singaraja et al 2013 in west bengal districts like bankura puruliya and birbhum are also reported with groundwater fluoride contamination batabyal and gupta 2017 mondal et al 2014 samal et al 2015 this fluoride contamination in groundwater is mainly controlled by the solubility of fluorite caf2 fluorapatite ca5 po4 3 cl f oh or hornblende naca2 mg fe al 5 si al 8o22 oh f 2 type of minerals narsimha and rajitha 2018 moreover different kinds of rocks metamorphic or sedimentary and their rate of fluorine enrichment regulates fluorine burden in the adjacent aquifers routroy et al 2013 groundwater of some states of india is also contaminated with nitrate like andhra pradesh rao 2006 reddy et al 2009 uttar pradesh sankararamakrishnan et al 2008 and rajasthan suthar et al 2009 in 2008 hooghly district in west bengal has been recognised with nitrate enrichment in its surface and groundwater kundu et al 2008 nitrate contamination is usually a result of agricultural activities with excess use of nitrogenous fertilisers nitrate being highly soluble in water leaches into groundwater while passing through the subsoil layers as the soil particles have low nitrate retention capacity majumdar and gupta 2000 for groundwater contamination another liable mineral is uranium u which causes a serious health risk because of its radiological and chemical properties and nephrotoxic effects in human health kumar et al 2011 singh et al 2013 in general the amorphous iron oxide and hydroxides ferrihydrite are good sink of uranium das et al 2018 apart from leaching from mines natural uranium enter into groundwater from its different mineralised forms like uraninite uo2 pitchblende u3o8 uranyl nitrate uo2 no3 2 autunite ca uo2 2 po4 2 10 12h2o uranophane ca uo2 2 sio3 oh 2 5h2o etc wu et al 2014 hence it is required to monitor the groundwater quality on a regular basis especially which are widely used by the population for sustainable maintenance of groundwater resources to know the origin mobility and geochemical distribution pattern of as and u in deep aquifers a significant investigation is done recently in western hetao basin inner mongolia where it has been established that the weathering of bedrock stimulates groundwater contamination guo et al 2016 west bengal falls under the world s largest delta ganga meghna brahmaputra gmb plain which is well enriched with as and the soil type is predominantly alluvial chakraborti et al 2013 nadia a district located in the east side of river bhagirathi of west bengal is highly contaminated with as which is already reported in various researches das et al 1996 mandal et al 1996 mazumder et al 2010 rahman et al 2014 roychowdhury et al 2008 it was reported that groundwater in all the 17 blocks of nadia district is affected with arsenic where approximately 51 4 and 17 3 of the tube wells had arsenic above 10 and 50 μg l respectively rahman et al 2014 the information depicts the condition of groundwater in nadia district which is not at all worthy for drinking purposes the main objective of our present work is to discuss the suitability of groundwater in nadia district for domestic and irrigational practices on a holistic approach based on the physico chemical parameters studied followed by water quality index wqi and future human health risk assessment ra no such study has come out so far on nadia district which aims its overall water quality covering all kinds of physico chemical parameters in this work the wqi result depicts the percentage of water can be used for domestic purposes and the risk assessment study makes people aware about the future health risk caused by the presence of arsenic nitrate and even a low amount of uranium in the ground water the possibility of nitrate pollution from agricultural run off and uranium mobility from mineralogical leaching should be looked after different studies have been done previously to monitor the surface or ground water quality based on wqi a potent appliance for quality analysis of river or surface or groundwater in india batabyal and chakraborty 2015 gupta and misra 2018 packialakshmi et al 2015 štambuk giljanović 1999 tiwari and mishra 1985 likewise a number of studies have been reported in india on groundwater quality and associated health risks based on the attribution of the toxic contaminants as no3 f and u present in groundwater adimalla and li 2019 adimalla et al 2019 chattopadhyay et al 2020 duggal et al 2017 goswami et al 2019 sharma and singh 2016 the spatial distribution of the aforesaid toxic elements in the groundwater of the study area is aimed to study through separate contour diagrams the present work will also focus on the correlation among the variable elements present in groundwater and other physico chemical parameters through some statistical programs like regression analysis correlation matrix and cluster analysis moreover future cancer and non cancer risk assessment on human health through consumption of these toxic contaminants have been evaluated in the studied areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is the nadia district which lies in the eastern india west bengal on the

villages http censusindia gov in 2011census dchb dchb a 19 1910 part a dchb nadia pdf the population of this district is approximate 51 7 lakhs which is massively dependent on hand tube well water and very few piped line water supply supplied by the local governments rahman et al 2014 nadia remains evergreen with seasonal field crops throughout the year for its plenty of underground water and soil type new alluvium almost all the important crops are profitably grown in this district the economy of which depends mainly on agriculture 2 2 sample collection and preservation 110 groundwater drinking samples were collected in pre washed airtight polyethylene containers in duplicates 50 ml and 250 ml respectively from deep as well as shallow tubewells covering all the 17 blocks of nadia district during the month of june 2018 the gps global positioning system data has been noted for identification of the sample source precisely with proper latitude and longitudes the radiation if any caused especially due to the presence of any radioactive element like uranium in the studied area has been measured the depth ranges of the drinking water tube wells varied from 50 to 460 ft from each

quality control tests were also performed by analyzing duplicates and calculating recovery of spiked samples 2 6 statistical analysis regression analysis correlation matrix and other mathematical as well as statistical relations among the samples were performed to understand their interdependence and significance using excel 2016 microsoft office for hierarchical cluster analysis hca bi plot diagram and contour plots origin 2017 software has been used 2 7 data analysis 2 7 1 water quality index wqi wqi is a rating scale that reflects a comprehensive picture upon the basic water quality of the area studied gupta and misra 2018 meng et al 2016 for computing wqi the parameters are given a specific number or weight with respect to their importance in water quality followed by a calculation of relative weight wi the relative weight is calculated as 4 wi wi i 1 n wi where wi relative weight wi weight of each parameter n number of parameters next a quality rating scale qi for each parameter is allocated by dividing their concentration in each water sample by their respective standard according to the guidelines prescribed in the bis and the result multiplied by 100 5 qi ci si 100 where qi quality rating ci concentration of each chemical parameter in each water sample mg l si indian drinking water standard for each chemical parameter according to the guidelines of the bis 2012 for the calculation of wqi the si is first calculated for each chemical parameter which is then used to define the wqi as per the following equation 6 si i w i q i 7 wqi sii where sii subindex of ith parameter qi the rating based on concentrate on of ith parameter anim gyampoa et al 2019 at last the computed wqi values are classified into five types of water quality excellent to unsuitable for drinking 2 7 2 risk assessment ra risk is defined as threat to human health caused by any toxic chemical consumed through daily diet or in present case drinking water therefore health risk assessment study is an important tool towards the measurement of future health risks or hazards caused by the consumption of toxic elements present in groundwater there is some established models or formulas for this study adapted from the united states environmental protection agency usepa risk is classified into two categories cancer and non cancer non cancer risk assessment is carried out especially for no3 and f adimalla et al 2019 narsimha and rajitha 2018 the two non carcinogenic toxic pollutants usepa 2006 as well as for as and u cancer risk assessment is performed for metalloid as which is a group 1 carcinogen referred by international agency for research on cancer iarc and agency for toxic substances and disease registry atsdr 2007 waqas et al 2017 radiological risk assessment is done for radioactive u which is also one kind of cancer risk ajay et al 2016 duggal et al 2017 the calculation for non carcinogenic risk is done through a standard quantification named hazard quotient hq

2016 usepa 2000 3 results and discussions 3 1 water quality parameters the overall water quality is analysed through determination of some physical as well as chemical parameters of collected groundwater samples n 110 the statistical presentation of the water quality parameters of all the samples based on three replicas is shown in table 2 the mean ph 7 54 of 110 groundwater samples suggests that the water quality of nadia district is slightly alkaline in character which is again verified by the mean total alkalinity 375 mg l of the same the range of temperature is observed between 25 7 and 31 2 c with a mean value of 28 2 c range of orp value lies in the order of 103 248 mv ec and tds are two such parameters which help to understand the total concentration of soluble salts in water tds defines the amount of inorganic salts including organic matter in water whereas ec measures electrical current in water these parameters have a strong relation between themselves rusydi 2018 the range of ec in studied case lies between 404 and 2250 μs cm mean 788 μs cm which helps to understand that water in this area holds a good potential to salts and minerals the mean tds value is found to be 525 mg l which is slightly greater than the permissible limit of tds in drinking water our study also found a strong association between ec and tds which is shown along with regression statistics fig 2 a various researches have been carried out to find the exact mathematical relation between tds and ec so that one parameter can be measured easily from the other one though depending on the specific activity of the dissolved ions the relation is not always linear but is expressed through the following equation tds mg l k ec μ s cm the factor k is understood as the tds ec ratio rusydi 2018 explained the ranges of different k values 0 55 0 75 for different kind of water samples similarly mcneil and cox 2000 also showed that the range of this ratio varied between 0 5 and 1 00 in freshwater samples in the present study both the parameters have been estimated using a probe but the ratio between tds and ec also lies in the range 0 52 0 67 chloride ions influence tds balakrishnan et al 2011 nelson 2002 which in turn gives the idea of salinity of groundwater this is important for the taste of groundwater for drinking purpose a quite good interrelation fig 2b is found between tds and cl where the mean chloride value lies 78 2 mg l the regression analysis is done here considering tds as dependent variable and ec cl as independent one considering the 110 samples collected from all the 17 blocks the mean iron concentration is found to be 3 02 mg l with a range of 0 1 13 7 mg l which indicates that the groundwater is iron rich the mean value of both total hardness th and total alkalinity ta is found to be higher than their respective guideline values in drinking water mean concentration of th is observed to be 329 mg l with a range of 20 570 mg l which signifies that the quality of groundwater is quite hard hardness of water is caused by the presence of calcium magnesium iron carbonate or bicarbonate ions mean calcium ion concentration 53 7 mg l range 4 156 mg l is found to be higher than that of magnesium ion 44 9 mg l range 0 18 114 mg l mean bicarbonate concentration 319 mg l range 37 650 mg l is found to be higher than mean carbonate concentration 56 mg l range 0 229 mg l mean concentration of so4 2 is observed to be 26 mg l with a range of 1 200 mg l and that of po4 3 is 1 36 mg l with a range of 0 05 19 2 mg l therefore mean anionic concentration range in the study area lies in the order of hco3 cl co3 2 so4 2 no3 po4 3 which simplifies the water quality of nadia district is basic and the elevated concentration of hco3 ions has a possibility of dissolution of carbonate minerals in groundwater of the surveyed area the mean u concentration is found to be 3 88 μg l with a range of 0 21 20 9 μg l it is important to mention here that amount of u in groundwater is dependent on the oxidation state of u in which it prevails in the bed rock or surface rock which also varies with water ph and orp waseem et al 2015 it is reported that mobility of u in the aquifers is eased with the oxidising conditions of the groundwater i e higher the orp higher the tendency of release and mobilisation of u into deep aquifers elless and lee 1998 smedley et al 2006 yang et al 2014 mean concentration of arsenic concentration is observed to be 22 μg l with a range of 3 206 μg l while the mean nitrate concentration is found to be 10 1 mg l with a range of 0 5 57 6 mg l 3 2 distribution of the toxic elements as no3 u f over exposure of arsenic in drinking water leads to numerous health hazards regarding arsenicosis pigmentation on skin which may lead to cancer in different organs of human body if left unattended abdul et al 2015 bhowmick et al 2018 roychowdhury 2008 2010 nitrate being one of the most substantial chemical pollutants in aquifers and ground water around the world over exposure of this through drinking water causes risk of infant methaemoglobinaemia or infant cyanosis fan and steinberg 1996 intake of high fluoride containing water results in decaying of bones even dental as well as skeletal fluorosis in children and adults narsimha and rajitha 2018 susheela et al 1993 uranium toxicity leads to nephritis in human and shows several harmful effects on renal system if consumed since a long time through drinking water it has more adverse effects due to its chemically toxic nature than radioactivity ajay et al 2016 who 2012 the spatial distribution of these toxic elements in the study area is shown through the following contour diagrams consisting latitudes and longitudes of the sampling areas where a contour line is defined as a constant valued function of two variables in a curve joining the points of equal value fig 3 the formation of these contours allows us to deduce comparative gradient of a parameter and estimate that parameter at specific places where the contour lines are closer the concentration of the elements in groundwater seems higher as well as the low concentration of the elements is shown by the distant contour lines from place to place the highest concentration of the elements is observed where the contour lines are converging the colour is ranged into different intensities with respect to the concentration of the toxic parameters found nag and ghosh 2013 the statistical distribution of the four toxic elements in the respective 17 blocks of nadia district is described in table 3 the present study shows that groundwater in all the 17 blocks are arsenic affected and approximately 52 of the samples contain arsenic above its permissible limit in drinking water i e 10 μg l who 2011 a maximum concentration of 206 μg l of as is found in chakdah block in this district lat 23 02 44 56 long 88 29 31 23 fig 3a which is almost 20 times higher than the recommended value the highest as concentration has been reported in groundwater from nadia district is 3200 μg l and approximately 0 048 million people has been reported at risk due to arsenic toxicity through consumption of contaminated drinking water above 300 μg l rahman et al 2014 a maximum concentration of 57 6 mg l of nitrate is found in one sample from chapra block lat 23 29 09 68 long 88 39 43 40 fig 3b where the permissible limit of nitrate in drinking water is 45 mg l bis 2012 nitrate concentration has crossed the recommended limit for drinking purposes in few groundwater samples in three other blocks i e nabadwip krishnanagar i and kaliganj with values 53 2 45 and 54 mg l respectively the elevated concentrations of nitrate in groundwater are may be an effect of excessive use of nitrate fertiliser in the agricultural fields in case of uranium distribution in groundwater of nadia district the observed concentration range 0 21 20 9 μg l is within permissible limit the world health organization who has recommended the permissible limit of uranium in drinking water as 30 μg l who 2011 though the atomic energy regulatory board department of atomic energy govt of india has mentioned the maximum limit as 60 μg l aerb 2004 the maximum concentration 20 9 μg l found from the sample source residing under tehatta ii block lat 23 46 19 75 long 88 22 43 01 fig 3c the guideline value of fluoride content in drinking water is 1 5 mg l who 2011 the fluoride contamination is not prominent here as the range of fluoride concentration observed is 0 01 0 71 mg l fig 3d with a mean value of 0 18 mg l table 2 but the matter of risk is the prevalence of moderately high nitrate concentration in some places which may incite the solubilisation of underlying uranium from different minerals in near future as nitrate plays an active part in secondary u dissolution groundwater withdrawal is a frequent phenomenon in west bengal throughout the study area and other parts of the state there are numerous shallow and deep tubewells which pull out groundwater continuously for drinking cooking and other household purposes in domestic scale and irrigation purposes biswas et al 2019 chowdhury et al 2018a 2018b so air oxidation in groundwater is the most possible way for desorption and mobility of even low amount of u this mobilization is catalyzed by the carrier elements like hco3 or no3 ions nolan and weber 2015 bajwa et al 2017 the elevated no3 concentrations may be a local issue through agricultural inputs it is evident in a report that u concentrations were interrelated to that of nitrate in approximately 78 of the aquifers of high plains and central valley u s nolan and weber 2015 these several geological contaminants obviously determinate the groundwater quality and portability it is pertinent to mention here that groundwater carries a natural u concentration in the range between 0 1 and 10 μg l under specific conditions osmond 1980 3 3 correlation study the degree of linear correlation between two each water quality parameter can describe whether they are inter related among themselves or not if it is then the r value correlation coefficient signifies the extent of correlation positive or negative table 4 in the present study a moderately strong positive correlation of u is found with tds r 0 42 p 0 05 and with ec r 0 43 p 0 05 respectively whereas a trivial positive correlation is observed with no3 r 0 27 p 0 05 in addition to this there is also noticed a quite good association of no3 with tds r 0 42 p 0 05 this information clearly shadows the fact that no3 may play a little but significant role in u dissolution i e oxidation of u vi nolan and weber 2015 hence it can be said that there is a possibility of minimum uranium deposition in groundwater from uranyl nitrate uo2 no3 2 type of minerals the greater kinesis of u vi is associated to the greater solubility of a wide variety of uranyl uo2 2 containing minerals waseem et al 2015 moreover u vi usually forms a ph dependent suite of uranyl carbonate and various hydrated complexes in ground water solutions waseem et al 2015 the co occurrence and correlation of u and no3 can again be established through the multiple axis graph fig 4 using multivariate statistical technique which can be further helpful to explore their spatial and temporal trends uranium is well known for a greater affinity towards cl ions also reported in groundwater of amritsar punjab india singh et al 2003 the present study also shows that there is a mild but significant positive correlation r 0 36 p 0 05 between cl and u hence it can be said that cl and no3 might be the carrier of uranium it is reported that hco3 ions are proficient leaching agent for u from the soil sediments bajwa et al 2017 therefore a minor but positive correlation coefficient r 0 22 p 0 05 between u and hco3 in the present study area is a proof that the bicarbonate produced in the groundwater from dissolution of atmospheric co2 or carbonic acid and calcium carbonate reactions perhaps percolates through the soil which then enhances u leaching possibility bajwa et al 2017 the different pattern of distribution of the major ions in groundwater and their variation of correlation with u may be an effect of the depth of the aquifers shallow or deep shin et al 2016 moreover the alkaline nature of the groundwater of the present study area may be another main reason for frequent u dissolution because alkalinity increases the desorption of u from metal oxides and hydroxides zhou and gu 2005 so4 2 holds a reasonably good positive correlation with tds ec cl and no3 r 0 45 0 45 0 44 0 29 p 0 05 respectively which signifies the interdependence of the ions into groundwater the mild positive correlation r 0 33 p 0 05 between so4 2 and u represents the fact that so4 2 ions are another complexing agent for uranyl ions in the groundwater almeida et al 2004 langmuir 1978 as this kind of complexation is predominant in oxidized water it can be illustrated that from place to place the sub lining water rock system is aerated for frequent groundwater withdrawal hco3 and ta has a strong positive correlation r 0 75 p 0 05 which suggests that the alkalinity of the studied groundwater is mostly contributed by bicarbonate ions mg2 ec and mg2 tds both have the same positive correlation value r 0 33 p 0 05 which shows that magnesium ions have a well built contribution towards the ionic conductance of the studied groundwater system no other significant correlation has been found in the case of as and f with other cations and anions in the studied ground water fig 4 explains that in the blocks numbered as 1 2 3 and 10 i e haringhata chakdah shantipur and krishnaganj co occurrence of nitrate and uranium is clearly understood as both the points for maximum concentration are very closely placed the blocks 6 7 8 and 15 i e krishnaganj ii ranaghat i ranaghat ii and tehatta ii show the possible co existence of nitrate and uranium in a lesser magnitude than the former blocks as the distance between the points increases the co occurrence of nitrate and uranium can be explained by the theory that infiltration of nitrate rich water from agricultural fields contributes towards the mobilisation of geogenic contaminant like uranium through oxidative dissolution of reduced u iv minerals coyte et al 2019 nolan and weber 2015 3 4 hierarchical cluster analysis hca dendrogram represents the relation between the clusters produced by the corresponding analyses of the parameters studied i e it actually demonstrates the variation of homogeneity between the clusters produced das et al 2018 sultana et al 2014 in the present study the cluster analysis fig 5 suggests that ph and temperature are directly dependent on each other tds ec falls under one cluster which proves their strong interrelation whereas both tds and ec are allied to cl and so4 2 ions between the two major cations ca2 and mg2 concentration of mg2 ions overrule total hardness th and among the anions concentration of so4 2 ions master total alkalinity ta as they fall under different small clusters total alkalinity is also associated to bicarbonate ions and chloride ions indirectly fe concentration is related to the oxidation reduction potential orp of groundwater another observation is that uranium distribution is directly dependent on the concentration of bicarbonate hco3 ions 3 5 assessment of water quality index wqi eleven significant parameters are allotted with a weight wi according to their significance with respect to the overall quality of water for drinking purposes the maximum weight of 5 has been assigned to the most toxic parameters like as and u due to its potential of causing harm whereas f and no3 are assigned with weight of 4 due to its importance in groundwater pollution the parameters their respective relative weights and their parallel permissible limits in drinking water are described in table 5 as per the calculations mentioned in section 2 7 1 as described in section 2 7 1 from equations 4 7 the estimated wqi value range lies between 33 9 and 555 and the classifications of sample percentage according to the water quality is described in table 6 about 38 2 and 19 1 of water samples are designated as poor and very poor quality respectively whereas about 9 1 of samples are absolutely inappropriate for drinking as a whole approximately 66 of water samples cannot be recommended for drinking cooking and other domestic purposes 3 6 human health risk assessment ra of the toxic parameters no3 f as u with the help of eq 8 section 2 7 2 the present study shows that the calculated mean hq value for no3 is 0 22 range 0 001 1 29 in the 110 groundwater samples analysed it also reveals that the hazard quotient hq factor has crossed the acceptable level of risk i e 1 00 1 18 1 20 and 1 28 respectively in water samples from four blocks krishnanagar i nabadwip kaliganj and chapra the tolerable level of risk for noncancerous diseases is unity for each element i e if the hq value becomes 1 it is said that an unacceptable non carcinogenic risk exists usepa 2005 the higher hq value explains that the current inhabitants of nadia district is under no3 strain in few cases similar studies with high hq no3 have been reported earlier adimalla and li 2019 adimalla et al 2019 the mean value of hq for f 0 10 with a range of 0 005 0 42 shows that there is no health risk from fluoride in drinking water in the study area in case of as approximately 55 of the samples show higher hq value than the acceptable limit with a mean of 2 67 the range of hq as 0 36 24 6 is a matter of concern for the population still consuming as contaminated drinking water as it brings about severe health hazards in near future it is important to mention that the same population faces a serious threat as the range of cancer risk c r for as lies between 1 61 10 4 to 1 1 10 2 with a mean value of 1 2 10 3 eq 9 10 which is way much higher than the threshold level of cancer risk caused by as 1 10 6 usepa 2005 this indicates that the present exposure of drinking water has a great potential to cause serious health problems including lung liver urinary or skin cancer alam et al 2016 the population in the district has been already exposed to arsenic toxicity through consumption of drinking arsenic contaminated water and foodstuff mainly crops and vegetables cultivated by using arsenic contaminated irrigation water in the region roychowdhury et al 2008 rice grain the staple crop contributes a considerable amount of arsenic mainly inorganic in character in daily diet which might pose a threat for risk of suffering from arsenic toxicity for the entire population roychowdhury 2008 roychowdhury et al 2008 the results also show that according to the u concentration in the groundwater at present there is no non carcinogenic risk from the chemical adversity point of view as the mean hq value is 0 14 with a range of 0 008 0 75 but the cancer risk of u exists as its mean value is found to be 2 48 10 3 eq 11 which is much higher than the acceptable level of radiological risk 1 10 4 caused by u who 2011a the estimated range of cancer risk lies between 1 35 10 4 1 10 2 which signifies that there is a strong probability of radiation induced adverse health hazards the observation found from cancer and non cancer risk assessment study is presented in table 7 similar observations on cancer risks caused by radioactive u were found in the study reported by sharma and singh 2016 therefore it is urgent to take necessary measures for improvement of drinking water quality and the health of the local populace 4 conclusion consumption and usage of raw groundwater in the study area is in a questionable condition the groundwater quality of present study area can be designated as considerably alkaline and hard in nature it needs serious concern with respect to the abundance of toxic as in drinking water as all the 17 blocks are as contaminated similarly there is a matter of anxiety from the promising other toxic chemicals like no3 as few samples from four blocks have been identified with excess no3 concentration 45 57 6 mg l the groundwater quality index data shows that 38 2 and 19 1 water samples are classified as poor and very poor whereas 9 1 samples are extremely unsuitable for drinking u concentration range is below its permissible limit but it is necessary to mention that the cl no3 and especially hco3 concentration may aggravate u dissolution in groundwater in future as they are good carrier of uranium no fluoride contamination is observed yet in this district there is prominent cancer risk from as and u in present groundwater and a significant non carcinogenic health risk from no3 in few cases so it can be concluded that the current status of drinking water is not safe and it may improve if rainwater be included in the freshwater supply system therefore a regular monitoring is suggested for the groundwater quality along with a continuous awareness program for the entire mass residing in the studied area conflicts of interest the authors have no conflict of interest acknowledgement we acknowledge the help of the science organization

12166,the present work comprises the evaluation of twenty physico chemical parameters in 110 ground water samples from 17 blocks of nadia district located in west bengal for its quality assessment a water quality index wqi modelling has been done further where about 66 of water sample are not recommended for use the mean anionic concentration range in groundwater seems to be in the order of hco3 cl co3 2 so4 2 no3 po4 3 which simplifies the water quality of nadia district is allover alkaline and it is mainly because of bicarbonate alkalinity hardness is determined by ca2 and mg2 ions where calcium ion concentration mean 53 7 mg l range 4 156 mg l overrules magnesium one mean 44 9 mg l range 0 18 114 mg l ground water in all the blocks is arsenic contaminated and maximum arsenic concentration is found to be 206 μg l in chakdah few ground water samples have been identified with presence of elevated level of nitrate 45 57 6 mg l particularly from four blocks krishnanagar i nabadwip kaliganj and chapra in the district no sample has been identified with uranium concentration range 0 21 20 9 μg l beyond its permissible limit 30 μg l as recommended by who presence of high concentrations of cl no3 and especially hco3 ions in groundwater and their positive interdependence with each other may magnify uranium contamination in future through dissolution of uranium as they are good carrier of uranium the fluoride concentration has been observed within its recommended value in drinking water there is a strong possibility for cancer risk through as and u in drinking water as the mean c r value 1 2 10 3 and 2 48 10 3 goes beyond their respective acceptance level apparently there is no health risk from f but in few cases no3 poses non carcinogenic health hazards in future graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater physico chemical parameters toxic contaminants distribution water quality index health risk assessment 1 introduction groundwater being one of the most abundant and precious natural resources in india is mostly used for domestic and irrigation purposes in both rural and urban areas chakraborti et al 2011 for the tremendous growing population in india the demand of freshwater is increasing rapidly which results the amount of groundwater being in a critical condition it has to be also noted that india is the largest user of groundwater in the world world bank 2012 reports say that more than 33 of total groundwater resources in this country are not safe for drinking chakraborti et al 2010 times of india 2010 a significant amount of population of the villages of west bengal india is directly dependent on groundwater for drinking cooking and other household purposes due to over exploitation of this resource a number of aquifers are unsustainable now similarly the quality of groundwater is also a primary concern for all healthy livings because almost 80 of diseases in human beings are water borne das and nag 2015 ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 unesco 2007 day by day a number of intrusive toxic pollutants are polluting groundwater from various sources whether natural through mineralization or anthropogenic through agricultural and industrial activities which causes a serious threat to health wu and sun 2016 arsenic as and fluoride f are two geogenic lethal elements which pollute the aquifers and sometimes these two elements deteriorate the quality of groundwater being present simultaneously kumar et al 2016 rasool et al 2015 groundwater arsenic is generally to blame for the local geochemical environment of the aquifers and nearby soil in more detail natural arsenic comes into groundwater from oxidation of arsenic bearing minerals or reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydroxide depending upon various hydrogeochemical conditions nickson et al 2000 several sites of india like west bengal bihar uttar pradesh jharkhand chattisgarh assam manipur are reported with groundwater arsenic contamination since past 20 30 years chakraborti et al 2018 rahman et al 2009 nine districts of west bengal india are severely suffering from as contamination in groundwater i e around 6 million people are at high health risk because of as contaminated drinking water chowdhury et al 2000 2001 dey et al 2014 rahaman et al 2013 more than 40 of estimated indian population is suffering from f causing diseases chakraborti et al 2016 especially the people of south indian districts who are facing a serious health problem due to fluoride contamination in groundwater raj and shaji 2017 singaraja et al 2013 in west bengal districts like bankura puruliya and birbhum are also reported with groundwater fluoride contamination batabyal and gupta 2017 mondal et al 2014 samal et al 2015 this fluoride contamination in groundwater is mainly controlled by the solubility of fluorite caf2 fluorapatite ca5 po4 3 cl f oh or hornblende naca2 mg fe al 5 si al 8o22 oh f 2 type of minerals narsimha and rajitha 2018 moreover different kinds of rocks metamorphic or sedimentary and their rate of fluorine enrichment regulates fluorine burden in the adjacent aquifers routroy et al 2013 groundwater of some states of india is also contaminated with nitrate like andhra pradesh rao 2006 reddy et al 2009 uttar pradesh sankararamakrishnan et al 2008 and rajasthan suthar et al 2009 in 2008 hooghly district in west bengal has been recognised with nitrate enrichment in its surface and groundwater kundu et al 2008 nitrate contamination is usually a result of agricultural activities with excess use of nitrogenous fertilisers nitrate being highly soluble in water leaches into groundwater while passing through the subsoil layers as the soil particles have low nitrate retention capacity majumdar and gupta 2000 for groundwater contamination another liable mineral is uranium u which causes a serious health risk because of its radiological and chemical properties and nephrotoxic effects in human health kumar et al 2011 singh et al 2013 in general the amorphous iron oxide and hydroxides ferrihydrite are good sink of uranium das et al 2018 apart from leaching from mines natural uranium enter into groundwater from its different mineralised forms like uraninite uo2 pitchblende u3o8 uranyl nitrate uo2 no3 2 autunite ca uo2 2 po4 2 10 12h2o uranophane ca uo2 2 sio3 oh 2 5h2o etc wu et al 2014 hence it is required to monitor the groundwater quality on a regular basis especially which are widely used by the population for sustainable maintenance of groundwater resources to know the origin mobility and geochemical distribution pattern of as and u in deep aquifers a significant investigation is done recently in western hetao basin inner mongolia where it has been established that the weathering of bedrock stimulates groundwater contamination guo et al 2016 west bengal falls under the world s largest delta ganga meghna brahmaputra gmb plain which is well enriched with as and the soil type is predominantly alluvial chakraborti et al 2013 nadia a district located in the east side of river bhagirathi of west bengal is highly contaminated with as which is already reported in various researches das et al 1996 mandal et al 1996 mazumder et al 2010 rahman et al 2014 roychowdhury et al 2008 it was reported that groundwater in all the 17 blocks of nadia district is affected with arsenic where approximately 51 4 and 17 3 of the tube wells had arsenic above 10 and 50 μg l respectively rahman et al 2014 the information depicts the condition of groundwater in nadia district which is not at all worthy for drinking purposes the main objective of our present work is to discuss the suitability of groundwater in nadia district for domestic and irrigational practices on a holistic approach based on the physico chemical parameters studied followed by water quality index wqi and future human health risk assessment ra no such study has come out so far on nadia district which aims its overall water quality covering all kinds of physico chemical parameters in this work the wqi result depicts the percentage of water can be used for domestic purposes and the risk assessment study makes people aware about the future health risk caused by the presence of arsenic nitrate and even a low amount of uranium in the ground water the possibility of nitrate pollution from agricultural run off and uranium mobility from mineralogical leaching should be looked after different studies have been done previously to monitor the surface or ground water quality based on wqi a potent appliance for quality analysis of river or surface or groundwater in india batabyal and chakraborty 2015 gupta and misra 2018 packialakshmi et al 2015 štambuk giljanović 1999 tiwari and mishra 1985 likewise a number of studies have been reported in india on groundwater quality and associated health risks based on the attribution of the toxic contaminants as no3 f and u present in groundwater adimalla and li 2019 adimalla et al 2019 chattopadhyay et al 2020 duggal et al 2017 goswami et al 2019 sharma and singh 2016 the spatial distribution of the aforesaid toxic elements in the groundwater of the study area is aimed to study through separate contour diagrams the present work will also focus on the correlation among the variable elements present in groundwater and other physico chemical parameters through some statistical programs like regression analysis correlation matrix and cluster analysis moreover future cancer and non cancer risk assessment on human health through consumption of these toxic contaminants have been evaluated in the studied areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is the nadia district which lies in the eastern india west bengal on the eastern river bank of the bhagirathi river covering an area of about 3927 km2 and is encompassed within latitude 22 47 10 n and longitude 88 55 65 e the geographical boundary of nadia district comprises bangladesh in the east bardhhaman and hooghly districts on the west murshidabad district on the north and north west and north 24 parganas district towards south and south east fig 1 nadia is approximately 46 ft above the sea level according to census 2011 the district consists of 8 municipalities 2 notified areas and 17 blocks which includes 187 gram panchayats comprising nearly 1307 villages http censusindia gov in 2011census dchb dchb a 19 1910 part a dchb nadia pdf the population of this district is approximate 51 7 lakhs which is massively dependent on hand tube well water and very few piped line water supply supplied by the local governments rahman et al 2014 nadia remains evergreen with seasonal field crops throughout the year for its plenty of underground water and soil type new alluvium almost all the important crops are profitably grown in this district the economy of which depends mainly on agriculture 2 2 sample collection and preservation 110 groundwater drinking samples were collected in pre washed airtight polyethylene containers in duplicates 50 ml and 250 ml respectively from deep as well as shallow tubewells covering all the 17 blocks of nadia district during the month of june 2018 the gps global positioning system data has been noted for identification of the sample source precisely with proper latitude and longitudes the radiation if any caused especially due to the presence of any radioactive element like uranium in the studied area has been measured the depth ranges of the drinking water tube wells varied from 50 to 460 ft from each block approximate 6 7 water samples range 5 10 were collected with maintaining an approximate distance of 6 6 km as per board of research in nuclear sciences brns department of atomic energy govt of india protocol a grid map was prepared supplementary fig s1 before sampling for better understanding of the sampling procedure in a particular type of container 50 ml water samples were collected with addition of 0 1 v v of concentrated nitric acid as preservative for estimation of arsenic iron and uranium as described earlier in other studies chowdhury et al 2018a ghosh et al 2019 shin et al 2016 in the other type of container 250 ml water samples were preserved without acid for determination of other drinking water quality parameters the water containers have been transported to laboratory

well as statistical relations among the samples were performed to understand their interdependence and significance using excel 2016 microsoft office for hierarchical cluster analysis hca bi plot diagram and contour plots origin 2017 software has been used 2 7 data analysis 2 7 1 water quality index wqi wqi is a rating scale that reflects a comprehensive picture upon the basic water quality of the area studied gupta and misra 2018 meng et al 2016 for computing wqi the parameters are given a specific number or weight with respect to their importance in water quality followed by a calculation of relative weight wi the relative weight is calculated as 4 wi wi i 1 n wi where wi relative weight wi weight of each parameter n number of parameters next a quality rating scale qi for each parameter is allocated by dividing their concentration in each water sample by their respective standard according to the guidelines prescribed in the bis and the result multiplied by 100 5 qi ci si 100 where qi quality rating ci concentration of each chemical parameter in each water sample mg l si indian drinking water standard for each chemical parameter according to the guidelines of the bis 2012 for the calculation of wqi the si is first calculated for each chemical parameter which is then used to define the wqi as per the following equation 6 si i w i q i 7 wqi sii where sii subindex of ith parameter qi the rating based on concentrate on of ith parameter anim gyampoa et al 2019 at last the computed wqi values are classified into five types of water quality excellent to unsuitable for drinking 2 7 2 risk assessment ra risk is defined as threat to human health caused by any toxic chemical consumed through daily diet or in present case drinking water therefore health risk assessment study is an important tool towards the measurement of future health risks or hazards caused by the consumption of toxic elements present in groundwater there is some established models or formulas for this study adapted from the united states environmental protection agency usepa risk is classified into two categories cancer and non cancer non cancer risk assessment is carried out especially for no3 and f adimalla et al 2019 narsimha and rajitha 2018 the two non carcinogenic toxic pollutants usepa 2006 as well as for as and u cancer risk assessment is performed for metalloid as which is a group 1 carcinogen referred by international agency for research on cancer iarc and agency for toxic substances and disease registry atsdr 2007 waqas et al 2017 radiological risk assessment is done for radioactive u which is also one kind of cancer risk ajay et al 2016 duggal et al 2017 the calculation for non carcinogenic risk is done through a standard quantification named hazard quotient hq

2016 usepa 2000 3 results and discussions 3 1 water quality parameters the overall water quality is analysed through determination of some physical as well as chemical parameters of collected groundwater samples n 110 the statistical presentation of the water quality parameters of all the samples based on three replicas is shown in table 2 the mean ph 7 54 of 110 groundwater samples suggests that the water quality of nadia district is slightly alkaline in character which is again verified by the mean total alkalinity 375 mg l of the same the range of temperature is observed between 25 7 and 31 2 c with a mean value of 28 2 c range of orp value lies in the order of 103 248 mv ec and tds are two such parameters which help to understand the total concentration of soluble salts in water tds defines the amount of inorganic salts including organic matter in water whereas ec measures electrical current in water these parameters have a strong relation between themselves rusydi 2018 the range of ec in studied case lies between 404 and 2250 μs cm mean 788 μs cm which helps to understand that water in this area holds a good potential to salts and minerals the mean tds value is found to be 525 mg l which is slightly greater than the permissible limit of tds in drinking water our study also found a strong association between ec and tds which is shown along with regression statistics fig 2 a various researches have been carried out to find the exact mathematical relation between tds and ec so that one parameter can be measured easily from the other one though depending on the specific activity of the dissolved ions the relation is not always linear but is expressed through the following equation tds mg l k ec μ s cm the factor k is understood as the tds ec ratio rusydi 2018 explained the ranges of different k values 0 55 0 75 for different kind of water samples similarly mcneil and cox 2000 also showed that the range of this ratio varied between 0 5 and 1 00 in freshwater samples in the present study both the parameters have been estimated using a probe but the ratio between tds and ec also lies in the range 0 52 0 67 chloride ions influence tds balakrishnan et al 2011 nelson 2002 which in turn gives the idea of salinity of groundwater this is important for the taste of groundwater for drinking purpose a quite good interrelation fig 2b is found between tds and cl where the mean chloride value lies 78 2 mg l the regression analysis is done here considering tds as dependent variable and ec cl as independent one considering the 110 samples collected from all the 17 blocks the mean iron concentration is found to be 3 02 mg l with a range of 0 1 13 7 mg l which indicates that the groundwater is iron rich the mean value of both total hardness th and total alkalinity ta is found to be higher than their respective guideline values in drinking water mean concentration of th is observed to be 329 mg l with a range of 20 570 mg l which signifies that the quality of groundwater is quite hard hardness of water is caused by the presence of calcium magnesium iron carbonate or bicarbonate ions mean calcium ion concentration 53 7 mg l range 4 156 mg l is found to be higher than that of magnesium ion 44 9 mg l range 0 18 114 mg l mean bicarbonate concentration 319 mg l range 37 650 mg l is found to be higher than mean carbonate concentration 56 mg l range 0 229 mg l mean concentration of so4 2 is observed to be 26 mg l with a range of 1 200 mg l and that of po4 3 is 1 36 mg l with a range of 0 05 19 2 mg l therefore mean anionic concentration range in the study area lies in the order of hco3 cl co3 2 so4 2 no3 po4 3 which simplifies the water quality of nadia district is basic and the elevated concentration of hco3 ions has a possibility of dissolution of carbonate minerals in groundwater of the surveyed area the mean u concentration is found to be 3 88 μg l with a range of 0 21 20 9 μg l it is important to mention here that amount of u in groundwater is dependent on the oxidation state of u in which it prevails in the bed rock or surface rock which also varies with water ph and orp waseem et al 2015 it is reported that mobility of u in the aquifers is eased with the oxidising conditions of the groundwater i e higher the orp higher the tendency of release and mobilisation of u into deep aquifers elless and lee 1998 smedley et al 2006 yang et al 2014 mean concentration of arsenic concentration is observed to be 22 μg l with a range of 3 206 μg l while the mean nitrate concentration is found to be 10 1 mg l with a range of 0 5 57 6 mg l 3 2 distribution of the toxic elements as no3 u f over exposure of arsenic in drinking water leads to numerous health hazards regarding arsenicosis pigmentation on skin which may lead to cancer in different organs of human body if left unattended abdul et al 2015 bhowmick et al 2018 roychowdhury 2008 2010 nitrate being one of the most substantial chemical pollutants in aquifers and ground water around the world over exposure of this through drinking water causes risk of infant methaemoglobinaemia or infant cyanosis fan and steinberg 1996 intake of high fluoride containing water results in decaying of bones even dental as well as skeletal fluorosis in children and adults narsimha and rajitha 2018 susheela et al 1993 uranium toxicity leads to nephritis in human and shows several harmful effects on renal system if consumed since a long time through drinking water it has more adverse effects due to its chemically toxic nature than radioactivity ajay et al 2016 who 2012 the spatial distribution of these toxic elements in the study area is shown through the following contour diagrams consisting latitudes and longitudes of the sampling areas where a contour line is defined as a constant valued function of two variables in a curve joining the points of equal value fig 3 the formation of these contours allows us to deduce comparative gradient of a parameter and estimate that parameter at specific places where the contour lines are closer the concentration of the elements in groundwater seems higher as well as the low concentration of the elements is shown by the distant contour lines from place to place the highest concentration of the elements is observed where the contour lines are converging the colour is ranged into different intensities with respect to the concentration of the toxic parameters found nag and ghosh 2013 the statistical distribution of the four toxic elements in the respective 17 blocks of nadia district is described in table 3 the present study shows that groundwater in all the 17 blocks are arsenic affected and approximately 52 of the samples contain arsenic above its permissible limit in drinking water i e 10 μg l who 2011 a maximum concentration of 206 μg l of as is found in chakdah block in this district lat 23 02 44 56 long 88 29 31 23 fig 3a which is almost 20 times higher than the recommended value the highest as concentration has been reported in groundwater from nadia district is 3200 μg l and approximately 0 048 million people has been reported at risk due to arsenic toxicity through consumption of contaminated drinking water above 300 μg l rahman et al 2014 a maximum concentration of 57 6 mg l of nitrate is found in one sample from chapra block lat 23 29 09 68 long 88 39 43 40 fig 3b where the permissible limit of nitrate in drinking water is 45 mg l bis 2012 nitrate concentration has crossed the recommended limit for drinking purposes in few groundwater samples in three other blocks i e nabadwip krishnanagar i and kaliganj with values 53 2 45 and 54 mg l respectively the elevated concentrations of nitrate in groundwater are may be an effect of excessive use of nitrate fertiliser in the agricultural fields in case of uranium distribution in groundwater of nadia district the observed concentration range 0 21 20 9 μg l is within permissible limit the world health organization who has recommended the permissible limit of uranium in drinking water as 30 μg l who 2011 though the atomic energy regulatory board department of atomic energy govt of india has mentioned the maximum limit as 60 μg l aerb 2004 the maximum concentration 20 9 μg l found from the sample source residing under tehatta ii block lat 23 46 19 75 long 88 22 43 01 fig 3c the guideline value of fluoride content in drinking water is 1 5 mg l who 2011 the fluoride contamination is not prominent here as the range of fluoride concentration observed is 0 01 0 71 mg l fig 3d with a mean value of 0 18 mg l table 2 but the matter of risk is the prevalence of moderately high nitrate concentration in some places which may incite the solubilisation of underlying uranium from different minerals in near future as nitrate plays an active part in secondary u dissolution groundwater withdrawal is a frequent phenomenon in west bengal throughout the study area and other parts of the state there are numerous shallow and deep tubewells which pull out groundwater continuously for drinking cooking and other household purposes in domestic scale and irrigation purposes biswas et al 2019 chowdhury et al 2018a 2018b so air oxidation in groundwater is the most possible way for desorption and mobility of even low amount of u this mobilization is catalyzed by the carrier elements like hco3 or no3 ions nolan and weber 2015 bajwa et al 2017 the elevated no3 concentrations may be a local issue through agricultural inputs it is evident in a report that u concentrations were interrelated to that of nitrate in approximately 78 of the aquifers of high plains and central valley u s nolan and weber 2015 these several geological contaminants obviously determinate the groundwater quality and portability it is pertinent to mention here that groundwater carries a natural u concentration in the range between 0 1 and 10 μg l under specific conditions osmond 1980 3 3 correlation study the degree of linear correlation between two each water quality parameter can describe whether they are inter related among themselves or not if it is then the r value correlation coefficient signifies the extent of correlation positive or negative table 4 in the present study a moderately strong positive correlation of u is found with tds r 0 42 p 0 05 and with ec r 0 43 p 0 05 respectively whereas a trivial positive correlation is observed with no3 r 0 27 p 0 05 in addition to this there is also noticed a quite good association of no3 with tds r 0 42 p 0 05 this information clearly shadows the fact that no3 may play a little but significant role in u dissolution i e oxidation of u vi nolan and weber 2015 hence it can be said that there is a possibility of minimum uranium deposition in groundwater from uranyl nitrate uo2 no3 2 type of minerals the greater kinesis of u vi is associated to the greater solubility of a wide variety of uranyl uo2 2 containing minerals waseem et al 2015 moreover u vi usually forms a ph dependent suite of uranyl carbonate and various hydrated complexes in ground water solutions waseem et al 2015 the co occurrence and correlation of u and no3 can again be established through the multiple axis graph fig 4 using multivariate statistical technique which can be further helpful to explore their spatial and temporal trends uranium is well known for a greater affinity towards cl ions also reported in groundwater of amritsar punjab india singh et al 2003 the present study also shows that there is a mild but significant positive correlation r 0 36 p 0 05 between cl and u hence it can be said that cl and no3 might be the carrier of uranium it is reported that hco3 ions are proficient leaching agent for u from the soil sediments bajwa et al 2017 therefore a minor but positive correlation coefficient r 0 22 p 0 05 between u and hco3 in the present study area is a proof that the bicarbonate produced in the groundwater from dissolution of atmospheric co2 or carbonic acid and calcium carbonate reactions perhaps percolates through the soil which then enhances u leaching possibility bajwa et al 2017 the different pattern of distribution of the major ions in groundwater and their variation of correlation with u may be an effect of the depth of the aquifers shallow or deep shin et al 2016 moreover the alkaline nature of the groundwater of the present study area may be another main reason for frequent u dissolution because alkalinity increases the desorption of u from metal oxides and hydroxides zhou and gu 2005 so4 2 holds a reasonably good positive correlation with tds ec cl and no3 r 0 45 0 45 0 44 0 29 p 0 05 respectively which signifies the interdependence of the ions into groundwater the mild positive correlation r 0 33 p 0 05 between so4 2 and u represents the fact that so4 2 ions are another complexing agent for uranyl ions in the groundwater almeida et al 2004 langmuir 1978 as this kind of complexation is predominant in oxidized water it can be illustrated that from place to place the sub lining water rock system is aerated for frequent groundwater withdrawal hco3 and ta has a strong positive correlation r 0 75 p 0 05 which suggests that the alkalinity of the studied groundwater is mostly contributed by bicarbonate ions mg2 ec and mg2 tds both have the same positive correlation value r 0 33 p 0 05 which shows that magnesium ions have a well built contribution towards the ionic conductance of the studied groundwater system no other significant correlation has been found in the case of as and f with other cations and anions in the studied ground water fig 4 explains that in the blocks numbered as 1 2 3 and 10 i e haringhata chakdah shantipur and krishnaganj co occurrence of nitrate and uranium is clearly understood as both the points for maximum concentration are very closely placed the blocks 6 7 8 and 15 i e krishnaganj ii ranaghat i ranaghat ii and tehatta ii show the possible co existence of nitrate and uranium in a lesser magnitude than the former blocks as the distance between the points increases the co occurrence of nitrate and uranium can be explained by the theory that infiltration of nitrate rich water from agricultural fields contributes towards the mobilisation of geogenic contaminant like uranium through oxidative dissolution of reduced u iv minerals coyte et al 2019 nolan and weber 2015 3 4 hierarchical cluster analysis hca dendrogram represents the relation between the clusters produced by the corresponding analyses of the parameters studied i e it actually demonstrates the variation of homogeneity between the clusters produced das et al 2018 sultana et al 2014 in the present study the cluster analysis fig 5 suggests that ph and temperature are directly dependent on each other tds ec falls under one cluster which proves their strong interrelation whereas both tds and ec are allied to cl and so4 2 ions between the two major cations ca2 and mg2 concentration of mg2 ions overrule total hardness th and among the anions concentration of so4 2 ions master total alkalinity ta as they fall under different small clusters total alkalinity is also associated to bicarbonate ions and chloride ions indirectly fe concentration is related to the oxidation reduction potential orp of groundwater another observation is that uranium distribution is directly dependent on the concentration of bicarbonate hco3 ions 3 5 assessment of water quality index wqi eleven significant parameters are allotted with a weight wi according to their significance with respect to the overall quality of water for drinking purposes the maximum weight of 5 has been assigned to the most toxic parameters like as and u due to its potential of causing harm whereas f and no3 are assigned with weight of 4 due to its importance in groundwater pollution the parameters their respective relative weights and their parallel permissible limits in drinking water are described in table 5 as per the calculations mentioned in section 2 7 1 as described in section 2 7 1 from equations 4 7 the estimated wqi value range lies between 33 9 and 555 and the classifications of sample percentage according to the water quality is described in table 6 about 38 2 and 19 1 of water samples are designated as poor and very poor quality respectively whereas about 9 1 of samples are absolutely inappropriate for drinking as a whole approximately 66 of water samples cannot be recommended for drinking cooking and other domestic purposes 3 6 human health risk assessment ra of the toxic parameters no3 f as u with the help of eq 8 section 2 7 2 the present study shows that the calculated mean hq value for no3 is 0 22 range 0 001 1 29 in the 110 groundwater samples analysed it also reveals that the hazard quotient hq factor has crossed the acceptable level of risk i e 1 00 1 18 1 20 and 1 28 respectively in water samples from four blocks krishnanagar i nabadwip kaliganj and chapra the tolerable level of risk for noncancerous diseases is unity for each element i e if the hq value becomes 1 it is said that an unacceptable non carcinogenic risk exists usepa 2005 the higher hq value explains that the current inhabitants of nadia district is under no3 strain in few cases similar studies with high hq no3 have been reported earlier adimalla and li 2019 adimalla et al 2019 the mean value of hq for f 0 10 with a range of 0 005 0 42 shows that there is no health risk from fluoride in drinking water in the study area in case of as approximately 55 of the samples show higher hq value than the acceptable limit with a mean of 2 67 the range of hq as 0 36 24 6 is a matter of concern for the population still consuming as contaminated drinking water as it brings about severe health hazards in near future it is important to mention that the same population faces a serious threat as the range of cancer risk c r for as lies between 1 61 10 4 to 1 1 10 2 with a mean value of 1 2 10 3 eq 9 10 which is way much higher than the threshold level of cancer risk caused by as 1 10 6 usepa 2005 this indicates that the present exposure of drinking water has a great potential to cause serious health problems including lung liver urinary or skin cancer alam et al 2016 the population in the district has been already exposed to arsenic toxicity through consumption of drinking arsenic contaminated water and foodstuff mainly crops and vegetables cultivated by using arsenic contaminated irrigation water in the region roychowdhury et al 2008 rice grain the staple crop contributes a considerable amount of arsenic mainly inorganic in character in daily diet which might pose a threat for risk of suffering from arsenic toxicity for the entire population roychowdhury 2008 roychowdhury et al 2008 the results also show that according to the u concentration in the groundwater at present there is no non carcinogenic risk from the chemical adversity point of view as the mean hq value is 0 14 with a range of 0 008 0 75 but the cancer risk of u exists as its mean value is found to be 2 48 10 3 eq 11 which is much higher than the acceptable level of radiological risk 1 10 4 caused by u who 2011a the estimated range of cancer risk lies between 1 35 10 4 1 10 2 which signifies that there is a strong probability of radiation induced adverse health hazards the observation found from cancer and non cancer risk assessment study is presented in table 7 similar observations on cancer risks caused by radioactive u were found in the study reported by sharma and singh 2016 therefore it is urgent to take necessary measures for improvement of drinking water quality and the health of the local populace 4 conclusion consumption and usage of raw groundwater in the study area is in a questionable condition the groundwater quality of present study area can be designated as considerably alkaline and hard in nature it needs serious concern with respect to the abundance of toxic as in drinking water as all the 17 blocks are as contaminated similarly there is a matter of anxiety from the promising other toxic chemicals like no3 as few samples from four blocks have been identified with excess no3 concentration 45 57 6 mg l the groundwater quality index data shows that 38 2 and 19 1 water samples are classified as poor and very poor whereas 9 1 samples are extremely unsuitable for drinking u concentration range is below its permissible limit but it is necessary to mention that the cl no3 and especially hco3 concentration may aggravate u dissolution in groundwater in future as they are good carrier of uranium no fluoride contamination is observed yet in this district there is prominent cancer risk from as and u in present groundwater and a significant non carcinogenic health risk from no3 in few cases so it can be concluded that the current status of drinking water is not safe and it may improve if rainwater be included in the freshwater supply system therefore a regular monitoring is suggested for the groundwater quality along with a continuous awareness program for the entire mass residing in the studied area conflicts of interest the authors have no conflict of interest acknowledgement we acknowledge the help of the science organization

fig 1 pakistan has excellent and longest canal irrigation system aslam et al 2015 canal irrigation practices are more common in punjab pakistan river jhelum and its tributaries are considered as the primary sources for irrigation arshad and oad 2017 water availability for cropping by the lower jhelum canal is 252 mm tahir and habib 2001 the map of the study area is shown in fig 1 2 2 study design forty samples were collected from the lower jhelum canal using a gps device to measure the coordinates of specific points samples were collected from twenty different locations of the study area samples were collected both from the surface and deep water points twenty samples from surface and twenty samples from approximately 3 ft deep of canal water were collected 2 3 data collection and analysis the selected sampling locations are shown in fig 2 the samples were collected by stratified simple random sampling from selected points grab samples were collected for both in depth and surface water analysis from all sampling stations in march 2017 the sampling depth for deep water sampling was selected almost 3 ft and the central point of the canal was preferred for data collection water samples were collected in propylene water bottles of 500 ml before water sampling containers were washed with distilled water and then two to three times by canal water which was going to be sampled before being filled with that water soon after sampling the bottles were labeled according to station number and sampling date other essential components of interest including nearby places villages and populations were noted in the diary the samples were placed immediately in a cooler box along with packets of ice cubes to maintain 4 c temperature during fieldwork samples for microbiological tests were collected in sterile glass bottles to avoid cross contamination special care was exercised while removing and applying caps cover space was left to allow the mixing of samples the containers were not overfilled space was left to enable the mixture of the samples samples were then placed in a nice box and were instantly transported to the laboratory in a cooler box stacked with ice standard analytical procedures and precautions were employed during the preservation sampling handling transportation and analysis of the water samples keith 2017 in the laboratory samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4 c the most abundant cations in surface water sodium and potassium magnesium and calcium were analyzed by using a flame photometer jenway pfp and titration method kumar et al 2014 respectively major anions bicarbonate and chloride were analyzed by titration method kumar et al 2014 and sulphate by spectrophotometer kojło et al 1990 turbidity was conducted by spectra quant nova 60 instrument ec tds and tss by conductivity meter pc jenway 4510 and co3 2 was analyzed by titration method kumar et al 2014 phosphate was determined by uv visible spectrophotometer kharat and pagar 2009 and ph by using a ph meter cod was measured according to is 3025 part 58 reaffirmed 2006 usepa and apha bod and other trace elements like as pb cu and zn and fe were determined according to apha 2005 coliform and e coli was determined by using membrane filtration process buckalew et al 2006 all statistical analysis was performed by spss statistical package for social sciences the calculated values of water quality parameters were compared with who and neqs guidelines or other acceptable standards to determine canal water suitability for irrigation purposes 2 4 gis analysis a portable gps device was used to measure the longitude and latitude of the sampling sites the results of these samples along with their coordinates were attributed in arcgis version 10 0 software as a point layer further an interpolation technique of inverse distance weighting idw was applied to prepare the thematic layer map of the water quality index wqi tomczak 1998 idw is a reliable method of spatial interpolation to predict the surface water quality in a more accurate format basically it is based on assumptions that the accredited value of an unsampled spot is the weighted average of known values in the nearby places weights are inversely proportional to distances between sampled points and predicted points lu and wong 2008 2 5 estimation of water quality index the water quality index wqi was calculated for the determination of water quality the water quality index provides a more comprehensive image of surface water quality sahu and sikdar 2008 for the calculation and mapping of wqi three steps were followed as reviewed in several papers ravikumar et al 2013 rokbani et al 2011 asadi et al 2007 a all of the chemical parameters were marked with a weight wi according to their relative importance in water quality or impacts on public health b relative weight wi of each parameter are presented in table 3 by using eq a table 3 represents the weight wi relative weight wi and standard values of each parameter according to who and neqs a w i w i n 1 n w i where wi relative weight of each parameter wi weight of each parameter n number of parameters c a quality rating scale qi was computed by dividing the concentration of each parameter in the water samples by own standards according to the guidelines provided by who and neqs after that result was multiplied by 100 using eq b b q i c i s i 100 where qi quality rating ci concentration of each parameter in each water sample in mg l si who standard of each chemical parameter in mg

eq d c s i w i q i d wqi i 1 n sii where sii sub index of ith parameter n number of parameters qi rating based on concentration usually the calculated water quality index values are categorized in 5 classes excellent good weak inferior and unfit to use ravikumar et al 2013 sahu and sikdar 2008 2 6 water quality determination for irrigation purpose the suitability of water quality for irrigation purposes was analyzed by selecting the critical parameters of water quality these parameters sar rsc na are the general criteria for assessing the water quality for irrigation purposes the concentrations were calculated with irrigation indexes by using the following formulas sodium absorption ratio according to gangadharan and vinoth 2016 sar was calculated by employing the equation as sar na ca mg 2 100 concentrations are in meq l residual sodium content it was calculated according to reddy 2013 equation which is as rsc co3 2 hco3 ca2 mg2 concentrations are in meq l sodium percentage na according to prasanth et al 2012 the sodium percentage is calculated by the given equation as na na k ca2 mg2 na k 100 concentrations are in meq l 3 results and discussion estimation of water quality is essential as it determines the appropriateness for irrigation purposes statistical summary of physicochemical and biological parameters from selected sites are listed in table 1 and table 2 usually the most important parameter for water quality determination is bod which was ranged in between 38 5mg l to 9mg l which is within neqs 80mg l permissible limit this shows that water quality is good for irrigation purpose high value of bod determines that water quality is deteriorating and polluted another investigation by aftab et al 2011 at the lahore branch canal pakistan ranges from 10 3 to 18 8mg l which is also lower than the current study canal but within neqs 80 permissible limit according to simeonov et al 2003 the value of bod of surface water of northern greece ranged between 2 0 and 8 0mg l which is within permissible limit and also lower than the current study canal cod is used to measure water quality it is widely diverse in the study site and ranged in between 14mg l to 105mg l which is also within neqs 150mg l limit goher et al 2014 pointed out that more cod is due to increased industrial pollution aftab et al 2011 at the lahore branch canal pakistan shows the values of cod ranged in 16 5 42 5mg l which is also within the permissible limit but lower than the current study canal another study conducted on surface water quality by simeonov et al 2003 in northern greece shows the cod value ranged between 4 0 and 94 0mg l which is also lower than the current investigation and within the standard limit the presence of various sediments from rocks soil volcanic eruption forest fires agriculture and industrial pollution are responsible for the arsenic contamination smith et al 2000 in the current study the values of arsenic ranged between 0 005mg l to 0 01mg l which is within the standard limit of who 0 05 in the current study the estimated values of lead were 0 01mg l at all sampling points deep surface which is within the standard limit of neqs 0 5mg l an increase in the concentration of pb metal in surface water has negative impacts on the aquatic ecosystem and disturbs the whole food web by biomagnification and bioaccumulation levallois et al 2014 phosphate is a vital nutrient and fertilizer component for the growth of a plant that enters waterways from domestic wastewater and agricultural fertilizers in the current study the values of phosphate ranged between 3 5 and 3 8mg l which is within the who 150mg l permissible limit similarly all other parameters turbidity carbonate bicarbonate calcium magnesium ph ec tds tss ca mg k na fe zn cu sulphate were within permissible limits of who and neqs whose averaged values are given in tables 1 and 2 according to united states environmental protection agency current standard for e coli is 126 cfu 100 ml in one month and maximum range is 1260 cfu 100 ml while in current study its value ranged in between 489 cfu 100 ml to 1220 cfu 100 ml 3 1 water quality index wqi the water quality index of ljc at 20 investigated sites ranged between 326 703 and 0 00303455 the areas which are shown with red color in fig 3 of wqi have minimum values 0 00303455 of overall pollution index and reflecting the excellent quality of water on the other hand the areas highlighted with purple color have maximum values of wqi 326 703 and unfit for human consumption fig 3 the yellow color in fig 3 of wqi shows the good water quality the wqi values which are falling in green color have a poor quality of water and blue color is showing the inferior water quality in the study area of lower jhelum canal 3 1 1 water quality index map the water quality index is a convenient and straightforward technique to express a large number of water quality parameters in a single aggregated value and equivalent scale wqi elaborates the water quality in a very comprehensive way just as excellent excellent good weak and unfit for use pesce and wunderlin 2000 akkoyunlu and akiner 2012 wqi was assumed to determine the quality of water of selected water samples of the lower jhelum canal the wqi is estimated by keeping in view the appropriateness of surface water for human consumption rokbani et al 2011 for the determination of the water quality index each of the parameters was assigned by a weight relating to their impacts on ecosystem human health the maximum weight 5 was assigned to the parameters which have the primary effect on quality of water i e tds f and no3 and the minimum weight 2 was assigned to the parameter which has less impact on water quality ca2 mg2 k rokbani et al 2011 ravikumar et al 2013 table 3 demonstrates the given weight and relative weight of each parameter and their standard values by neqs national environmental quality standards and who world health organization 3 2 water quality index of lower jhelum canal according to table 4 the wqi of samples s d9 to s d19 both surface and deep has excellent quality of water in the villages of chakdaddan haweli kirtowal chak no 9 noor purpiran kamal mustafa and mongas as elaborated in table 4 sample s1 d1 from the station no 1 have excellent water quality as shown in table 4 sample s4 and d4 which were selected from the station no 4 have a poor quality of water and sample s d2 to s d8 excluding s d4 has inferior quality in the villages of miana kotehra choat and koat matta etc as shown in table 4 the samples s d20 at the station no 20 in the village of rasul and near rasul barrage had inferior water quality which is unfit for use table 4 graphical representation of wqi at all sampling sites is shown in fig 4 3 3 suitability of lower jhelum canal for irrigation purpose it was observed from the results that the maximum and minimum value of wqi of lower jhelum canal has been found between 326 703 and 0 00303456 respectively table 5 elaborates the water quality of each station of study area according to the standards of wqi in this study it was observed that majority of the water 55 is excellent to use for irrigation purpose 30 is of inferior quality 5 is of good quality 5 of poor quality and 5 is unfit to use for irrigation purpose which needs special treatment it

forty samples were collected from the lower jhelum canal using a gps device to measure the coordinates of specific points samples were collected from twenty different locations of the study area samples were collected both from the surface and deep water points twenty samples from surface and twenty samples from approximately 3 ft deep of canal water were collected 2 3 data collection and analysis the selected sampling locations are shown in fig 2 the samples were collected by stratified simple random sampling from selected points grab samples were collected for both in depth and surface water analysis from all sampling stations in march 2017 the sampling depth for deep water sampling was selected almost 3 ft and the central point of the canal was preferred for data collection water samples were collected in propylene water bottles of 500 ml before water sampling containers were washed with distilled water and then two to three times by canal water which was going to be sampled before being filled with that water soon after sampling the bottles were labeled according to station number and sampling date other essential components of interest including nearby places villages and populations were noted in the diary the samples were placed immediately in a cooler box along with packets of ice cubes to maintain 4 c temperature during fieldwork samples for microbiological tests were collected in sterile glass bottles to avoid cross contamination special care was exercised while removing and applying caps cover space was left to allow the mixing of samples the containers were not overfilled space was left to enable the mixture of the samples samples were then placed in a nice box and were instantly transported to the laboratory in a cooler box

12168,the aim of this research is to study the effect of graphene oxide go along with the gamma radiation for the degradation of an organic compound phenol phenol is a major component of petrochemicals and thus it serves as a precursor to various chemical processes including plastic synthesis and synthesis of other related materials there are various studies on the degradation potential of ionizing radiation of gamma rays on various organic compounds but no experimental study has been recorded till date with the combined effect of nanomaterial and the radiation potential of gamma rays fourier transforms infrared ftir spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy sem and x ray diffraction xrd were considered for the characterization of graphene oxide characterization study revealed that ionizing radiation has little effect on the functional group and overall chemical composition on the go nano adsorbent as the degradation process involves various factors thus to optimize the process parameters for the degradation rsm response surface methodology method was utilized where the effect of ph the dosage of graphene oxide nanomaterial and contact time were considered simultaneously as the variable factors influencing the process efficacy under optimized condition maximum removal capacity was found to be 98 8 and the error between experimental and

water is an indispensable part of life the treatment and management of contaminants in the aquatic environment is a top priority from the perspective of environmental sustainability particularly the effective removal of persistent organic pollutants pops from wastewater streams appears to be critically important because of their suspected mutagenic and carcinogenic properties as well as their acute and chronic health effects chitose et al 2003 chu et al 2016 consequently numerous technologies have been extensively adopted and rigorously evaluated over the years for the removal of pops from industrial effluents alkhuraiji et al 2017 busca et al 2008 u s environmental protection agency 2007 table 1 one of the major toxic organic pollutants found in wastewater is phenol which is coming from different industry like polymeric resin petroleum paints pesticides leather rubber petrochemicals plastic pharmaceuticals as well as a pesticide are also one among the majorsources of phenols in the natural surface water josé c et al 2011 liu et al 2010 mukherjee et al 2019 saha et al 2013 epa environmental protection agency has set the limits of phenolic compounds in wastewater to be below 1 mg l uddin et al 2007 recently treatment with ionizing radiation ir has emerged as a green and promising approach for removal of pops from contaminated water since it does not create any secondary pollutants ania et al 2007 jianlong and jiazhuo 2007 indeed ir has already been reported for treating many kinds of industrial wastewater textile industry petroleum refining industry coke making processes as well as municipal and sewage wastewater goel et al 2003 the ir treatment is one of the advanced oxidation processes aop in which both oxidizing oh and reducing radical species zheng et al 2007 are formed directly without any addition of other additives or chemical reactants production of highly reactive hydroxyl oh radical is the major feature for the radiolytic degradation of organic pollutants tian et al 2012 rubio clemente et al 2014 gamma radiation can induce radical formation which helps in better degradation of organic contaminants huang et al 2016 zhuan and wanga 2019 the formation of highly reactive species along with the reaction taking place at room temperature and without any production of harmful secondary products proves the advantages of the advanced oxidation process but the major drawback lies in its high cost thus ionizing radiation is often used in combination of other techniques to increase the degradation efficiency sun et al 2012 martínez morlanes et al 2011 daiem et al 2013 slegers and tilquin 2006 kongmany et al 2014 yu et al 2008 basfar et al 2005 wu et al 2008 more recently as an important precursor and derivate of graphene graphene oxide go

feasibility of using go for the removal of a wide range of pollutants from contaminated water nanomaterials based out of carbonaceous sources are being widely used for research topics regarding the removal of a huge variety of pollutants specifically due to its marvelous adsorption capabilities adsorption still is considered to be the easiest and economical way to remove pollutants from our environment due to conveniently ease of the operating process parameters kulkarni and kaware 2014 graphene oxide has unique physical and chemical properties like excellent electrical and thermal conductivity mechanical strength and large specific surface area guodonget al 2016 xia et al 2019 the main aim of the present research study was directed to investigate the effect of graphene oxide on the degradation of phenol under the influence of gamma irradiation hybrid technologies involving the participation of more than one processes is still an unexplored zone for the researchers rsm response surface methodology was employed for optimization of the process parameters and to obtain the best condition for maximum degradation efficiency of the process additionally an artificial

predictive modeling response surface modeling rsm is a crucial tool to analyze and determine the optimum conditions between the interactive factors within the design space of the experimental study it involves doing several experiments simultaneously using the results of first the few single factors at a time experiment thus it provides an insight into the steps to be planned for experimenting thus rsm is a collection of both mathematical and statistical techniques to form the empirical model which will help in the prediction of the design of experiments ferreiraet al 2007 sinha et al 2012 the major advantage of rsm over doing full scale experiments lies in the fact that it can reduce the experimental time and also limits the unnecessary use of chemicals for performing large scale batch operations in this experimental study box behnken design were adopted to study the integrated effects of process variable such as ph of the solution contact period of adsorbate and adsorbent and dosage of the nano adsorbents the second order polynomial equation was used to relate the independent variables of the experiment and their responses to optimize the parameters for better removal of phenol 3 parameters response surface methodology was chosen ph range 3 9 dose 1 g l 2 g l and time 10 30 min were chosen as independent variables and removal of phenol was chosen as the response in this study table 2 total of 17 experiments were performed according to the design expert software tools 2 5 modeling using artificial neural network in this study a three layer feed forward backpropagation neural network with a linear transfer function was developed for modeling of phenol removal using the combined effect of both gamma irradiation and adsorption by graphene oxide nanomaterials matlab 7 was used in this study to develop the neural network model in this study ann architectures were chosen as feed forward networks that were trained by the input data using the backpropagation algorithm singh et al 2007 sinha et al 2012 cannata et al 2011 uddin et al 2007 xia et al 2019 guodong et al 2016 mukherjee et al 2019 kilkarni et al 2014 ferreira et al 2007

each of 8 neurons and removal was taken as output variable similar top rsm analysis total 32 experimental data was taken for ann analysis among which 24 data points was taken as training 4 data points as validation and 4 data points was taken as test sets sinha et al 2012 3 results and discussions 3 1 effect of different experimental parameters on removal from fig 1 a it was observed that using solely gamma irradiation removal of phenol from aqueous solution was about 30 1 but using both gamma irradiation and graphene oxide nanomaterial removal resulted to be 81 4 after 30 min exposure and dosage of 1 g l of go nanomaterial the reason for the increased in the removal may be due to the combined or simultaneous approach effect of both gamma irradiation and graphene oxide nanomaterial using 1 g l of graphene oxide 20 mg l of phenol in solution at 8 kgy gamma radiation for 30 min it was observed from fig 1b that as the irradiation dose of gamma radiation increased removal was also increased as the exposure dose increased ionization of the phenol solution increased and as a result removal of phenol present in solution increased a similar result was reported by okamoto et al 1985 that increasing the dose of ionization radiation there was a significant increase in degradation of phenol from fig 1c it was observed that as the dose of adsorbent increased removal of phenol from the aqueous medium increased but as the dose increased from 0 5 g l no further increase in removal was observed al sayyed et al 1991 mills and morris 1993 terzian and serpone 1995 the reason for this phenomenon may be that almost all the phenol present in the solution can be adsorbed at 0 5 g l dosage amount of adsorbent and thus further increased in adsorbent dose did not affect on the removal of phenol from fig 1d it was observed that as the time of simultaneous exposure adsorption increased due to the combined effect of ionization and adsorption removal increased and almost 89 25 removal was observed at 60 min of the combined effect of exposure and ionization 3 2 optimization using response surface methodology it was observed that as the ph decreased the removal of phenol from the solution increased from anova analysis it was observed that the model developed by rsm was statistically significant and the model was the quadratic model p value was 0 0002 0 05 and the f value was 22 75 the goodness of fit of the model was also verified using multiple regression analyses and cv values it was observed that the r2 value was 0 9669 suggesting that the regression analysis was statistically significant the adjusted multiple regression value of 0 925 also suggested the model be significant in this case the cv 2 75 was low suggesting that the model developed by rsm in this study was valid statistically amini and younesi 2009 chowdhury and saha 2012 mukherjee et al 2019 2 r 2 91 05 9 35 xph 0 41 x dose 1 98 x time 8 x 10 3 x ph x dose 0 064 x ph x time 1 70 x 10 4 x dose

experimental analysis and the error between the two was less than 5 3 2 1 interaction between the process parameters the combined effect of solution ph and graphene oxide dosage on phenol removal is shown in the plot of fig 2b it was observed that phenol removal increased as the dose of graphene oxide was increased the reason may be that as go dose increased the surface area available for phenol adsorption increased and as a result removal of phenol from solution increased simultaneously the same observation was observed in other reference papers singh et al 2007 but in the case of ph it was observed that as ph decreased removal increased as phenol is a weak acid and so at higher ph due to ionization of phenol molecules removal decreases at higher ph due to electrostatic repulsions between the negative charge present in go and protonated phenol molecules adsorption on the go surface decreased and as a result removal decreased the optimized condition was observed at ph 3 13 with a dosage amount of 1 54 g l of adsorbent graphene oxide the combined effect of solution ph and time on the exposure of phenol removal is shown in the plot of fig 2c it was observed that phenol removal increased as the time of exposure increases the reason may be that due to more exposure of gamma irradiation and adsorption on phenol solution removal of phenol from its aqueous solution culminates to near exhaustion but in the case of ph it was observed that as ph decreased removal increased the optimized condition was thus observed at ph at 3 13 and dosage of 1 54 g l of adsorbent dosage a similar effect was also observed in the case of time and dose fig 2d 3 2 2 validation of response surface methodology the optimized condition was found to be around ph 3 13 dose of the adsorbent 1 54 g l time 29 61 min and at this condition removal was found to be 98 81 from model value and 96 71 from the actual experimental analysis the error between the experimental and theoretical results was observed to be around 2 125 3 3 modeling using artificial neural network in this study a three layer feed forward backpropagation neural network with a linear transfer function was developed for modeling of phenol removal from its aqueous solution by using the effects of both gamma irradiation and adsorption by graphene oxide nanomaterials in combination among the 5 algorithm used for hidden layer levenberg marquardt backpropagation trained network fig 3 showed a correlation coefficient of 0 9997 higher han other algorithm this high correlation coefficient of the experimental and theoretical plot signified the reliability of the neural model developed in this study for the parameters ph 3 13 dose of the adsorbent 1 54 g l time 29 61 min removal was found to be 97 65 from ann modeling and 98 81 was obtained from rsm analysis and actual removal was found as 96 71 3 4 characterization of the nano materials using sem ftir and xrd sem scanning electron microscope analysis of the nano materials was performed before and after exposure to gamma irradiation from sem analysis go was observed as disordered solid of thin overlapping indiscriminately aggregated sheets closely associated with each other fig 4 a and also observed with many exposed surfaces or regions which might be used for adsorption purposes a drastic change was observed fig 4b in the surface texture of the treated adsorbent after exposure to gamma irradiation and adsorption of phenol on the surface ansón casaos et al 2014 from figure 4c 4d it was observed no drastic change in the ftir analysis pattern of go nano materials before and after exposure except the transmittance thus it can be conferred that no such change in the chemical composition of the sample has occurred due to the ionizing rays the group present in the go was observed as the spectrum exhibited the characteristic peaks at 1020 1384 1626 2924 and 3423 cm 1 indicating c o cc co o h acid and o h hydroxyl bonds respectively similar observation were observed by luceño sánchez et al 2018 and mukherjee et al 2019 the same type of observation was observed for xrd analysis also fig 4e f no significant effect was observed on the xrd profile before and after exposure of gamma on the go nano materials the diffractogram was characteristic of graphene oxide with diffraction peak at 2θ 10 5 the peak at 26 5 and 42 5 denotes unreacted graphite bands thus this shows that even at ionizing radiation dose of 8 kgy there was no change in the crystallinity of the sample and no reduction of graphene oxide the shortening of the peak at 2θ 26 5 maybe due to irregular stacking of unreacted graphene 4 conclusion in this present experimental study the graphene oxide was successfully synthesized and its efficiency in the adsorption of phenol under gamma irradiation was studied from the above experiments it can be concluded that by combining the effect of gamma irradiation and nano materials the removal capacity of phenol was increased by 30 compared to the individual effect response surface methodology rsm provided for the study of the removal process with a minimal number of trail and thus saving the overall time and cost besides that it allowed developing a model for the entire process to estimate the removal percentage of phenol at the different contact time the dose of substrate and intensity of radiation analysis of the variance represented that at ph 3 13 contact period of 29 61 min with the dosage amount of graphene oxide of 1 54 g l results in the maximum removal capacity up to 98 8 and the final concentration of phenol in the solution was rendered to be around 0 24 mg l which is well below the permissible limit it was also observed that using the proposed simulated ann model to predict the removal of phenol present in a solution using the combined effect of both adsorption and gamma irradiation to scale up the process the response surface methodology can also be utilized the study revealed that the combined effect of gamma radiation and graphene oxide could be a promising technique for the removal of organic pollutant phenol declaration of competing interset there is no

12168,the aim of this research is to study the effect of graphene oxide go along with the gamma radiation for the degradation of an organic compound phenol phenol is a major component of petrochemicals and thus it serves as a precursor to various chemical processes including plastic synthesis and synthesis of other related materials there are various studies on the degradation potential of ionizing radiation of gamma rays on various organic compounds but no experimental study has been recorded till date with the combined effect of nanomaterial and the radiation potential of gamma rays fourier transforms infrared ftir spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy sem and x ray diffraction xrd were considered for the characterization of graphene oxide characterization study revealed that ionizing radiation has little effect on the functional group and overall chemical composition on the go nano adsorbent as the degradation process involves various factors thus to optimize the process parameters for the degradation rsm response surface methodology method was utilized where the effect of ph the dosage of graphene oxide nanomaterial and contact time were considered simultaneously as the variable factors influencing the process efficacy under optimized condition maximum removal capacity was found to be 98 8 and the error between experimental and theoretical results was observed as 2 125 by response surface methodology the process was further modeled using artificial neural network analysis ann and it was observed that the correlation

water is an indispensable part of life the treatment and management of contaminants in the aquatic environment is a top priority from the perspective of environmental sustainability particularly the effective removal of persistent organic pollutants pops from wastewater streams appears to be critically important because of their suspected mutagenic and carcinogenic properties as well as their acute and chronic health effects chitose et al 2003 chu et al 2016 consequently numerous technologies have been extensively adopted and rigorously evaluated over the years for the removal of pops from industrial effluents alkhuraiji et al 2017 busca et al 2008 u s environmental protection agency 2007 table 1 one of the major toxic organic pollutants found in wastewater is phenol which is coming from different industry like polymeric resin petroleum paints pesticides leather rubber petrochemicals plastic pharmaceuticals as well as a pesticide are also one among the majorsources of phenols in the natural surface water josé c et al 2011 liu et al 2010 mukherjee et al 2019 saha et al 2013 epa environmental protection agency has set the limits of phenolic compounds in wastewater to be below 1 mg l uddin et al 2007 recently treatment with ionizing radiation ir has emerged as a green and promising approach for removal of pops from contaminated water since it does not create any secondary pollutants ania et al 2007 jianlong and jiazhuo 2007 indeed ir has already been reported for treating many kinds of industrial wastewater textile industry petroleum refining industry coke making processes as well as municipal and sewage wastewater goel et al 2003 the ir treatment is one of the advanced oxidation processes aop in which both oxidizing oh and reducing radical species zheng et al 2007 are formed directly without any addition of other additives or chemical reactants production of highly reactive hydroxyl oh radical is the major feature for the radiolytic degradation of organic pollutants tian et al 2012 rubio clemente et al 2014 gamma radiation can induce radical formation which helps in better degradation of organic contaminants huang et al 2016 zhuan and wanga 2019 the formation of highly reactive species along with the reaction taking place at room temperature and without any production of harmful secondary products proves the advantages of the advanced oxidation process but the major drawback lies in its high cost thus ionizing radiation is often used in combination of other techniques to increase the degradation efficiency sun et al 2012 martínez morlanes et

feasibility of using go for the removal of a wide range of pollutants from contaminated water nanomaterials based out of carbonaceous sources are being widely used for research topics regarding the removal of a huge variety of pollutants specifically due to its marvelous adsorption capabilities adsorption still is considered to be the easiest and economical way to remove pollutants from our

response surface methodology was employed for optimization of the process parameters and to obtain the best condition for maximum degradation efficiency of the process additionally an artificial

between the negative charge present in go and protonated phenol molecules adsorption on the go surface decreased and as a result removal decreased the optimized condition was observed at ph 3 13 with a dosage amount of 1 54 g l of adsorbent graphene oxide the combined effect of solution ph and time on the exposure of phenol removal is shown in the plot of fig 2c it was observed that phenol removal increased as the time of exposure increases the reason may be that due to more exposure of gamma irradiation and adsorption on phenol solution removal of phenol from its aqueous solution culminates to near exhaustion but in the case of ph it was observed that as ph decreased removal increased the optimized condition was thus observed at ph at 3 13 and dosage of 1 54 g l of adsorbent dosage a similar effect was also observed in the case of time and dose fig 2d 3 2 2 validation of response surface methodology the optimized condition was found to be around ph 3 13 dose of the adsorbent 1 54 g l time 29 61 min and at this condition removal was found to be 98 81 from model value and 96 71 from the actual experimental analysis the error between the experimental and theoretical results was observed to be around 2 125 3 3 modeling using artificial neural network in this study a three layer feed forward backpropagation neural network with a linear transfer function was developed for modeling of phenol removal from its aqueous solution by using the effects of both gamma irradiation and adsorption by graphene oxide nanomaterials in combination among the 5 algorithm used for hidden layer levenberg marquardt backpropagation trained network fig 3 showed a correlation coefficient of 0 9997 higher han other algorithm this high correlation coefficient of the experimental and theoretical plot signified the reliability of the neural model developed in this study for the parameters ph 3 13 dose of the adsorbent 1 54 g l time 29 61 min removal was found to be 97 65 from ann modeling and 98 81 was obtained from rsm analysis and actual removal was found as 96 71 3 4 characterization of the nano materials using sem ftir and xrd sem scanning electron microscope analysis of the nano materials was performed before and after exposure to gamma irradiation from sem analysis go was observed as disordered solid of thin overlapping indiscriminately aggregated sheets closely associated with each other fig 4 a and also observed with many exposed surfaces or regions which might be used for adsorption purposes a drastic change was observed fig 4b in the surface texture of the treated adsorbent after exposure to gamma irradiation and adsorption of phenol on the surface ansón casaos et al 2014 from figure 4c 4d it was observed no drastic change in the ftir analysis pattern of go nano materials before and after exposure except the transmittance thus it can be conferred that no such change in the chemical composition of the sample has occurred due to the ionizing rays the group present in the go was observed as the spectrum exhibited the characteristic peaks at 1020 1384 1626 2924 and 3423 cm 1 indicating c o cc co o h acid and o h hydroxyl bonds respectively similar observation were observed by luceño sánchez et al 2018 and mukherjee et al 2019 the same type of observation was observed for xrd analysis also fig 4e f no significant effect was observed on the xrd profile before and after exposure of gamma on the go nano materials the diffractogram was characteristic of graphene oxide with diffraction peak at 2θ 10 5 the peak at 26 5 and 42 5 denotes unreacted graphite bands thus this shows that even at ionizing radiation dose of 8 kgy there was no change in the crystallinity of the sample and no reduction of graphene oxide the shortening of the peak at 2θ 26 5 maybe due to irregular stacking of unreacted graphene 4 conclusion in this present experimental study the graphene oxide was successfully synthesized and its efficiency in the adsorption of phenol under gamma irradiation was studied from the above experiments it can be concluded that by combining the effect of gamma irradiation and nano materials the removal capacity of phenol was increased by 30 compared to the individual effect response surface methodology rsm provided for the study of the removal process with a minimal number of trail and thus saving the overall time and cost besides that it allowed developing a model for the entire process to estimate the removal percentage of phenol at the different contact time the dose of substrate and intensity of radiation analysis of the variance represented that at ph 3 13 contact period of 29 61 min with the dosage amount of graphene oxide of 1 54 g l results in the maximum removal capacity up to 98 8 and the final concentration of phenol in the solution was rendered to be around 0 24 mg l which is well below the permissible limit it was also observed that using the proposed simulated ann model to predict the removal of phenol present in a solution using the combined effect of both adsorption and gamma irradiation to scale up the process the response surface methodology can also be utilized the study revealed that the combined effect of gamma radiation and graphene oxide could be a promising technique for the removal of organic pollutant phenol declaration of competing interset there is no

physical chemical parameters of groundwater the study also offers the baseline data to monitor the water quality to sustain future water consumption in this island the information obtained from this study could provide a reference for future studies in pulau bidong as well as other malaysian tropical islands 2 methodology 2 1 study area pulau bidong is located in the east coast of peninsular malaysia fig 1 the total land area of the island is approximately 230 km2 this island is hilly with steep slope where the maximum elevation is approximately 267 m the freshwater supply in this island is mainly from groundwater the water sources in this island inclusive of small streams in the flat land at the south of the island which is covered by forest except for the steepest points along the water s edge which are bare rock howard 1979 pulau bidong consists of a research centre belongs to universiti malaysia terengganu umt there are few wells present in both umt marine research station and pantai pasir pengkalan besides there is a dam collecting water in umt marine research station during wet season in which the dam is connected to the main reservoir that provides water to the well during wet season pulau bidong is an island with tropical rainforest climate and northeast monsoon season from october to march where during this season the study area is exposed to heavy rain spells of about 2000 mm of rainfall annually metmalaysia 2016 thus the main source of groundwater recharge in pulau bidong is rainfall the other factor that may affect the groundwater in pulau bidong is saltwater intrusion which normally occur during drought season when the rainfall is minimum the sampling activities were carried out during june to october as represent the transitional period from southwest monsoon to northeast monsoon since peninsular malaysia is expected to receive heavy rainfall during september to october suhaila and jemain 2009 2 2 selection of sampling points the sampling points were selected based on the criteria of proper well constructed at each sampling points three sampling points were located in umt marine research station and two sampling points were located in pantai pasir pengkalan fig 1 table 1 the wells in pulau bidong mainly supply freshwater for various activities and purposes the well at station 1 is currently active for freshwater usage the well at station 2 acts as an alternative freshwater supply and the well at station 3 is inactive whereas the wells at station 4 and station 5 are mainly used by fisherman for bathing purposes the major groundwater sources of all stations are mainly from precipitation 2 3 sample collection a total of 25 water samples were collected from five sampling stations over a period of 5 months from june 2016 to october 2016 groundwater samples were collected in triplicates at each sampling stations the water level was measured followed by pumping the surface water out from the well for 15 min before taking water samples from each sampling stations isa et al 2012 this was done to ensure that the samples collected represent the groundwater instead of the stagnant water which would affect the quality of the samples the samples were later collected using niskin water sampler and were kept in 1 l and 5 l sampling bottles the samples were then preserved in icebox to minimize the changes of nutrients content prior to the laboratory analysis 2 4 physical parameters the physical parameters such as temperature specific conductivity dissolved oxygen do ph salinity and dissolved oxygen saturation do were measured in situ during sample collection using multiparameter ysi professional plus the multiparameter was calibrated according to manufacturer s recommendations to ensure the accuracy of the reading 2 5 laboratory analysis the concentrations of nitrite no2 nitrate no3 ammonium nh4 and phosphate po4 3 amounts were measured according to the standard methods recommended by american public health association apha 1999 and environmental protection agency epa 1983 the nutrients no2 and no3 amounts were determined via ultraviolet spectrophotometric screening method at different wavelengths the drp was determined by ascorbic method and nh4 was determined by phenate method apha 1999 the standard solutions were prepared to obtain standard curve and reagents were prepared for the determination of nutrients no2 no3 nh4 and po4 3 concentrations in water samples respectively the tds and tss concentrations in the sample were calculated using gravimetric method after filtration process 2 6 data and statistical analysis the spss version 20 was used to perform statistical analysis with respect to the monthly variation of physicochemical parameters and rainfall the physicochemical parameters were analysed by calculating pearson s correlation coefficient r value the correlation matrix was constructed by calculating the coefficients of different pairs of parameters and correlation for significance was determined using r value the significance is considered at the level of 0 01 and 0 05 2 tailed analysis the chemometrics techniques were applied to determine the significant parameters that affecting the groundwater quality of pulau bidong the aforementioned parameters could be the factors or pollutants that may impair the pulau bidong freshwater sources on that account principal component analysis pca and discriminant analysis da were performed by using microsoft excel extension xlstat version 2014 5 03 for excel 16 0 the principal component analysis pca was utilized to compare the compositional patterns between the measured groundwater parameters and identify the factors that influence each factor loading 3 results 3 1 physical parameters fig 2 illustrates the monthly variation of physicochemical parameters for groundwater samples the temperature of the groundwater in pulau bidong was generally constant and ranged from 26 8 c to 28 7 c with an average value of 27 6 c fig 2a specific conductivity value was ranged from 0 010 s m to 0 452 s m with an average value of 0 059 s m fig 2b where the minimum value was recorded at station 3 in july and the highest value was recorded at station 2 in june dissolved oxygen value was ranged from 0 26 mg l to 7 45 mg l fig 2c with an average value of 2 05 mg l the do value was highest in june and generally low from july to october the ph value was ranged from 5 2 to 7 6 which was between slightly acidic and neutral nature with an average value of 6 2 fig 2d the salinity value was ranged from 0 04 to 2 41 ppt with an average value of 0 31 ppt fig 2e the salinity values were highest in june and were below zero ppt from july onwards the do saturation was ranged from 0 61 to 60 60 with an average saturation of 15 70 fig 2f where saturation was generally highest in june except the extreme low saturation at station 3 in june the tds values were ranged from 0 086 to 6 840 mg l with an average of 0 833 1 447 mg l fig 2g the concentrations of tds were generally higher in station 3 for solids the tss concentration in groundwater of pulau bidong were low with a minimum value of 0 001 mg l and 0 011 mg l with average concentration of 0 002 0 002 fig 2h 3 2 nutrient concentration the concentrations of nutrients were generally similar except for phosphate that was low and constant generally nh4 no3 and no2 were relatively higher in june and low from july onwards the concentration of nh4 ranged from as low as 0 00 0 81 mg l with an average of 0 05 0 16 mg l fig 3 a no3 was ranged from 0 00 to 4 31 mg l with an average of 0 46 1 15 mg l fig 3b whereas no2 was ranged as low as from 0 00 to 0 19 mg l with an average of 0 01 0 04 mg l fig 3c phosphate concentration was ranged from 0 00 mg l to 0 03 mg l with average concentration of 0 01 0 01 mg l fig 3d data scattering demonstrated that there was no difference in distribution pattern between spatial and temporal distribution fig 4 illustrates that data were consistently distributed except for do and tds the median value of both parameters reveal that the collected data were distributed towards the minimum value and only few data were recorded at the high value 4 discussion table 2 demonstrates monthly rainfall recorded at the nearest meteorological station to pulau bidong metmalaysia 2016 the data revealed that the rainfall had increased from june to october 2016 and the highest level was recorded in october 2016 table 3 demonstrates the correlation coefficient between water quality variables and rainfall with correlation matrix strong positive correlation r 0 982 was observed between temperature and specific conductivity temperature is useful in evaluating the drinking water quality as it influences the overall water quality such as chemical reactions rate in water body decreasing the gases solubility and improving the tastes and colour of water olajire and imeokparia 2001 nevertheless there was no variation in temperature of the collected water which could be due to location of pulau bidong in the tropics mink 1964 demonstrated that the temperature of groundwater exists in the tropics vary within narrow limits the specific conductivity was found to be directly related to temperature as the mobility of ions in solution increased as temperature increased barron and ashton 2013 nonetheless results reveal that rainfall affected more towards specific conductivity in pulau bidong r 0 623 this is consistent with a previous study that demonstrated that there was a significant difference between specific conductivity and rainfall events at shallow water depth of groundwater datry et al 2004 the specific conductivity in pulau bidong however with the minimum value of 0 01 s m and maximum value of 0 45 s m was in accordance with standard limit of the drinking water stated in national drinking water quality standard ndwqs guidelines table 4 the do value demonstrated significant positive correlation with salinity r 0 950 tss r 0 914 no2 r 0 959 and nh4 r 0 946 furthermore do values were varied between june and the following months as the values were negatively correlated to each other r 0 758 this could be due to the massive inflow of precipitation datry et al 2004 evidence has shown that do content of water is also influenced by the source and water temperature world health organization 2004 moreover the water from pulau bidong was slightly acidic in which ph values was ranged from 5 2 to 7 6 the rainfall could possibly affect ph where it is the main source of recharge of groundwater which imparts acidity to groundwater as pure rainfall is slightly acidic in nature karanath 1987 besides the high ph values may be due to process of chlorination there were also several readings below the recommended ph value of 6 58 however the ph value does not have any adverse health effect except the alteration of the taste of water it should be noted that according to world health organization 2004 most of the natural and groundwater have ph from 4 to 9 salinity is defined by the amount of salt content in a water column that is closely affecting the value of conductivity tds and tss brown 2016 the salinity of the groundwater sources of pulau bidong was between 0 04 and 2 41 ppt the results reveal high salinity in groundwater of pulau bidong in the month of june this could be due to seawater intrusion in june caused by increased activities such as active usage and bathing while at drought causing the groundwater overdraft besides groundwater contains naturally occurring salts from organic material that would increase the salinity mayer et al 2005 table 3 reveals that the salinity in pulau bidong was significantly related with do saturation r 0 921 tss r 0 918 no2 r 0 998 and nh4 r 1 000 the strong positive correlation between nh4 and salinity was caused by prevalent nitrogen inorganic species form of ammonium in groundwater according to mayer et al 2005 freshwater for drinking and all irrigation purpose have salinity level less than 0 5 ppt and high concentration of tds will affects the taste and odour of water the tds are the inorganic matters that present as solution in water therefore considered as an accurate measure of salinity the recommended cutoffs for tds in drinking water by who and ndwqs should not exceed 1000 mg l the tds found in groundwater sources of pulau bidong were below the recommended cutoffs value with a value ranged between 0 086 and 6 840 mg l making it suitable for drinking total dissolved solid is highly correlated to no3 where nitrate is one of the ions in total dissolved solids parameters that determine the nature of water quality lukubye and andama 2017 according to aris et al 2009 groundwater in small islands is often exposed to heavy pumping as a result of high demand for freshwater consumption the tss value in pulau bidong of 0 001 mg l and 0 011 mg l were lower than the ndwqs permissible limit additionally r value of tss and rainfall was 0 912 suggesting that the low tss could be indicative of the wash off of surface pollutants by rainfall characteristics such as rainfall intensity duration and depth gong et al 2016 moreover low tss also indicates that the groundwater in pulau bidong is not turbid nitrite is rarely present in significant concentrations except in a reducing environment as nitrate is the highly stable oxidation state the no2 and nh4 were highly correlated r 0 999 as the aforementioned nutrients were relatively low in groundwater the concentrations of no2 and no3 in groundwater of pulau bidong are within the recommended limit suggested by who and ndwqs the high intake of no2 and no3 in drinking water were found to cause methaemoglobinaemia which is caused by the reaction between nitrite and haemoglobin in the red blood cells to form methaemoglobin that binds oxygen tightly and inhibit the release of haemoglobin world health organization 2011 in general rainfall had strong negative correlation with temperature r 0 645 specific conductivity with r 0 623 do r 0 758 salinity r 0 681 no3 r 0 629 no2 r 0 688 and nh4 r 0 668 do saturation r 0 856 and tss r 0 912 this reveals that rainfall is one of the factors affecting the physicochemical parameters of groundwater in pulau bidong the findings were in agreement with a previous study by mayer et al 2005 which demonstrated rainfall geology and topography are essential with regard to groundwater table 5 demonstrates that pca for temporal and spatial assessment were similar four principal components pcs were acquired for pulau bidong groundwater column with eigenvalues larger than 1 and had 75 16 of the total variance in the data set the first pc revealed 34 06 of the total variance and had strong positive factor loadings on conductivity and salinity moderate factor loadings on temperature and tss as well as weak factor loading on tds in pulau bidong groundwater dissolved salts such as sodium and chloride ions affect the water conductivity due to their ability to conduct electrical flow additionally the aforementioned salt ions are known to influence the concentration of tds and tss in the water column lane et al 2007 mcneil and cox 2000 in general temperature may affect the tds and tss contents as higher temperature will cause the dissolved salt to form solid salt hall and burns 2003 the second pc had 19 65 out of the total variance with strong factor loadings on nh4 no3 and no2 as well as moderate and weak factor loading on do and ph respectively frequently nh4 no3 and no2 are derived from fertilized agricultural land domestic waste animal waste urban drainage septic tanks soil erosion detergents and sewage disposal systems buck et al 2003 lichtenberg and shapiro 1997 dick 1983 the aforementioned compounds are well known as organic and acidic compound therefore their existence in the water column would reduce water ph the existence of organic compound in the water column are shown to reduce do value due to degradation process by the microorganisms vrzel et al 2016 gormly and spalding 1979 the findings of the present study indicate that domestic waste animal waste septic tanks soil erosion and the usage of detergents affected the groundwater quality of pulau bidong meanwhile the third and fourth pc had 11 88 and 9 57 of the total variance correspondingly furthermore do ph and tds reveal moderate factor loadings on pc3 whereas po4 3 had strong factor loading and ph and tss had weak factor loadings on pc4 similar to the first and second pc pc3 and pc4 had similar significant variables as the existence of the organic materials would reduce the value of do and ph as well as the concentration of tds and tss in pulau bidong groundwater column the discriminant analysis da was applied to the collected water quality data to define the spatial and temporal variation of pulau bidong groundwater in da groundwater quality data were designated as the independent variables da for both cases was performed via standard stepwise forward and stepwise backward model table 6 demonstrates the classification matrix of temporal da for pulau bidong groundwater the temporal variation demonstrated that the calculated discriminant function analysis dfa for standard and stepwise backward mode were similar there was 100 accurate classification of data with five discriminant variables for standard mode and three discriminant variables for stepwise backward mode the standard mode da revealed that conductivity do ph tds and salinity were the significant variables that play role in temporal variation on the other hand only ph salinity and tds discriminated the groundwater quality throughout temporal changes the stepwise forward da indicated 72 accurate classification data as three datasets and one dataset of august were misclassified as july and october respectively one dataset and two datasets of july were misinterpreted as august and october correspondingly moreover findings demonstrate that only ph and salinity had high variation in terms of their temporal distribution an increased flow of freshwater volume during the sampling period into pulau bidong groundwater would affect the ph and salinity value of the water column as the flushed out water or water seepage was acidic due to the existence of soil trace furthermore evidence has shown that freshwater contains less salt ions as compared to the groundwater wong et al 2007 waeles et al 2005 the spatial variation based on da was carried out using standard stepwise forward and stepwise backward models table 7 demonstrates the classification matrix of spatial da for pulau bidong groundwater the standard mode of da reveals 92 of accurate classification with three important variables which are temperature no3 and po4 3 on the other hand the stepwise forward and stepwise backward mode reveal 60 and 76 of correct classification of data respectively through the stepwise forward mode two significant variables namely temperature and no3 were identified whereas through the stepwise backward mode only one parameter temperature had high variability in terms of spatial distribution therefore pulau bidong groundwater variables had significant variation in term of spatial distribution for temperature no3 and po4 3 which might be derived from domestic waste animal waste septic tanks soil erosion and the usage of detergents buck et al 2003 lichtenberg and shapiro 1997 5 conclusion there were significant differences in physical characteristics and nutrients in june where the rainfall was lower than other months and were similar from july to october which were relatively higher suggesting that the aforementioned parameters were affected by the precipitation there were low nutrients concentrations in pulau bidong due to non point sources and were safe to be consumed by the visitors the physicochemical quality of groundwater in pulau bidong was superior except that ph was slightly lower than the local and international recommended drinking water guidelines based on chemometrics analysis ph and salinity were significantly affected the changes of pulau bidong groundwater temporally due to the intrusion of high volume of freshwater during heavy rainfall the spatial variation of the present study reveals that no3 no2 nh4 and po4 3 significantly affected the changes of pulau bidong groundwater quality therefore the proper management of septic tanks is essential to improve the elimination of possible elevated concentration especially nitrate notably the selected parameters are strongly interrelated and could be altered by human interference besides the seasonal variation also directly reflects the water quality of pulau bidong this study provided the baseline data for future research nevertheless long term monitoring is essential for understanding the groundwater behavior in pulau bidong as this would facilitate proper management for preventing the effects of human activities in order to ensure sustainable supply of groundwater to

station 2 acts as an alternative freshwater supply and the well at station 3 is inactive whereas the wells at station 4 and station 5 are mainly used by fisherman for bathing purposes the major groundwater sources of all stations are mainly from precipitation 2 3 sample collection a total of 25 water samples were collected from five sampling stations over a period of 5 months from june 2016 to october 2016 groundwater samples were collected in triplicates at each sampling stations the water level was measured followed by pumping the surface water out from the well for 15 min before taking water samples from each sampling stations isa et al 2012 this was done to ensure that the samples collected represent the groundwater instead of the stagnant water which would affect the quality of the samples the samples were later collected using niskin water sampler and were kept in 1 l and 5 l sampling bottles the samples were then preserved in icebox to minimize the changes of nutrients content prior to the laboratory analysis 2 4 physical parameters the physical parameters such as temperature specific conductivity dissolved oxygen do ph salinity and dissolved oxygen saturation do were measured in situ during sample collection using multiparameter ysi professional plus the multiparameter was calibrated according to manufacturer s recommendations to ensure the accuracy of the reading 2 5 laboratory analysis the concentrations of nitrite no2 nitrate no3 ammonium nh4 and phosphate po4 3 amounts were measured according to the standard methods recommended by american public health association apha 1999 and environmental protection agency epa 1983 the nutrients no2 and no3 amounts were determined via ultraviolet spectrophotometric screening method at different wavelengths the drp was determined by ascorbic method and nh4 was determined by phenate method apha 1999 the standard solutions were prepared to obtain standard curve and reagents were prepared for the determination of nutrients no2 no3 nh4 and po4 3 concentrations in water samples respectively the tds and tss concentrations in the sample were calculated using gravimetric method after filtration process 2 6 data and statistical analysis the spss version 20 was used to perform statistical analysis with respect to the monthly variation of physicochemical parameters and rainfall the physicochemical parameters were analysed by calculating pearson s correlation coefficient r value the correlation matrix was constructed by calculating the coefficients of different pairs of parameters and correlation for significance was determined using r value the significance is considered at the level of 0 01 and 0 05 2 tailed analysis the chemometrics techniques were applied to determine the significant parameters that affecting the groundwater quality of pulau bidong the aforementioned parameters could be the factors or pollutants that may impair the pulau bidong freshwater sources on that account principal component analysis pca and discriminant analysis da were performed by using microsoft excel extension xlstat version 2014 5 03 for excel 16 0 the principal component analysis pca was utilized to compare the compositional patterns between the measured groundwater parameters and identify the factors that influence each factor loading 3 results 3 1 physical parameters fig 2 illustrates the monthly variation of physicochemical parameters for groundwater samples the temperature of the groundwater in pulau bidong was generally constant and ranged from 26 8 c to 28 7 c with an average value of 27 6 c fig 2a specific conductivity value was ranged from 0 010 s m to 0 452 s m with an average value of 0 059 s m fig 2b where the minimum value was recorded at station 3 in july and the highest value was recorded at station 2 in june dissolved oxygen value was ranged from 0 26 mg l to 7 45 mg l fig 2c with an average value of 2 05 mg l the do value was highest in june and generally low from july to october the ph value was ranged from 5 2 to 7 6 which was between slightly acidic and neutral nature with an average value of 6 2 fig 2d the salinity value was ranged from 0 04 to 2 41 ppt with an average value of 0 31 ppt fig 2e the salinity values were highest in june and were below zero ppt from july onwards the do saturation was ranged from 0 61 to 60 60 with an average saturation of 15 70 fig 2f where saturation was generally highest in june except the extreme low saturation at station 3 in june the tds values were ranged from 0 086 to 6 840 mg l with an average of 0 833 1 447 mg l fig 2g the concentrations of tds were generally higher in station 3 for solids the tss concentration in groundwater of pulau bidong were low with a minimum value of 0 001 mg l and 0 011 mg l with average concentration of 0 002 0 002 fig 2h 3 2 nutrient concentration the concentrations of nutrients were generally similar except for phosphate that was low and constant generally nh4 no3 and no2 were relatively higher in june and low from july onwards the concentration of nh4 ranged from as low as 0 00 0 81 mg l with an average of 0 05 0 16 mg l fig 3 a no3 was ranged from 0 00 to 4 31 mg l with an average of 0 46 1 15 mg l fig 3b whereas no2 was ranged as low as from 0 00 to 0 19 mg l with an average of 0 01 0 04 mg l fig 3c phosphate concentration was ranged from 0 00 mg l to 0 03 mg l with average concentration of 0 01 0 01 mg l fig 3d data scattering demonstrated that there was no difference in distribution pattern between spatial and temporal distribution fig 4 illustrates that data were consistently distributed except for do and tds the median value of both parameters reveal that the collected data were distributed towards the minimum value and only few data were recorded at the high value 4 discussion table 2 demonstrates monthly rainfall recorded at the nearest meteorological station to pulau bidong metmalaysia 2016 the data revealed that the rainfall had increased from june to october 2016 and the highest level was recorded in october 2016 table 3 demonstrates the correlation coefficient between water quality variables and rainfall with correlation matrix strong positive correlation r 0 982 was observed between temperature and specific conductivity temperature is useful in evaluating the drinking water quality as it influences the overall water quality such as chemical reactions rate in water body decreasing the gases solubility and improving the tastes and colour of water olajire and imeokparia 2001 nevertheless there was no variation in temperature of the collected water which could be due to location of pulau bidong in the tropics mink 1964 demonstrated that the temperature of groundwater exists in the tropics vary within narrow limits the specific conductivity was found to be directly related to temperature as the mobility of ions in solution increased as temperature increased barron and ashton 2013 nonetheless results reveal that rainfall affected more towards specific conductivity in pulau bidong r 0 623 this is consistent with a previous study that demonstrated that there was a significant difference between specific conductivity and rainfall events at shallow water depth of groundwater datry et al 2004 the specific conductivity in pulau bidong however with the minimum value of 0 01 s m and maximum value of 0 45 s m was in accordance with standard limit of the drinking water stated in national drinking water quality standard ndwqs guidelines table 4 the do value demonstrated significant positive correlation with salinity r 0 950 tss r 0 914 no2 r 0 959 and nh4 r 0 946 furthermore do values were varied between june and the following months as the values were negatively correlated to each other r 0 758 this could be due to the massive inflow of precipitation datry et al 2004 evidence has shown that do content of water is also influenced by the source and water temperature world health organization 2004 moreover the water from pulau bidong was slightly acidic in which ph values was ranged from 5 2 to 7 6 the rainfall could possibly affect ph where it is the main source of recharge of groundwater which imparts acidity to groundwater as pure rainfall is slightly acidic in nature karanath 1987 besides the high ph values may be due to process of chlorination there were also several readings below the recommended ph value of 6 58 however the ph value does not have any adverse health effect except the alteration of the taste of water it should be noted that according to world health organization 2004 most of the natural and groundwater have ph from 4 to 9 salinity is defined by the amount of salt content in a water column that is closely affecting the value of conductivity tds and tss brown 2016 the salinity of the groundwater sources of pulau bidong was between 0 04 and 2 41 ppt the results reveal high salinity in groundwater of pulau bidong in the month of june this could be due to seawater intrusion in june caused by increased activities such as active usage and bathing while at drought causing the groundwater overdraft besides groundwater contains naturally occurring salts from organic material that would increase the salinity mayer et al 2005 table 3 reveals that the salinity in pulau bidong was significantly related with do saturation r 0 921 tss r 0 918 no2 r 0 998 and nh4 r 1 000 the strong positive correlation between nh4 and salinity was caused by prevalent nitrogen inorganic species form of ammonium in groundwater according to mayer et al 2005 freshwater for drinking and all irrigation purpose have salinity level less than 0 5 ppt and high concentration of tds will affects the taste and odour of water the tds are the inorganic matters that present as solution in water therefore considered as an accurate measure of salinity the recommended cutoffs for tds in drinking water by who and ndwqs should not exceed 1000 mg l the tds found in groundwater sources of pulau bidong were below the recommended cutoffs value with a value ranged between 0 086 and 6 840 mg l making it suitable for drinking total dissolved solid is highly correlated to no3 where nitrate is one of the ions in total dissolved solids parameters that determine the nature of water quality lukubye and andama 2017 according to aris et al 2009 groundwater in small islands is often exposed to heavy pumping as a result of high demand for freshwater consumption the tss value in pulau bidong of 0 001 mg l and 0 011 mg l were lower than the ndwqs permissible limit additionally r value of tss and rainfall was 0 912 suggesting that the low tss could be indicative of the wash off of surface pollutants by rainfall characteristics such as rainfall intensity duration and depth gong et al 2016 moreover low tss also indicates that the groundwater in pulau bidong is not turbid nitrite is rarely present in significant concentrations except in a reducing environment as nitrate is the highly stable oxidation state the no2 and nh4 were highly correlated r 0 999 as the aforementioned nutrients were relatively low in groundwater the concentrations of no2 and no3 in groundwater of pulau bidong are within the recommended limit suggested by who and ndwqs the high intake of no2 and no3 in drinking water were found to cause methaemoglobinaemia which is caused by the reaction between nitrite and haemoglobin in the red blood cells to form methaemoglobin that binds oxygen tightly and inhibit the release of haemoglobin world health organization 2011 in general rainfall had strong negative correlation with temperature r 0 645 specific conductivity with r 0 623 do r 0 758 salinity r 0 681 no3 r 0 629 no2 r 0 688 and nh4 r 0 668 do saturation r 0 856 and tss r 0 912 this reveals that rainfall is one of the factors affecting the physicochemical parameters of groundwater in pulau bidong the findings were in agreement with a previous study by mayer et al 2005 which demonstrated rainfall geology and topography are essential with regard to groundwater table 5 demonstrates that pca for temporal and spatial assessment were similar four principal components pcs were acquired for pulau bidong groundwater column with eigenvalues larger than 1 and had 75 16 of the total variance in the data set the first pc revealed 34 06 of the total variance and had strong positive factor loadings on conductivity and salinity moderate factor loadings on temperature and tss as well as weak factor loading on tds in pulau bidong groundwater dissolved salts such as sodium and chloride ions affect the water conductivity due to their ability to conduct electrical flow additionally the aforementioned salt ions are known to influence the concentration of tds and tss in the water column lane et al 2007 mcneil and cox 2000 in general temperature may affect the tds and tss contents as higher temperature will cause the dissolved salt to form solid salt hall and burns 2003 the second pc had 19 65 out of the total variance with strong factor loadings on nh4 no3 and no2 as well as moderate and weak factor loading on do and ph respectively frequently nh4 no3 and no2 are derived from fertilized agricultural land domestic waste animal waste urban drainage septic tanks soil erosion detergents and sewage disposal systems buck et al 2003 lichtenberg and shapiro 1997 dick 1983 the aforementioned compounds are well known as organic and acidic compound therefore their existence in the water column would reduce water ph the existence of organic compound in the water column are shown to reduce do value due to degradation process by the microorganisms vrzel et al 2016 gormly and spalding 1979 the findings of the present study indicate that domestic waste animal waste septic tanks soil erosion and the usage of detergents affected the groundwater quality of pulau bidong meanwhile the third and fourth pc had 11 88 and 9 57 of the total variance correspondingly furthermore do ph and tds reveal moderate factor loadings on pc3 whereas po4 3 had strong factor loading and ph and tss had weak factor loadings on pc4 similar to the first and second pc pc3 and pc4 had similar significant variables as the existence of the organic materials would reduce the value of do and ph as well as the concentration of tds and tss in pulau bidong groundwater column the discriminant analysis da was applied to the collected water quality data to define the spatial and temporal variation of pulau bidong groundwater in da groundwater quality data were designated as the independent variables da for both cases was performed via standard stepwise forward and stepwise backward model table 6 demonstrates the classification matrix of temporal da for pulau bidong groundwater the temporal variation demonstrated that the calculated discriminant function analysis dfa for standard and stepwise backward mode were similar there was 100 accurate classification of data with five discriminant variables for standard mode and three discriminant variables for stepwise backward mode the standard mode da revealed that conductivity do ph tds and salinity were the significant variables that play role in temporal variation on the other hand only ph salinity and tds discriminated the groundwater quality throughout temporal changes the stepwise forward da indicated 72 accurate classification data as three datasets and one dataset of august were misclassified as july and october respectively one dataset and two datasets of july were misinterpreted as august and october correspondingly moreover findings demonstrate that only ph and salinity had high variation in terms of their temporal distribution an increased flow of freshwater volume during the sampling period into pulau bidong groundwater would affect the ph and salinity value of the water column as the flushed out water or water seepage was acidic due to the existence of soil trace furthermore evidence has shown that freshwater contains less salt ions as compared to the groundwater wong et al 2007 waeles et al 2005 the spatial variation based on da was carried out using standard stepwise forward and stepwise backward models table 7 demonstrates the classification matrix of spatial da for pulau bidong groundwater the standard mode of da reveals 92 of accurate classification with three important variables which are temperature no3 and po4 3 on the other hand the stepwise forward and stepwise backward mode reveal 60 and 76 of correct classification of data respectively through the stepwise forward mode two significant variables namely temperature and no3 were identified whereas through the stepwise backward mode only one parameter temperature had high variability in terms of spatial distribution therefore pulau bidong groundwater variables had significant variation in term of spatial distribution for temperature no3 and po4 3 which might be derived from domestic waste animal waste septic tanks soil erosion and the usage of detergents buck et al 2003 lichtenberg and shapiro 1997 5 conclusion there were significant differences in physical characteristics and nutrients in june where the rainfall was lower than other months and were similar from july to october which were relatively higher suggesting that the aforementioned parameters were affected by the precipitation there were low nutrients concentrations in pulau bidong due to non point sources and were safe to be consumed by the visitors the physicochemical quality of groundwater in pulau bidong was superior except that ph was slightly lower than the local and international recommended drinking water guidelines based on chemometrics analysis ph and salinity were significantly affected the changes of pulau bidong groundwater temporally due to the intrusion of high volume of freshwater during heavy rainfall the spatial variation of the present study reveals that no3 no2 nh4 and po4 3 significantly affected the changes of pulau bidong groundwater quality therefore the proper management of septic tanks is essential to improve the elimination of possible elevated concentration especially nitrate notably the selected parameters are strongly interrelated and could be altered by human interference besides the seasonal variation also directly reflects the water quality of pulau bidong this study provided the baseline data for future research nevertheless long term monitoring is essential for understanding the groundwater behavior in pulau bidong as this would facilitate proper management for preventing the effects of human activities in order to ensure sustainable supply of groundwater to
