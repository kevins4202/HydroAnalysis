20715,offshore structures with jack up systems can be operated at depths up to 150 m and are used not only as drilling rigs and production rigs but also as support and accommodation units jack up operation is carried out under environmental loads such as wind and wave for which it is essential to understand jack up behavior and structural response as the boundary condition the foundation model of offshore structures affects the vibration mode of a structure and consequently the behavioral and structural analysis results as well typical simple foundation models such as pinned and linear spring do not reflect soil structure interaction ssi in jack up analysis as an alternative the international organization for standardization iso guidelines have suggested this ssi model as a simple secant model a yield interaction model and a time consuming but accurate soil continuum model in the present study a structural analysis of jack up is performed using the yield interaction model and the soil continuum model the yield interaction model model b for clay derived for consideration of the nonlinear behavior of soil has been studied and continuously improved until recently the existing model has generally assumed a linear load displacement relationship in the elastic region but this relationship may overestimate the load as soil plasticity occurs gradually in practice in this paper the hyperbolic model b is proposed based on which the horizontal and rotational load displacement material curves in the region before yield are assumed to have a hyperbolic relationship the regression equation for the initial stiffness accompanying the model is also suggested for single clay and soft over stiff clay a fully coupled ssi analysis with a soil continuum model is performed to validate the proposed model large soil deformation accompanied by deep penetration is considered simultaneously in the structural analysis of jack up as a result inside the yield envelope the existing model may overestimate the moment acting on the soil thereby underestimating the bending moment at the hull leg joint the model b developed and proposed in this paper well predicts the soil response and bending moment distribution of the leg which results are validated in comparison with those of the soil continuum model the proposed model can also simulate the hysteresis soil response for a sinusoidal load like in the soil continuum model these effects make that behavior of soil and structure before yield is well simulated therefore efficient design is available in terms of the fatigue strength assessment 1 introduction an offshore fixed platform is an offshore structure that installs itself on the seabed in order to withstand environmental loads such as wave and wind for this reason it is relatively easy to install unlike floating platforms a jack up is a special platform that combines the characteristics of fixed and floating platforms during operation this offshore structure with penetrated leg into soil behaves like a fixed platform but can move like a floating platform before and after operation the jack up also called the self elevating unit is equipped with a jacking system to lower and lift legs and 3 6 legs are put on the seabed to support the hull from environmental loads williams et al 1999 young et al 1984 the operation process of this jack up is divided mainly into four stages transit installation operation and retrieval le tirant and p√©rol 1993 in the operation phase it is important to accurately consider the fixed state because the installed depth is limited and the behavior varies greatly depending on the seabed soil wilson 2002 in structural analysis of a fixed platform seabed soils act as boundary conditions the boundary conditions of the structure generally affect the global vibration mode of and the local stress on the structure zhang et al 2017 in addition the vibration mode of the offshore structure affects not only the structural response but also the hydrodynamic response kim et al 2014 in the preliminary design of a fixed platform a simple support model or a linear spring is used as a simplified foundation model baglioni et al 1982 williams et al 1998 this simple foundation model is still used in the specific condition and is known to yield high accuracy only in cases where soil deformation is very small however when designing offshore structures it is required to calculate the response of structures under severe environmental conditions in such situations with large soil deformation simple foundation models entailing for example simple support conditions and linear springs cannot accurately simulate the actual soil houlsby et al 1992 williams et al 1998 inaccurate boundary conditions possibly misestimate not only the structural response at a specific site but also the vibration mode of the structure which determines the entire structure design a movement of the structure incurs significant soil deformation which leads to changed boundary conditions that affect structural behavior certainly soil structure interaction ssi renders precise simulation of a structure s behavior and response quite challenging in the preloading phase for the installation of the jack up the leg is penetrated into the seabed until sufficient bearing capacity is obtained leg penetration analysis calculates the vertical bearing capacity against the penetration and is necessary to determine the preloading load and the corresponding leg penetration depth during design endley et al 1981 hossain and randolph 2010 houlsby and martin 2003 kee and ims 1984 teh et al 2008 in the case of the gulf of mexico gom the south china sea in the southeast asian region and the southwest sea of south korea the soft soil is composed mainly of clay jin et al 2015 menzies and roper 2008 nancy et al 2014 in these areas then legs should be deeply penetrated until sufficient bearing capacity is achieved either by deeply penetrating into the single soft clay or reaching the underlying stiff clay choi et al 2020 in review this deep penetration process inevitably incurs large soil deformation such as the backflow phenomenon whereby the spudcan is pushed directly under the soil and the surrounding soil moves significantly the disturbed soil properties affect not only the penetration of the spudcan but also the subsequent operation of the jack up in the operation stage which is supported by the seabed soil and withstands environmental loads the foundation model mentioned above affects the global behavior of the structure by which boundary condition is changed due to the soil martin 1994 schotman 1989 vlahos et al 2005 in addition the large deformation of the seabed soil due to the deep spudcan penetration prior to the operation phase also affects the properties and corresponding foundation model zhang et al 2014c due to this complex behavior the foundation model used in the operation of jack up cannot be generally simplified as a simple boundary condition such as a simple support or a linear spring the ssi model is a two way analysis model according to which the plasticity of the soil and the response of the structure interact with each other in iso 2012 a secant model a yield interaction model and a soil continuum model were proposed as ssi models the secant model is the simplest model that considers ssi this model introduces the concept of secant stiffness in the rotational direction which is available only at a specific design point the yield interaction model was proposed as model b for more accurate simulation of the plastic behavior of clay martin 1994 this yield interaction model for clay model b was improved to the state of the art model introduced by zhang et al 2014b model b calculates the plastic displacement through an iterative calculation using a formulated equation incorporating elasticity yield envelope flow rule and hardening law martin and houlsby 2000 vlahos et al 2008 this model is known to calculate the plastic behavior of soil well in addition hyper model b was proposed in order to simulate strength degradation in the rotational direction by introducing a nonlinear moment rotation relationship into the model b framework vlahos et al 2006 the soil continuum model that performs numerical analysis according to the soil continuum is the most obvious but time consuming foundation model that accounts for the interaction of structures and soil from the pinned model to the soil continuum model less conservative and more accurate analysis is possible in iso 2012 therefore a more complicated model is called for when performing a high level acceptance check the objective of this study is to propose an improved ssi foundation model for deep penetration a simplified yield interaction model is used in order to combine efficient computational cost with considering detailed ssi simulation the existing yield interaction model for clay model b uses a constant elasticity matrix in the area before yield actual soil like other general material follows elastic plastic relationship where gradual failure occurs not elastic perfectly plastic norsok 2010 provides guidelines for ultimate limit states uls and fatigue limit states fls of offshore structures offshore structures should meet their expected life under various environmental conditions caused by for example wind wave and current lee et al 2019 the constant elasticity matrix may be reasonable in terms of uls where sufficient environmental loads are applied for plasticity to occur but may cause inaccurate prediction in terms of fls offshore structures spend most of their life in the area before yield and in terms of fatigue the response and boundary conditions in that area should be precisely considered for this objective model b with hyperbolic elastic curve before yield is proposed and implemented as the boundary condition of jack up structural analysis strength degradation before yield is implemented resulting in nonlinearity in the reaction force of the spudcan in respect to the environmental load as a result the structural response of the whole jack up structure is calculated realistically the earlier hyper model b has simulated the strength degradation of the cyclic load only in the direction of rotation that has the most dominant effect on the response vlahos et al 2006 however in the meantime the installation effect and improvement of plasticity have been included in model b zhang et al 2014b and hyper model b has a constant relation in horizontal direction and neglects the coupled term of horizontal and rotation direction the nonlinear elasto plastic load displacement curve of the soil is assumed as a hyperbolic model and implemented in the existing model b framework in the present study and through this the nonlinearity of the structural response due to gradual failure is reflected this hyperbolic relationship is defined by being simplified through initial soil stiffness and soil capacity in particular as initial stiffness is defined as a slope at a small displacement it is sensitive to displacement criteria and noise to avoid confusion due to misuse a guideline on the initial stiffness that can be adjusted for the proposed model is presented in the form of a regression model the numerical analysis results according to the spudcan embedment and lower soil properties are used for the stiffness calculation as a result the coefficient is presented so that the initial stiffness can be calculated directly which can be used as soil stiffness in the global jack up analysis as well as hyperbolic model in the present study fully coupled ssi analysis using the soil large deformation finite element ldfe technique is performed and compared with the proposed model single clay and soft over stiff clay are selected as the target soils in which deep penetration is often needed this study is conducted through numerical analysis considering the large deformation effect on soil due to spudcan penetration the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel technique in the abaqus explicit commercial program is used for the soil ldfe analysis the soil continuum model is the most accurate method to numerically simulate the ssi in this model the interaction between the jack up and the soil is considered simultaneously 2 conventional theory on yield interaction model for clay the existing model b as briefly described above is a work hardening plasticity based numerical model for spudcan behavior on clay this concept was first introduced for jack up behavior by schotman 1989 as model a afterward elasticity yield envelope flow rule and hardening law were improved overall by martin 1994 and presented as model b model b presented an empirical yield envelope formula based on the results of a 1g experiment after a minor improvement a revised yield envelope formula was proposed as a cigar shape that included an eccentricity concept in a horizontal rotation plane for the elasticity relationship inside the yield envelope martin 1994 introduced terms related to interaction in the horizontal and rotational directions eq 1 1 k e l k v 0 0 0 k h k c 0 k c k m k v g r 0 0 0 k h g r k c g r 2 0 k c g r 2 k m g r 3 the state of the art yield interaction model for clay was improved by zhang et al 2014b based on the same plasticity framework of model b elasticity yield envelope flow rule and the hardening law were updated considering the backflow and surrounding soil in spudcan behavior in this improved model b a yield envelope equation considering tensile capacity based on a centrifuge model test is included in actual single clay the horizontal and rotational capacities remain even when there is no vertical load due to backflow and adhesion after penetration and this phenomenon is reflected in the model the elastic relationship is the same as that of the existing model b of martin 1994 in eq 1 but the necessary coefficients k v k h k m k c for the elastic relation are presented for a single clay in various embedments and properties zhang et al 2012 this state of the art model b of zhang et al 2014b has been applied in subsequent studies not only to single clay but also to various multi layered soils containing clay ragni et al 2017 wang et al 2018 yin and dong 2019 vlahos et al 2006 simulated a non linear relationship rather than a linear relationship as the elastic behavior within the yield envelope in the rotational direction the stiffness decreases as rotation occurs and the hysteresis curve in the elastic region is simulated through this eq 2 to simulate this strength degradation vlahos et al 2006 introduced the hyperplasticity theory to simulate the rotational direction spring which adopts the thermomechanical principle to formulate soil plasticity using the spring slider element suggested in the hyperplasticity theory the non linear spring in the rotational direction is simulated e n t in contrast the horizontal and rotational interaction term of the elastic relation is removed for simplicity hyper model b with this nonlinear rotational spring was introduced 2 k e l k v g r 0 0 0 k h g r 0 0 0 8 e n t g r 3 the contents of the existing research on the elasticity of model b have been briefly summarized in this paper with the state of the art model b the hyper model b shares the same plasticity framework because it is based on the initial existing model b details on the hardening law and yield envelope along with this plasticity framework can be found in martin 1994 vlahos et al 2006 and zhang et al 2014b respectively 3 proposed yield interaction model hmb in this paper model b with hyperbolic elastic curve is proposed as hyperbolic model b hmb which extends the nonlinear hyperbolic relation in the elastic region in the horizontal and rotational directions and presents the coefficients for this the vertical horizontal and rotational motion of the spudcan after the penetration in single clay and soft over stiff clay has been simulated in choi et al 2020 in review and the corresponding load displacement curve has been calculated the resulting nonlinear relationship has been expressed as a hyperbolic curve and implemented in the foundation model the hyper model b vlahos et al 2006 applied a nonlinear relationship only in the direction of rotation however the proposed model has extended it in the horizontal direction and added the interaction terms of the horizontal and rotational directions eq 3 in addition the state of the art model for single clay proposed by zhang et al 2014b has been combined and applied hyperbolic curves are expressed through initial stiffness and capacity in particular the initial stiffness at an initial small displacement can vary significantly depending on the criteria compared to this sensitivity the change in initial stiffness can cause a large effect in the hyperbolic equation accordingly a regression model has been proposed to present the initial stiffness for single clay and soft over stiff clay when using the hmb presented in this paper this regression model is expected to be used to decide the initial stiffness in various soil properties and embedments 3 k e l k v g r 0 0 0 f k h u f k c Œ∏ 0 f k c Œ∏ f k

over stiff clay this paper intends to target the soil types that can exist in the soft clay field accordingly single soft clay and soft over stiff clay a case in which penetration meets the lower stiff layer is selected fig 1 in the single clay and upper layer of the soft over stiff clay the 2 4 1 35z kpa undrained shear strength s u profile in menzies and roper 2008 is used as general marine clay menzies and roper measured and introduced the soil properties of the gom field of which case 1 is selected and applied to the present study the single clay case using these properties is named swp and the details of the soil properties and nonlinear model parameters are shown in table 1 more detailed information about properties can be found in choi et al 2020 in review the height h of the upper layer of multi layered clay has been chosen as two times diameter 2b to assume deep penetration the lower layer of the soft over stiff clay is modeled by applying two three and four times the undrained strength at the boundary of the upper soft clay s u h the cases are named mws2p mws3p and mws4p respectively fig 1 likewise the details on the lower stiff layer are shown in table 1 the compared results are representatively by the mws2p case in this paper and the other two cases are introduced in the appendix the load displacement curve for each direction has been calculated using a single spudcan in a sufficiently deep embedment w as shown in fig 2 the soil continuum for obtaining load displacement relationship of single spudcan is modeled as a 3d solid in order to perform ldfe analysis through cel the eulerian mesh comprises the ec3d8r element the tresca model incorporating strain softening and rate dependency is used for modeling clay this nonlinear clay model has been introduced in einav and randolph 2005 and hossain and randolph 2009 the soil domain is modeled large enough to avoid boundary effects with width 6 times the spudcan diameter and height 5 5 times the spudcan diameter bienen et al 2012 ragni et al 2017 zhang et al 2014b in the case of soft over stiff clay the soil domain is divided into two layers to model the upper and lower clays the coulomb friction coefficient is assumed to be 0 1 based on the existing numerical analysis research on the spudcan jun et al 2018 wang et al 2012 2015 more detailed information about the single spudcan analysis is introduced in choi et al 2020 in review prior to applying vertical horizontal and rotational motion to the spudcan penetration is conducted to position the spudcan at a specific depth the preceding penetration analysis is performed to consider the soil disturbed by installation this procedure is close to the environment that the actual spudcan encounters the high penetration speed of the spudcan may overestimate the soil response due to the inertia effect the present study based on the existing research and case study used the penetration rate of 0 2 m s hu et al 2014 the spudcan is penetrated to embedments of 1 8b 2 0b 2 2b and 2 4b in order to investigate the effect of the lower stiff layer near the boundary 3 2 hyperbolic relation in horizontal and rotational directions 3 2 1 model b with hyperbolic elastic curve hyperbolic backbone curves have often been used to express ground hysteresis behavior huang et al 2020 vlahos et al 2006 the equation of the hyperbolic curve is as follows 4 f h y p e r x x a b x this hyperbolic curve equation is used to express the strength degradation in the horizontal and rotational directions through the numerical analysis spudcan penetration is simulated and then the horizontal and rotational motions are applied under a specific vertical force to catch the maximum capacity in each direction the h u and m Œ∏ relationships are assumed to be hyperbolic eq 4 and are fitted to the results of the numerical analysis fig 3 model b with hyperbolic elastic curve is proposed as hyperbolic model b hmb first the hyperbolic expression is formulated using physically meaningful parameters eq 5 6 5 f k h u u 1 k h 1 h o a b s u 6 f k m Œ∏ Œ∏ 1 k m 1 m o a b s Œ∏ where k h and k m are the initial stiffness in the horizontal and rotational directions respectively which means the slope at u Œ∏ 0 h o and m o also mean the capacity and converged value at u Œ∏ in each direction the physical meanings of initial stiffness and capacity are presented in fig 3 the results of fitting according to the proposed equation are shown in table 2 the load displacement curve and the corresponding parameters have been calculated by varying the lower clay properties and embedments in one of the several cases the results of single clay and soft over stiff clay at w 2 2b are selected as shown in fig 3 the fitted hyperbolic curve black line follows the single spudcan analysis result blue points when it is assumed to be elastic perfectly plastic red dotted line the strength degradation cannot be expressed the effect of lower stiff clay is well revealed in the fitted value table 2 the rotational motaion has downward motion at a side of the spudcan therefore the rotational capacity is increased in the soft over stiff clay due to the squeezing effect however the horizontal capacity does not change much the initial stiffness determines the initial part of the load displacement material curve both the horizontal and rotational stiffness increases due to the influence of the lower stiff clay in particular the rotational stiffness affected by the surrounding soil increases significantly the fitting results for different embedments and properties of lower clay are presented in fig 6 and table 4 table 7 in the appendix the deeper the embedment and the stronger the lower clay the higher the initial stiffness and capacity the effects of embedments and properties on initial stiffness and capacity are deeply illustrated in the choi et al 2020 in review however the results that may be unacceptable are obtained for 2 2b of mws4p fig 19 at a depth of 2 2b the maximum bearing area of the spudcan is close to the soil boundary with the large difference of soil properties in the mws4p case it is confirmed that the graph tends to be slightly different at the initial rotation compared with the other cases of soil properties and embedments this result seems to have been a simple numerical analysis outlier and so it is excluded from the subsequent regression analysis 3 3 coupled term in spudcan motion the horizontal and rotational directions interact with each other therefore a reaction moment occurs in the horizontal motion of the spudcan and the rotation also results in a horizontal reaction force model b martin 1994 introduced these coupled terms compared with the initial model a schotman 1989 and a state of the art modified model b mmb also included these coupled terms on the other hand in hyper model b the existing research considering the nonlinearity of the elastic region in the rotational direction the coupled term was not considered for simplification vlahos et al 2006 in this study the effect of these coupled terms is examined and simply considered in the proposed foundation model according to the concept of secant stiffness in general in numerical analysis the behavior at the next increment is determined by considering the time or load increment and corresponding tangent stiffness of the load displacement curve however secant stiffness refers to the stiffness that connects from the starting point to the design point when all of the load or displacement is applied sullivan et al 2004 in this secant stiffness concept the load displacement at the design point coincides but an incorrect load displacement relation occurs at different locations although the secant stiffness that fits only at a certain point has limitations it also has the advantage of being a foundation model that can be modeled simply in the form of a linear spring in the structure in consideration of the plasticity of the soil as in the conventional model b rotation did not generate the vertical reaction force however the horizontal reaction force occurred due to the rotation of the spudcan non diagonal term in eq 1 the coupled term is investigated by calculating the horizontal reaction force when a rotation is applied while keeping the vertical and horizontal directions fixed the secant stiffness at each displacement is shown in fig 4 secant stiffness is a method of expressing a load corresponding to each displacement assuming a linear model although not an entire nonlinear relationship can be simulated through the secant stiffness reaction force at specific displacement can be modeled simply and effectively therefore the secant stiffness value at each displacement is calculated by dividing the displacement corresponding to the resulting load as shown in fig 4 it is confirmed that the secant stiffness approaches zero from the initial stiffness value as displacement increases as in the existing model if the horizontal load and rotation are linear in the elastic region the secant stiffness of the coupled term will also have a constant value eq 1 however in the result of the present numerical analysis secant stiffness decreases which means that strength degradation occurs as in other directions fig 4 a secant stiffness has a larger value as the lower clay is stronger and the embedment is deeper in soft over stiff clay fig 4 b exceptionally 2 0b is showing a larger value than 2 2b in the soft over stiff clay case figs 4 b fig 20 in appendix 2 0b in soft over stiff clay is the moment when the spudcan tip reaches the soil boundary the horizontal force about the rotation is caused by the difference in soil response on both sides of the rotated spudcan when rotation occurs squeezing occurs on a side with a downward motion while the upper clay is only affected on the other side with an upward motion therefore the unbalanced response makes the horizontal reaction force increase the embedment at which this effect is most amplified is w 2 0b and accordingly the secant stiffness is slightly increased than w 2 2b case also fluctuation occurs in the initial phase of numerical analysis this is a small value but the secant stiffness that calculates the slope may result in an unintended bounce at a few initial points the cases from 1 8b to 2 2b quickly approaches zero and the case of 2 4b has an initial negative stiffness but similarly tends to approach zero in this way since the secant stiffness value of kc has small value compared with kh and km it also has a small effect on the horizontal force and rotational moment respectively for example single clay and soft over stiff clay are introduced according to table 2 the kh in the table is 455 64 and 646 88 mn m for single clay and soft over stiff clay respectively these values have been multiplied to the horizontal displacement in the elastic matrix of eq 3 in the case of the calculated kc a value of about 20 in swp and about 90 in mws2p corresponded to 0 02m of displacement kc is multiplied by a smaller value of rotation compared with the horizontal displacement and has a smaller effect on the horizontal force in the case of moment even if the horizontal displacement has a larger value km is more than 100 times larger than kc likewise the coupled term has a small effect as well for this reason in the present study the concept of secant stiffness is adopted for simple simulation of strength degradation a linearly decreased stiffness model with increasing displacement is used resulting in zero for the displacement of 0 1m the initial stiffness of this coupled term is from zhang et al 2012 who calculated the initial stiffness of the equation for single clay as the coupled term did not have a significant effect relative to the diagonal term the existing initial stiffness is used in the case of multi layers the stiffness is determined by linear interpolation of the values corresponding to the upper and lower clay properties 3 4 regression model of initial stiffness to define the horizontal and rotational hyperbolic relations in hmb two parameters initial stiffness and capacity should be determined carefully the actual response of jack up hardly reaches the maximum single direction capacity because combined loads are applied in practice and loads in other directions also contribute to yield in this respect the initial stiffness which determines the initial phase of the material curve becomes important the initial stiffness is determined according to the response at a small strain fig 5 shows that the initial stiffness may vary depending on the criteria of small strain in fig 5 a it seems that the blue slope represents the overall shape better than the red slope in contrast when it is enlarged fig 5 b the red slope is the better representative of the material curve at the beginning and the blue slope rather crosses the curve this sensitivity of the initial slope can cause a difference in the corresponding hyperbolic curve even if the capacity is the same the difference in the initial slope can cause a large difference in the early stage as shown in fig 5 b it may not be valid that the initial stiffness calculated through different methods or other criteria can be applied to the proposed hmb for this reason this paper intends to present a regression model for initial stiffness in soft over stiff clay that can be used in hmb the equations are presented so that the corresponding parameters can be used in both the single clay and the soft over stiff clay prior to the analysis the undrained shear strength ratio and depth ratio are selected as the representative variables for consideration of the effect of the lower stiff clay the undrained shear strength ratio s u s t i f f s u h refers to the ratio of the undrained shear strength of the upper soft clay and the lower stiff clay at the boundary the effect of the lower clay can be normalized and expressed using the ratio of undrained strength a regression model has been proposed for the lower stiff clay which is 1 4 times harder than the upper clay the depth ratio w h means the ratio of the depth of penetration to the height of the upper clay embedment cannot clearly present the relationship with the lower stiff clay and so for this purpose the depth ratio is normalized by the height of the upper layer a regression model is proposed for depth ratios from 0 9 to 1 2 in particular it is expected that a depth ratio of 0 9 or less will be affected only the upper soft clay and not also the lower clay this selected range can cover the bearing pressure of a typical jack up for the selected undrained shear strength ratio and depth ratio the initial stiffness and capacity are calculated by fitting from the results of the single spudcan ldfe analysis the results for varying embedment in the single clay and soft over stiff clay mws2p are plotted in fig 6 fig 6 a shows the results in the horizontal direction and kh and ho are calculated as the initial slope and converged value respectively fig 6 b shows the rotational direction and the corresponding km and mo are also obtained the fitted lines are indicated as a black solid line for both cases of single clay and soft over stiff clay it is confirmed that the deeper the penetration depth the greater the initial stiffness and capacity this significant increase occurs in the soft over stiff clay case which is impacted by the lower stiff clay fig 7 shows the effect of the lower layer on the load displacement curve as shown in fig 7 a at w 1 8b the spudcan does not meet the lower stiff clay and so the soft clay applies only a small reaction force however at w 2 4b the spudcan overlaps much with the lower stiff clay and the stiff clay applies a correspondingly large reaction force fig 7 b horizontal capacity is greatly influenced by the area overlapped with lower stiff clay therefore the capacity increases significantly in 2 2b and 2 4b where the overlapped areas are increased due to the large reaction force from the stiff clay the reaction moment increases more than the horizontal reaction force due to the downward motion of one side to the lower stiff clay the side with downward motion will be affected by squeezing even though the spudcan is not overlapped with the lower stiff clay and so the rotational capacity increases from w 2 2b 7 g e 2 1 ŒΩ 500 2 1 ŒΩ s u 8 g h 500 2 1 ŒΩ s u h 9 k h k h g h r

for the stiffness coefficient k h k m concept presented by iso 2012 eq 9 10 although kh and km actually have physical meaning as initial stiffness an equation for the normalized coefficient is provided for general applicability shear modulus g and spudcan radius r have been used for normalization g applied in the present study is calculated by using the general relation with e and the relationship with s u eq 7 g h uses the intact s u of upper soft clay properties at the boundary for normalization eq 8 the properties of the lower clay are implemented in the regression model through the undrained shear strength ratio although the operative strength may be more appropriate to express the stiffness after installation intact strength is used for a convenience in use if the equation about soil stiffness is expressed in terms of the operative strength the strength after installation should be investigated through a measurement or a numerical analysis for this reason the intact strength is adopted fig 8 presents the accuracy of the proposed regression model the x axis is the value obtained through numerical analysis and the y axis is the value calculated through the regression model the linear dotted line means that the two values are the same therefore the closer the points are to the corresponding line the better the regression equation predicts the value the points in fig 8 show the trend close to linear and it is also confirmed that eq 9 and eq 10 represented the initial stiffness well 4 validation the ssi model of jack up in iso 2012 consists of the secant model the yield interaction model and the soil continuum model in the previous section the elastic relationship that determines the behavior within the yield envelope has been improved in the yield interaction model strength degradation before yield has been implemented through hyperbolic relations and initial stiffness applicable to proposed hmb has been introduced in the form of a regression model for validation of the proposed yield interaction model structural analysis of jack up with the soil continuum model is performed through ldfe taking into account the installation effect in the jack up analysis during the operation phase zhang et al 2014c the penetration of the jack up structure is also simulated prior to the jack up structural analysis under environmental loads the plasticity framework of model b has been implemented in numerical simulations the implicit formulation of model b in vlahos et al 2008 has been used in the user element uel subroutine of abaqus the uel subroutine can directly define the constitutive equation of the element and load displacement relationship for multiple degrees of freedom dof in each step repetitive calculations using displacements and reaction forces are performed to determine the elastic and plastic behavior of the foundation elasticity yield envelope the flow rule for plastic behavior and the hardening law for additional vertical penetration are all formulated in an iterative procedure thereby the plastic displacement corresponding to each increment is calculated the detailed formulation was introduced in vlahos et al 2008 the soil continuum model is the most reliable and accurate among numerical methods for consideration of ssi the load transferred from the structure is applied to the soil simultaneously and the influence of the structure due to the corresponding soil behavior is considered in two way despite its accuracy the computational cost of this method makes it difficult to use widely especially for time series analysis in the existing jack up problem the soil continuum model is considered by using a basic mohr coulomb model for sands with relatively small deformation pisan√≤ et al 2019 however for clays accompanied by large deformations fully coupled ssi analysis is not widely performed due to the excessively high cost of simulating the large deformations and resulting changes in soil properties 4 1 yield interaction model in macro element prior to the application of hmb the plasticity framework of model b has been implemented first in order to perform structural analysis using the yield interaction model for the implicit formulation of model b refer to vlahos et al 2008 the macro element reflecting the formulated expression has been implemented using the user element subroutine of abaqus model b which is a yield interaction model for clay is effectively implemented through the user element because it is necessary to perform repetitive calculations using displacement and reaction forces validation using jack up structural analysis should be performed to determine whether the yield interaction model is well implemented the 2d jack up analysis in vlahos et al 2008 has been selected as a validation case a jack up with 100m leg length and 51 96m leg spacing has been modeled and the undrained shear strength of clay is 10 2z kpa depending on the depth z details on the fe model and structural properties are available in vlahos et al 2008 and martin 1994 after preloading of the spudcans to vo 100 mn the vertical load is unloaded to 50 mn v vo 0 5 and the environmental load is applied to 7 mn the capacity of each direction cited in the reference is used as given the results of vlahos et al 2008 are plotted as o and those of implemented uel are plotted as lines in fig 9 a according to the result yield at about henv 4 mn and moment failure of the leeward leg are simulated well in addition the reaction force in the vertical and horizontal directions of the macro element follows the reference results well this validation case has been expanded to 3d using the yield envelope equation suggested in bienen and cassidy 2006 in the 3d yield envelope equation eq 11 the sign of the horizontal and rotational directions is changed according to the sign convention and a torsion term q is added as a result of the same analysis implementing eq 11 it is confirmed that the graph in fig 9 is obtained the same 11 f h 2 h o 2 m 3 m o 2 2 e h 2 h o m 3 m o h 3 h o 2 m 2 m o 2 2 e h 3 h o m 2 m o q q o 2 4 1 œá 2 2 v

oil platform of 125 08m leg length 39 32m leg spacing 74 09m hull length and 61 11m breadth however it is challenging to obtain detailed information on this actual jack up and so a similar sized jack up used in other research has been selected zhang et al 2014a presented the detailed specification of the jack up structure used for verification this structure has legs of 120m length and 37 87m spacing and spudcans of 14m equivalent diameter this model closely resembles the leg and spudcan specifications of mlt 116c which is referred to in the present study therefore corresponding leg section information and stiffness are also used in this study model the second moment of area of the leg modeled by the equivalent 1d beam in the reference is 7 2 m4 in the case of hull the reference gives a 1d beam with a second section moment of 72 m4 the elastic modulus and shear modulus of the leg have the values 200 gpa and 80 gpa respectively which are common steel values 4 2 2 fe model used in ssi analysis an equivalent beam model is used for the jack up structure consisting of a leg and a hull fig 10 a this model called the stick model has been proposed in iso 2012 as one of the leg model types that can be used for structural analysis the stick model can calculate the global response of jack up such as base shear and overturning moment of overall structure and global leg forces the beams that make up the legs and hulls have been modeled as timoshenko beams that allow transverse shear deformation each leg has been modeled with 21 nodes and 20 elements and the hull has 6 nodes between each leg braces in the hull have been properly complemented for sufficient strength of hull leg joint the implemented user element is placed in the lower part of the jack up leg as a 1d beam the legs and user elements are connected by 6 dof coupling as in the spudcan so that the reaction and displacement calculated from user elements can be transferred the bottom of the user element is fixed so that only the user element reaction becomes the boundary condition of the jack up structure in the user element two types of yield interaction models are used to compare each other first hmb a proposed model for single clay and soft over stiff clay is used in this study and for comparison state of the art model zhang et al 2014b is used also because it is intended to show the difference between the proposed methodological model and the existing model the same soil parameters stiffness capacity as obtained through the single spudcan analysis table 3 are used the jack up structure used in the soil continuum model fig 10 b uses the same model as in fig 10 a the global response of the jack up is calculated using the stick model composed of timoshenko beams with the equivalent stiffness the spudcan is a steel structure that transfers reaction force and moment by direct interaction with soil therefore the spudcan has been modeled using 3d solid elements to simulate ssi through the cel technique the lagrangian mesh for the spudcan comprises c3d6 and c3d8r elements the local strength of the spudcan has a minimal effect in terms of overall structural strength and so the spudcan is assumed to be rigid to clarify the ssi using the load reference point lrp the lrp of spudcan and the lower leg are connected by 6 dof coupling so that the soil response can be transmitted to the structure as it is for maintaining the parameters of the nonlinear load displacement relationship in table 3 the soil continuum model also uses the same soil properties as the single spudcan analysis the eulerian mesh ec3d8r is used for the cel analysis and the tresca model incorporating strain softening and rate dependency is used for modeling of the clay the mws2p case is selected as the representative case of soft over stiff clay soil properties of swp and mws2p are presented in table 1 the previous soil domain size is selected based on a single spudcan thus a larger domain would be needed for the entire jack up structure the soil domain with a diameter of 10b and a depth of 6b is adopted for the jack up analysis the element size is determined to be 0 065b considering the computational cost and the accuracy of the analysis as the element size increases the analysis time decreases but the accuracy of the analysis also decreases a large sized element typically shows that the bearing capacity value increases fig 11 the element size of 0 065b which showed similar results to those for 0 05b used in the single spudcan analysis is adopted the interface between spudcan and soil consists of normal hard contact and tangential frictional contact based on the penalty method a tangential frictional coefficient of 0 1 is used by reference to existing researches wang et al 2012 2015 jun et al 2018 details of the fe modeling are the same as single spudcan analysis section 3 1 4 3 load sequence of jack up analysis the jack up analysis is divided into penetration and environmental load analyses for simulation of the operating procedure of actual jack up first the jack up penetrates from the seabed to the target location of 2 2b fig 12 b the penetration process simulating the jack up installation phase is performed at a 0 015b s penetration rate after penetration and positioning at the target position ssi analysis is performed by applying an environmental load fig 12 c the weight of the hull structure is applied to the hull leg joint as a vertical point load and the weight of the legs is applied as the distributed load in the case of environmental loads a horizontal point load is applied to the 105m position airgap 15m from the spudcan assuming the water depth the environmental load is applied until structure failure and thus correspondingly totals of 15 mn for single clay and 19 5 mn for soft over stiff clay are applied to the three legs 4 4 single clay 4 4 1 results of single clay analysis the results of the jack up analysis considering ssi by means of a nonlinear foundation model for single clay are compared ldfe in figure means the soil continuum model and hmb and mmb means the hyperbolic model b and state of the art model b of zhang et al 2014b respectively for convenience the state of the art model is named modified model b and accordingly it is expressed as mmb the leeward leg results are presented by solid lines and the windward leg results are represented by dashed lines these legend criteria remain consistent throughout the paper the results of the reaction force moment and displacement acting on the soil are plotted in fig 13 the results of the soil continuum model and two yield interaction models proposed hmb and state of the art mmb also are shown as can be seen when an environmental load is applied the whole structure rotates in the environmental load direction so that the leeward leg shows downward motion and the windward leg shows upward motion this phenomenon is illustrated in fig 13 a with respect to the vertical load and displacement the reaction force of the leeward leg increases and accordingly downward motion is shown in the vertical direction the windward leg shows upward motion and the corresponding reaction force decreases accordingly the environmental loads are applied in the direction where two of the three legs are the leeward leg and one is the windward leg accordingly it is shown that the displacement and reaction force of the windward leg are about twice as large as those of the leeward fig 13 b shows the rotational reaction moment and rotation of the ssi models the soil generally experiences moment failure first during jack up behavior that is the reason why the secant model introduced the concept of secant stiffness only for the rotational stiffness the soil continuum model ldfe in fig 13 and yield interaction model results also confirm that failure occurs first in the rotational direction when looking at the ldfe results the increased rate of moment gradually decreases as the environmental load increases and eventually starts to fall near 4 mn this moment failure occurs gradually and the displacement also shows a progressively increasing slope in the case of the yield interaction models both models well predict the moment failure in the hyperbolic model strength degradation before yield is simulated through the hyperbolic relation eq 6 accordingly the reaction moment gradually decreases as the environmental load increases such as in the ldfe analysis by contrast mmb shows that the reaction moment increases relatively linearly with the initial slope as the environmental load increases before yield the hmb and mmb start with the same initial slope but the difference occurs as the analysis proceeds thus it is confirmed that the moment is slightly overestimated at the yield point in the case of displacement the hmb results showed gradual increases but the difference between the foundation models is not significant the difference between the two yield interaction models is better shown in fig 14 a there the load paths for the vertical reaction force and the rotational reaction moment show the difference between the two models before reaching the yield envelope in the case of hmb the overall load path including the gradual moment failure follows the ldfe results relatively well especially in the windward leg in the case of mmb the behavior after the yield point is also similar to that of the other two models however the behavior before yield is somewhat close to linear and shows large reaction moment fig 14 b plots the moment rotation material curve at the jack up analysis because the same soil properties are used in the numerical analysis table 1 the material curve obtained from the single spudcan analysis and that from the jack up structural analysis are almost identical hyperbolic model b hmb reflects the strength degradation before yield so the load displacement curve follows the ldfe result well both before and after yield however mmb can simulate the plastic behavior after yield well while the elastic behavior shows a curve close to linearity gradual moment failure in the ldfe results is not simulated in mmb 4 4 2 results of soft over stiff clay analysis fig 15 plots the results of the numerical analysis in soft over stiff clay as mentioned in the previous section the global behavior of jack up is also same in the soft over stiff clay so that the leeward leg is downward and the windward leg is subjected to upward forces as the leeward leg shows downward motion the vertical reaction force increases at the same time by contrast as the windward leg shows upward movement the vertical reaction force decreases fig 15 b plots the horizontal reaction force and displacement as the environmental load is applied in the horizontal direction in the elastic region the total horizontal reaction force acting in the opposite direction should by the principle of action reaction be the same value therefore before yield occurs near henv 4 mn the horizontal reaction force of the same magnitude as the environmental load is calculated in both the soil continuum model and the two yield interaction models when yield occurs moment failure occurs first and the reaction force and moments in all directions are redistributed accordingly the horizontal response of the leeward and windward legs is changed due to their different vertical reaction forces in the model b framework the load path after yield moves on the force resultant yield envelope the horizontal and rotational responses can change depends on the vertical response level in the case of the horizontal displacement of the spudcan hmb expresses a gradual increase due to the hyperbolic relation despite the initial linearity of displacement mmb results after the yield also approach the ldfe results closely fig 15 c plots the reaction moment and rotation according to the environmental load soil failure usually occurs first in the rotational direction and in this respect it is important to simulate the reaction moment precisely in soft over stiff clay cases subjected to larger environmental loads gradual moment failure appears as well the moment increases slowly as the environmental load increases in the soil continuum model and the moment values of the windward leg become different due to yield about the environmental load of 3 mn modified model b mmb predicts the yield point of 3 mn well and as is apparent the moment in the plastic region is close to the ldfe result the results of hmb start with the same initial slope as the mmb but show a hyperbolic relation the yield point is pushed back henv 4 5 mn and the strength of degradation is well simulated in the reaction moment nonlinear hyperbolic relation makes the calculated moment results close to the ldfe results in the case of mmb despite the similar results after yield the moment is overestimated due to the constant elasticity matrix the rotation results effectively indicate a difference between the hmb and the existing mmb specifically the hyperbolic relation implemented in the horizontal direction in hmb the soil continuum model using the ldfe analysis shows a gradual increase in rotation which is also simulated in hmb however mmb shows a relatively linear relationship and accordingly the yield occurs earlier as a result there is a difference in rotation between the two yield interaction models at the yield point like in the moment results the load path in the vm plane and moment rotation curve are plotted in fig 16 the load path shows the effect of moment failure so the results of hmb follow the results of ldfe better fig 16 a unlike mmb result which approaches the yield envelope in a direction of linear initial stiffness the slope of hmb gradually decreases with moment increment and thus becomes similar to the result of the soil continuum model wherein gradual moment failure occurs in addition mmb rapidly approaches the yield envelope and yield occurs in the leeward leg by contrast the hmb does not reach the yield envelope and indeed yield does not occur to present the moment failure the moment rotation curve from the single spudcan analysis that from the jack up analysis using a soil continuum model and those from the two yield interaction models are shown in fig 16 b hyperbolic model b hmb uses a fitted hyperbolic curve from the results of the single spudcan analysis and follows the curve well the decreasing moment is also simulated in the windward leg despite the low level value because the moment capacity depends on the vertical and horizontal forces the moment capacity is smaller when applied than when vertical and horizontal forces are not applied according to the concept of the force resultant yield envelope contrastingly in the case of mmb the moment is overestimated in the elastic region before yield however after yield the results quickly approaches those of the ldfe analysis 5 discussion structural assessment the foundation model as the boundary condition affects not only the soil response but also the structural response these effects on structural response are the same for single clay and soft over stiff clay and therefore the results for soft over stiff clay are presented in this paper representatively by taking into account the nonlinear relationship before yield the difference in the soil response between the existing model and the proposed model is maximized right before the yield point and the beginning of the plastic region henv 3 3 mn in fig 15 c the bending moment of the leg at this point is shown in fig 17 in order to understand the structural response due to this difference in addition the point at which soil failure occurs due to the continuous load being applied even after yield has been selected henv 6 5 mn in fig 15 c and the bending moment of the leg at this point is shown in fig 18 the structural response at henv 3 3 mn where a difference in soil reaction moment between mmb and hmb is maximized is shown in fig 17 the stick model is suitable for viewing the global jack up response not local member forces and thus the distribution of the bending moment of the leg is presented sm2 in figure hyperbolic model b hmb shows a similar distribution to the soil continuum model results using ldfe on the other hand mmb shows that the reaction moment on the soil is larger than those of the other two models and that accordingly the bending moment of the leg also is different the moment acting on the spudcan leg joint is larger than those in the other two models like soil response and so the distribution of the moment of the entire leg is shifted as a result the bending moment at the hull leg joint is underestimated due to the shifted distribution this hull leg joint is one of the critical points in the jack up structural analysis and hmb shows a more realistic bending moment distribution at the leg the structural response at henv 6 5 mn where the plasticity of the soil and the failure of the structure occurs is shown in fig 18 in this plastic region the three models show similar values this is because mmb simulates a moment in the plastic region well through the plasticity framework after yield as a result all three models shows a similar distribution in terms of the bending moment of the leg based on the bending moment results it is confirmed that the magnitude of the reaction moment acting on the spudcan which is the same as that of the applied moment on soil affects the distribution of the bending moment of the leg the distributions of bending moments are similar if they show similar soil reaction moments fig 18 however it is important to take into account that the large reaction force on the soil may lead to underestimation of the bending moment in the hull leg joint fig 17 although the load path is different it is confirmed that the structural response is similar when the resulting reaction force and moment applied to the soil are similar this means that structural analysis can be performed with the load dependent foundation model as the boundary condition and in terms of uls where the maximum response is important the existing model b shows good predictions if the foundation model accurately simulates the reaction force and transfers it to the structure the global structural response in terms of bending moment can be predicted however the strength degradation before yield realistically predicts the response under small environmental loads hyperbolic model b hmb can be considered to be a good alternative if the area before yield is of primary interest such as fls 6 conclusion this study aims to investigate the elasticity of model b which determines the soil behavior inside the yield envelope in the conventional model load displacement relation in the constant elasticity matrix has an almost linear relationship except for the horizontal rotation coupled term however actual soil shows gradually degraded strength and therefore this study applied a nonlinear relationship to the horizontal and rotational directions in the conventional hyper model b a nonlinear hyperbolic relationship is applied only to the rotational direction the proposed hyperbolic model b hmb extends this nonlinear relationship to the horizontal direction and combines a state of the art concept such as the tensile capacity of spudcan as a result a constant elasticity matrix can overestimate the soil response before yield in contrast the nonlinear hyperbolic relationship can simulate strength degradation before yield the proposed model is implemented using macro elements and compared with the soil continuum model using ldfe a global jack up analysis is conducted on single clay and soft over stiff clay using yield interaction models including the conventional model b and the proposed model b as well as the soil continuum model the nonlinearity of the load displacement curve is also shown in the jack up analysis using the soil continuum model strength degradation appears even at small displacement the state of the art model b has a linear relationship before yield except for the horizontal rotational coupled term of small influence and so strength degradation did not occur hyperbolic model b hmb however considers nonlinearity in the region before the load combination reaches the yield envelope accordingly the load path and the plastic displacement of the soil as well as the load displacement curve are well simulated in the global analysis the effects of changes of foundation model on structural response based on a global analysis are investigated through the bending moment of the leg which is one of the global structural responses of jack up for comparison of the structural response the point where the load combination reaches the yield envelope and the point where soil failure occurs have been selected the reaction force of the soil is transferred to the structure through the spudcan serving as a foundation and the bending moment of the leg depends on this transferred force as a result it is possible to predict the bending moment distribution of the leg relatively accurately through proposed model in consideration of soil nonlinearity before yield it is confirmed that a change of the foundation model can also affect the structural response at the hull leg joint regarding the structure response in terms of ultimate strength when the load path is not important the resulting reaction force of soil is focused and existing model b is effective enough to use however when the load path is important such as in fatigue analysis the nonlinearity of the soil should be considered with respect to the small load combination before yield and proposed hyperbolic model b can be an alternative for this purpose credit authorship contribution statement

20715,offshore structures with jack up systems can be operated at depths up to 150 m and are used not only as drilling rigs and production rigs but also as support and accommodation units jack up operation is carried out under environmental loads such as wind and wave for which it is essential to understand jack up behavior and structural response as the boundary condition the foundation model of offshore structures affects the vibration mode of a structure and consequently the behavioral and structural analysis results as well typical simple foundation models such as pinned and linear spring do not reflect soil structure interaction ssi in jack up analysis as an alternative the international organization for standardization iso guidelines have suggested this ssi model as a simple secant model a yield interaction model and a time consuming but accurate soil continuum model in the present study a structural analysis of jack up is performed using the yield interaction model and the soil continuum model the yield interaction model model b for clay derived for consideration of the nonlinear behavior of soil has been studied and continuously improved until recently the existing model has generally assumed a linear load displacement relationship in the elastic region but this relationship may overestimate the load as soil plasticity occurs gradually in practice in this paper the hyperbolic model b is proposed based on which the horizontal and rotational load displacement material curves in the region before yield are assumed to have a hyperbolic relationship the regression equation for the initial stiffness accompanying the model is also suggested for single clay and soft over stiff clay a fully coupled ssi analysis with a soil continuum model is performed to validate the proposed model large soil deformation accompanied by deep penetration is considered simultaneously in the structural analysis of jack up as a result inside the yield envelope the existing model may overestimate the moment acting on the soil thereby underestimating the bending moment at the hull leg joint the model b developed and proposed in this paper well predicts the soil response and bending moment distribution of the leg which results are validated in comparison with those of the soil continuum model the proposed model can also simulate the hysteresis soil response for a sinusoidal load like in the soil continuum model these effects make that behavior of soil and structure before yield is well simulated therefore efficient design is available in terms of the fatigue strength assessment 1 introduction an offshore fixed platform is an offshore structure that installs itself on the seabed in order to withstand environmental loads such as wave and wind for this reason it is relatively easy to install unlike floating platforms a jack up is a special platform that combines the characteristics of fixed and floating platforms during operation this offshore structure with penetrated leg into soil behaves like a fixed platform but can move like a floating platform before and after operation the jack up also called the self elevating unit is equipped with a jacking system to lower and lift legs and 3 6 legs are put on the seabed to support the hull from environmental loads williams et al 1999 young et al 1984 the operation process of this jack up is divided mainly into four stages transit installation operation and retrieval le tirant and p√©rol 1993 in the operation phase it is important to accurately consider the fixed state because the installed depth is limited and the behavior varies greatly depending on the seabed soil wilson 2002 in structural analysis of a fixed platform seabed soils act as boundary conditions the boundary conditions of the structure generally affect the global vibration mode of and the local stress on the structure zhang et al 2017 in addition the vibration mode of the offshore structure affects not only the structural response but also the hydrodynamic response kim et al 2014 in the preliminary design of a fixed platform a simple support model or a linear spring is used as a simplified foundation model baglioni et al 1982 williams et al 1998 this simple foundation model is still used in the specific condition and is known to yield high accuracy only in cases where soil deformation is very small however when designing offshore structures it is required to calculate the response of structures under severe environmental conditions in such situations with large soil deformation simple foundation models entailing for example simple support conditions and linear springs cannot accurately simulate the actual soil houlsby et al 1992 williams et al 1998 inaccurate boundary conditions possibly misestimate not only the structural response at a specific site but also the vibration mode of the structure which determines the entire structure design a movement of the structure incurs significant soil deformation which leads to changed boundary conditions that affect structural behavior certainly soil structure interaction ssi renders precise simulation of a structure s behavior and response quite challenging in the preloading phase for the installation of the jack up the leg is penetrated into the seabed until sufficient bearing capacity is obtained leg penetration analysis calculates the vertical bearing capacity against the penetration and is necessary to determine the preloading load and the corresponding leg penetration depth during design endley et al 1981 hossain and randolph 2010 houlsby and martin 2003 kee and ims 1984 teh et al 2008 in the case of the gulf of mexico gom the south china sea in the southeast asian region and the southwest sea of south korea the soft soil is composed mainly of clay jin et al 2015 menzies and roper 2008 nancy et al 2014 in these areas then legs should be deeply penetrated until sufficient bearing capacity is achieved either by deeply penetrating into the single soft clay or reaching the underlying stiff clay choi et al 2020 in review this deep penetration process inevitably incurs large soil deformation such as the backflow phenomenon whereby the spudcan is pushed directly under the soil and the surrounding soil moves significantly the disturbed soil properties affect not only the penetration of the spudcan but also the subsequent operation of the jack up in the operation stage which is supported by the seabed soil and withstands environmental loads the foundation model mentioned above affects the global behavior of the structure by which boundary condition is changed due to the soil martin 1994 schotman 1989 vlahos et al 2005 in addition the large deformation of the seabed soil due to the deep spudcan penetration prior to the operation phase also affects the properties and corresponding foundation model zhang et al 2014c due to this complex behavior the foundation model used in the operation of jack up cannot be generally simplified as a simple boundary condition such as a simple support or a linear spring the ssi model is a two way analysis model according to which the plasticity of the soil and the response of the structure interact with each other in iso 2012 a secant model a yield interaction model and a soil continuum model were proposed as ssi models the secant model is the simplest model that considers ssi this model introduces the concept of secant stiffness in the rotational direction which is available only at a specific design point the yield interaction model was proposed as model b for more accurate simulation of the plastic behavior of clay martin 1994 this yield interaction model for clay model b was improved to the state of the art model introduced by zhang et al 2014b model b calculates the plastic displacement through an iterative calculation using a formulated equation incorporating elasticity yield envelope flow rule and hardening law martin and houlsby 2000 vlahos et al 2008 this model is known to calculate the plastic behavior of soil well in addition hyper model b was proposed in order to simulate strength degradation in the rotational direction by introducing a nonlinear moment rotation relationship into the model b framework vlahos et al 2006 the soil continuum model that performs numerical analysis according to the soil continuum is the most obvious but time consuming foundation model that accounts for the interaction of structures and soil from the pinned model to the soil continuum model less conservative and more accurate analysis is possible in iso 2012 therefore a more complicated model is called for when performing a high level acceptance check the objective of this study is to propose an improved ssi foundation model for deep penetration a simplified yield interaction model is used in order to combine efficient computational cost with considering detailed ssi simulation the existing yield interaction model for clay model b uses a constant elasticity matrix in the area before yield actual soil like other general material follows elastic plastic relationship where gradual failure occurs not elastic perfectly plastic norsok 2010 provides guidelines for ultimate limit states uls and fatigue limit states fls of offshore structures offshore structures should meet their expected life under various environmental conditions caused by for example wind wave and current lee et al 2019 the constant elasticity matrix may be reasonable in terms of uls where sufficient environmental loads are applied for plasticity to occur but may cause inaccurate prediction in terms of fls offshore structures spend most of their life in the area before yield and in terms of fatigue the response and boundary conditions in that area should be precisely considered for this objective model b with hyperbolic elastic curve before yield is proposed and implemented as the boundary condition of jack up structural analysis strength degradation before yield is implemented resulting in nonlinearity in the reaction force of the spudcan in respect to the environmental load as a result the structural response of the whole jack up structure is calculated realistically the earlier hyper model b has simulated the strength degradation of the cyclic load only in the direction of rotation that has the most dominant effect on the response vlahos et al 2006 however in the meantime the installation effect and improvement of plasticity have been included in model b zhang et al 2014b and hyper model b has a constant relation in horizontal direction and neglects the coupled term of horizontal and rotation direction the nonlinear elasto plastic load displacement curve of the soil is assumed as a hyperbolic model and implemented in the existing model b framework in the present study and through this the nonlinearity of the structural response due to gradual failure is reflected this hyperbolic relationship is defined by being simplified through initial soil stiffness and soil capacity in particular as initial stiffness is defined as a slope at a small displacement it is sensitive to displacement criteria and noise to avoid confusion due to misuse a guideline on the initial stiffness that can be adjusted for the proposed model is presented in the form of a regression model the numerical analysis results according to the spudcan embedment and lower soil properties are used for the stiffness calculation as a result the coefficient is presented so that the initial stiffness can be calculated directly which can be used as soil stiffness in the global jack up analysis as well as hyperbolic model in the present study fully coupled ssi analysis using the soil large deformation finite element ldfe technique is performed and compared with the proposed model single clay and soft over stiff clay are selected as the target soils in which deep penetration is often needed this study is conducted through numerical analysis considering the large deformation effect on soil due to spudcan penetration the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel technique in the abaqus explicit commercial program is used for the soil ldfe analysis the soil continuum model is the most accurate method to numerically simulate the ssi in this model the interaction between the jack up and the soil is considered simultaneously 2 conventional theory on yield interaction model for clay the existing model b as briefly described above is a work hardening plasticity based numerical model for spudcan behavior on clay this concept was first introduced for jack up behavior by schotman 1989 as model a afterward elasticity yield envelope flow rule and hardening law were improved overall by martin 1994 and presented as model b model b presented an empirical yield envelope formula based on the results of a 1g experiment after a minor improvement a revised yield envelope formula was proposed as a cigar shape that included an eccentricity concept in a horizontal rotation plane for the elasticity relationship inside the yield envelope martin 1994 introduced terms related to interaction in the horizontal and rotational directions eq 1 1 k e l k v 0 0 0 k h k c 0 k c k m k v g r 0 0 0 k h g r k c g r 2 0 k c g r 2 k m g r 3 the state of the art yield interaction model for clay was improved by zhang et al 2014b based on the same plasticity framework of model b elasticity yield envelope flow rule and the hardening law were updated considering the backflow and surrounding soil in spudcan behavior in this improved model b a yield envelope equation considering tensile capacity based on a centrifuge model test is included in actual single clay the horizontal and rotational capacities remain even when there is no vertical load due to backflow and adhesion after penetration and this phenomenon is reflected in the model the elastic relationship is the same as that of the existing model b of martin 1994 in eq 1 but the necessary coefficients k v k h k m k c for the elastic relation are presented for a single clay in various embedments and properties zhang et al 2012 this state of the art model b of zhang et al 2014b has been applied in subsequent studies not only to single clay but also to various multi layered soils containing clay ragni et al 2017 wang et al 2018 yin and dong 2019 vlahos et al 2006 simulated a non linear relationship rather than a linear relationship as the elastic behavior within the yield envelope in the rotational direction the stiffness decreases as rotation occurs and the hysteresis curve in the elastic region is simulated through this eq 2 to simulate this strength degradation vlahos et al 2006 introduced the hyperplasticity theory to simulate the rotational direction spring which adopts the thermomechanical principle to formulate soil plasticity using the spring slider element suggested in the hyperplasticity theory the non linear spring in the rotational direction is simulated e n t in contrast the horizontal and rotational interaction term of the elastic relation is removed for simplicity hyper model b with this nonlinear rotational spring was introduced 2 k e l k v g r 0 0 0 k h g r 0 0 0 8 e n t g r 3 the contents of the existing research on the elasticity of model b have been briefly summarized in this paper with the state of the art model b the hyper model b shares the same plasticity framework because it is based on the initial existing model b details on the hardening law and yield envelope along with this plasticity framework can be found in martin 1994 vlahos et al 2006 and zhang et al 2014b respectively 3 proposed yield interaction model hmb in this paper model b with hyperbolic elastic curve is proposed as hyperbolic model b hmb which extends the nonlinear hyperbolic relation in the elastic region in the horizontal and rotational directions and presents the coefficients for this the vertical horizontal and rotational motion of the spudcan after the penetration in single clay and soft over stiff clay has been simulated in choi et al 2020 in review and the corresponding load displacement curve has been calculated the resulting nonlinear relationship has been expressed as a hyperbolic curve and implemented in the foundation model the hyper model b vlahos et al 2006 applied a nonlinear relationship only in the direction of rotation however the proposed model has extended it in the horizontal direction and added the interaction terms of the horizontal and rotational directions eq 3 in addition the state of the art model for single clay proposed by zhang et al 2014b has been combined and applied hyperbolic curves are expressed through initial stiffness and capacity in particular the initial stiffness at an initial small displacement can vary significantly depending on the criteria compared to this sensitivity the change in initial stiffness can cause a large effect in the hyperbolic equation accordingly a regression model has been proposed to present the initial stiffness for single clay and soft over stiff clay when using the hmb presented in this paper this regression model is expected to be used to decide the initial stiffness in various soil properties and embedments 3 k e l k v g r 0 0 0 f k h u f k c Œ∏ 0 f k c Œ∏ f k

over stiff clay this paper intends to target the soil types that can exist in the soft clay field accordingly single soft clay and soft over stiff clay a case in which penetration meets the lower stiff layer is selected fig 1 in the single clay and upper layer of the soft over stiff clay the 2 4 1 35z kpa undrained shear strength s u profile in menzies and roper 2008 is used as general marine clay menzies and roper measured and introduced the soil properties of the gom field of which case 1 is selected and applied to the present study the single clay case using these properties is named swp and the details of the soil properties and nonlinear model parameters are shown in table 1 more detailed information about properties can be found in choi et al 2020 in review the height h of the upper layer of multi layered clay has been chosen as two times diameter 2b to assume deep penetration the lower layer of the soft over stiff clay is modeled by applying two three and four times the undrained strength at the boundary of the upper soft clay s u h the cases are named mws2p mws3p and mws4p respectively fig 1 likewise the details on the lower stiff layer are shown in table 1 the compared results are representatively by the mws2p case in this paper and the other two cases are introduced in the appendix the load displacement curve for each direction has been calculated using a single spudcan in a sufficiently deep embedment w as shown in fig 2 the soil continuum for obtaining load displacement relationship of single spudcan is modeled as a 3d solid in order to perform ldfe analysis through cel the eulerian mesh comprises the ec3d8r element the tresca model incorporating strain softening and rate dependency is used for modeling clay this nonlinear clay model has been introduced in einav and randolph 2005 and hossain and randolph 2009 the soil domain is modeled large enough to avoid boundary effects with width 6 times the spudcan diameter and height 5 5 times the spudcan diameter bienen et al 2012 ragni et al 2017 zhang et al 2014b in the case of soft over stiff clay the soil domain is divided into two layers to model the upper and lower clays the coulomb friction coefficient is assumed to be 0 1 based on the existing numerical analysis research on the spudcan jun et al 2018 wang et al 2012 2015 more detailed information about the single spudcan analysis is introduced in choi et al 2020 in review prior to applying vertical horizontal and rotational motion to the spudcan penetration is conducted to position the spudcan at a specific depth the preceding penetration analysis is performed to consider the soil disturbed by installation this procedure is close to the environment that the actual spudcan encounters the high penetration speed of the spudcan may overestimate the soil response due to the inertia effect the present study based on the existing research and case study used the penetration rate of 0 2 m s hu et al 2014 the spudcan is penetrated to embedments of 1 8b 2 0b 2 2b and 2 4b in order to investigate the effect of the lower stiff layer near the boundary 3 2 hyperbolic relation in horizontal and rotational directions 3 2 1 model b with hyperbolic elastic curve hyperbolic backbone curves have often been used to express ground hysteresis behavior huang et al 2020 vlahos et al 2006 the equation of the hyperbolic curve is as follows 4 f h y p e r x x a b x this hyperbolic curve equation is used to express the strength degradation in the horizontal and rotational directions through the numerical analysis spudcan penetration is simulated and then the horizontal and rotational motions are applied under a specific vertical force to catch the maximum capacity in each direction the h u and m Œ∏ relationships are assumed to be hyperbolic eq 4 and are fitted to the results of the numerical analysis fig 3 model b with hyperbolic elastic curve is proposed as hyperbolic model b hmb first the hyperbolic expression is formulated using physically meaningful parameters eq 5 6 5 f k h u u 1 k h 1 h o a b s u 6 f k m Œ∏ Œ∏ 1 k m 1 m o a b s Œ∏ where k h and k m are the initial stiffness in the horizontal and rotational directions respectively which means the slope at u Œ∏ 0 h o and m o also mean the capacity and converged value at u Œ∏ in each direction the physical meanings of initial stiffness and capacity are presented in fig 3 the results of fitting according to the proposed equation are shown in table 2 the load displacement curve and the corresponding parameters have been calculated by varying the lower clay properties and embedments in one of the several cases the results of single clay and soft over stiff clay at w 2 2b are selected as shown in fig 3 the fitted hyperbolic curve black line follows the single spudcan analysis result blue points when it is assumed to be elastic perfectly plastic red dotted line the strength degradation cannot be expressed the effect of lower stiff clay is well revealed in the fitted value table 2 the rotational motaion has downward motion at a side of the spudcan therefore the rotational capacity is increased in the soft over stiff clay due to the squeezing effect however the horizontal capacity does not change much the initial stiffness determines the initial part of the load displacement material curve both the horizontal and rotational stiffness increases due to the influence of the lower stiff clay in particular the rotational stiffness affected by the surrounding soil increases significantly the fitting results for different embedments and properties of lower clay are presented in fig 6 and table 4 table 7 in the appendix the deeper the embedment and the stronger the lower clay the higher the initial stiffness and capacity the effects of embedments and properties on initial stiffness and capacity are deeply illustrated in the choi et al 2020 in review however the results that may be unacceptable are obtained for 2 2b of mws4p fig 19 at a depth of 2 2b the maximum bearing area of the spudcan is close to the soil boundary with the large difference of soil properties in the mws4p case it is confirmed that the graph tends to be slightly different at the initial rotation compared with the other cases of soil properties and embedments this result seems to have been a simple numerical analysis outlier and so it is excluded from the subsequent regression analysis 3 3 coupled term in spudcan motion the horizontal and rotational directions interact with each other therefore a reaction moment occurs in the horizontal motion of the spudcan and the rotation also results in a horizontal reaction force model b martin 1994 introduced these coupled terms compared with the initial model a schotman 1989 and a state of the art modified model b mmb also included these coupled terms on the other hand in hyper model b the existing research considering the nonlinearity of the elastic region in the rotational direction the coupled term was not considered for simplification vlahos et al 2006 in this study the effect of these coupled terms is examined and simply considered in the proposed foundation model according to the concept of secant stiffness in general in numerical analysis the behavior at the next increment is determined by considering the time or load increment and corresponding tangent stiffness of the load displacement curve however secant stiffness refers to the stiffness that connects from the starting point to the design point when all of the load or displacement is applied sullivan et al 2004 in this secant stiffness concept the load displacement at the design point coincides but an incorrect load displacement relation occurs at different locations although the secant stiffness that fits only at a certain point has limitations it also has the advantage of being a foundation model that can be modeled simply in the form of a linear spring in the structure in consideration of the plasticity of the soil as in the conventional model b rotation did not generate the vertical reaction force however the horizontal reaction force occurred due to the rotation of the spudcan non diagonal term in eq 1 the coupled term is investigated by calculating the horizontal reaction force when a rotation is applied while keeping the vertical and horizontal directions fixed the secant stiffness at each displacement is shown in fig 4 secant stiffness is a method of expressing a load corresponding to each displacement assuming a linear model although not an entire nonlinear relationship can be simulated through the secant stiffness reaction force at specific displacement can be modeled simply and effectively therefore the secant stiffness value at each displacement is calculated by dividing the displacement corresponding to the resulting load as shown in fig 4 it is confirmed that the secant stiffness approaches zero from the initial stiffness value as displacement increases as in the existing model if the horizontal load and rotation are linear in the elastic region the secant stiffness of the coupled term will also have a constant value eq 1 however in the result of the present numerical analysis secant stiffness decreases which means that strength degradation occurs as in other directions fig 4 a secant stiffness has a larger value as the lower clay is stronger and the embedment is deeper in soft over stiff clay fig 4 b exceptionally 2 0b is showing a larger value than 2 2b in the soft over stiff clay case figs 4 b fig 20 in appendix 2 0b in soft over stiff clay is the moment when the spudcan tip reaches the soil boundary the horizontal force about the rotation is caused by the difference in soil response on both sides of the rotated spudcan when rotation occurs squeezing occurs on a side with a downward motion while the upper clay is only affected on the other side with an upward motion therefore the unbalanced response makes the horizontal reaction force increase the embedment at which this effect is most amplified is w 2 0b and accordingly the secant stiffness is slightly increased than w 2 2b case also fluctuation occurs in the initial phase of numerical analysis this is a small value but the secant stiffness that calculates the slope may result in an unintended bounce at a few initial points the cases from 1 8b to 2 2b quickly approaches zero and the case of 2 4b has an initial negative stiffness but similarly tends to approach zero in this way since the secant stiffness value of kc has small value compared with kh and km it also has a small effect on the horizontal force and rotational moment respectively for example single clay and soft over stiff clay are introduced according to table 2 the kh in the table is 455 64 and 646 88 mn m for single clay and soft over stiff clay respectively these values have been multiplied to the horizontal displacement in the elastic matrix of eq 3 in the case of the calculated kc a value of about 20 in swp and about 90 in mws2p corresponded to 0 02m of displacement kc is multiplied by a smaller value of rotation compared with the horizontal displacement and has a smaller effect on the horizontal force in the case of moment even if the horizontal displacement has a larger value km is more than 100 times larger than kc likewise the coupled term has a small effect as well for this reason in the present study the concept of secant stiffness is adopted for simple simulation of strength degradation a linearly decreased stiffness model with increasing displacement is used resulting in zero for the displacement of 0 1m the initial stiffness of this coupled term is from zhang et al 2012 who calculated the initial stiffness of the equation for single clay as the coupled term did not have a significant effect relative to the diagonal term the existing initial stiffness is used in the case of multi layers the stiffness is determined by linear interpolation of the values corresponding to the upper and lower clay properties 3 4 regression model of initial stiffness to define the horizontal and rotational hyperbolic relations in hmb two parameters initial stiffness and capacity should be determined carefully the actual response of jack up hardly reaches the maximum single direction capacity because combined loads are applied in practice and loads in other directions also contribute to yield in this respect the initial stiffness which determines the initial phase of the material curve becomes important the initial stiffness is determined according to the response at a small strain fig 5 shows that the initial stiffness may vary depending on the criteria of small strain in fig 5 a it seems that the blue slope represents the overall shape better than the red slope in contrast when it is enlarged fig 5 b the red slope is the better representative of the material curve at the beginning and the blue slope rather crosses the curve this sensitivity of the initial slope can cause a difference in the corresponding hyperbolic curve even if the capacity is the same the difference in the initial slope can cause a large difference in the early stage as shown in fig 5 b it may not be valid that the initial stiffness calculated through different methods or other criteria can be applied to the proposed hmb for this reason this paper intends to present a regression model for initial stiffness in soft over stiff clay that can be used in hmb the equations are presented so that the corresponding parameters can be used in both the single clay and the soft over stiff clay prior to the analysis the undrained shear strength ratio and depth ratio are selected as the representative variables for consideration of the effect of the lower stiff clay the undrained shear strength ratio s u s t i f f s u h refers to the ratio of the undrained shear strength of the upper soft clay and the lower stiff clay at the boundary the effect of the lower clay can be normalized and expressed using the ratio of undrained strength a regression model has been proposed for the lower stiff clay which is 1 4 times harder than the upper clay the depth ratio w h means the ratio of the depth of penetration to the height of the upper clay embedment cannot clearly present the relationship with the lower stiff clay and so for this purpose the depth ratio is normalized by the height of the upper layer a regression model is proposed for depth ratios from 0 9 to 1 2 in particular it is expected that a depth ratio of 0 9 or less will be affected only the upper soft clay and not also the lower clay this selected range can cover the bearing pressure of a typical jack up for the selected undrained shear strength ratio and depth ratio the initial stiffness and capacity are calculated by fitting from the results of the single spudcan ldfe analysis the results for varying embedment in the single clay and soft over stiff clay mws2p are plotted in fig 6 fig 6 a shows the results in the horizontal direction and kh and ho are calculated as the initial slope and converged value respectively fig 6 b shows the rotational direction and the corresponding km and mo are also obtained the fitted lines are indicated as a black solid line for both cases of single clay and soft over stiff clay it is confirmed that the deeper the penetration depth the greater the initial stiffness and capacity this significant increase occurs in the soft over stiff clay case which is impacted by the lower stiff clay fig 7 shows the effect of the lower layer on the load displacement curve as shown in fig 7 a at w 1 8b the spudcan does not meet the lower stiff clay and so the soft clay applies only a small reaction force however at w 2 4b the spudcan overlaps much with the lower stiff clay and the stiff clay applies a correspondingly large reaction force fig 7 b horizontal capacity is greatly influenced by the area overlapped with lower stiff clay therefore the capacity increases significantly in 2 2b and 2 4b where the overlapped areas are increased due to the large reaction force from the stiff clay the reaction moment increases more than the horizontal reaction force due to the downward motion of one side to the lower stiff clay the side with downward motion will be affected by squeezing even though the spudcan is not overlapped with the lower stiff clay and so the rotational capacity increases from w 2 2b 7 g e 2 1 ŒΩ 500 2 1 ŒΩ s u 8 g h 500 2 1 ŒΩ s u h 9 k h k h g h r

for the stiffness coefficient k h k m concept presented by iso 2012 eq 9 10 although kh and km actually have physical meaning as initial stiffness an equation for the normalized coefficient is provided for general applicability shear modulus g and spudcan radius r have been used for normalization g applied in the present study is calculated by using the general relation with e and the relationship with s u eq 7 g h uses the intact s u of upper soft clay properties at the boundary for normalization eq 8 the properties of the lower clay are implemented in the regression model through the undrained shear strength ratio although the operative strength may be more appropriate to express the stiffness after installation intact strength is used for a convenience in use if the equation about soil stiffness is expressed in terms of the operative strength the strength after installation should be investigated through a measurement or a numerical analysis for this reason the intact strength is adopted fig 8 presents the accuracy of the proposed regression model the x axis is the value obtained through numerical analysis and the y axis is the value calculated through the regression model the linear dotted line means that the two values are the same therefore the closer the points are to the corresponding line the better the regression equation predicts the value the points in fig 8 show the trend close to linear and it is also confirmed that eq 9 and eq 10 represented the initial stiffness well 4 validation the ssi model of jack up in iso 2012 consists of the secant model the yield interaction model and the soil continuum model in the previous section the elastic relationship that determines the behavior within the yield envelope has been improved in the yield interaction model strength degradation before yield has been implemented through hyperbolic relations and initial stiffness applicable to proposed hmb has been introduced in the form of a regression model for validation of the proposed yield interaction model structural analysis of jack up with the soil continuum model is performed through ldfe taking into account the installation effect in the jack up analysis during the operation phase zhang et al 2014c the penetration of the jack up structure is also simulated prior to the jack up structural analysis under environmental loads the plasticity framework of model b has been implemented in numerical simulations the implicit formulation of model b in vlahos et al 2008 has been used in the user element uel subroutine of abaqus the uel subroutine can directly define the constitutive equation of the element and load displacement relationship for multiple degrees of freedom dof in each step repetitive calculations using displacements and reaction forces are performed to determine the elastic and plastic behavior of the foundation elasticity yield envelope the flow rule for plastic behavior and the hardening law for additional vertical penetration are all formulated in an iterative procedure thereby the plastic displacement corresponding to each increment is calculated the detailed formulation was introduced in vlahos et al 2008 the soil continuum model is the most reliable and accurate among numerical methods for consideration of ssi the load transferred from the structure is applied to the soil simultaneously and the influence of the structure due to the corresponding soil behavior is considered in two way despite its accuracy the computational cost of this method makes it difficult to use widely especially for time series analysis in the existing jack up problem the soil continuum model is considered by using a basic mohr coulomb model for sands with relatively small deformation pisan√≤ et al 2019 however for clays accompanied by large deformations fully coupled ssi analysis is not widely performed due to the excessively high cost of simulating the large deformations and resulting changes in soil properties 4 1 yield interaction model in macro element prior to the application of hmb the plasticity framework of model b has been implemented first in order to perform structural analysis using the yield interaction model for the implicit formulation of model b refer to vlahos et al 2008 the macro element reflecting the formulated expression has been implemented using the user element subroutine of abaqus model b which is a yield interaction model for clay is effectively implemented through the user element because it is necessary to perform repetitive calculations using displacement and reaction forces validation using jack up structural analysis should be performed to determine whether the yield interaction model is well implemented the 2d jack up analysis in vlahos et al 2008 has been selected as a validation case a jack up with 100m leg length and 51 96m leg spacing has been modeled and the undrained shear strength of clay is 10 2z kpa depending on the depth z details on the fe model and structural properties are available in vlahos et al 2008 and martin 1994 after preloading of the spudcans to vo 100 mn the vertical load is unloaded to 50 mn v vo 0 5 and the environmental load is applied to 7 mn the capacity of each direction cited in the reference is used as given the results of vlahos et al 2008 are plotted as o and those of implemented uel are plotted as lines in fig 9 a according to the result yield at about henv 4 mn and moment failure of the leeward leg are simulated well in addition the reaction force in the vertical and horizontal directions of the macro element follows the reference results well this validation case has been expanded to 3d using the yield envelope equation suggested in bienen and cassidy 2006 in the 3d yield envelope equation eq 11 the sign of the horizontal and rotational directions is changed according to the sign convention and a torsion term q is added as a result of the same analysis implementing eq 11 it is confirmed that the graph in fig 9 is obtained the same 11 f h 2 h o 2 m 3 m o 2 2 e h 2 h o m 3 m o h 3 h o 2 m 2 m o 2 2 e h 3 h o m 2 m o q q o 2 4 1 œá 2 2 v

oil platform of 125 08m leg length 39 32m leg spacing 74 09m hull length and 61 11m breadth however it is challenging to obtain detailed information on this actual jack up and so a similar sized jack up used in other research has been selected zhang et al 2014a presented the detailed specification of the jack up structure used for verification this structure has legs of 120m length and 37 87m spacing and spudcans of 14m equivalent diameter this model closely resembles the leg and spudcan specifications of mlt 116c which is referred to in the present study therefore corresponding leg section information and stiffness are also used in this study model the second moment of area of the leg modeled by the equivalent 1d beam in the reference is 7 2 m4 in the case of hull the reference gives a 1d beam with a second section moment of 72 m4 the elastic modulus and shear modulus of the leg have the values 200 gpa and 80 gpa respectively which are common steel values 4 2 2 fe model used in ssi analysis an equivalent beam model is used for the jack up structure consisting of a leg and a hull fig 10 a this model called the stick model has been proposed in iso 2012 as one of the leg model types that can be used for structural analysis the stick model can calculate the global response of jack up such as base shear and overturning moment of overall structure and global leg forces the beams that make up the legs and hulls have been modeled as timoshenko beams that allow transverse shear deformation each leg has been modeled with 21 nodes and 20 elements and the hull has 6 nodes between each leg braces in the hull have been properly complemented for sufficient strength of hull leg joint the implemented user element is placed in the lower part of the jack up leg as a 1d beam the legs and user elements are connected by 6 dof coupling as in the spudcan so that the reaction and displacement calculated from user elements can be transferred the bottom of the user element is fixed so that only the user element reaction becomes the boundary condition of the jack up structure in the user element two types of yield interaction models are used to compare each other first hmb a proposed model for single clay and soft over stiff clay is used in this study and for comparison state of the art model zhang et al 2014b is used also because it is intended to show the difference between the proposed methodological model and the existing model the same soil parameters stiffness capacity as obtained through the single spudcan analysis table 3 are used the jack up structure used in the soil continuum model fig 10 b uses the same model as in fig 10 a the global response of the jack up is calculated using the stick model composed of timoshenko beams with the equivalent stiffness the spudcan is a steel structure that transfers reaction force and moment by direct interaction with soil therefore the spudcan has been modeled using 3d solid elements to simulate ssi through the cel technique the lagrangian mesh for the spudcan comprises c3d6 and c3d8r elements the local strength of the spudcan has a minimal effect in terms of overall structural strength and so the spudcan is assumed to be rigid to clarify the ssi using the load reference point lrp the lrp of spudcan and the lower leg are connected by 6 dof coupling so that the soil response can be transmitted to the structure as it is for maintaining the parameters of the nonlinear load displacement relationship in table 3 the soil continuum model also uses the same soil properties as the single spudcan analysis the eulerian mesh ec3d8r is used for the cel analysis and the tresca model incorporating strain softening and rate dependency is used for modeling of the clay the mws2p case is selected as the representative case of soft over stiff clay soil properties of swp and mws2p are presented in table 1 the previous soil domain size is selected based on a single spudcan thus a larger domain would be needed for the entire jack up structure the soil domain with a diameter of 10b and a depth of 6b is adopted for the jack up analysis the element size is determined to be 0 065b considering the computational cost and the accuracy of the analysis as the element size increases the analysis time decreases but the accuracy of the analysis also decreases a large sized element typically shows that the bearing capacity value increases fig 11 the element size of 0 065b which showed similar results to those for 0 05b used in the single spudcan analysis is adopted the interface between spudcan and soil consists of normal hard contact and tangential frictional contact based on the penalty method a tangential frictional coefficient of 0 1 is used by reference to existing researches wang et al 2012 2015 jun et al 2018 details of the fe modeling are the same as single spudcan analysis section 3 1 4 3 load sequence of jack up analysis the jack up analysis is divided into penetration and environmental load analyses for simulation of the operating procedure of actual jack up first the jack up penetrates from the seabed to the target location of 2 2b fig 12 b the penetration process simulating the jack up installation phase is performed at a 0 015b s penetration rate after penetration and positioning at the target position ssi analysis is performed by applying an environmental load fig 12 c the weight of the hull structure is applied to the hull leg joint as a vertical point load and the weight of the legs is applied as the distributed load in the case of environmental loads a horizontal point load is applied to the 105m position airgap 15m from the spudcan assuming the water depth the environmental load is applied until structure failure and thus correspondingly totals of 15 mn for single clay and 19 5 mn for soft over stiff clay are applied to the three legs 4 4 single clay 4 4 1 results of single clay analysis the results of the jack up analysis considering ssi by means of a nonlinear foundation model for single clay are compared ldfe in figure means the soil continuum model and hmb and mmb means the hyperbolic model b and state of the art model b of zhang et al 2014b respectively for convenience the state of the art model is named modified model b and accordingly it is expressed as mmb the leeward leg results are presented by solid lines and the windward leg results are represented by dashed lines these legend criteria remain consistent throughout the paper the results of the reaction force moment and displacement acting on the soil are plotted in fig 13 the results of the soil continuum model and two yield interaction models proposed hmb and state of the art mmb also are shown as can be seen when an environmental load is applied the whole structure rotates in the environmental load direction so that the leeward leg shows downward motion and the windward leg shows upward motion this phenomenon is illustrated in fig 13 a with respect to the vertical load and displacement the reaction force of the leeward leg increases and accordingly downward motion is shown in the vertical direction the windward leg shows upward motion and the corresponding reaction force decreases accordingly the environmental loads are applied in the direction where two of the three legs are the leeward leg and one is the windward leg accordingly it is shown that the displacement and reaction force of the windward leg are about twice as large as those of the leeward fig 13 b shows the rotational reaction moment and rotation of the ssi models the soil generally experiences moment failure first during jack up behavior that is the reason why the secant model introduced the concept of secant stiffness only for the rotational stiffness the soil continuum model ldfe in fig 13 and yield interaction model results also confirm that failure occurs first in the rotational direction when looking at the ldfe results the increased rate of moment gradually decreases as the environmental load increases and eventually starts to fall near 4 mn this moment failure occurs gradually and the displacement also shows a progressively increasing slope in the case of the yield interaction models both models well predict the moment failure in the hyperbolic model strength degradation before yield is simulated through the hyperbolic relation eq 6 accordingly the reaction moment gradually decreases as the environmental load increases such as in the ldfe analysis by contrast mmb shows that the reaction moment increases relatively linearly with the initial slope as the environmental load increases before yield the hmb and mmb start with the same initial slope but the difference occurs as the analysis proceeds thus it is confirmed that the moment is slightly overestimated at the yield point in the case of displacement the hmb results showed gradual increases but the difference between the foundation models is not significant the difference between the two yield interaction models is better shown in fig 14 a there the load paths for the vertical reaction force and the rotational reaction moment show the difference between the two models before reaching the yield envelope in the case of hmb the overall load path including the gradual moment failure follows the ldfe results relatively well especially in the windward leg in the case of mmb the behavior after the yield point is also similar to that of the other two models however the behavior before yield is somewhat close to linear and shows large reaction moment fig 14 b plots the moment rotation material curve at the jack up analysis because the same soil properties are used in the numerical analysis table 1 the material curve obtained from the single spudcan analysis and that from the jack up structural analysis are almost identical hyperbolic model b hmb reflects the strength degradation before yield so the load displacement curve follows the ldfe result well both before and after yield however mmb can simulate the plastic behavior after yield well while the elastic behavior shows a curve close to linearity gradual moment failure in the ldfe results is not simulated in mmb 4 4 2 results of soft over stiff clay analysis fig 15 plots the results of the numerical analysis in soft over stiff clay as mentioned in the previous section the global behavior of jack up is also same in the soft over stiff clay so that the leeward leg is downward and the windward leg is subjected to upward forces as the leeward leg shows downward motion the vertical reaction force increases at the same time by contrast as the windward leg shows upward movement the vertical reaction force decreases fig 15 b plots the horizontal reaction force and displacement as the environmental load is applied in the horizontal direction in the elastic region the total horizontal reaction force acting in the opposite direction should by the principle of action reaction be the same value therefore before yield occurs near henv 4 mn the horizontal reaction force of the same magnitude as the environmental load is calculated in both the soil continuum model and the two yield interaction models when yield occurs moment failure occurs first and the reaction force and moments in all directions are redistributed accordingly the horizontal response of the leeward and windward legs is changed due to their different vertical reaction forces in the model b framework the load path after yield moves on the force resultant yield envelope the horizontal and rotational responses can change depends on the vertical response level in the case of the horizontal displacement of the spudcan hmb expresses a gradual increase due to the hyperbolic relation despite the initial linearity of displacement mmb results after the yield also approach the ldfe results closely fig 15 c plots the reaction moment and rotation according to the environmental load soil failure usually occurs first in the rotational direction and in this respect it is important to simulate the reaction moment precisely in soft over stiff clay cases subjected to larger environmental loads gradual moment failure appears as well the moment increases slowly as the environmental load increases in the soil continuum model and the moment values of the windward leg become different due to yield about the environmental load of 3 mn modified model b mmb predicts the yield point of 3 mn well and as is apparent the moment in the plastic region is close to the ldfe result the results of hmb start with the same initial slope as the mmb but show a hyperbolic relation the yield point is pushed back henv 4 5 mn and the strength of degradation is well simulated in the reaction moment nonlinear hyperbolic relation makes the calculated moment results close to the ldfe results in the case of mmb despite the similar results after yield the moment is overestimated due to the constant elasticity matrix the rotation results effectively indicate a difference between the hmb and the existing mmb specifically the hyperbolic relation implemented in the horizontal direction in hmb the soil continuum model using the ldfe analysis shows a gradual increase in rotation which is also simulated in hmb however mmb shows a relatively linear relationship and accordingly the yield occurs earlier as a result there is a difference in rotation between the two yield interaction models at the yield point like in the moment results the load path in the vm plane and moment rotation curve are plotted in fig 16 the load path shows the effect of moment failure so the results of hmb follow the results of ldfe better fig 16 a unlike mmb result which approaches the yield envelope in a direction of linear initial stiffness the slope of hmb gradually decreases with moment increment and thus becomes similar to the result of the soil continuum model wherein gradual moment failure occurs in addition mmb rapidly approaches the yield envelope and yield occurs in the leeward leg by contrast the hmb does not reach the yield envelope and indeed yield does not occur to present the moment failure the moment rotation curve from the single spudcan analysis that from the jack up analysis using a soil continuum model and those from the two yield interaction models are shown in fig 16 b hyperbolic model b hmb uses a fitted hyperbolic curve from the results of the single spudcan analysis and follows the curve well the decreasing moment is also simulated in the windward leg despite the low level value because the moment capacity depends on the vertical and horizontal forces the moment capacity is smaller when applied than when vertical and horizontal forces are not applied according to the concept of the force resultant yield envelope contrastingly in the case of mmb the moment is overestimated in the elastic region before yield however after yield the results quickly approaches those of the ldfe analysis 5 discussion structural assessment the foundation model as the boundary condition affects not only the soil response but also the structural response these effects on structural response are the same for single clay and soft over stiff clay and therefore the results for soft over stiff clay are presented in this paper representatively by taking into account the nonlinear relationship before yield the difference in the soil response between the existing model and the proposed model is maximized right before the yield point and the beginning of the plastic region henv 3 3 mn in fig 15 c the bending moment of the leg at this point is shown in fig 17 in order to understand the structural response due to this difference in addition the point at which soil failure occurs due to the continuous load being applied even after yield has been selected henv 6 5 mn in fig 15 c and the bending moment of the leg at this point is shown in fig 18 the structural response at henv 3 3 mn where a difference in soil reaction moment between mmb and hmb is maximized is shown in fig 17 the stick model is suitable for viewing the global jack up response not local member forces and thus the distribution of the bending moment of the leg is presented sm2 in figure hyperbolic model b hmb shows a similar distribution to the soil continuum model results using ldfe on the other hand mmb shows that the reaction moment on the soil is larger than those of the other two models and that accordingly the bending moment of the leg also is different the moment acting on the spudcan leg joint is larger than those in the other two models like soil response and so the distribution of the moment of the entire leg is shifted as a result the bending moment at the hull leg joint is underestimated due to the shifted distribution this hull leg joint is one of the critical points in the jack up structural analysis and hmb shows a more realistic bending moment distribution at the leg the structural response at henv 6 5 mn where the plasticity of the soil and the failure of the structure occurs is shown in fig 18 in this plastic region the three models show similar values this is because mmb simulates a moment in the plastic region well through the plasticity framework after yield as a result all three models shows a similar distribution in terms of the bending moment of the leg based on the bending moment results it is confirmed that the magnitude of the reaction moment acting on the spudcan which is the same as that of the applied moment on soil affects the distribution of the bending moment of the leg the distributions of bending moments are similar if they show similar soil reaction moments fig 18 however it is important to take into account that the large reaction force on the soil may lead to underestimation of the bending moment in the hull leg joint fig 17 although the load path is different it is confirmed that the structural response is similar when the resulting reaction force and moment applied to the soil are similar this means that structural analysis can be performed with the load dependent foundation model as the boundary condition and in terms of uls where the maximum response is important the existing model b shows good predictions if the foundation model accurately simulates the reaction force and transfers it to the structure the global structural response in terms of bending moment can be predicted however the strength degradation before yield realistically predicts the response under small environmental loads hyperbolic model b hmb can be considered to be a good alternative if the area before yield is of primary interest such as fls 6 conclusion this study aims to investigate the elasticity of model b which determines the soil behavior inside the yield envelope in the conventional model load displacement relation in the constant elasticity matrix has an almost linear relationship except for the horizontal rotation coupled term however actual soil shows gradually degraded strength and therefore this study applied a nonlinear relationship to the horizontal and rotational directions in the conventional hyper model b a nonlinear hyperbolic relationship is applied only to the rotational direction the proposed hyperbolic model b hmb extends this nonlinear relationship to the horizontal direction and combines a state of the art concept such as the tensile capacity of spudcan as a result a constant elasticity matrix can overestimate the soil response before yield in contrast the nonlinear hyperbolic relationship can simulate strength degradation before yield the proposed model is implemented using macro elements and compared with the soil continuum model using ldfe a global jack up analysis is conducted on single clay and soft over stiff clay using yield interaction models including the conventional model b and the proposed model b as well as the soil continuum model the nonlinearity of the load displacement curve is also shown in the jack up analysis using the soil continuum model strength degradation appears even at small displacement the state of the art model b has a linear relationship before yield except for the horizontal rotational coupled term of small influence and so strength degradation did not occur hyperbolic model b hmb however considers nonlinearity in the region before the load combination reaches the yield envelope accordingly the load path and the plastic displacement of the soil as well as the load displacement curve are well simulated in the global analysis the effects of changes of foundation model on structural response based on a global analysis are investigated through the bending moment of the leg which is one of the global structural responses of jack up for comparison of the structural response the point where the load combination reaches the yield envelope and the point where soil failure occurs have been selected the reaction force of the soil is transferred to the structure through the spudcan serving as a foundation and the bending moment of the leg depends on this transferred force as a result it is possible to predict the bending moment distribution of the leg relatively accurately through proposed model in consideration of soil nonlinearity before yield it is confirmed that a change of the foundation model can also affect the structural response at the hull leg joint regarding the structure response in terms of ultimate strength when the load path is not important the resulting reaction force of soil is focused and existing model b is effective enough to use however when the load path is important such as in fatigue analysis the nonlinearity of the soil should be considered with respect to the small load combination before yield and proposed hyperbolic model b can be an alternative for this purpose credit authorship contribution statement

during the operation of sft to study the dynamic response of sft system subjected to the undex the semi empirical formula of the cole shock wave and the geers hunter bubble motion formula are used to established the undex load formula and the transient fluid solid interaction effect of the structure is considered according to the retarded potential formula rpf a coupled model that considers the explosion and vehicular loads is developed using d alembert s principle and the runge kutta method additionally the established load and coupled model are verified using existing test data and methods the influence of the load and structural parameters are analyzed based on the parameters of the proposed sft the results reveal the impact of vehicle explosion coupled on the sft system response and the relationship between the structural parameters and the system response and some significant conclusions are presented keywords submerged floating tunnel underwater explosion vehicle load theoretical model coupled vibration 1 introduction the submerged floating tunnel sft is a novel type structure that spans large and deep water areas its concept was first proposed by norwegian scholars remseth et al 1999 and gradually been accepted by researchers in various countries owing to its advantages such as large crossing capacity small vertical slope flexible planning minimal outside interference and green environmental protection xiang et al 2017 currently the sft is at the stage of a feasibility study minoretti et al 2016 moan and eidem 2020 and needs to overcome several challenges before it can be applied to engineering evaluating the mechanical performance of the sft from the load and using this to guide the design and operation is a major research field of the sft as a traffic structure vehicle load is the conventional load faced by sft researches in this area include tariverdilo 2011 simplified trains to moving load sequences and studied the dynamic response of sft under the trains action by simplifying the vehicle to a single degree of freedom system lin et al 2018 2019 established a sft theoretical model and studied the vehicle tunnel coupled vibration additionally jin and kim 2020 established a tube tether vehicle coupled numerical model of sft the sft dynamic response under the coupled action of wave and vehicle is studied the undex is an extreme accidental load may occur during the operation of sft and it will pose significant damage to the sft once it occurs in the related researches some scholars studied the structure response under undex through numerical simulation and experiment for example zhang et al 2011 invested the overall damage effect of ships subject to the undex based on the abaqus li et al 2011 studied the dynamic characteristics of cylindrical shells under the shallow water explosion through the explosion test and msc dytran jin et al 2019 explored the dynamic response of sandwich structures under the undex bubble through the abaqus and explosion test other scholars studied the physical process and the load calculation of undex by combining theoretical analysis and test for example cole 1948 studied the calculation method of undex shock wave load through explosion test and theoretical analysis zamyshlyayev 1973 explored the free surface effect cavitation effect diffraction effect and other unique phenomena of undex through explosion tests geers and hunter 2002 established a undex bubble motion model and studied the load characteristics of the bubble using the potential flow theory and daa double asymptotic approximation method the above researches provide valuable experience for the undex research of sft the undex researches of sft includes a study by seo et al 2015 who simplified the sft to a beam on the elastic foundation model and calculated the dynamic response of sft tube subject to the undex shock wave hong et al 2018 and luo et al 2018 who simulated the dynamic process of the sft subject to undex with ls dyna and analyzed the effects of explosion parameters and the support system on the dynamic response yang et al 2019 established a three dimensional model of the underwater tunnel with autodyn to evaluate the damage of the underwater tunnel after the explosion besides some scholars studied the influences of concrete performance and section form of sft through a combination of explosion tests and numerical simulations kristoffersen et al 2019 t√∏mte 2015 however most of the researches mentioned above focus on numerical simulation with little theoretical research and the bubble load and the coupled effect between the sft tube and tether are not considered which has a discrepancy with the actual situation therefore if a comprehensive theoretical model considers undex loads and structure response was proposed it can provide an essential reference for the anti blast design research of sft and similar underwater structures based on the above researches this paper uses the semi empirical formula of the cole shock wave and the geers hunter bubble motion formula to consider the shock wave and bubble pulse action of undex and the retard potential formula rpf to consider the fluid structure coupled effect after the explosion besides the vehicle vibration tether vibration and tube space vibration are taken into account by establishing the vibration equations of the sft component accordingly a coupled vibration model of the sft is developed by considering the vehicular and explosion loads simultaneously finally the load parameters and structural parameters are discussed and its the impact law is revealed 2 load model and equation establishment the sft is generally composed of the tunnel tube suspended in a certain depth underwater the underwater foundations the tethers and the connection devices as shown in fig 1 2 1 explosive shock wave action considering the most unfavourable situation this paper assumes the undex occurs in the mid span of the sft the distance and angle between the explosion point and the tunnel mid span position can be represented by the initial standoff distance r i and the load incident angle Œ∏ as shown in fig 2 the shock wave load of undex can be calculated using the semi empirical formula proposed by cole 1 p m w e r k w e 1 3 r Œ± p st t p m exp t t s where p m is the

k 52 4 and Œ± 1 13 t s is the decay time of shock wave load t s 0 084 w e 1 3 w e 1 3 r 0 23 beside the time distribution the longitudinal spatial distribution of undex load along the sft also needs to be considered in fact the spatial distribution under different standoff distances has been given in eq 1 but for the calculation convenience the standoff distance r needs to be replaced by the longitudinal coordinate x the standoff distance and any point on the tube is r x r i 2 x l tb 2 2 bring it into p m we get 2 p m w e x k w e 1 3 r x Œ± it can be further processed by replacing r x in eq 2 with the initial standoff distance r i the shock wave spatial distribution function can be written as p sx 3 p m w e x k w e 1 3 r i r i r x Œ± k w e 1 3 r i Œ± r i r x Œ± p sx x r i r x Œ± r i

sx x 2 2 bubble pulse action the undex load usually includes two parts the shock wave and bubble pulsation the shock wave stage provides initial conditions for bubble generation and pulsation geers and hunter 2002 conducted deep research on this topic who simplified the undex bubbles to spherical bubbles and established a relatively completed bubble motion formula as eq 5 and fig 3 because this

tube and the tether are coupled through the tether tension and the tube and the vehicle are coupled through the vehicle load finally these components form an integral coupled vibration system for such a time varying coupled system the analytical solution cannot be solved and the runge kutta method will be used for numerical integration solve 3 calculation model and load analysis currently there is no completed sft in the world as per the design data of the proposed sft the parameters used in the following calculation are shown in table 1 won et al 2019 xiang et al 2020 3 1 model verification and analysis this subsection will verify the load and structural model of this paper fig 7 a shows the verification of the vehicle tunnel coupled model it can be seen that the calculation results of this paper and lin et al 2019 are similar the two displacement peak is 1 75 and 1 86 mm respectively and the error is within a reasonable range li and rong 2012 collected shock wave load pressure data through undex test fig 7 b shows the verification of the undex shock wave load formula it can be seen that the distribution of cole s empirical formula is similar to the test results the two pressure peaks are 14 90 and 15 07 mpa respectively besides the figure also shows the total shock wave pressure after considering the fluid solid interaction it can be seen that the total pressure on the structure is about twice of the previous one the bubble motion calculated by geers hunter model is shown in fig 7 c and d from fig 7 c it can be seen that the bubble radius increases and decreases repeatedly with time and the bubble radius has decayed to a minimum at the third pulsation therefore the first three pulsations can be taken when calculate the bubble pulsation load the maximum radius and maximum period in this paper is 0 216 m and 0 203 s the semi empirical formula of bubble radius r max j 3 38 w e h 10 3 1 3 and bubble period t j 2 11 w e 1 3 h 10 3 5 6 can be used for verification after calculation the empirical radius is 0 212 m the empirical period is 0 209 s the error is within a reasonable range fig 7 d shows the bubble migration displacement with time it can be found that the migration displacement increases slowly as the bubble expands and the displacement increases suddenly as the bubble contracts which is owning to the bubbles displace the liquid with a higher density than the internal gas also fig 7 d shows the bubble pulse pressure calculated by the bubble motion equation it can be seen that the bubble pulse pressure corresponds to its radius distribution when the bubble is in the expansion stage the pressure is negative when the bubble is in the contraction stage it will generate a tremendous positive pressure which verifies the reliability of the bubble pulse load in this paper 3 2 effect of load parameters in this subsection the load parameters are mainly discussed to analyze the coupled effect of undex and vehicle load here are four cases explosion load only moving load only explosion when the vehicle just enters the tunnel initial position and explosion when the vehicle travels to the middle of the tunnel mid span the displacement result of the tube and the vehicle is shown in fig 8 a and fig 8 b it can be seen from fig 8 a that whether exploded at the initial position or the mid span the tube displacement under the coupled action of vehicle explosion is not much different from that of only explosion compared with only the explosion action the tube displacement peak of exploded at the initial position and the mid span increased by 12 7 and 18 2 respectively it shows undex load and its loading time have little impact on tube displacement it can be seen from fig 8 b that whether exploded at the initial position or the mid span the vehicle displacement under the coupled action of the vehicle explosion is much greater than that of only vehicle compared with only vehicle action the vehicle displacement exploded at the initial position and the mid span increased by 5 35 times and 6 38 times respectively it shows the undex load and its loading time have a significant impact on vehicle displacement for the vehicle displacement under vehicle load the displacement is multiplied after explosion the maximum explosion displacement occurs when the vehicle is in mid span in addition to simplifying the vehicle to a vehicle load capable of coupled vibration with the tunnel tube it can also be reduced to a moving load by considering only its gravitational effect the former can analyze the explosive response of the vehicle beside the tube but the latter is more efficient and convenient in terms of calculation the dynamic response of the sft tube body under moving load is found to be similar to the vehicle load by lin et al 2019 therefore it would be more efficient to use the moving load model if only the response of the sft tube body is analyzed unlike shock waves the bubbles shrink and expand repeatedly with time which makes its load have a certain frequency fig 8 c shows the relationship between bubble load frequency and tunnel frequency it can be found that the larger the explosive amount the smaller the explosion point water depth explosion depth the higher the bubble load frequency and vice versa in the figure the frequency of the bubble load under different explosive amounts and explosion depth is less than 2 40 hz while the first order natural frequency of the sft is 0 61 hz and the second order frequency is 9 80 hz it can be seen that the tunnel has the possibility of first order resonance furthermore fig 8 c marks the first order frequency curve of the tunnel with a red line and the explosion parameters represented by the curve have the possibility of resonance the magnitude of the explosive load mainly depends on the two parameters explosive amount and the standoff distance to comprehensively consider both of them this paper introduces the scaled distance z z r w e 1 3 fig 8 d calculates the relationship curve between the scaled distance and the system maximum displacement under three kinds of explosive amount it can be found that the distribution curve of them is similar with the increase of the scaled distance they all show an inversely proportional downward trend only when the scaled distance is small the curve peak increases with the increase of explosive amount it shows that the explosive amount has a more significant impact on the system displacement when the scaled distance is small and the standoff distance has a more significant impact on the system displacement when the scaled distance is large the undex of near field will cause a massive displacement of the sft when the scaled distance is greater than 10 the impact of the undex on the sft will be greatly reduced 4 structural parameters 4 1 tether spacing and quantity this subsection mainly discusses the structural parameters to analyze the impact of tether spacing and quantity on system displacement the dynamic responses of tube vehicle and tether are calculated under two conditions tether spacing h 50 m 9 pairs of tethers and tether spacing h 100 m 4 pairs of tethers as shown in fig 9 fig 9 a shows the tube mid span displacement under two tether spacing it can be seen that the undex occurs at 10 s when the vehicle drives to the mid span the tube displacement before 10 s is mainly derived from the vehicle load working load and the tube displacement after 10 s is mainly derived from the undex load extreme load compared with the tether spacing h 50 m the tube displacement under vehicle load and undex load increases by 80 4 and 53 8 when the tether spacing doubles fig 9 b shows the vehicle displacement under two tether spacing similarly compared with the tether spacing h 50 m the vehicle displacement under vehicle load and undex load increases by 85 5 and 43 7 when the tether spacing doubles comparing with the system response under the two tether spacing it can be found increasing the tether quantity can significantly improve the vibration resistance of the sft system comparing with the system response under the two loads it can be found that the greater the load strength the weaker the tether s restraining ability fig 9 c shows the tube fourier amplitude under two kinds of tether spacing the fourier curves has two peaks the smaller peak in initial position is the tube response caused by the vehicle load and the larger is the tube response caused by the explosion load it can be found the curve shifts to the upper left after increasing the tether spacing which represents the response and period of the tube increase the tension time history curve of tether is an important parameter in the design of sft fig 9 d shows the tether tension under the two kinds of tether quantity it can be found 5 tether located in the tube mid span has the maximum tension 1467 kn when the tether quantities ns 9 and two pairs tethers 2 and 3 located near the middle of the tube has maximum tension 2062 kn and 2071 kn when the tether quantities ns 4 it can be seen that the tension of tether has increased by 41 1 furthermore when the tether quantities is 9 ns 9 the maximum tension difference between the edge tether and the mid span tether is 22 5 when the tether quantities is 4 ns 4 the maximum tension difference between the edge tether and the mid span tether is 47 6 it indicates that the tether at the tube mid span bears greater tension than other tethers and the difference between the two increases as the tether quantities decreases 4 2 effect of tube length and tia the sft tube length is one of essential design indicators to analyze the effect of the tube length on the system response the tethers spacing maintains at h 50 m the tube length selects three values for the calculation 200 500 and 1000 m fig 10 a shows the tube mid span displacement under three tube lengths it can be seen the curves under the three tube lengths are similar the mid span displacement time history curves of the tubes are similar in three cases the maximum displacements of tunnels with 200 500 and 1000 m lengths before explosion are 2 45 2 14 and 1 68 mm and the maximum displacements after explosion are 14 83 13 03 and 12 50 mm it can be observed the displacement response is the maximized when the tube length is the shortest and the displacement response is the minimized when the tube length is the longest which is because the tether quantities increases as the tube length increases and the increased tethers share the displacement of tube fig 10 b shows the fourier amplitude under three tube lengths it can be seen that the main frequency of the system decrease with the increase of the tube length and the frequency changes are very little when the tube length is more than 500 m which means the increase of the tube length will not cause great changes in the tunnel frequency and stiffness in a word the tube displacement is affected by the stiffness and tunnel span increasing the tube length will slightly increase the vibration resistance of the sft since the above parameters will not cause the directional difference of the system response only the vertical direction z direction movement of the sft tube is discussed the tether inclined angle tia is an important parameter that induce the directional difference of the sft here we will discuss the sft displacement in the z and y directions under the undex in conjunction with the tia keeping the load incident angle is 45 three tia of 30 45 and 60 are selected to calculate the displacement envelope of the tube as shown in fig 11 a it can be seen that the tia has a significant effect on the tube displacement in z vertical and y horizontal directions the displacements in the two directions are approximately equal when the tia is 45 the vertical displacement is greater than horizontal displacement when the tia is less than 45 the horizontal displacement is greater than the vertical displacement when the tia is greater than 45 which is because the tia determines the rigidity of the support system in two directions the larger the tia the greater the vertical rigidity and the smaller the horizontal rigidity for further analysis fig 11 b shows the relationship between the tia and the tube maximum displacement in the z and y directions it can be seen that the tube displacement in the z direction decreases approximately linearly with the tia increase however the displacement in the y direction shows a trend of first increasing and then decreasing which is because the displacement in the y direction is affected by the tether stiffness and tension the influence of tether tension on the tube displacement is that it causes the tube to bear additional tension in the z or y direction when the tia increases to 90 the tether is vertical the tether horizontal tension gradually disappears so the tube horizontal displacement also decreases when the tia decrease to 0 the reason for the increment in the vertical displacement is the tube is also subjected to the vehicle load in this direction generally the tether has the function of restraining movement and transferring load and the tia close to 90 can minimize the horizontal and vertical displacement of the tube when considering the vehicle load 5 conclusion to study the sft system s response to undex a vehicular tunnel explosion coupled model of sft is developed in this study combining with the parameters of the proposed sft the load and structural parameters are discussed and the following conclusions are obtained 1 through the study of the coupled effect of vehicle and explosion load it is found vehicle load has little effect on the response of sft under explosion while explosion load has a significant impact on vehicle response the vehicle displacement increases by 5 6 times after the explosion and the maximum explosion displacement occurs when the vehicle is in mid span 2 through the study of the explosion parameter it is found that the system response of the sft decreases in inverse proportion with the increase of the scaled distance the frequency of the undex bubble load is less than 2 4 hz under different explosion parameters which may cause the first order resonance of sft tube 3 through the study of the structural parameters it is found that under the same tube length increasing the tether spacing weak the sft vibration resistance and makes the mid span tethers bear relatively large tension under same tether spacing increasing the tube length reduces the structural displacement to a certain extent the tether has the function of restraining movement and transferring load the tia close to 90 can minimize the horizontal and vertical displacement of the tube 4 this study considered the relatively comprehensive undex load and established the sft far field explosion model the vehicle load was considered and the overall elastic response law of the sft was analyzed however the environmental factors such as seabed boundary wave current are simplified limiting the application of this model in complex undex environment furthermore relevant research can be carried out by combining above factors with numerical simulation and experiments declaration of competing interest the

the relationship between the structural parameters and the system response and some significant conclusions are presented keywords submerged floating tunnel underwater explosion vehicle load theoretical model coupled vibration 1 introduction the submerged floating tunnel sft is a novel type structure that spans large and deep water areas its concept was first proposed by norwegian scholars remseth et al 1999 and gradually been accepted by researchers in various countries owing to its advantages such as large crossing capacity small vertical slope flexible planning minimal outside interference and green environmental protection xiang et al 2017 currently the sft is at the stage of a feasibility study minoretti et al 2016 moan and eidem 2020 and needs to overcome several challenges before it can be applied to engineering evaluating the mechanical performance of the sft from the load and using this to guide the design and operation is a major research field of the sft as a traffic structure vehicle load is the conventional load faced by sft researches in this area include tariverdilo 2011 simplified trains to moving load sequences and studied the dynamic response of sft under the trains action by simplifying the vehicle to a single degree of freedom system lin et al 2018 2019 established a sft theoretical model and studied the vehicle tunnel coupled vibration additionally jin and kim 2020 established a tube tether vehicle coupled numerical model of sft the sft dynamic response under the coupled action of wave and vehicle is studied the undex is an extreme accidental load may occur during the operation of sft and it will pose significant damage to the sft once it occurs in the related researches some scholars studied the structure response under undex through numerical simulation and experiment for example zhang et al 2011 invested the overall damage effect of ships subject to the undex based on the abaqus li et al 2011 studied the dynamic characteristics of cylindrical shells under the shallow water explosion through the explosion test and msc dytran jin et al 2019 explored the dynamic response of sandwich structures under the undex bubble through the abaqus and explosion test other scholars studied the physical process and the load calculation of undex by combining theoretical analysis and test for example cole 1948 studied the calculation method of undex shock wave load through explosion test and theoretical analysis zamyshlyayev 1973 explored the free surface effect cavitation effect diffraction effect and other unique phenomena of undex through explosion tests geers and hunter 2002 established a undex bubble motion model and studied the load characteristics of the bubble using the potential flow theory and daa double asymptotic approximation method the above researches provide valuable experience for the undex research of sft the undex researches of sft includes a study by seo et al 2015 who simplified the sft to a beam on the elastic foundation model and calculated the dynamic response of sft tube subject to the undex shock wave hong et al 2018 and luo et al 2018 who simulated the dynamic process of the sft subject to undex with ls dyna and analyzed the effects of explosion parameters and the support system on the dynamic response yang et al 2019 established a three dimensional model of the underwater tunnel with autodyn to evaluate the damage of the underwater tunnel after the explosion besides some scholars studied the influences of concrete performance and section form of sft through a combination of explosion tests and numerical simulations kristoffersen et al 2019 t√∏mte 2015 however most of the researches mentioned above focus on numerical simulation with little theoretical research and the bubble load and the coupled effect between the sft tube and tether are not considered which has a discrepancy with the actual situation therefore if a comprehensive theoretical model considers undex loads and structure response was proposed it can provide an essential reference for the anti blast design research of sft and similar underwater structures based on the above researches this paper uses the semi empirical formula of the cole shock wave and the geers hunter bubble motion formula to consider the shock wave and bubble pulse action of undex and the retard potential formula rpf to consider the fluid structure coupled effect after the explosion besides the vehicle vibration tether vibration and tube space vibration are taken into account by establishing the vibration equations of the sft component accordingly a coupled vibration model of the sft is developed by considering the vehicular and explosion loads simultaneously finally the load parameters and structural parameters are discussed and its the impact law is revealed 2 load model and equation establishment the sft is generally composed of the tunnel tube suspended in a certain depth underwater the underwater foundations the tethers and the connection devices as shown in fig 1 2 1 explosive shock wave action considering the most unfavourable situation this paper assumes the undex occurs in the mid span of the sft the distance and angle between the explosion point and the tunnel mid span position can be represented by the initial standoff distance r i and the load incident angle Œ∏ as shown in fig 2 the shock wave load of undex can be calculated using the semi empirical formula proposed by cole 1 p m w e r k w e 1 3 r Œ± p st t p m exp t t s where p m is the

k 52 4 and Œ± 1 13 t s is the decay time of shock wave load t s 0 084 w e 1 3 w e 1 3 r 0 23 beside the time distribution the longitudinal spatial distribution of undex load along the sft also needs to be considered in fact the spatial distribution under different standoff distances has been given in eq 1 but for the calculation convenience the standoff distance r needs to be replaced by the longitudinal coordinate x the standoff distance and any point on the tube is r x r i 2 x l tb 2 2 bring it into p m we get 2 p m w e x k w e 1 3 r x Œ± it can be further processed by replacing r x in eq 2 with the initial standoff distance r i the shock wave spatial distribution function can be written as p sx 3 p m w e x k w e 1 3 r i r i r x Œ± k w e 1 3 r i Œ± r i r x Œ± p sx x r i r x Œ± r i

sx x 2 2 bubble pulse action the undex load usually includes two parts the shock wave and bubble pulsation the shock wave stage provides initial conditions for bubble generation and pulsation geers and hunter 2002 conducted deep research on this topic who simplified the undex bubbles to spherical bubbles and established a relatively completed bubble motion formula as eq 5 and fig 3 because this

transient low frequency according to the phase characteristics of the structure response the early transient high frequency response is mainly the acoustic radiation problem and the later transient low frequency response is mainly the virtual mass problem according to the two stage division hypothesis the total explosion pressure on the structure can be written as eq 10 by simplifying eq 9

structure the vehicle load is necessary to consider the tube and vehicle occur vibration interaction at the vehicle position when subject to an external load which makes them form a coupled vibration system as per lin et al 2019 without considering the vehicle horizontal displacement and the vehicle separation from the road caused by the explosion the vehicle motion equation and load formula are

tube and the tether are coupled through the tether tension and the tube and the vehicle are coupled through the vehicle load finally these components form an integral coupled vibration system for such a time varying coupled system the analytical solution cannot be solved and the runge kutta method will be used for numerical integration solve 3 calculation model and load analysis currently there is no completed sft in the world as per the design data of the proposed sft the parameters used in the following calculation are shown in table 1 won et al 2019 xiang et al 2020 3 1 model verification and analysis this subsection will verify the load and structural model of this paper fig 7 a shows the verification of the vehicle tunnel coupled model it can be seen that the calculation results of this paper and lin et al 2019 are similar the two displacement peak is 1 75 and 1 86 mm respectively and the error is within a reasonable range li and rong 2012 collected shock wave load pressure data through undex test fig 7 b shows the verification of the undex shock wave load formula it can be seen that the distribution of cole s empirical formula is similar to the test results the two pressure peaks are 14 90 and 15 07 mpa respectively besides the figure also shows the total shock wave pressure after considering the fluid solid interaction it can be seen that the total pressure on the structure is about twice of the previous one the bubble motion calculated by geers hunter model is shown in fig 7 c and d from fig 7 c it can be seen that the bubble radius increases and decreases repeatedly with time and the bubble radius has decayed to a minimum at the third pulsation therefore the first three pulsations can be taken when calculate the bubble pulsation load the maximum radius and maximum period in this paper is 0 216 m and 0 203 s the semi empirical formula of bubble radius r max j 3 38 w e h 10 3 1 3 and bubble period t j 2 11 w e 1 3 h 10 3 5 6 can be used for verification after calculation the empirical radius is 0 212 m the empirical period is 0 209 s the error is within a reasonable range fig 7 d shows the bubble migration displacement with time it can be found that the migration displacement increases slowly as the bubble expands and the displacement increases suddenly as the bubble contracts which is owning to the bubbles displace the liquid with a higher density than the internal gas also fig 7 d shows the bubble pulse pressure calculated by the bubble motion equation it can be seen that the bubble pulse pressure corresponds to its radius distribution when the bubble is in the expansion stage the pressure is negative when the bubble is in the contraction stage it will generate a tremendous positive pressure which verifies the reliability of the bubble pulse load in this paper 3 2 effect of load parameters in this subsection the load parameters are mainly discussed to analyze the coupled effect of undex and vehicle load here are four cases explosion load only moving load only explosion when the vehicle just enters the tunnel initial position and explosion when the vehicle travels to the middle of the tunnel mid span the displacement result of the tube and the vehicle is shown in fig 8 a and fig 8 b it can be seen from fig 8 a that whether exploded at the initial position or the mid span the tube displacement under the coupled action of vehicle explosion is not much different from that of only explosion compared with only the explosion action the tube displacement peak of exploded at the initial position and the mid span increased by 12 7 and 18 2 respectively it shows undex load and its loading time have little impact on tube displacement it can be seen from fig 8 b that whether exploded at the initial position or the mid span the vehicle displacement under the coupled action of the vehicle explosion is much greater than that of only vehicle compared with only vehicle action the vehicle displacement exploded at the initial position and the mid span increased by 5 35 times and 6 38 times respectively it shows the undex load and its loading time have a significant impact on vehicle displacement for the vehicle displacement under vehicle load the displacement is multiplied after explosion the maximum explosion displacement occurs when the vehicle is in mid span in addition to simplifying the vehicle to a vehicle load capable of coupled vibration with the tunnel tube it can also be reduced to a moving load by considering only its gravitational effect the former can analyze the explosive response of the vehicle beside the tube but the latter is more efficient and convenient in terms of calculation the dynamic response of the sft tube body under moving load is found to be similar to the vehicle load by lin et al 2019 therefore it would be more efficient to use the moving load model if only the response of the sft tube body is analyzed unlike shock waves the bubbles shrink and expand repeatedly with time which makes its load have a certain frequency fig 8 c shows the relationship between bubble load frequency and tunnel frequency it can be found that the larger the explosive amount the smaller the explosion point water depth explosion depth the higher the bubble load frequency and vice versa in the figure the frequency of the bubble load under different explosive amounts and explosion depth is less than 2 40 hz while the first order natural frequency of the sft is 0 61 hz and the second order frequency is 9 80 hz it can be seen that the tunnel has the possibility of first order resonance furthermore fig 8 c marks the first order frequency curve of the tunnel with a red line and the explosion parameters represented by the curve have the possibility of resonance the magnitude of the explosive load mainly depends on the two parameters explosive amount and the standoff distance to comprehensively consider both of them this paper introduces the scaled distance z z r w e 1 3 fig 8 d calculates the relationship curve between the scaled distance and the system maximum displacement under three kinds of explosive amount it can be found that the distribution curve of them is similar with the increase of the scaled distance they all show an inversely proportional downward trend only when the scaled distance is small the curve peak increases with the increase of explosive amount it shows that the explosive amount has a more significant impact on the system displacement when the scaled distance is small and the standoff distance has a more significant impact on the system displacement when the scaled distance is large the undex of near field will cause a massive displacement of the sft when the scaled distance is greater than 10 the impact of the undex on the sft will be greatly reduced 4 structural parameters 4 1 tether spacing and quantity this subsection mainly discusses the structural parameters to analyze the impact of tether spacing and quantity on system displacement the dynamic responses of tube vehicle and tether are calculated under two conditions tether spacing h 50 m 9 pairs of tethers and tether spacing h 100 m 4 pairs of tethers as shown in fig 9 fig 9 a shows the tube mid span displacement under two tether spacing it can be seen that the undex occurs at 10 s when the vehicle drives to the mid span the tube displacement before 10 s is mainly derived from the vehicle load working load and the tube displacement after 10 s is mainly derived from the undex load extreme load compared with the tether spacing h 50 m the tube displacement under vehicle load and undex load increases by 80 4 and 53 8 when the tether spacing doubles fig 9 b shows the vehicle displacement under two tether spacing similarly compared with the tether spacing h 50 m the vehicle displacement under vehicle load and undex load increases by 85 5 and 43 7 when the tether spacing doubles comparing with the system response under the two tether spacing it can be found increasing the tether quantity can significantly improve the vibration resistance of the sft system comparing with the system response under the two loads it can be found that the greater the load strength the weaker the tether s restraining ability fig 9 c shows the tube fourier amplitude under two kinds of tether spacing the fourier curves has two peaks the smaller peak in initial position is the tube response caused by the vehicle load and the larger is the tube response caused by the explosion load it can be found the curve shifts to the upper left after increasing the tether spacing which represents the response and period of the tube increase the tension time history curve of tether is an important parameter in the design of sft fig 9 d shows the tether tension under the two kinds of tether quantity it can be found 5 tether located in the tube mid span has the maximum tension 1467 kn when the tether quantities ns 9 and two pairs tethers 2 and 3 located near the middle of the tube has maximum tension 2062 kn and 2071 kn when the tether quantities ns 4 it can be seen that the tension of tether has increased by 41 1 furthermore when the tether quantities is 9 ns 9 the maximum tension difference between the edge tether and the mid span tether is 22 5 when the tether quantities is 4 ns 4 the maximum tension difference between the edge tether and the mid span tether is 47 6 it indicates that the tether at the tube mid span bears greater tension than other tethers and the difference between the two increases as the tether quantities decreases 4 2 effect of tube length and tia the sft tube length is one of essential design indicators to analyze the effect of the tube length on the system response the tethers spacing maintains at h 50 m the tube length selects three values for the calculation 200 500 and 1000 m fig 10 a shows the tube mid span displacement under three tube lengths it can be seen the curves under the three tube lengths are similar the mid span displacement time history curves of the tubes are similar in three cases the maximum displacements of tunnels with 200 500 and 1000 m lengths before explosion are 2 45 2 14 and 1 68 mm and the maximum displacements after explosion are 14 83 13 03 and 12 50 mm it can be observed the displacement response is the maximized when the tube length is the shortest and the displacement response is the minimized when the tube length is the longest which is because the tether quantities increases as the tube length increases and the increased tethers share the displacement of tube fig 10 b shows the fourier amplitude under three tube lengths it can be seen that the main frequency of the system decrease with the increase of the tube length and the frequency changes are very little when the tube length is more than 500 m which means the increase of the tube length will not cause great changes in the tunnel frequency and stiffness in a word the tube displacement is affected by the stiffness and tunnel span increasing the tube length will slightly increase the vibration resistance of the sft since the above parameters will not cause the directional difference of the system response only the vertical direction z direction movement of the sft tube is discussed the tether inclined angle tia is an important parameter that induce the directional difference of the sft here we will discuss the sft displacement in the z and y directions under the undex in conjunction with the tia keeping the load incident angle is 45 three tia of 30 45 and 60 are selected to calculate the displacement envelope of the tube as shown in fig 11 a it can be seen that the tia has a significant effect on the tube displacement in z vertical and y horizontal directions the displacements in the two directions are approximately equal when the tia is 45 the vertical displacement is greater than horizontal displacement when the tia is less than 45 the horizontal displacement is greater than the vertical displacement when the tia is greater than 45 which is because the tia determines the rigidity of the support system in two directions the larger the tia the greater the vertical rigidity and the smaller the horizontal rigidity for further analysis fig 11 b shows the relationship between the tia and the tube maximum displacement in the z and y directions it can be seen that the tube displacement in the z direction decreases approximately linearly with the tia increase however the displacement in the y direction shows a trend of first increasing and then decreasing which is because the displacement in the y direction is affected by the tether stiffness and tension the influence of tether tension on the tube displacement is that it causes the tube to bear additional tension in the z or y direction when the tia increases to 90 the tether is vertical the tether horizontal tension gradually disappears so the tube horizontal displacement also decreases when the tia decrease to 0 the reason for the increment in the vertical displacement is the tube is also subjected to the vehicle load in this direction generally the tether has the function of restraining movement and transferring load and the tia close to 90 can minimize the horizontal and vertical displacement of the tube when considering the vehicle load 5 conclusion to study the sft system s response to undex a vehicular tunnel explosion coupled model of sft is developed in this study combining with the parameters of the proposed sft the load and structural parameters are discussed and the following conclusions are obtained 1 through the study of the coupled effect of vehicle and explosion load it is found vehicle load has little effect on the response of sft under explosion while explosion load has a significant impact on vehicle response the vehicle displacement increases by 5 6 times after the explosion and the maximum explosion displacement occurs when the vehicle is in mid span 2 through the study of the explosion parameter it is found that the system response of the sft decreases in inverse proportion with the increase of the scaled distance the frequency of the undex bubble load is less than 2 4 hz under different explosion parameters which may cause the first order resonance of sft tube 3 through the study of the structural parameters it is found that under the same tube length increasing the tether spacing weak the sft vibration resistance and makes the mid span tethers bear relatively large tension under same tether spacing increasing the tube length reduces the structural displacement to a certain extent the tether has the function of restraining movement and transferring load the tia close to 90 can minimize the horizontal and vertical displacement of the tube 4 this study considered the relatively comprehensive undex load and established the sft far field explosion model the vehicle load was considered and the overall elastic response law of the sft was analyzed however the environmental factors such as seabed boundary wave current are simplified limiting the application of this model in complex undex environment furthermore relevant research can be carried out by combining above factors with numerical simulation and experiments declaration of competing interest the

20717,the configuration of outriggers has a significant influence on the wave resistance of a trimaran in this paper slender ship theory is applied to calculate the wave resistance of trimarans in order to improve the calculation accuracy nurbs non uniform rational b splines method is introduced to molding the hull surface and the relative ideal results are obtained on this basis a series of 3d color maps of interference resistance between main hull and outriggers under different speeds and different displacement ratios are given to study the influence of the outrigger layout on the interference resistance the results show that within an appropriate range there is only one valley point of interference resistance exists in each 3d color map for this reason in combination with the characteristic of linear wave resistance has analytic expression the steepest descent method can be applied to solve the problem of searching the outrigger layout with minimum wave resistance efficiently based on the above aspects this paper proposes a fast trimaran outrigger layout resistance optimization method by means of selecting an appropriate initial outrigger layout position using trimaran wave resistance formula combined with steepest descent method the minimum interference resistance layout in specific speed can be obtained efficiently the results show a good precision of the

applied in naval architecture in recent years trimaran consists of three slender hulls a main hull and two identical outriggers compared to typical mono hull ship trimaran has lower resistance ackers et al 1997 li et al 2002 and better seakeeping performance in some conditions david and holloway 2007 mcdonald et al 2013 ni et al 2011 for trimaran design the outrigger layout the longitudinal and transverse distance between main hull and outriggers is an important factor that cannot be ignored wang et al 2018 it has a critical impact on many aspects of the trimaran s performance including resistance seakeeping etc duan et al 2019 therefore reasonable design of the outrigger layout to make the lowest resistance of the trimaran has become a key step in trimaran design 1 1 previous work in terms of the trimaran outrigger layout resistance optimization problem accurate trimaran resistance prediction method is the basis of the whole optimization process trimaran has shown an obvious reduction in wave resistance compared to typical mono hull ship in some froude number ranges this is because each of its individual hull has a high length width ratio which leads to a lower wave resistance especially in high speed conditions pertaining the trimaran wave resistance calculation linear wave resistance theory is usually applied aubault and yeung 2012 due to the length width ratio of each hull is commonly high in the work of cai et al 2004 classical michell thin ship theory michell 1898 has been used in resistance calculation of trimaran the numerical results show a good agreement with the experimental results then wu et al wu et al 2005 and yu et al yu et al 2015 also give satisfied results in wave resistance prediction of trimaran by using new slender ship theory noblesse 1983 however the main hulls of the trimaran calculated in the above researches are all pink stern michell s integral is applicable to the calculation of wave resistance of ship with pink stern for the resistance calculation of trimarans with transom stern main hull the applicability of linear wave resistance theory has not been fully verified in recent years cfd method has also been applied in the prediction of total resistance of the trimaran wu et al 2011 deng et al 2019 although the cfd method has advantages in the precision of resistance calculation the viscous effect can be taken into account its low calculation efficiency makes it difficult to apply this method to the optimization calculation that requires calculate a large number of working conditions in addition experimental measurements are also used to study the resistance performance of the trimaran bertorello et al 2001 mizine et al 2004 pavkov and morabito 2014 burak et al 2020 the disadvantages of this method are also obvious i e it is time consuming and the cost is usually high in terms of the outrigger layout optimization due to the special configuration of trimaran interference resistance between main hull and outriggers will be generated in its forward motion the interference resistance is the trimaran wave resistance in calm water minus the sum of wave resistance of the main hull and two outriggers under same sailing speed however an appropriate outrigger layout according to the traveling speed may lead to a small value or even negative value of the interference resistance yang et al 2002 this concept was first proposed by wilson et al 1993 i e the trimaran wave resistance can be reduced by reasonable designing outrigger layout in order to cancel waves between main hull and outriggers in 2000 2001 yang et al 2001 has analyzed optimal outrigger layout by using 3 linear wave resistance theories and gave a series of contour maps of trimaran wave resistance in different froude numbers their work has discussed the relationship between trimaran outrigger layout and wave resistance in different froude numbers systematically in 2003 zafer studied the influence of outrigger layout on trimaran wave resistance by using three dimensional rankine source method zafer 2003 the results show that there is no specific outrigger layout that suitable for trimaran under any speed hence according to different traveling speed it calls for different outrigger layout to achieve the best wave cancellation effect in order to reduce the wave resistance of the whole trimaran in additional displacement ratio between main hull and outriggers will also influence the optimal outrigger layout position lu and pan 2004 concerning the optimization method of the trimaran outrigger layout optimization problem enumeration method is the most commonly used method to solve this problem the main idea of enumeration method is to select the optimal layout by calculating resistance of the trimaran under all outrigger layouts in a certain range this method not only has low calculation efficiency but it also may not obtain the true global optimal value because of missing the proper choices from the discrete samples hence a high efficiency optimization method is required to overcome these shortcomings 1 2 objective of this study to sum up there are still the following shortcomings in the problem of interference wave resistance optimization for trimaran outrigger layout 1 in order to make the whole optimization process efficient a fast method must be applied to calculate the trimaran wave resistance such as michell s integral however the traditional michell s integral is difficult to accurately solve the trimaran wave resistance 2 traditional optimization methods such as enumeration method have low optimization efficiency and are difficult to meet the requirements of practical engineering design hence to make up for the above deficiencies a fast optimization method for solving trimaran minimum interference resistance layout is proposed in this paper in this optimization method nurbs non uniform rational b splines method is applied to modeling the trimaran hull in order to overcome the problem that the traditional michell s integral cannot accurately calculate the wave resistance of the transom stern trimaran on this basis combining the steepest descent method this paper proposes a fast optimization method that can figure out the optimal lowest wave resistance outrigger layout position efficiently the accuracy and efficiency of the optimization method proposed in this paper are verified by practical optimize a trimaran s outrigger layout 2 outrigger layout optimization problem of lowest wave resistance trimaran and solutions 2 1 problem description as stated in section 1 the problem studied in this paper is how to quickly find the position of the outriggers that minimizes the wave resistance of the trimaran as is known to all for a trimaran sailing at a fixed speed in calm water the position of two identical outriggers will influence the wave resistance of the whole trimaran that means each set of longitudinal and transverse distance corresponds to a specific wave resistance of the trimaran hence this optimization problem can be described in mathematical form as follows 1 m i n i m i z e r a p s u b j e c t t o a m i n a a m a x a n d p m i n p p m a x where a and p represent longitudinal and transverse distance of outriggers respectively as shown in fig 1 a m i n a m a x and p m i n p m a x are the maximum value range of longitudinal and transverse distance of outriggers r a p represents the trimaran wave resistance under the outrigger layout with longitudinal and transverse distance equal to a and p respectively for such an optimization problem the usual approach is to discretize the optimization space first i e discrete processing should be carried out on the interval a m i n a m a x and p m i n p m a x in this case we obtain finite groups of a and p the problem then turns into pick one of these groups of a and p that leads to the minimum wave resistance of the trimaran 2 2 fast optimization method of lowest resistance trimaran outrigger layout in order to solve the optimization problem stated in section 2 1 efficiently we also need to possess the following conditions a reliable and efficient trimaran wave resistance solver b the law of influence of the outrigger layout on wave resistance c efficient optimization algorithm firstly for condition a whichever method is applied to solve this optimization problem a reliable and efficient trimaran wave resistance solver is necessary for fast optimization of trimaran outrigger layout the solver needs to have higher computational efficiency on the basis of a certain accuracy hence the slender ship theory combined with nurbs modelling is applied to calculate the trimaran wave resistance in this paper secondly for condition b it is a necessary process to study the law of influence of outrigger layout on trimaran wave resistance this process plays an important role in the selection of optimization algorithm for instance to solve the optimization problem by gradient method it is necessary to ensure that the optimization function has only one peak or valley value point finally for condition c this is the core section of the overall optimization process the selection of the optimization algorithm should be considered in combination with the form of solver trimaran wave resistance calculation program and the characteristics of the function to be optimized r a p in equation 1 hence due to the characteristics of wave resistance calculation method based on slender ship theory has the explicit expression and only one valley value point exist in the function to be optimized within a certain range steepest decent method is applied as the optimization algorithm in this paper to sum up the operation process of the fast optimization method of trimaran outrigger layout can be summarized as follow a determine the initial outrigger position of the trimaran to be optimized according to the optimal outrigger position of trimaran with similar hull or traveling speed b calculate the trimaran wave resistance and its derivatives to a and p under the current outrigger layout through nurbs modeling c determine the decent step length and decent path through the results solved by step b obtain the new outrigger layout d recalculate the trimaran wave resistance and its derivatives to a and p under new outrigger layout and judge whether the current layout position is the resistance valley value point if not then return to step b the operation process is also shown in fig 2 3 trimaran wave resistance calculation method 3 1 application of michells integral in trimaran wave resistance calculation for a high speed trimaran each of its individual hull is slender high length width ratio this allows the slender ship theory can be used to predict the resistance of high speed trimarans according to slender ship theory assuming the wave making velocity potential satisfy the linear free surface boundary

traveling speed l is the length at waterline t is draft it is notable that vector p and q in formula 2 as cosine and sine vector of kochin function satisfy the principle of linear superposition hence for a trimaran p p 0 p 1 p 2 and q q 0 q 1 q 2 the wave resistance formula for trimaran could be written as 3 r w r w 0 r w 1 r w 2 r w 12 r w 012 the p and q vector in the equation below are similar

from formula 3 we can find that the wave resistance of a trimaran consists of three parts resistance of each individual hull interference resistance between two outriggers and interference resistance between main hull and outriggers in terms of the problem of outrigger layout optimization the primary concern part is the interference resistance r w 12 and r w 012 in the following we will analyze the relationship between outrigger layout and interference resistance in detail through numerical calculation 3 2 verification of michells integral in trimaran wave resistance calculation in order to verify the accuracy of linear wave resistance theory in the prediction of trimaran wave resistance we take trimaran in reference suzuki and ikehata 1996 as the calculation model the main parameters of the trimaran model to be calculated are given in table 1 the hull form in reference suzuki and ikehata 1996 can be described by a function below 9 y b m 2 c o s œÄ x 2 1 z t m 4 the trimaran model is composed of a main hull and two identical outriggers that are geometrically similar to the main hull the calculating mesh on main hull and outriggers are uniform for main hull are 100 length direction 10 depth direction and for outriggers are 30 length direction 5 depth direction integral calculation in formula 5 8 are solved by trapzoidal integration method the numerical results are shown in fig 3 fig 3 shows that the results obtained in this paper have great agreement with suzuki s results which the average error are less than 6 especially for f n 0 35 the average error is less than 3 compared to suzuki s results it should be noted that the calculated trimaran model in this example is a wigley hull model the main hull and two outriggers are all pink stern hull however it may lead to a decrease in the accuracy of this method in wave resistance prediction when the main hull and outriggers of the calculation model are both transom stern in order to overcome this shortcoming nurbs modeling is adopted in this paper to improve the accuracy of wave resistance calculation 3 3 trimaran wave resistance expression combined with nurbs in section 2 the wave resistance of a trimaran with wigley hull is calculated and satisfactory results are obtained however the main hull of a trimaran is usually not a simple pink stern hull with mathematical expression for ships with transom stern the calculation results of michell s integral are usually not satisfactory this is not only because the transom stern has a large disturbance to the flow field the failure to accurately obtain f x x z is also one of the reasons hence the mathematical expression of the trimaran hull is required during the process of hull modelling in order to accurately obtain the value of f x x z at each point nurbs non uniform rational b spline is an excellent method for curve and surface modeling this method is first proposed in the doctoral thesis of versprille at present nurbs has been widely applied in many fields and has become an industry standard for the representation design and data exchange of shapes when using computers to process geometric information the characteristic of surface modeling with nurbs method is that the surface has an analytic mathematical expression the nurbs surface equation defined by parametric variables is 10 s u v i 1 n j 1 m n i p u n j p v w i j p i j i 1 n j 1 m n i p u n j p v w i j 0 u v 1 where p i j denotes the control point on the surface w i j is the weighting factor and n i p u n i q v represent the defined b spline function on u and v direction in terms of the calculation of trimaran wave resistance by nurbs modelling the calculation formula 3 8 remains the same as the method of expression of the ship hull has changed the definition of function p and q will also be changed observing the expression of p and q in formula 2 the variables x z and hull form function f x x z should be substituted by the form of parametric equation notice the change of the integration variable the expression of p and q will be transformed into 11 p i 0 1 0 1 f x u v c o s k 0 x u v Œª e k 0 z u v Œª 2 x u v u y u v v x u v v y u v u d u d v q i 0 1 0 1 f x

the parametric equation f x u v denotes the slope of tangent line in the x direction on the hull surface corresponding to the point on the central fore and aft plane 3 4 numerical results in order to verify the accuracy of the calculation of trimaran wave resistance modeled by nurbs method we compared the calculated results with the experimental data jia et al 2009 the trimaran model in the experiment is a transom stern trimaran unlike wigley hull trimaran there are no explicit expression for both main hull and outriggers of this trimaran the main parameters of the trimaran model are listed in table 2 in this paper the wave resistances coefficient under four outrigger layouts are compared the transverse distance of these four layouts is p 0 7 m and the longitudinal distance is a 0 0 m a 0 7 m a 1 0 m and a 1 3 m respectively fig 4 a d show the comparison results of wave resistance coefficient under different speed and different outrigger layout the x coordinate is froude number ranging from 0 3 to 0 8 and the y coordinate is wave resistance coefficient multiply by 10 3 the red dots represent the experimental results derived by reference jia et al 2009 the black line and blue dash line represent the numerical results of michells integral with and without nurbs modelling it can be found from fig 4 the 2 linear wave resistance calculation methods have poor accuracy for low speed conditions when f n 0 35 the wave resistance calculation results derived by this method are almost without reference however when f n 0 35 especially for 0 4 f n 0 65 the accuracy of the calculation results of michells integral with nurbs modeled has been improved significantly in the case of 0 4 f n 0 65 the average error root mean square error between the experimental results and the numerical results of nurbs michells integral is only 9 1 fig 3 a 5 5 fig 3 b 5 7 fig 3 c and 7 1 fig 3 d respectively although the calculation accuracy of wave resistance coefficient is not ideal its variation trend with froude number is quite consistent more importantly the numerical results of nurbs michells integral are very accurate for the relationship between the resistance values of trimaran with different outrigger layouts this is significant for applying this approach to trimaran outrigger layout optimization problems on the contrary the numerical results derived by traditional michells integral is far from the experimental results in terms of accuracy and trend within the range of 0 4 f n 0 65 4 influence of outrigger layouts on interference resistance of the trimaran as stated in section 1 in order to improve the efficiency of the optimization process we intend to adopt steepest decent method to perform the optimization calculation however the steepest decent method does not have the global search capability as genetic algorithm it requires the problem to be solved as a single peak or valley value problem hence the condition of the influence of outrigger layout on interference resistance will be discussed in this section it can be found from formula 3 the interference resistance consists of two parts r w 012 and r w 12 in order to study the influence of outrigger layouts on the interference resistance we now use formula 3 8 to compute the interference resistance of a trimaran and analysis the distribution law of interference resistance in different froude numbers and different displacement ratios the parameters and conditions of computational model are listed in table 3 define r i as the dimensionless interference resistance where r w is the total wave resistance of the trimaran the 3d color maps of about outrigger layouts in different conditions are shown in figs 5 7 the horizontal and longitudinal ordinate in figures represent dimensionless longitudinal clearance a l m and transverse clearance p l m of outrigger respectively the vertical ordinate represents the value of dimensionless interference resistance the outrigger layouts in the computation above are range from a l 0 75 0 in longitudinal direction and p l 0 05 0 3 in transverse direction it is obvious to find from figs 5 7 that a higher displacement ratio m o will lead to a lower interference resistance r i under any traveling speed the interference resistance are ranging from 0 45 0 35 for m o 15 0 34 0 26 for m o 20 and 0 24 0 22 for m o 30 in addition there is no specific outrigger layout that minimize the wave resistance for a trimaran at any traveling speed and any displacement ratio for different traveling speed and different displacement ratio the optimal outrigger layout position should be determined by calculation the minimum r i outrigger layout position will tend to rearward and inward with the increasing of the froud number for any displacement ratio conditions due to the restriction of practical construction the transverse clearance between main hull and outriggers cannot be infinitely small hence for high speed trimaran i e f n 0 5 the outriggers should be designed as close to main hull as possible in addition it is shown from figs 5 7 that for 0 4 f n 0 6 within a certain range there is only one valley point of interference resistance in each 3d color map this significant characteristic enables the steepest descent method can be applied to calculate the outrigger layout position with minimum value of r i 5 fast resistance optimization method for trimaran outrigger layout 5 1 application of the steepest descent method in trimaran outrigger layout optimization the steepest descent method also named the gradient descent method is a relatively simple unconstrained optimization method it is first proposed by french mathematician cauchy in 1874 this method has following advantages simple computation program small computation amount no restrictions for initial point the essence of descent method is taking negative gradient direction as the steepest descent direction to approaching the valley point taking a two dimensional function as an example f x y has only one valley point in domain d taking x 0 y 0 as initial point the gradient of function f x y at initial point f x 0 y 0 is the steepest descent direction assume optimal step size is Œ± therefore Œ± need to be solved in order to ensure that 12 f x 1 y 1 m i n f x 0 Œ± f x y 0 Œ± f y thus f x 1 y 1 can be taken as a function of Œ± and a proper value of Œ± need to be solved to minimized f x 0 Œ± f x y 0 Œ± f y as function f x y has only one valley point in domain d f x 0 Œ± f x y 0 Œ± f y must has minimum value hence the problem becomes to find the value of Œ± when f x 0 Œ± f x y 0 Œ± f y Œ± equal to zero back to the minimum interference resistance layout problem the initial position of outrigger layout needs to be determined first to find the optimal layout for the optimization of a trimaran with any hull form both main hull and outriggers the minimum interference resistance layout a 0 p 0 of a trimaran with similar hull form in geometry and similar froude number can be used as the initial position then using steepest descent method to approach the optimal layout position from a 0 p 0 the procedures in details are given below first solving the partial derivative of interference resistance with respect to longitudinal and transverse clearance a p we get r i a 0 p 0 a r i a 0 p 0 p hereinafter refer to as r a 0 r p 0 taking r a 0 r p 0 as the descent direction and assume descent step is Œ± then we can get 13 r i a 1 p 1 r i a 0 Œ± r a p 0 Œ± r p where a 1 p 1 a 0 Œ± r a p 0 Œ± r p is the new outrigger layout position after one descent step secondly taking a 1 p 1 as new initial position and repeat the procedure above till the length of Œ± r a Œ± r p less than the preset error Œµ the outrigger layout a n p n we obtained after the last calculation is taken as the final position and then stop the iteration it should be noted that the descent step above has not be solved to obtain the optimal descent step r i should be regard as the function of Œ± and obtaining derivation of r i on Œ± 14 r i a 0 Œ± r a 0 p 0 Œ± r p 0 Œ± 1 2 Œª 2 Œª 2 1 c o s k 0 p 0 Œ± r p 0 Œª Œª 2 1 2 p 0 p 2 q 0 q 2 c o s k 0 a 0 Œ± r a 0 Œª p 0 q 2 q 0 p 2 s i n k 0 a 0 Œ± r a 0 Œª p 2 2 q 2 2 d Œª 1 Œª 2 Œª 2 1 p 0 2 q 0 2 d Œª as equation 14 is a nonlinear equation about Œ± it is hard to obtain the exact solution only numerical solution can be obtained however for equation 14 it will require a large amount of computation to get the numerical solution in each descent step this is inconsistent with the concept of fast solving method in this paper hence in the method proposed in this paper the fixed descent step is adopted according to practical conditions a fixed descent step Œ± f i x can be set the value of Œ± f i x will influence the rapidity of computation and the precision of result hence in order to ensure the calculation accuracy the value of Œ± f i x should be less than the acceptable error 5 2 verification of the fast trimaran outrigger layout resistance optimization method in order to verify the fast trimaran outrigger layout resistance optimization method the model used in the reference suzuki and ikehata 1996 is taken as an example the relevant parameters of the computational model are given in table 2 for f n 0 4 and f n 0 5 the minimum interference resistance layout of the trimaran given in reference suzuki and ikehata 1996 is a l m p l m 0 34 0 17 and a l m p l m 0 34 0 10 respectively derived by enumeration method the optimization procedure can be represented by the flow chart of fig 2 in section 2 2 in order to obtain the optimal layout of the trimaran in reference suzuki and ikehata 1996 we should first take the optimal layout of a similar trimaran as the initial location this paper takes the minimum interference resistance layout position of the trimaran that used in section 4 with f n 0 4 and m o 30 as the initial position i e the optimal layout position is a l m p l m 0 31 0 16 which has been shown in fig 5 c the descent path in solving the optimal layout position is shown in fig 8 to ensure the relative error limit of optimal layout position within 0 1 of main hull length the transverse and longitudinal distance of the outrigger is set to be 1 1000 of the ship length at waterline the minimum interference resistance layout of a l m p l m 0 337 0 171 for f n 0 4 and a l m p l m 0 337 0 10 for f n 0 5 have been obtained by means of the fast resistance optimization method we can see from fig 8 a and b that for each case as there is only one valley point the decent paths are not complicated for both cases for the case of f n 0 4 fig 8 a the interference resistance of the optimal layout decreases from 2 07 to 2 13 comparing to the initial layout position for the case of fn 0 5 fig 8 b the interference resistance of the optimal layout decreases from 0 81 to 2 05 comparing to the initial layout position in terms of the calculation efficiency of enumeration method and the method proposed in this paper the fast resistance optimization method costs only 2 43 s for case 1 f n 0 4 and 5 46 s for case 2 f n 0 5 while the typical enumeration method costs 27 76 s under the same computing condition 4 intel r core tm i5 cpu 4 00 gb ram the difference of calculation time between case 1 and case 2 is mainly due to the different distances between the initial layout and the optimal layout nevertheless the computational efficiency of the fast optimization method proposed in this paper can be more than 5 times higher than that of the enumeration method for either case these results show an outstanding promotion in computational efficiency in addition under the same condition of computation the method proposed in this paper will also provide a more accurate result 6 summary linear wave resistance theory has been applied to calculated the wave resistance of a trimaran with wigley hull trimaran wave resistance formula is given out in the form of individual hull resistance and interference resistance between main hull and outriggers in order to improve the accuracy of the wave resistance of a trimaran with transom stern this paper presents a wave resistance calculation method based on nurbs modeling the accuracy of the resistance calculation method is verified by calculating a trimaran s wave resistance for the condition of 0 4 f n 0 65 the results show a satisfactory consistent with the reference s results for high speed trimaran 0 4 f n 0 6 the influence of wave resistance on outrigger layouts in different froude numbers and different displacement ratios has been given out by the form of 3d color maps it turns out that there is no specific outrigger layout that suitable for all conditions for high speed trimarans optimal outrigger layout position is around the middle back of the main hull with the increase of froude number the optimal outrigger position tends to be rearward and inward to main hull the distribution of wave resistance about outrigger layouts is not obvious for different displacement ratio an efficient resistance optimization method for trimaran outrigger layout has been proposed the method provides a fast way to search the outrigger layout with the minimum wave resistance the method has been tested by optimizing a trimaran outrigger layout the results show a huge

20717,the configuration of outriggers has a significant influence on the wave resistance of a trimaran in this paper slender ship theory is applied to calculate the wave resistance of trimarans in order to improve the calculation accuracy nurbs non uniform rational b splines method is introduced to molding the hull surface and the relative ideal results are obtained on this basis a series of 3d color maps of interference resistance between main hull and outriggers under different speeds and different displacement ratios are given to study the influence of the outrigger layout on the interference resistance the results show that within an appropriate range there is only one valley point of interference resistance exists in each 3d color map for this reason in combination with the characteristic of linear wave resistance has analytic expression the steepest descent method can be applied to solve the problem of searching the outrigger layout with minimum wave resistance efficiently based on the above aspects this paper proposes a fast trimaran outrigger layout resistance optimization method by means of selecting an appropriate initial outrigger layout position using trimaran wave resistance formula combined with steepest descent method the minimum interference resistance layout in specific speed can be obtained efficiently the results show a good precision of the

applied in naval architecture in recent years trimaran consists of three slender hulls a main hull and two identical outriggers compared to typical mono hull ship trimaran has lower resistance ackers et al 1997 li et al 2002 and better seakeeping performance in some conditions david and holloway 2007 mcdonald et al 2013 ni et al 2011 for trimaran design the outrigger layout the longitudinal and transverse distance between main hull and outriggers is an important factor that cannot be ignored wang et al 2018 it has a critical impact on many aspects of the trimaran s performance including resistance seakeeping etc duan et al 2019 therefore reasonable design of the outrigger layout to make the lowest resistance of the trimaran has become a key step in trimaran design 1 1 previous work in terms of the trimaran outrigger layout resistance optimization problem accurate trimaran resistance prediction method is the basis of the whole optimization process trimaran has shown an obvious reduction in wave resistance compared to typical mono hull ship in some froude number ranges this is because each of its individual hull has a high length width ratio which leads to a lower wave resistance especially in high speed conditions pertaining the trimaran wave resistance calculation linear wave resistance theory is usually applied aubault and yeung 2012 due to the length width ratio of each hull is commonly high in the work of cai et al 2004 classical michell thin ship theory michell 1898 has been used in resistance calculation of trimaran the numerical results show a good agreement with the experimental results then wu et al wu et al 2005 and yu et al yu et al 2015 also give satisfied results in wave resistance prediction of trimaran by using new slender ship theory noblesse 1983 however the main hulls of the trimaran calculated in the above researches are all pink stern michell s integral is applicable to the calculation of wave resistance of ship with pink stern for the resistance calculation of trimarans with transom stern main hull the applicability of linear wave resistance theory has not been fully verified in recent years cfd method has also been applied in the prediction of total resistance of the trimaran wu et al 2011 deng et al 2019 although the cfd method has advantages in the precision of resistance calculation the viscous effect can be taken into account its low calculation efficiency makes it difficult to apply this method to the optimization calculation that requires calculate a large number of working conditions in addition experimental measurements are also used to study the resistance performance of the trimaran bertorello et al 2001 mizine et al 2004 pavkov and morabito 2014 burak et al 2020 the disadvantages of this method are also obvious i e it is time consuming and the cost is usually high in terms of the outrigger layout optimization due to the special configuration of trimaran interference resistance between main hull and outriggers will be generated in its forward motion the interference resistance is the trimaran wave resistance in calm water minus the sum of wave resistance of the main hull and two outriggers under same sailing speed however an appropriate outrigger layout according to the traveling speed may lead to a small value or even negative value of the interference resistance yang et al 2002 this concept was first proposed by wilson et al 1993 i e the trimaran wave resistance can be reduced by reasonable designing outrigger layout in order to cancel waves between main hull and outriggers in 2000 2001 yang et al 2001 has analyzed optimal outrigger layout by using 3 linear wave resistance theories and gave a series of contour maps of trimaran wave resistance in different froude numbers their work has discussed the relationship between trimaran outrigger layout and wave resistance in different froude numbers systematically in 2003 zafer studied the influence of outrigger layout on trimaran wave resistance by using three dimensional rankine source method zafer 2003 the results show that there is no specific outrigger layout that suitable for trimaran under any speed hence according to different traveling speed it calls for different outrigger layout to achieve the best wave cancellation effect in order to reduce the wave resistance of the whole trimaran in additional displacement ratio between main hull and outriggers will also influence the optimal outrigger layout position lu and pan 2004 concerning the optimization method of the trimaran outrigger layout optimization problem enumeration method is the most commonly used method to solve this problem the main idea of enumeration method is to select the optimal layout by calculating resistance of the trimaran under all outrigger layouts in a certain range this method not only has low calculation efficiency but it also may not obtain the true global optimal value because of missing the proper choices from the discrete samples hence a high efficiency optimization method is required to overcome these shortcomings 1 2 objective of this study to sum up there are still the following shortcomings in the problem of interference wave resistance optimization for trimaran outrigger layout 1 in order to make the whole optimization process efficient a fast method must be applied to calculate the trimaran wave resistance such as michell s integral however the traditional michell s integral is difficult to accurately solve the trimaran wave resistance 2 traditional optimization methods such as enumeration method have low optimization efficiency and are difficult to meet the requirements of practical engineering design hence to make up for the above deficiencies a fast optimization method for solving trimaran minimum interference resistance layout is proposed in this paper in this optimization method nurbs non uniform rational b splines method is applied to modeling the trimaran hull in order to overcome the problem that the traditional michell s integral cannot accurately calculate the wave resistance of the transom stern trimaran on this basis combining the steepest descent method this paper proposes a fast optimization method that can figure out the optimal lowest wave resistance outrigger layout position efficiently the accuracy and efficiency of the optimization method proposed in this paper are verified by practical optimize a trimaran s outrigger layout 2 outrigger layout optimization problem of lowest wave resistance trimaran and solutions 2 1 problem description as stated in section 1 the problem studied in this paper is how to quickly find the position of the outriggers that minimizes the wave resistance of the trimaran as is known to all for a trimaran sailing at a fixed speed in calm water the position of two identical outriggers will influence the wave resistance of the whole trimaran that means each set of longitudinal and transverse distance corresponds to a specific wave resistance of the trimaran hence this optimization problem can be described in mathematical form as follows 1 m i n i m i z e r a p s u b j e c t t o a m i n a a m a x a n d p m i n p p m a x where a and p represent longitudinal and transverse distance of outriggers respectively as shown in fig 1 a m i n a m a x and p m i n p m a x are the maximum value range of longitudinal and transverse distance of outriggers r a p represents the trimaran wave resistance under the outrigger layout with longitudinal and transverse distance equal to a and p respectively for such an optimization problem the usual approach is to discretize the optimization space first i e discrete processing should be carried out on the interval a m i n a m a x and p m i n p m a x in this case we obtain finite groups of a and p the problem then turns into pick one of these groups of a and p that leads to the minimum wave resistance of the trimaran 2 2 fast optimization method of lowest resistance trimaran outrigger layout in order to solve the optimization problem stated in section 2 1 efficiently we also need to possess the following conditions a reliable and efficient trimaran wave resistance solver b the law of influence of the outrigger layout on wave resistance c efficient optimization algorithm firstly for condition a whichever method is applied to solve this optimization problem a reliable and efficient trimaran wave resistance solver is necessary for fast optimization of trimaran outrigger layout the solver needs to have higher computational efficiency on the basis of a certain accuracy hence the slender ship theory combined with nurbs modelling is applied to calculate the trimaran wave resistance in this paper secondly for condition b it is a necessary process to study the law of influence of outrigger layout on trimaran wave resistance this process plays an important role in the selection of optimization algorithm for instance to solve the optimization problem by gradient method it is necessary to ensure that the optimization function has only one peak or valley value point finally for condition c this is the core section of the overall optimization process the selection of the optimization algorithm should be considered in combination with the form of solver trimaran wave resistance calculation program and the characteristics of the function to be optimized r a p in equation 1 hence due to the characteristics of wave resistance calculation method based on slender ship theory has the explicit expression and only one valley value point exist in the function to be optimized within a certain range steepest decent method is applied as the optimization algorithm in this paper to sum up the operation process of the fast optimization method of trimaran outrigger layout can be summarized as follow a determine the initial outrigger position of the trimaran to be optimized according to the optimal outrigger position of trimaran with similar hull or traveling speed b calculate the trimaran wave resistance and its derivatives to a and p under the current outrigger layout through nurbs modeling c determine the decent step length and decent path through the results solved by step b obtain the new outrigger layout d recalculate the trimaran wave resistance and its derivatives to a and p under new outrigger layout and judge whether the current layout position is the resistance valley value point if not then return to step b the operation process is also shown in fig 2 3 trimaran wave resistance calculation method 3 1 application of michells integral in trimaran wave resistance calculation for a high speed trimaran each of its individual hull is slender high length width ratio this allows the slender ship theory can be used to predict the resistance of high speed trimarans according to slender ship theory assuming the wave making velocity potential satisfy the linear free surface boundary

traveling speed l is the length at waterline t is draft it is notable that vector p and q in formula 2 as cosine and sine vector of kochin function satisfy the principle of linear superposition hence for a trimaran p p 0 p 1 p 2 and q q 0 q 1 q 2 the wave resistance formula for trimaran could be written as 3 r w r w 0 r w 1 r w 2 r w 12 r w 012 the p and q vector in the equation below are similar

from formula 3 we can find that the wave resistance of a trimaran consists of three parts resistance of each individual hull interference resistance between two outriggers and interference resistance between main hull and outriggers in terms of the problem of outrigger layout optimization the primary concern part is the interference resistance r w 12 and r w 012 in the following we will analyze the relationship between outrigger layout and interference resistance in detail through numerical calculation 3 2 verification of michells integral in trimaran wave resistance calculation in order to verify the accuracy of linear wave resistance theory in the prediction of trimaran wave resistance we take trimaran in reference suzuki and ikehata 1996 as the calculation model the main parameters of the trimaran model to be calculated are given in table 1 the hull form in reference suzuki and ikehata 1996 can be described by a function below 9 y b m 2 c o s œÄ x 2 1 z t m 4 the trimaran model is composed of a main hull and two identical outriggers that are geometrically similar to the main hull the calculating mesh on main hull and outriggers are uniform for main hull are 100 length direction 10 depth direction and for outriggers are 30 length direction 5 depth direction integral calculation in formula 5 8 are solved by trapzoidal integration method the numerical results are shown in fig 3 fig 3 shows that the results obtained in this paper have great agreement with suzuki s results which the average error are less than 6 especially for f n 0 35 the average error is less than 3 compared to suzuki s results it should be noted that the calculated trimaran model in this example is a wigley hull model the main hull and two outriggers are all pink stern hull however it may lead to a decrease in the accuracy of this method in wave resistance prediction when the main hull and outriggers of the calculation model are both transom stern in order to overcome this shortcoming nurbs modeling is adopted in this paper to improve the accuracy of wave resistance calculation 3 3 trimaran wave resistance expression combined with nurbs in section 2 the wave resistance of a trimaran with wigley hull is calculated and satisfactory results are obtained however the main hull of a trimaran is usually not a simple pink stern hull with mathematical expression for ships with transom stern the calculation results of michell s integral are usually not satisfactory this is not only because the transom stern has a large disturbance to the flow field the failure to accurately obtain f x x z is also one of the reasons hence the mathematical expression of the trimaran hull is required during the process of hull modelling in order to accurately obtain the value of f x x z at each point nurbs non uniform rational b spline is an excellent method for curve and surface modeling this method is first proposed in the doctoral thesis of versprille at present nurbs has been widely applied in many fields and has become an industry standard for the representation design and data exchange of shapes when using computers to process geometric information the characteristic of surface modeling with nurbs method is that the surface has an analytic mathematical expression the nurbs surface equation defined by parametric variables is 10 s u v i 1 n j 1 m n i p u n j p v w i j p i j i 1 n j 1 m n i p u n j p v w i j 0 u v 1 where p i j denotes the control point on the surface w i j is the weighting factor and n i p u n i q v represent the defined b spline function on u and v direction in terms of the calculation of trimaran wave resistance by nurbs modelling the calculation formula 3 8 remains the same as the method of expression of the ship hull has changed the definition of function p and q will also be changed observing the expression of p and q in formula 2 the variables x z and hull form function f x x z should be substituted by the form of parametric equation notice the change of the integration variable the expression of p and q will be transformed into 11 p i 0 1 0 1 f x u v c o s k 0 x u v Œª e k 0 z u v Œª 2 x u v u y u v v x u v v y u v u d u d v q i 0 1 0 1 f x

the parametric equation f x u v denotes the slope of tangent line in the x direction on the hull surface corresponding to the point on the central fore and aft plane 3 4 numerical results in order to verify the accuracy of the calculation of trimaran wave resistance modeled by nurbs method we compared the calculated results with the experimental data jia et al 2009 the trimaran model in the experiment is a transom stern trimaran unlike wigley hull trimaran there are no explicit expression for both main hull and outriggers of this trimaran the main parameters of the trimaran model are listed in table 2 in this paper the wave resistances coefficient under four outrigger layouts are compared the transverse distance of these four layouts is p 0 7 m and the longitudinal distance is a 0 0 m a 0 7 m a 1 0 m and a 1 3 m respectively fig 4 a d show the comparison results of wave resistance coefficient under different speed and different outrigger layout the x coordinate is froude number ranging from 0 3 to 0 8 and the y coordinate is wave resistance coefficient multiply by 10 3 the red dots represent the experimental results derived by reference jia et al 2009 the black line and blue dash line represent the numerical results of michells integral with and without nurbs modelling it can be found from fig 4 the 2 linear wave resistance calculation methods have poor accuracy for low speed conditions when f n 0 35 the wave resistance calculation results derived by this method are almost without reference however when f n 0 35 especially for 0 4 f n 0 65 the accuracy of the calculation results of michells integral with nurbs modeled has been improved significantly in the case of 0 4 f n 0 65 the average error root mean square error between the experimental results and the numerical results of nurbs michells integral is only 9 1 fig 3 a 5 5 fig 3 b 5 7 fig 3 c and 7 1 fig 3 d respectively although the calculation accuracy of wave resistance coefficient is not ideal its variation trend with froude number is quite consistent more importantly the numerical results of nurbs michells integral are very accurate for the relationship between the resistance values of trimaran with different outrigger layouts this is significant for applying this approach to trimaran outrigger layout optimization problems on the contrary the numerical results derived by traditional michells integral is far from the experimental results in terms of accuracy and trend within the range of 0 4 f n 0 65 4 influence of outrigger layouts on interference resistance of the trimaran as stated in section 1 in order to improve the efficiency of the optimization process we intend to adopt steepest decent method to perform the optimization calculation however the steepest decent method does not have the global search capability as genetic algorithm it requires the problem to be solved as a single peak or valley value problem hence the condition of the influence of outrigger layout on interference resistance will be discussed in this section it can be found from formula 3 the interference resistance consists of two parts r w 012 and r w 12 in order to study the influence of outrigger layouts on the interference resistance we now use formula 3 8 to compute the interference resistance of a trimaran and analysis the distribution law of interference resistance in different froude numbers and different displacement ratios the parameters and conditions of computational model are listed in table 3 define r i as the dimensionless interference resistance where r w is the total wave resistance of the trimaran the 3d color maps of about outrigger layouts in different conditions are shown in figs 5 7 the horizontal and longitudinal ordinate in figures represent dimensionless longitudinal clearance a l m and transverse clearance p l m of outrigger respectively the vertical ordinate represents the value of dimensionless interference resistance the outrigger layouts in the computation above are range from a l 0 75 0 in longitudinal direction and p l 0 05 0 3 in transverse direction it is obvious to find from figs 5 7 that a higher displacement ratio m o will lead to a lower interference resistance r i under any traveling speed the interference resistance are ranging from 0 45 0 35 for m o 15 0 34 0 26 for m o 20 and 0 24 0 22 for m o 30 in addition there is no specific outrigger layout that minimize the wave resistance for a trimaran at any traveling speed and any displacement ratio for different traveling speed and different displacement ratio the optimal outrigger layout position should be determined by calculation the minimum r i outrigger layout position will tend to rearward and inward with the increasing of the froud number for any displacement ratio conditions due to the restriction of practical construction the transverse clearance between main hull and outriggers cannot be infinitely small hence for high speed trimaran i e f n 0 5 the outriggers should be designed as close to main hull as possible in addition it is shown from figs 5 7 that for 0 4 f n 0 6 within a certain range there is only one valley point of interference resistance in each 3d color map this significant characteristic enables the steepest descent method can be applied to calculate the outrigger layout position with minimum value of r i 5 fast resistance optimization method for trimaran outrigger layout 5 1 application of the steepest descent method in trimaran outrigger layout optimization the steepest descent method also named the gradient descent method is a relatively simple unconstrained optimization method it is first proposed by french mathematician cauchy in 1874 this method has following advantages simple computation program small computation amount no restrictions for initial point the essence of descent method is taking negative gradient direction as the steepest descent direction to approaching the valley point taking a two dimensional function as an example f x y has only one valley point in domain d taking x 0 y 0 as initial point the gradient of function f x y at initial point f x 0 y 0 is the steepest descent direction assume optimal step size is Œ± therefore Œ± need to be solved in order to ensure that 12 f x 1 y 1 m i n f x 0 Œ± f x y 0 Œ± f y thus f x 1 y 1 can be taken as a function of Œ± and a proper value of Œ± need to be solved to minimized f x 0 Œ± f x y 0 Œ± f y as function f x y has only one valley point in domain d f x 0 Œ± f x y 0 Œ± f y must has minimum value hence the problem becomes to find the value of Œ± when f x 0 Œ± f x y 0 Œ± f y Œ± equal to zero back to the minimum interference resistance layout problem the initial position of outrigger layout needs to be determined first to find the optimal layout for the optimization of a trimaran with any hull form both main hull and outriggers the minimum interference resistance layout a 0 p 0 of a trimaran with similar hull form in geometry and similar froude number can be used as the initial position then using steepest descent method to approach the optimal layout position from a 0 p 0 the procedures in details are given below first solving the partial derivative of interference resistance with respect to longitudinal and transverse clearance a p we get r i a 0 p 0 a r i a 0 p 0 p hereinafter refer to as r a 0 r p 0 taking r a 0 r p 0 as the descent direction and assume descent step is Œ± then we can get 13 r i a 1 p 1 r i a 0 Œ± r a p 0 Œ± r p where a 1 p 1 a 0 Œ± r a p 0 Œ± r p is the new outrigger layout position after one descent step secondly taking a 1 p 1 as new initial position and repeat the procedure above till the length of Œ± r a Œ± r p less than the preset error Œµ the outrigger layout a n p n we obtained after the last calculation is taken as the final position and then stop the iteration it should be noted that the descent step above has not be solved to obtain the optimal descent step r i should be regard as the function of Œ± and obtaining derivation of r i on Œ± 14 r i a 0 Œ± r a 0 p 0 Œ± r p 0 Œ± 1 2 Œª 2 Œª 2 1 c o s k 0 p 0 Œ± r p 0 Œª Œª 2 1 2 p 0 p 2 q 0 q 2 c o s k 0 a 0 Œ± r a 0 Œª p 0 q 2 q 0 p 2 s i n k 0 a 0 Œ± r a 0 Œª p 2 2 q 2 2 d Œª 1 Œª 2 Œª 2 1 p 0 2 q 0 2 d Œª as equation 14 is a nonlinear equation about Œ± it is hard to obtain the exact solution only numerical solution can be obtained however for equation 14 it will require a large amount of computation to get the numerical solution in each descent step this is inconsistent with the concept of fast solving method in this paper hence in the method proposed in this paper the fixed descent step is adopted according to practical conditions a fixed descent step Œ± f i x can be set the value of Œ± f i x will influence the rapidity of computation and the precision of result hence in order to ensure the calculation accuracy the value of Œ± f i x should be less than the acceptable error 5 2 verification of the fast trimaran outrigger layout resistance optimization method in order to verify the fast trimaran outrigger layout resistance optimization method the model used in the reference suzuki and ikehata 1996 is taken as an example the relevant parameters of the computational model are given in table 2 for f n 0 4 and f n 0 5 the minimum interference resistance layout of the trimaran given in reference suzuki and ikehata 1996 is a l m p l m 0 34 0 17 and a l m p l m 0 34 0 10 respectively derived by enumeration method the optimization procedure can be represented by the flow chart of fig 2 in section 2 2 in order to obtain the optimal layout of the trimaran in reference suzuki and ikehata 1996 we should first take the optimal layout of a similar trimaran as the initial location this paper takes the minimum interference resistance layout position of the trimaran that used in section 4 with f n 0 4 and m o 30 as the initial position i e the optimal layout position is a l m p l m 0 31 0 16 which has been shown in fig 5 c the descent path in solving the optimal layout position is shown in fig 8 to ensure the relative error limit of optimal layout position within 0 1 of main hull length the transverse and longitudinal distance of the outrigger is set to be 1 1000 of the ship length at waterline the minimum interference resistance layout of a l m p l m 0 337 0 171 for f n 0 4 and a l m p l m 0 337 0 10 for f n 0 5 have been obtained by means of the fast resistance optimization method we can see from fig 8 a and b that for each case as there is only one valley point the decent paths are not complicated for both cases for the case of f n 0 4 fig 8 a the interference resistance of the optimal layout decreases from 2 07 to 2 13 comparing to the initial layout position for the case of fn 0 5 fig 8 b the interference resistance of the optimal layout decreases from 0 81 to 2 05 comparing to the initial layout position in terms of the calculation efficiency of enumeration method and the method proposed in this paper the fast resistance optimization method costs only 2 43 s for case 1 f n 0 4 and 5 46 s for case 2 f n 0 5 while the typical enumeration method costs 27 76 s under the same computing condition 4 intel r core tm i5 cpu 4 00 gb ram the difference of calculation time between case 1 and case 2 is mainly due to the different distances between the initial layout and the optimal layout nevertheless the computational efficiency of the fast optimization method proposed in this paper can be more than 5 times higher than that of the enumeration method for either case these results show an outstanding promotion in computational efficiency in addition under the same condition of computation the method proposed in this paper will also provide a more accurate result 6 summary linear wave resistance theory has been applied to calculated the wave resistance of a trimaran with wigley hull trimaran wave resistance formula is given out in the form of individual hull resistance and interference resistance between main hull and outriggers in order to improve the accuracy of the wave resistance of a trimaran with transom stern this paper presents a wave resistance calculation method based on nurbs modeling the accuracy of the resistance calculation method is verified by calculating a trimaran s wave resistance for the condition of 0 4 f n 0 65 the results show a satisfactory consistent with the reference s results for high speed trimaran 0 4 f n 0 6 the influence of wave resistance on outrigger layouts in different froude numbers and different displacement ratios has been given out by the form of 3d color maps it turns out that there is no specific outrigger layout that suitable for all conditions for high speed trimarans optimal outrigger layout position is around the middle back of the main hull with the increase of froude number the optimal outrigger position tends to be rearward and inward to main hull the distribution of wave resistance about outrigger layouts is not obvious for different displacement ratio an efficient resistance optimization method for trimaran outrigger layout has been proposed the method provides a fast way to search the outrigger layout with the minimum wave resistance the method has been tested by optimizing a trimaran outrigger layout the results show a huge enhance of computational efficiency in optimal outrigger layout calculation compared to typical enumeration method credit authorship contribution statement s m wang writing original draft designing

20718,blade pitch control bpc is an indispensable part of a variable speed wind turbine which maintains a stable power output by adjusting the blade pitch angle to adapt to the changing inflow speed introduced by the platform pitching motion ppm an integrated aeroelastic servo transmission system of a floating offshore wind turbine fowt is established and validated comparing with existing models our model considers the effect of the bpc on the fowt apart from the dynamic characteristic of the drivetrain and the aeroelastic coupling of the blade firstly dynamic behaviours of the fowt under different tip speed ratios are compared then the performance of fowt with and without the bpc influence is compared followed by a dynamic analysis of the fowt under a varying platform pitching amplitude results show that the tip speed ratio slightly alters the fowt performance under the ppm considering the effect of the bpc the fluctuation of the generator power reduce but the aerodynamic

renewable energy laboratory ppm platform pitching motion rbm rigid body motion 1 introduction with the development of science and technology wind energy is already playing a role as a mainstream source of electricity veers et al 2019 the onshore wind energy is widely developed since it is cost effective however onshore wind turbines are usually accompanied with noise and visual impact on the contrary offshore wind energy does not suffer these disadvantages and has a higher average inflow speed and low wind turbulence bahaj et al 2020 hu and he 2017 in 2019 the average rated capacity of offshore turbines installed was 7 8 mw 1 mw larger than that in 2018 a report by the european wind energy association ewea 2020 floating offshore wind turbines fowts normally are equipped with long blades and high tower with the increase of the size of the modern wind turbine the blade flexibility increases simultaneously which has a significant impact on blade aerodynamic loads li et al 2020a chen et al 2018 rezaei et al 2018 the high tower amplifies the influence of platform motions on the relative inflow speed of the blade wen et al 2019 especially for the platform pitching motion ppm lee and lee 2019 due to the complexity of the maintenance and repair process of wind turbines the transmission system of wind turbines usually has a long downtime which increases the operation cost of wind farms igba et al 2015 the control system of a wind turbine including a generator torque control and a blade pitch control bpc dominates the wind turbine operating with high efficiency and low power fluctuation menezes et al 2018 the operating condition of a wind turbine may be different considering the influence of the control system especially for the bpc therefore the dynamic performance analyses of the transmission system with the bpc in ppm are necessary the influence of the ppm on wind turbine aerodynamic characteristics has been studied by numerical researchers wen et al 2018 adopted a free vortex method to analyse the power performance of a fowt at the rated wind speed and a reduced frequency was proposed to integrate the effects of the platform pitch amplitude and frequency the wind shear effects induced by the ppm were introduced in wen et al 2019 which indicated that the ppm will introduce significant fluctuations to the aerodynamic loads based on the coupling of a nonlinear vortex lattice method and vortex particle method lee et al lee and lee 2019 imposed the translational surge sway and heave and rotational roll pitch and yaw motions on the wind turbine basement and shown that only the platform pitching and surging motions have significant influence on the aerodynamic thrust and power output of the wind turbine jeon et al 2014 adopted a vortex lattice method to analyse the unsteady aerodynamics of a fowt in ppm they pointed out that a turbulent wake state will appear at a low speed inflow condition in shen et al 2018 a lifting surface method with a free wake model was developed and the aerodynamic characteristics of the national renewable energy laboratory nrel 5 mw wind turbine was studied in fang et al 2020 the computational fluid dynamics cfd method with an improved delayed detached eddy simulation is utilized for investigating the aerodynamics of a fowt under the harmonic pitching motion with different periods and amplitudes the results showed that the aerodynamic performances of the fowt were sensitive to these parameters and the rotor power increased under the periodic pitching motion based on the cfd a model for coupling the rotor motion and the ppm is proposed by wu et al wu and nguyen 2017 similarly liu et al 2016 also adopted an open source cfd solver to investigate the variations of the aerodynamic thrust and torque under the platform surging heaving and pitching motions based on the cfd solver the aerodynamic behaviours of the nrel 5 mw wind turbine were investigated under the platform pitching and surging motions by lienard et al 2020 which indicated that the platform pitching and surging motions all have remarkable impacts on the average aerodynamic power than the average aerodynamic thrust a coupled aero hydrodynamic simulation was presented in huang et al huang and wan 2019 based on the cfd method with an unsteady actuator line model the rotor power thrust and relative wind velocity were analyzed and it is reported that the aerodynamic loads and platform motions influenced each other using the helicopter multi block flow solver leble et al leble and barakos 2017 investigated a 10 mw wind turbine performance under the platform pitching and yawing motions and results showed that the vortex ring state appears under the pitching motion with a special amplitude and period besides the platform pitching motion leads to more significant changes in the thrust and power tran et al tran et al 2014 tran and kim 2015a 2015b carried out a series of investigations about the effects of the ppm on the aerodynamic performances and many valuable results have been obtained a cfd method incorporating the rigid body motion and overset grid techniques was presented in tran et al 2014 it pointed out that the ppm will induce a drastic change of the unsteady aerodynamic load in tran et al tran and kim 2015a an unsteady cfd method based on the dynamic mesh technique unsteady blade element momentum bem with the direct local relative velocity approach the bem with an equivalent average velocity approach were presented the result showed that the unsteady aerodynamic loads induced by platform motions were sensitive to the variations of the ppm amplitude and ppm frequency similarly in tran et al tran and kim 2015b the unsteady aerodynamic thrust and power coefficients are calculated with experiencing platform pitching and yawing motions the result showed that under the same oscillating conditions maximum variation effects for the thrust and power coefficients caused by the ppm was more sensitive than that by the platform yawing motion modern fowt blades are featured with large scale and distinct flexibility coupling the free vortex wake method and a linearized beam theory an aeroelastic model was established by rodriguez et al rodriguez and jaworski 2017 in which the stability of tip vortices shed from different rotors were studied their aeroelastic model only take into account the flap wise deformation this assumption may not be applicable for wind blades with large flexibility this is because the blade torsional deformation has a significant effect on the aerodynamic loads li et al 2020a chen et al 2018 considering the elastic behaviour of the blades kim et al kim and kwon 2019 investigated the aerodynamic performance and aeroelastic behaviour by coupling the bem theory and euler bernoulli beam theory the platform motions of six degrees of freedom dof are involved it is observed that loads induced by the platform pitching and surging motions had significant influence on the flap wise and torsional deformations of the blades however the euler bernoulli beam theory has a limitation in considering the effects of the large deformation and blade stress stiffening of larger rotational blades the control system is another essential part of the wind turbine which dominates the whole wind turbine operation ignoring deformations of blades aliabadi et al karimianaliabadi and rasekh 2020 analyzed the performance of a fowt under the ppm with the bpc in their research the unsteady aerodynamic loads were obtained by the unsteady bem with the dynamic wake and dynamic stall models it was reported that the mean power coefficient increased when the tip speed ratio is less than 7 and this trend was reverse with high tip speed ratios according to the above literature reviews and the best of our knowledge many researchers pay attention to the aerodynamic performance of fowts under platform motions however the dynamic characteristic of the drive train and the variation of non torque loads on the hub are seldom involved the elastic deformations of blades are also ignored in the reported literature moreover the effects of bpc is usually ignored in traditional studies however some researchers point out that the control system should be involved in the analysis since it plays an important role in the wind turbine system wen et al 2019 tran and kim 2015a to fill the above motioned literature gaps and to furtherly explore the effects of the ppm on fowt the paper mainly focuses on the two major aspects 1 a more integrated wind turbine transmission system is established and validated in which the aeroelastic coupling of the blade dynamic characteristics of the gearbox and effects of the bpc are considered 2 considering the bpc the dynamic behaviours of the fowt under the ppm are analyzed in detail dynamic behaviour analysis mainly includes generator power non torque loads on the hub aerodynamic and aeroelastic characteristics of a flexible wind turbine blade dynamic responses of the drive train the remainder of the paper is summarized as follows description of the ppm is first presented in section 2 1 then the modelling and validation of the fowt transmission system are given in sections 2 2 and 2 3 respectively in section 3 a detailed analysis and discussion on the dynamic characteristics of the fowt transmission system are provided conclusions are summarized and presented in section 4 2 modelling and validation in this section the description of the ppm is presented at the beginning to determine the relative wind speed of the local blade then the modelling process of the fowt transmission system proposed by the previous research li et al 2020b is briefly introduced and a bpc strategy is added to the transmission system at the end of this section model verifications are presented 2 1 description of the platform pitching motion the nrel 5 mw wind turbine proposed by jonkman et al 2009 is chosen as the analysis object to conduct the whole numerical simulations this wind turbine is representative of the modern fowt it has been extensively studied making great contribution to the existing literature the operating condition and main properties of the nrel 5 mw baseline wind turbine are shown in table 1 the stiffness of the tower is relatively higher than the blades thus platform motions of the fowt are normally regarded as rigid motions with six dof heave sway surge yaw pitch and roll as shown in fig 1 a oxyz is the global wind turbine coordinate and oxyz is the local rotor plane coordinate Œ∏ wing is the azimuth angle between the y axial and blade v 0 is the free stream velocity as reported by prior researches platform surging and pitching have obvious effects on variations of the aerodynamic power and thrust lee and lee 2019 ppm is more complex than the platform surging motion so only the pitching motion is analyzed to focus on the influence of the ppm some unsteady effects such as wind shear tower shadow and wind turbulence et al are all excluded and only the ppm is considered as suggested by previous studies the ppm is set to be a sine function wen et al 2019 lee and lee 2019 lienard et al 2020 tran and kim 2015a 1 Œ∏ pp a pitch sin 2 œÄ f pitch t œï 0 where Œ∏ pp and t are the platform pitch angle and the time respectively a pitch and f pitch are the amplitude and frequency respectively initial phase œï 0 is assumed as 0 to meet the actual operating environment a pitch 0 4 and f pitch 0 hz 0 2 hz wen et al 2018 without loss of generality f pitch is assumed as 0 1 hz the blade movement introduced by the ppm has an additional contribution to the relative speed of the local blade element as a result a linear velocity variation on the rotor plane appears the relative speed of an arbitrary local blade element q i e v rel induced by the ppm can be calculated as 2 v rel v 0 v p v 0 œâ p i t c h h y q v 0 2 œÄ f pitch a pitch cos 2 œÄ f pitch t œï 0 h y q where v p is the additional velocity induced by the ppm h is the distance between the hub to the rotating center of the ppm œâ pitch is the angular velocity of the ppm y q is the position of the blade element in the y direction in oxyz for the rigid blade it can be calculated as 3 y q r cos Œ∏ wing r cos 2 œÄ f r o t o r t œï wing where f rotor is the rotational frequency of the rotor plane œï wing is the initial azimuth angle of the blade in actual condition the y q should be determined by the deformed blade as an example the effect of ppm on the relative velocity of the local blade element q at the rated operating condition v 0 11 4 m s and the rotational speed of the rotor plane is equated to 12 1 r min is given as follows platform pitching conditions are assumed as a pitch 1 and f pitch 0 1 hz respectively to simplify the analysis the blade is assumed to be rigid here along the blade the position of q changes from the hub r r 0 to the blade tip r r 1 0 r is the radial position of q and r is the blade length the relative wind velocities of blade 1 induced by the ppm at r r 0 0 5 and 1 0 are shown in fig 2 where t is the motion period of the ppm without loss of generality the initial azimuth angle of blade 1 is set as 0 it can be found that the fluctuation of v rel at the blade tip is more complex than that of the blade root due to the coupling of the ppm and the blade rotation the corresponding frequency spectrums of v rel at different locations are shown in fig 2d we can find that only the f pitch is included at the blade root this is because the v rel at the blade root y q 0 all the time is only determined by the ppm see eq 2 as the blade element gets away from the hub the effect of the blade rotation enhances and the amplitude of the coupling frequencies f rotor f pitch and f rotor f pitch increases 2 2 modelling of the fowt transmission system in this section an integrated wind turbine transmission system see fig 3 a of the nrel 5 mw wind turbine is established in which three blades with a precone angle Œ∏ con are fixed with the hub i e main shaft and a conventional three point suspension configuration is adopted to support the gearbox the integrated modelling and analysis processes are shown in fig 3b the aerodynamic model and flexible blade model constitute the aeroelastic model the integrated transmission system model are constructed by the aeroelastic model and drivetrain model according to the variation of the generator speed œâ gen blade pitch controller adjusts the blade pitch angle Œ∏ pitch a generated Œ± time integration algorithm with the variable time step size is adopted to conduct the whole analysis process the blade aeroelastic model gear drivetrain model and blade pitch controller are coupled with each other except for the blade pitch controller the detailed modelling process of the fowt transmission system has been described in the previous research li et al 2020b therefore only the main principle of the transmission system is briefly introduced as shown in fig 3a the gear drivetrain includes two low speed helical planetary gear stages and one helical parallel shaft gear stage taking the effects of the flexibility shear deformation and gyroscopic moment into consideration the gear shafts are simulated by the timoshenko beam stringer 2008 the gear meshing is replaced as a linear spring in the perpendicular direction of teeth contact face with the corresponding helix angle Œ≤ ij see fig 4 considering the effect of gear s lateral torsional axial swing coupling the gears are all simulated as the lumped masses with six dof r s r p and r r are the base circle radius of the sun gear planet gear and ring œà ij is the angle between the positive y axis and the meshing plane based on lagrange s theory the motion equation of the corresponding gear pair ij can be obtained 4 m i j x i j c i j x i j k i j x i j f i j where m ij c ij and x ij are the mass matrix damping matrix and displacement vector of the gear pair ij respectively the detailed expressions of them can be found in ref wang et al 2017 li et al 2020c the bearing supporting is modelled as a linear spring a rigid region model is established to link the elastic supporting of the carrier and planet gears finally the mass stiffness and damping matrices of gears and shafts are all assembled to produce the overall gear drivetrain model based on the finite element method the aeroelastic blade model including the blade structural model and aerodynamic model are coupled using a loose coupling approach see fig 5 at every time step the blade state including the blade deformations blade positions and blade velocities is delivered to the aerodynamic model to determine the aerodynamic loads including the axial force f n tangential force f t and torsion moment m Œ∏ on the contrary these aerodynamic loads are applied to the beam nodes as time varying external forces to obtain the blade dynamic responses the detailed coupling process can be found in previous research li et al 2020a to balance the calculation accuracy and efficiency the blade structural model is structured by the geometrically exact beam theory gebt li et al 2020a bauchau 2010 in this beam model the effects of the blade large deformation blade stress stiffening and blade centrifugal coriolis force all can be included moreover the element length at both ends of the blade is shorter than that in the middle to increase the calculation efficiency based on the displacement field description and hamilton principle the governing equation of the gebt beam can be obtained then the beam model is discretized by using the finite element method to get the linear governing equation finally considering the coupling of the blade rotation and ppm the multiple motion period of pitching motion should be calculated as shown in fig 2 thus calculation efficiency should be considered emphatically bem which is widely used in industrial practice is adopted to calculate aerodynamic loads it has the highest computational efficiency and has been adopted to analyse the aerodynamic characteristics of fowt under the platform motions successfully tran and kim 2015a kim and kwon 2019 karimianaliabadi and rasekh 2020 de vaal et al 2014 as shown in fig 5 v blade is the blade element velocity vector including the blade elastic vibration and the additional velocity induced by the ppm w is the induced velocity vector the dynamic wake model of √∏ye is used considering the time delay of the wake to go from one equilibrium state to another hansen 2015 the inflow angle œÜ between the relative velocity vector v rel and the rotor plane is composed of the angle of attack aoa Œ± e section initial twist angle Œ∏ twist blade pitch angle Œ∏ pitch and blade torsional deformed angle Œ∏ deformed at this section therefore the aoa can be calculated as Œ± e œÜ Œ∏ total arctan v rel ax v rel tan Œ∏ twist Œ∏ pitch Œ∏ deformed where 5 v rel t a n v rel ax v 0 v 0 ax v blade x 2 v blade y 2 v blade z w t a n w ax where the superscripts ax and tan denote the axial and tangential directions about the blade section respectively see fig 5 then the aerodynamic loads can be determined according to the airfoil characteristic provided by jonkman et al 2009 due to the ppm the wind turbine will operate in a tilted incoming inflow which causes a skew of wake and leads to a variation of induced velocity along with the azimuth angle therefore a yaw model describing the distribution of the induced velocity presented by hasen hansen 2015 is adopted to enhance the calculation accuracy the hub loss tip loss glauert s corrections and snel s dynamic stall model are also added to this study hansen 2015 khan 2018 to maintain the rated generator power the blade pitch angle Œ∏ pitch increases as wind speed gets larger this is because the aoa decreases when Œ∏ pitch increases see eq 5 which reduces the energy capture from the wind in this study the baseline bpc provided by jonkman et al 2009 is adopted according to the wind speed and the generator speed œâ gen the blade pitch controller give an appropriate blade pitch angle Œ∏ pitch to the pitch actuators the Œ∏ pitch is calculated using a proportional integral pi control on the rotation speed error between the rated generator speed œâ gen and filtered generator speed œâ rated 6 Œ∏ pitch t k p e r r t k i 0 t e r r œÑ d œÑ e r r t œâ gen œâ rated where k p and k i are the proportional coefficient and the integral coefficient respectively they are all determined by the wind turbine characteristic and the corresponding operating condition moreover the blade pitch angle is limited between 0 and 90 according to the blade aerodynamic properties 2 3 verification and validation the aeroelastic model and the gearbox model have been validated in the previous research li et al 2020b in this section two cases are designed to check whether the proposed model has the ability to provide reliable and accurate dynamic analyses under the blade pitch angle variation and platform pitching motion first variations of the Œ∏ pitch under different wind speeds obtained from the presented model are compared with the results presented in the ref jonkman et al 2009 see fig 6 to validate that the presented model has the capability to handle the variation of Œ∏ pitch it can be found that they have the same varying tendency above the rated wind speed however the Œ∏ pitch obtained from the present model is less than that calculated by fast which is because the torsional deformation is included in our blade model but it is ignored in fast s blade model nwtc 2013 the torsional deformation just makes up for the gap of the Œ∏ pitch between the two models see fig 5 similar phenomenon is also found in ref chen et al 2018 but the authors did not comment on it according to the above descriptions the calculation results of the proposed model are reliable to illustrate the proposed model can capture the time varying aerodynamic characteristics under the ppm the aerodynamic power and thrust of different methods are compared in fig 7 the simulation results are obtained from tran et al 2014 and the ppm states are a pitch 4 and f pitch 0 1 hz the mrf rbm and gdw are the multiple reference frames approach rigid body motion approach and generalized dynamic wake model respectively it should be noted that the platform motion coordinate and initial position in ref tran et al 2014 are different from this study thus in this validation case the proposed model is re established in the same coordinate and ppm as the ref tran et al 2014 as shown in fig 7 it can be found that the results of the presented model are in good agreement with those of other methods which shows that the presented model is reliable with the ppm based on the above validation and discussion it can be concluded that the proposed model has the ability to provide reliable and accurate dynamic analyses under the Œ∏ pitch variation and ppm in the following sections we will use the proposed model to analyse the dynamic characteristics of the wind turbine transmission system under the ppm with bpc 3 results and discussion in this section the dynamic behaviours of the nrel 5 mw wind turbine under the ppm are simulated and discussed conventionally bpc only works above the rated wind speed thus performance analyses of the fowt under the different tip speed ratios are presented firstly then dynamic analyzed with and without the bpc are compared in section 3 2 in the end the influence of the platform pitching amplitude is analyzed in section 3 3 3 1 influence of the tip speed ratio many researchers mainly pay attention to the blade aerodynamic characteristics including the aerodynamic power but the output power of a wind turbine is generator power not the aerodynamic power the aerodynamic power and generator power are calculated as 7 p aero t aero œâ rotor p gen t gen œâ gen where p aero and p gen are the aerodynamic power and generator power respectively t aero and t gen are the aerodynamic torque and generator torque respectively in actuality t gen is fixed when wind speed exceeds the rated wind speed with the baseline control strategy therefore the fluctuation of p gen is mainly influenced by the generator rotation œâ gen however for the p aero calculation the rotation speed of the blade rotor plane œâ rotor is normally assumed as fixed t aero changes immediately under the ppm but the variation of œâ gen is determined by the t aero t gen and the inertia of the whole transmission system j sys including the rotor plane and the drivetrain 8 Œ¥ œâ gen Œ± gen Œ¥ t Œ± gen t aero i s y s t gen j s y s where Œ± gen is the acceleration of the generator shaft and i sys is the gearbox transmission ratio modern wind turbines are normally equipped with long blades which means the transmission system has large inertia thus the fluctuation range of the œâ gen is relatively small in other words though the ppm has significant influence on the aerodynamic power this effect on the generator power is weakened due to the large inertia of the transmission system p aero and p gen under the ppm a pitch 2 and f pitch 0 1 hz with the v 0 12 m s tip speed ratio Œª 6 65 are compared in fig 8 a according to the above analyses it can be found that the fluctuation of the p aero is larger than that of the p gen moreover there is a delay between the maximum of the p aero and p gen when t t 1 the p aero reaches the maximum which is consistent with the relative wind speed but the p gen reaches the maximum when t t t 3 this is because the equivalent aerodynamic torque t aero t aero i s y s is large than the t gen between the t 2 and t 3 see fig 8b which increases the œâ gen continuously the large inertia of the wind turbine transmission system has a strong ability to store energy which stores energy from t 2 to t 3 and releases energy from t 1 to t 2 to make up the reduction of wind energy the generator power is selected as the analysis object in the following section since it is the actual output power of a wind turbine the generator power p gen aerodynamic thrust f thrust tilt moment on the hub m tilt and yaw moment on the hub m yaw under the ppm a pitch 2 and f pitch 0 1 hz with different tip speed ratios Œª 6 65 5 70 4 99 and 4 43 are shown in fig 9 it can be found that the fluctuation amplitude of p gen m tilt and m yaw under different tip speed ratios are almost the same the little difference between them is mainly caused by the difference in blade pitch angles which changes under the different wind speed to maintain generator power see fig 6 blade section stiffness changes along with the variation of the blade pitch angle thus the blade aeroelastic characteristics behaves differently for diverse tip speed ratios as shown in fig 9b aerodynamic thrusts under different tip speed ratios are different but this difference is just limited to the mean of f thrust without the platform motions this phenomenon has also be observed in ref yu and kwon 2013 therefore the difference is not caused by the ppm the oscillation amplitudes under the different tip speed ratios 1 7e5 1 65e5 1 6e5 and 1 5e5 for 12 m s to 18 m s are close based on the above analyses it can be conclude that the ppm almost has the same effects on the aerodynamic characteristics of the wind turbine under different tip speed ratios 3 2 comparison between with and without blade pitch control because the effects of the ppm are not sensitive to the wind speed as analyzed in section 3 1 a constant tip speed ratio Œª 6 14 i e v 0 13 m s is adopted to compare the dynamic characteristic of the transmission system under the ppm with and without bpc in this section the ppm is set as a pitch 2 and f pitch 0 1 hz two cases are designed to analyse the effect of the bpc case 1 nrel 5 mw wind turbine with bpc case 2 nrel 5 mw wind turbine without bpc Œ∏ pitch p gen f thrust and m tilt are compared in fig 10 for cases with the bpc considered or not it can be found that the Œ∏ pitch reduces to the minimum when t t 0 5 and reaches the maximum when t t 1 0 see fig 10a this is because the additional wind speed induced by the ppm is smallest when t t 0 5 and thus a larger aoa of the blade is required at this moment to capture more energy from the wind meanwhile a larger aoa means that the Œ∏ pitch should be reduced as shown in eq 5 as shown in fig 10b the fluctuation of the p gen is apparently reduced when bpc is considered therefore bpc improves the power output obviously under the ppm besides the large inertia of the transmission system generates an apparent phase lag in the power output the opposite phase also occurs in the thrust response see fig 10c but this phenomenon mainly is caused by the variation of the Œ∏ pitch the aerodynamic thrust considering the bpc tends to enhance the ppm introducing negative damping to the platform motion and the negative damping may deteriorate the stability of the platform therefore the effects of bpc should be considered comprehensively for the designer of the bpc strategy as shown in fig 10d there are little differences in the tilt moment between the two cases similar phenomena are also observed in other non torque loads such as yaw moment aerodynamic loads in x direction and y direction therefore we can conclude that the collective bpc cannot mitigate the non torque loads induced by the ppm aoa variations and corresponding frequency spectrums with and without the bpc under the ppm at r r 0 3 and r r 1 0 are compared in fig 11 from fig 11a and c we can find that the fluctuation of aoa at r r 0 3 with the bpc is smaller than that without bpc but the aoa at r r 1 0 with the bpc fluctuates distinctly this is because the aerodynamic torque is accumulated by the discrete tangential force f t and dominated by the f t in the middle part see fig 12 a therefore a stable aerodynamic torque requires that f t in the middle part fluctuates little which means that the aoa in the middle part should be as stable as possible however airfoil property changes along the blade thus the aoa at the blade tip increases due to the adjustment of the blade pitch angle this has significant influence on the aerodynamic thrust see fig 10c owing to the thrust are dominated by the discrete f n around the blade tip see fig 12b ignoring the effect of the bpc the frequency components of the spectrum of the aoa are consistent with that of the blade relative wind speed here the f rotor0 and f rotor1 are the rotation frequency of the rotor plane with and without the bpc respectively f rotor0 is larger than f rotor1 because the bpc can reduce the fluctuation of the rotation speed considering the effect of the bpc the frequency components of the spectrum of the aoa are dominated by the f pitch with and without the bpc the radial displacements and corresponding frequency spectrums of planet 1 in the planetary gear stages 1 and 2 u 11 and u 21 respectively are compared in fig 13 f c21 and f c20 are the rotation frequency of carrier 2 with and without the bpc the rotation frequency of carrier 1 is equated to the rotation frequency of the rotor plane for u 11 and u 21 the oscillation amplitudes with and without the bpc are close which is because they are mainly influenced by the non torque loads induced by the ppm however the bpc has little effect on the non torque loads see fig 10d considering the effects of the bpc the frequency components of the spectrum of u 11 and u 21 are mainly focused on the f rotor1 f pitch and f rotor1 f pitch however the sidebands f rotor0 nf pitch and f c20 nf pitch n 1 2 3 of u 11 and u 21 are noticeable under the non control case bearing forces of the main shaft bearing with and without the bpc in the x direction and y direction are shown in fig 14 the bpc slightly alters the non torque loads on the hub and the bearing forces of the main shaft bearing are mainly influenced by these non torque loads therefore there are little differences in the bearing forces between the two simulation cases the bearing loads are time varying which accelerates the bearing fatigue therefore a more superior bpc strategy should be adopted to reduce the non torque loads introduced by the platform motions such as the individual bpc 3 3 influence of the pitch amplitude as shown in eq 2 additional relative wind speed induced by the ppm is closely related to the distance from the pitch center to the hub h the amplitude and frequency of the ppm a pitch and f pitch in this section only the effects of the a pitch are analyzed in detail this is because the variations of h and f pitch all can change the actual motion amplitude to meet the actual operating condition that a fowt may experience the amplitude variation of the ppm is set as 0 1 2 3 4 the other operating environment is same as section 3 2 i e f pitch 0 1 hz v 0 13 m s and h 90 m Œ∏ pitch p gen f thrust and m tilt under the different pitch amplitudes are compared in fig 15 along with the increase of the pitch amplitude the variation of the relative wind encountered by the blade augments it leads to the Œ∏ pitch has been in a significant fluctuation see fig 15a the Œ∏ pitch changes as a sine function when the pitch amplitude is less than 2 however there exists a moment such as t 4 t 5 for a pitch 4 that the Œ∏ pitch 0 all the time under a pitch 3 and 4 this is mainly caused by two reasons 1 the platform pitching amplitude is too large which leads to an obvious reduction of the blade relative wind speed at around t t 0 5 even the blade pitch angle equates to 0 enough aerodynamic torque cannot be provided by the rotor plane to make the rotor speed reaches the rated speed as soon as possible 2 large inertia of the transmission system is another import affecting factor as shown in eq 8 the large inertia of the transmission system makes the rotor speed is insensitive to the aerodynamic torque therefore the platform pitching amplitude and large inertia of the transmission system determine the duration of the Œ∏ pitch 0 together due to the limitation of the bpc the fluctuation of the power output augments with the increase of the a pitch see fig 15b there exists an obvious reduction of the p aero between t 4 and t 5 during this period t 4 t 5 a single bpc is ineffective and a combined controller incorporating the blade pitch controller and generator torque controller is expected as shown in fig 15c the aerodynamic thrusts change rapidly owing to the variation of the Œ∏ pitch along with the increase of the a pitch the tilt moment increases fig 15d noting that the collective blade pitch variation has little impact on the non torque loads as analyzed in section 3 2 the shapes of the m tilt under different pitch amplitudes are similar and only determined by the ppm frequency spectrums of the aoa at the blade tip under different platform pitching amplitudes are compared in fig 16 when a pitch 1 and 2 the frequency components of the spectrum of the aoa are relatively simple and dominated by the f pitch owing to the existence of the Œ∏ pitch 0 at every platform pitching period see fig 15a the nf pitch n 1 2 3 appears when a pitch 3 and 4 the amplitude increment of the nf pitch n 1 2 3 is larger than that of the f pitch this is because the duration of the Œ∏ pitch 0 under a pitch 4 is longer than that under a pitch 3 also the fluctuation of Œ∏ pitch under a pitch 4 is more dramatic than that under a pitch 3 frequency spectrums of the u 21 under different platform pitching amplitudes are shown in fig 17 along with the increase of the platform pitching amplitude the amplitudes of the f c21 f pitch increase and amplitudes of the f c21 nf pitch n 1 2 3 increase significantly this is because the non torque loads and the fluctuation of the rotation speed induced by the ppm increase with the increasing pitch amplitude as shown in fig 15b and d bearing forces of the main shaft bearing under different platform pitching amplitudes in the x direction and y direction are shown in fig 18 it can be found that the bearing forces in two directions all increase with the increasing platform pitching amplitude due to the ppm mainly arises the variation of relative wind speed in the vertical direction see eq 2 the variation of the tilt moment is more obvious than that of the yaw moment which is mainly caused by the blade elastic deformation therefore the bearing force in the y direction fluctuates more significantly than that in the x direction 4 conclusions in this study the dynamic characteristics of the nrel 5 mw floating offshore wind turbine fowt are investigated considering the effects of the blade pitch control bpc an integrated aeroelastic servo wind turbine transmission system is established and validated to conduct the study in the proposed model the aeroelastic coupling of the blade dynamic characteristics of the gearbox and baseline bpc are all considered firstly the influences of the tip speed ratio under the platform pitching motion ppm are analyzed then the dynamic characteristics of the transmission with and without the bpc are compared influences of the platform pitching amplitude on the fowt dynamic characteristics are studied in the end based on the above simulations and discussions the following conclusions are summarized 1 due to the large inertia of the transmission system the fluctuation of the generator power is smaller than that of the aerodynamic power the ppm almost has the same effects on aerodynamic characteristics of the wind turbine under different tip speed ratios 2 considering the effect of the bpc the fluctuation of the generator power reduces but the aerodynamic thrust tends to enhance the ppm non torque loads induced by the ppm are insensitive to the variation of the blade pitch angle due to the differences of the twist angle and torsional deformation along the blade span wise direction the fluctuation of the angle of attack aoa decreases in the mid span while increases in the blade tip considering the effect of the bpc 3 along with the increase of the platform pitching amplitude the fluctuations of the blade pitch angle generator power aerodynamic thrust non torque loads radial displacements of the planet gears bearing force of the main shaft bearing increase due to the limitation of the baseline bpc and the large inertia of the transmission system in conclusion the bpc has significant influence on the dynamic characteristics of the floating wind turbine moreover increasing rotor inertia of the modern large scale commercial wind turbine plays a more important role in the dynamic analysis and controller design of the system therefore high fidelity dynamic characteristic analysis is necessary for the exploitation of an

20718,blade pitch control bpc is an indispensable part of a variable speed wind turbine which maintains a stable power output by adjusting the blade pitch angle to adapt to the changing inflow speed introduced by the platform pitching motion ppm an integrated aeroelastic servo transmission system of a floating offshore wind turbine fowt is established and validated comparing with existing models our model considers the effect of the bpc on the fowt apart from the dynamic characteristic of the drivetrain and the aeroelastic coupling of the blade firstly dynamic behaviours of the fowt under

renewable energy laboratory ppm platform pitching motion rbm rigid body motion 1 introduction with the development of science and technology wind energy is already playing a role as a mainstream source of electricity veers et al 2019 the onshore wind energy is widely developed since it is cost effective however onshore wind turbines are usually accompanied with noise and visual impact on the contrary offshore wind energy does not suffer these disadvantages and has a higher average inflow speed and low wind turbulence bahaj et al 2020 hu and he 2017 in 2019 the average rated capacity of offshore turbines installed was 7 8 mw 1 mw larger than that in 2018 a report by the european wind energy association ewea 2020 floating offshore wind turbines fowts normally are equipped with long blades and high tower with the increase of the size of the modern wind turbine the blade flexibility increases simultaneously which has a significant impact on blade aerodynamic loads li et al 2020a chen et al 2018 rezaei et al 2018 the high tower amplifies the influence of platform motions on the relative inflow speed of the blade wen et al 2019 especially for the platform pitching motion ppm lee and lee 2019 due to the complexity of the maintenance and repair process of wind turbines the transmission system of wind turbines usually has a long downtime which increases the operation cost of wind farms igba et al 2015 the control system of a wind turbine including a generator torque control and a blade pitch control bpc dominates the wind turbine operating with high efficiency and low power fluctuation menezes et al 2018 the operating condition of a wind turbine may be different considering the influence of the control system especially for the bpc therefore the dynamic performance analyses of the transmission system with the bpc in ppm are necessary the influence of the ppm on wind turbine aerodynamic characteristics has been studied by numerical researchers wen et al 2018 adopted a free vortex method to analyse the power performance of a fowt at the rated wind speed and a reduced frequency was proposed to integrate the effects of the platform pitch amplitude and frequency the wind shear effects induced by the ppm were introduced in wen et al 2019 which indicated that the ppm will introduce significant fluctuations to the aerodynamic loads based on the coupling of a nonlinear vortex lattice method and vortex particle method lee et al lee and lee 2019 imposed the translational surge sway and heave and rotational roll pitch and yaw motions on the wind turbine basement and shown that only the platform pitching and surging motions have significant influence on the aerodynamic thrust and power output of the wind turbine jeon et al 2014 adopted a vortex lattice method to analyse the unsteady aerodynamics of a fowt in ppm they pointed out that a turbulent wake state will appear at a low speed inflow condition in shen et al 2018 a lifting surface method with a free wake model was developed and the aerodynamic characteristics of the national renewable energy laboratory nrel 5 mw wind turbine was studied in fang et al 2020 the computational fluid dynamics cfd method with an improved delayed detached eddy simulation is utilized for investigating the aerodynamics of a fowt under the harmonic pitching motion with different periods and amplitudes the results showed that the aerodynamic performances of the fowt were sensitive to these parameters and the rotor power increased under the periodic pitching motion based on the cfd a model for coupling the rotor motion and the ppm is proposed by wu et al wu and nguyen 2017 similarly liu et al 2016 also adopted an open source cfd solver to investigate the variations of the aerodynamic thrust and torque under the platform surging heaving and pitching motions based on the cfd solver the aerodynamic behaviours of the nrel 5 mw wind turbine were investigated under the platform pitching and surging motions by lienard et al 2020 which indicated that the platform pitching and surging motions all have remarkable impacts on the average aerodynamic power than the average aerodynamic thrust a coupled aero hydrodynamic simulation was presented in huang et al huang and wan 2019 based on the cfd method with an unsteady actuator line model the rotor power thrust and relative wind velocity were analyzed and it is reported that the aerodynamic loads and platform motions influenced each other using the helicopter multi block flow solver leble et al leble and barakos 2017 investigated a 10 mw wind turbine performance under the platform pitching and yawing motions and results showed that the vortex ring state appears under the pitching motion with a special amplitude and period besides the platform pitching motion leads to more significant changes in the thrust and power tran et al tran et al 2014 tran and kim 2015a 2015b carried out a series of investigations about the effects of the ppm on the aerodynamic performances and many valuable results have been obtained a cfd method incorporating the rigid body motion and overset grid techniques was presented in tran et al 2014 it pointed out that the ppm will induce a drastic change of the unsteady aerodynamic load in tran et al tran and kim 2015a an unsteady cfd method based on the dynamic mesh technique unsteady blade element momentum bem with the direct local relative velocity approach the bem with an equivalent average velocity approach were presented the result showed that the unsteady aerodynamic loads induced by platform motions were sensitive to the variations of the ppm amplitude and ppm frequency similarly in tran et al tran and kim 2015b the unsteady aerodynamic thrust and power coefficients are calculated with experiencing platform pitching and yawing motions the result showed that under the same oscillating conditions maximum variation effects for the thrust and power coefficients caused by the ppm was more sensitive than that by the platform yawing motion modern fowt blades are featured with large scale and distinct flexibility coupling the free vortex wake method and a linearized beam theory an aeroelastic model was established by rodriguez et al rodriguez and jaworski 2017 in which the stability of tip vortices shed from different rotors were studied their aeroelastic model only take into account the flap wise deformation this assumption may not be applicable for wind blades with large flexibility this is because the blade torsional deformation has a significant effect on the aerodynamic loads li et al 2020a chen et al 2018 considering the elastic behaviour of the blades kim et al kim and kwon 2019 investigated the aerodynamic performance and aeroelastic behaviour by coupling the bem theory and euler bernoulli beam theory the platform motions of six degrees of freedom dof are involved it is observed that loads induced by the platform pitching and surging motions had significant influence on the flap wise and torsional deformations of the blades however the euler bernoulli beam theory has a limitation in considering the effects of the large deformation and blade stress stiffening of larger rotational blades the control system is another essential part of the wind turbine which dominates the whole wind turbine operation ignoring deformations of blades aliabadi et al karimianaliabadi and rasekh 2020 analyzed the performance of a fowt under the ppm with the bpc in their research the unsteady aerodynamic loads were obtained by the unsteady bem with the dynamic wake and dynamic stall models it was reported that the mean power coefficient increased when the tip speed ratio is less than 7 and this trend was reverse with high tip speed ratios according to the above literature reviews and the best of our knowledge many researchers pay attention to the aerodynamic performance of fowts under platform motions however the dynamic characteristic of the drive train and the variation of non torque loads on the hub are seldom involved the elastic deformations of blades are also ignored in the reported literature moreover the effects of bpc is usually ignored in traditional studies however some researchers point out that the control system should be involved in the analysis since it plays an important role in the wind turbine system wen et al 2019 tran and kim 2015a to fill the above motioned literature gaps and to furtherly explore the effects of the ppm on fowt the paper mainly focuses on the two major aspects 1 a more integrated wind turbine transmission system is established and validated in which the aeroelastic coupling of the blade dynamic characteristics of the gearbox and effects of the bpc are considered 2 considering the bpc the dynamic behaviours of the fowt under the ppm are analyzed in detail dynamic behaviour analysis mainly includes generator power non torque loads on the hub aerodynamic and aeroelastic characteristics of a flexible wind turbine blade dynamic responses of the drive train the remainder of the paper is summarized as follows description of the ppm is first presented in section 2 1 then the modelling and validation of the fowt transmission system are given in sections 2 2 and 2 3 respectively in section 3 a detailed analysis and discussion on the dynamic characteristics of the fowt transmission system are provided conclusions are summarized and presented in section 4 2 modelling and validation in this section the description of the ppm is presented at the beginning to determine the relative wind speed of the local blade then the modelling process of the fowt transmission system proposed by the previous research li et al 2020b is briefly introduced and a bpc strategy is added to the transmission system at the end of this section model verifications are presented 2 1 description of the platform pitching motion the nrel 5 mw wind turbine proposed by jonkman et al 2009 is chosen as the analysis object to conduct the whole numerical simulations this wind turbine is representative of the modern fowt it has been extensively studied making great contribution to the existing literature the operating condition and main properties of the nrel 5 mw baseline wind turbine are shown in table 1 the stiffness of the tower is relatively higher than the blades thus platform motions of the fowt are normally regarded as rigid motions with six dof heave sway surge yaw pitch and roll as shown in fig 1 a oxyz is the global wind turbine coordinate and oxyz is the local rotor plane coordinate Œ∏ wing is the azimuth angle between the y axial and blade v 0 is the free stream velocity as reported by prior researches platform surging and pitching have obvious effects on variations of the aerodynamic power and thrust lee and lee 2019 ppm is more complex than the platform surging motion so only the pitching motion is analyzed to focus on the influence of the ppm some unsteady effects such as wind shear tower shadow and wind turbulence et al are all excluded and only the ppm is considered as suggested by previous studies the ppm is set to be a sine function wen et al 2019 lee and lee 2019 lienard et al 2020 tran and kim 2015a 1 Œ∏ pp a pitch sin 2 œÄ f pitch t œï 0 where Œ∏ pp and t are the platform pitch angle and the time respectively a pitch and f pitch are the amplitude and frequency respectively initial phase œï 0 is assumed as 0 to meet the actual operating environment a pitch 0 4 and f pitch 0 hz 0 2 hz wen et al 2018 without loss of generality f pitch is assumed as 0 1 hz the blade movement introduced by the ppm has an additional contribution to the relative speed of the local blade element as a result a linear velocity variation on the rotor plane appears the relative speed of an arbitrary local blade element q i e v rel induced by the ppm can be calculated as 2 v rel v 0 v p v 0 œâ p i t c h h y q v 0 2 œÄ f pitch a pitch cos 2 œÄ f pitch t œï 0 h y q where v p is the additional velocity induced by the ppm h is the distance between the hub to the rotating center of the ppm œâ pitch is the angular velocity of the ppm y q is the position of the blade element in the y direction in oxyz for the rigid blade it can be calculated as 3 y q r cos Œ∏ wing r cos 2 œÄ f r o t o r t œï wing where f rotor is the rotational frequency of the rotor plane œï wing is the initial azimuth angle of the blade in actual condition the y q should be determined by the deformed blade as an example the effect of ppm on the relative velocity of the local blade element q at the rated operating condition v 0 11 4 m s and the rotational speed of the rotor plane is equated to 12 1 r min is given as follows platform pitching conditions are assumed as a pitch 1 and f pitch 0 1 hz respectively to simplify the analysis the blade is assumed to be rigid here along the blade the position of q changes from the hub r r 0 to the blade tip r r 1 0 r is the radial position of q and r is the blade length the relative wind velocities of blade 1 induced by the ppm at r r 0 0 5 and 1 0 are shown in fig 2 where t is the motion period of the ppm without loss of generality the initial azimuth angle of blade 1 is set as 0 it can be found that the fluctuation of v rel at the blade tip is more complex than that of the blade root due to the coupling of the ppm and the blade rotation the corresponding frequency spectrums of v rel at different locations are shown in fig 2d we can find that only the f pitch is included at the blade root this is because the v rel at the blade root y q 0 all the time is only determined by the ppm see eq 2 as the blade element gets away from the hub the effect of the blade rotation enhances and the amplitude of the coupling frequencies f rotor f pitch and f rotor f pitch increases 2 2 modelling of the fowt transmission system in this section an integrated wind turbine transmission system see fig 3 a of the nrel 5 mw wind turbine is established in which three blades with a precone angle Œ∏ con are fixed with the hub i e main shaft and a conventional three point suspension configuration is adopted to support the gearbox the integrated modelling and analysis processes are shown in fig 3b the aerodynamic model and flexible blade model constitute the aeroelastic model the integrated transmission system model are constructed by the aeroelastic model and drivetrain model according to the variation of the generator speed œâ gen blade pitch controller adjusts the blade pitch angle Œ∏ pitch a generated Œ± time integration algorithm with the variable time step size is adopted to conduct the whole analysis process the blade aeroelastic model gear drivetrain model and blade pitch controller are coupled with each other except for the blade pitch controller the detailed modelling process of the fowt transmission system has been described in the previous research li et al 2020b therefore only the main principle of the transmission system is briefly introduced as shown in fig 3a the gear drivetrain includes two low speed helical planetary gear stages and one helical parallel shaft gear stage taking the effects of the flexibility shear deformation and gyroscopic moment into consideration the gear shafts are simulated by the timoshenko beam stringer 2008 the gear meshing is replaced as a linear spring in the perpendicular direction of teeth contact face with the corresponding helix angle Œ≤ ij see fig 4 considering the effect of gear s lateral torsional axial swing coupling the gears are all simulated as the lumped masses with six dof r s r p and r r are the base circle radius of the sun gear planet gear and ring œà ij is the angle between the positive y axis and the meshing plane based on lagrange s theory the motion equation of the corresponding gear pair ij can be obtained 4 m i j x i j c i j x i j k i j x i j f i j where m ij c ij and x ij are the mass matrix damping matrix and displacement vector of the gear pair ij respectively the detailed expressions of them can be found in ref wang et al 2017 li et al 2020c the bearing supporting is modelled as a linear spring a rigid region model is established to link the elastic supporting of the carrier and planet gears finally the mass stiffness and damping matrices of gears and shafts are all assembled to produce the overall gear drivetrain model based on the finite element method the aeroelastic blade model including the blade structural model and aerodynamic model are coupled using a loose coupling approach see fig 5 at every time step the blade state including the blade deformations blade positions and blade velocities is delivered to the aerodynamic model to determine the aerodynamic loads including the axial force f n tangential force f t and torsion moment m Œ∏ on the contrary these aerodynamic loads are applied to the beam nodes as time varying external forces to obtain the blade dynamic responses the detailed coupling process can be found in previous research li et al 2020a to balance the calculation accuracy and efficiency the blade structural model is structured by the geometrically exact beam theory gebt li et al 2020a bauchau 2010 in this beam model the effects of the blade large deformation blade stress stiffening and blade centrifugal coriolis force all can be included moreover the element length at both ends of the blade is shorter than that in the middle to increase the calculation efficiency based on the displacement field description and hamilton principle the governing equation of the gebt beam can be obtained then the beam model is discretized by using the finite element method to get the linear governing equation finally considering the coupling of the blade rotation and ppm the multiple motion period of pitching motion should be calculated as shown in fig 2 thus calculation efficiency should be considered emphatically bem which is widely used in industrial practice is adopted to calculate aerodynamic loads it has the highest computational efficiency and has been adopted to analyse the aerodynamic characteristics of fowt under the platform motions successfully tran and kim 2015a kim and kwon 2019 karimianaliabadi and rasekh 2020 de vaal et al 2014 as shown in fig 5 v blade is the blade element velocity vector including the blade elastic vibration and the additional velocity induced by the ppm w is the induced velocity vector the dynamic wake model of √∏ye is used considering the time delay of the wake to go from one equilibrium state to another hansen 2015 the inflow angle œÜ between the relative velocity vector v rel and the rotor plane is composed of the angle of attack aoa Œ± e section initial twist angle Œ∏ twist blade pitch angle Œ∏ pitch and blade torsional deformed angle Œ∏ deformed at this section therefore the aoa can be calculated as Œ± e œÜ Œ∏ total arctan v rel ax v rel tan Œ∏ twist Œ∏ pitch Œ∏ deformed where 5 v rel t a n v rel ax v 0 v 0 ax v blade x 2 v blade y 2 v blade z w t a n w ax where the superscripts ax and tan denote the axial and tangential directions about the blade section respectively see fig 5 then the aerodynamic loads can be determined according to the airfoil characteristic provided by jonkman et al 2009 due to the ppm the wind turbine will operate in a tilted incoming inflow which causes a skew of wake and leads to a variation of induced velocity along with the azimuth angle therefore a yaw model describing the distribution of the induced velocity presented by hasen hansen 2015 is adopted to enhance the calculation accuracy the hub loss tip loss glauert s corrections and snel s dynamic stall model are also added to this study hansen 2015 khan 2018 to maintain the rated generator power the blade pitch angle Œ∏ pitch increases as wind speed gets larger this is because the aoa decreases when Œ∏ pitch increases see eq 5 which reduces the energy capture from the wind in this study the baseline bpc provided by jonkman et al 2009 is adopted according to the wind speed and the generator speed œâ gen the blade pitch controller give an appropriate blade pitch angle Œ∏ pitch to the pitch actuators the Œ∏ pitch is calculated using a proportional integral pi control on the rotation speed error between the rated generator speed œâ gen and filtered generator speed œâ rated 6 Œ∏ pitch t k p e r r t k i 0 t e r r œÑ d œÑ e r r t œâ gen œâ rated where k p and k i are the proportional coefficient and the integral coefficient respectively they are all determined by the wind turbine characteristic and the corresponding operating condition moreover the blade pitch angle is limited between 0 and 90 according to the blade aerodynamic properties 2 3 verification and validation the aeroelastic model and the gearbox model have been validated in the previous research li et al 2020b in this section two cases are designed to check whether the proposed model has the ability to provide reliable and accurate dynamic analyses under the blade pitch angle variation and platform pitching motion first variations of the Œ∏ pitch under different wind speeds obtained from the presented model are compared with the results presented in the ref jonkman et al 2009 see fig 6 to validate that the presented model has the capability to handle the variation of Œ∏ pitch it can be found that they have the same varying tendency above the rated wind speed however the Œ∏ pitch obtained from the present model is less than that calculated by fast which is because the torsional deformation is included in our blade model but it is ignored in fast s blade model nwtc 2013 the torsional deformation just makes up for the gap of the Œ∏ pitch between the two models see fig 5 similar phenomenon is also found in ref chen et al 2018 but the authors did not comment on it according to the above descriptions the calculation results of the proposed model are reliable to illustrate the proposed model can capture the time varying aerodynamic characteristics under the ppm the aerodynamic power and thrust of different methods are compared in fig 7 the simulation results are obtained from tran et al 2014 and the ppm states are a pitch 4 and f pitch 0 1 hz the mrf rbm and gdw are the multiple reference frames approach rigid body motion approach and generalized dynamic wake model respectively it should be noted that the platform motion coordinate and initial position in ref tran et al 2014 are different from this study thus in this validation case the proposed model is re established in the same coordinate and ppm as the ref tran et al 2014 as shown in fig 7 it can be found that the results of the presented model are in good agreement with those of other methods which shows that the presented model is reliable with the ppm based on the above validation and discussion it can be concluded that the proposed model has the ability to provide reliable and accurate dynamic analyses under the Œ∏ pitch variation and ppm in the following sections we will use the proposed model to analyse the dynamic characteristics of the wind turbine transmission system under the ppm with bpc 3 results and discussion in this section the dynamic behaviours of the nrel 5 mw wind turbine under the ppm are simulated and discussed conventionally bpc only works above the rated wind speed thus performance analyses of the fowt under the different tip speed ratios are presented firstly then dynamic analyzed with and without the bpc are compared in section 3 2 in the end the influence of the platform pitching amplitude is analyzed in section 3 3 3 1 influence of the tip speed ratio many researchers mainly pay attention to the blade aerodynamic characteristics including the aerodynamic power but the output power of a wind turbine is generator power not the aerodynamic power the aerodynamic power and generator power are calculated as 7 p aero t aero œâ rotor p gen t gen œâ gen where p aero and p gen are the aerodynamic power and generator power respectively t aero and t gen are the aerodynamic torque and generator torque respectively in actuality t gen is fixed when wind speed exceeds the rated wind speed with the baseline control strategy therefore the fluctuation of p gen is mainly influenced by the generator rotation œâ gen however for the p aero calculation the rotation speed of the blade rotor plane œâ rotor is normally assumed as fixed t aero changes immediately under the ppm but the variation of œâ gen is determined by the t aero t gen and the inertia of the whole transmission system j sys including the rotor plane and the drivetrain 8 Œ¥ œâ gen Œ± gen Œ¥ t Œ± gen t aero i s y s t gen j s y s where Œ± gen is the acceleration of the generator shaft and i sys is the gearbox transmission ratio modern wind turbines are normally equipped with long blades which means the transmission system has large inertia thus the fluctuation range of the œâ gen is relatively small in other words though the ppm has significant influence on the aerodynamic power this effect on the generator power is weakened due to the large inertia of the transmission system p aero and p gen under the ppm a pitch 2 and f pitch 0 1 hz with the v 0 12 m s tip speed ratio Œª 6 65 are compared in fig 8 a according to the above analyses it can be found that the fluctuation of the p aero is larger than that of the p gen moreover there is a delay between the maximum of the p aero and p gen when t t 1 the p aero reaches the maximum which is consistent with the relative wind speed but the p gen reaches the maximum when t t t 3 this is because the equivalent aerodynamic torque t aero t aero i s y s is large than the t gen between the t 2 and t 3 see fig 8b which increases the œâ gen continuously the large inertia of the wind turbine transmission system has a strong ability to store energy which stores energy from t 2 to t 3 and releases energy from t 1 to t 2 to make up the reduction of wind energy the generator power is selected as the analysis object in the following section since it is the actual output power of a wind turbine the generator power p gen aerodynamic thrust f thrust tilt moment on the hub m tilt and yaw moment on the hub m yaw under the ppm a pitch 2 and f pitch 0 1 hz with different tip speed ratios Œª 6 65 5 70 4 99 and 4 43 are shown in fig 9 it can be found that the fluctuation amplitude of p gen m tilt and m yaw under different tip speed ratios are almost the same the little difference between them is mainly caused by the difference in blade pitch angles which changes under the different wind speed to maintain generator power see fig 6 blade section stiffness changes along with the variation of the blade pitch angle thus the blade aeroelastic characteristics behaves differently for diverse tip speed ratios as shown in fig 9b aerodynamic thrusts under different tip speed ratios are different but this difference is just limited to the mean of f thrust without the platform motions this phenomenon has also be observed in ref yu and kwon 2013 therefore the difference is not caused by the ppm the oscillation amplitudes under the different tip speed ratios 1 7e5 1 65e5 1 6e5 and 1 5e5 for 12 m s to 18 m s are close based on the above analyses it can be conclude that the ppm almost has the same effects on the aerodynamic characteristics of the wind turbine under different tip speed ratios 3 2 comparison between with and without blade pitch control because the effects of the ppm are not sensitive to the wind speed as analyzed in section 3 1 a constant tip speed ratio Œª 6 14 i e v 0 13 m s is adopted to compare the dynamic characteristic of the transmission system under the ppm with and without bpc in this section the ppm is set as a pitch 2 and f pitch 0 1 hz two cases are designed to analyse the effect of the bpc case 1 nrel 5 mw wind turbine with bpc case 2 nrel 5 mw wind turbine without bpc Œ∏ pitch p gen f thrust and m tilt are compared in fig 10 for cases with the bpc considered or not it can be found that the Œ∏ pitch reduces to the minimum when t t 0 5 and reaches the maximum when t t 1 0 see fig 10a this is because the additional wind speed induced by the ppm is smallest when t t 0 5 and thus a larger aoa of the blade is required at this moment to capture more energy from the wind meanwhile a larger aoa means that the Œ∏ pitch should be reduced as shown in eq 5 as shown in fig 10b the fluctuation of the p gen is apparently reduced when bpc is considered therefore bpc improves the power output obviously under the ppm besides the large inertia of the transmission system generates an apparent phase lag in the power output the opposite phase also occurs in the thrust response see fig 10c but this phenomenon mainly is caused by the variation of the Œ∏ pitch the aerodynamic thrust considering the bpc tends to enhance the ppm introducing negative damping to the platform motion and the negative damping may deteriorate the stability of the platform therefore the effects of bpc should be considered comprehensively for the designer of the bpc strategy as shown in fig 10d there are little differences in the tilt moment between the two cases similar phenomena are also observed in other non torque loads such as yaw moment aerodynamic loads in x direction and y direction therefore we can conclude that the collective bpc cannot mitigate the non torque loads induced by the ppm aoa variations and corresponding frequency spectrums with and without the bpc under the ppm at r r 0 3 and r r 1 0 are compared in fig 11 from fig 11a and c we can find that the fluctuation of aoa at r r 0 3 with the bpc is smaller than that without bpc but the aoa at r r 1 0 with the bpc fluctuates distinctly this is because the aerodynamic torque is accumulated by the discrete tangential force f t and dominated by the f t in the middle part see fig 12 a therefore a stable aerodynamic torque requires that f t in the middle part fluctuates little which means that the aoa in the middle part should be as stable as possible however airfoil property changes along the blade thus the aoa at the blade tip increases due to the adjustment of the blade pitch angle this has significant influence on the aerodynamic thrust see fig 10c owing to the thrust are dominated by the discrete f n around the blade tip see fig 12b ignoring the effect of the bpc the frequency components of the spectrum of the aoa are consistent with that of the blade relative wind speed here the f rotor0 and f rotor1 are the rotation frequency of the rotor plane with and without the bpc respectively f rotor0 is larger than f rotor1 because the bpc can reduce the fluctuation of the rotation speed considering the effect of the bpc the frequency components of the spectrum of the aoa are dominated by the f pitch with and without the bpc the radial displacements and corresponding frequency spectrums of planet 1 in the planetary gear stages 1 and 2 u 11 and u 21 respectively are compared in fig 13 f c21 and f c20 are the rotation frequency of carrier 2 with and without the bpc the rotation frequency of carrier 1 is equated to the rotation frequency of the rotor plane for u 11 and u 21 the oscillation amplitudes with and without the bpc are close which is because they are mainly influenced by the non torque loads induced by the ppm however the bpc has little effect on the non torque loads see fig 10d considering the effects of the bpc the frequency components of the spectrum of u 11 and u 21 are mainly focused on the f rotor1 f pitch and f rotor1 f pitch however the sidebands f rotor0 nf pitch and f c20 nf pitch n 1 2 3 of u 11 and u 21 are noticeable under the non control case bearing forces of the main shaft bearing with and without the bpc in the x direction and y direction are shown in fig 14 the bpc slightly alters the non torque loads on the hub and the bearing forces of the main shaft bearing are mainly influenced by these non torque loads therefore there are little differences in the bearing forces between the two simulation cases the bearing loads are time varying which accelerates the bearing fatigue therefore a more superior bpc strategy should be adopted to reduce the non torque loads introduced by the platform motions such as the individual bpc 3 3 influence of the pitch amplitude as shown in eq 2 additional relative wind speed induced by the ppm is closely related to the distance from the pitch center to the hub h the amplitude and frequency of the ppm a pitch and f pitch in this section only the effects of the a pitch are analyzed in detail this is because the variations of h and f pitch all can change the actual motion amplitude to meet the actual operating condition that a fowt may experience the amplitude variation of the ppm is set as 0 1 2 3 4 the other operating environment is same as section 3 2 i e f pitch 0 1 hz v 0 13 m s and h 90 m Œ∏ pitch p gen f thrust and m tilt under the different pitch amplitudes are compared in fig 15 along with the increase of the pitch amplitude the variation of the relative wind encountered by the blade augments it leads to the Œ∏ pitch has been in a significant fluctuation see fig 15a the Œ∏ pitch changes as a sine function when the pitch amplitude is less than 2 however there exists a moment such as t 4 t 5 for a pitch 4 that the Œ∏ pitch 0 all the time under a pitch 3 and 4 this is mainly caused by two reasons 1 the platform pitching amplitude is too large which leads to an obvious reduction of the blade relative wind speed at around t t 0 5 even the blade pitch angle equates to 0 enough aerodynamic torque cannot be provided by the rotor plane to make the rotor speed reaches the rated speed as soon as possible 2 large inertia of the transmission system is another import affecting factor as shown in eq 8 the large inertia of the transmission system makes the rotor speed is insensitive to the aerodynamic torque therefore the platform pitching amplitude and large inertia of the transmission system determine the duration of the Œ∏ pitch 0 together due to the limitation of the bpc the fluctuation of the power output augments with the increase of the a pitch see fig 15b there exists an obvious reduction of the p aero between t 4 and t 5 during this period t 4 t 5 a single bpc is ineffective and a combined controller incorporating the blade pitch controller and generator torque controller is expected as shown in fig 15c the aerodynamic thrusts change rapidly owing to the variation of the Œ∏ pitch along with the increase of the a pitch the tilt moment increases fig 15d noting that the collective blade pitch variation has little impact on the non torque loads as analyzed in section 3 2 the shapes of the m tilt under different pitch amplitudes are similar and only determined by the ppm frequency spectrums of the aoa at the blade tip under different platform pitching amplitudes are compared in fig 16 when a pitch 1 and 2 the frequency components of the spectrum of the aoa are relatively simple and dominated by the f pitch owing to the existence of the Œ∏ pitch 0 at every platform pitching period see fig 15a the nf pitch n 1 2 3 appears when a pitch 3 and 4 the amplitude increment of the nf pitch n 1 2 3 is larger than that of the f pitch this is because the duration of the Œ∏ pitch 0 under a pitch 4 is longer than that under a pitch 3 also the fluctuation of Œ∏ pitch under a pitch 4 is more dramatic than that under a pitch 3 frequency spectrums of the u 21 under different platform pitching amplitudes are shown in fig 17 along with the increase of the platform pitching amplitude the amplitudes of the f c21 f pitch increase and amplitudes of the f c21 nf pitch n 1 2 3 increase significantly this is because the non torque loads and the fluctuation of the rotation speed induced by the ppm increase with the increasing pitch amplitude as shown in fig 15b and d bearing forces of the main shaft bearing under different platform pitching amplitudes in the x direction and y direction are shown in fig 18 it can be found that the bearing forces in two directions all increase with the increasing platform pitching amplitude due to the ppm mainly arises the variation of relative wind speed in the vertical direction see eq 2 the variation of the tilt moment is more obvious than that of the yaw moment which is mainly caused by the blade elastic deformation therefore the bearing force in the y direction fluctuates more significantly than that in the x direction 4 conclusions in this study the dynamic characteristics of the nrel 5 mw floating offshore wind turbine fowt are investigated considering the effects of the blade pitch control bpc an integrated aeroelastic servo wind turbine transmission system is established and validated to conduct the study in the proposed model the aeroelastic coupling of the blade dynamic characteristics of the gearbox and baseline bpc are all considered firstly the influences of the tip speed ratio under the platform pitching motion ppm are analyzed then the dynamic characteristics of the transmission with and without the bpc are compared influences of the platform pitching amplitude on the fowt dynamic characteristics are studied in the end based on the above simulations and discussions the following conclusions are summarized 1 due to the large inertia of the transmission system the fluctuation of the generator power is smaller than that of the aerodynamic power the ppm almost has the same effects on aerodynamic characteristics of the wind turbine under different tip speed ratios 2 considering the effect of the bpc the fluctuation of the generator power reduces but the aerodynamic thrust tends to enhance the ppm non torque loads induced by the ppm are insensitive to the variation of the blade pitch angle due to the differences of the twist angle and torsional deformation along the blade span wise direction the fluctuation of the angle of attack aoa decreases in the mid span while increases in the blade tip considering the effect of the bpc 3 along with the increase of the platform pitching amplitude the fluctuations of the blade pitch angle generator power aerodynamic thrust non torque loads radial displacements of the planet gears bearing force of the main shaft bearing increase due to the limitation of the baseline bpc and the large inertia of the transmission system in conclusion the bpc has significant influence on the dynamic characteristics of the floating wind turbine moreover increasing rotor inertia of the modern large scale commercial wind turbine plays a more important role in the dynamic analysis and controller design of the system therefore high fidelity dynamic characteristic analysis is necessary for the exploitation of an

20719,a novel application of a convolutional neural network cnn for the identification of mooring line failure of a turret moored fpso is demonstrated the cnn was trained on images of the turret horizontal displacement history simulated for both an intact mooring and a system with one line that had failed when tested on operational and extreme environments representative of the north west shelf of australia the cnn successfully distinguished between the turret responses associated with the intact and broken mooring classification accuracy was found to be lower for relatively benign conditions when the turret offset response was minimal this was significantly improved through the use of additional hidden layers and retraining as the cnn does not explicitly utilise metocean data as input apart from training it is envisaged that it offers an effective and lower cost alternative to existing mooring failure detection approaches for the offshore industry keywords mooring systems machine learning convolutional neural networks 1 introduction floating production storage and offloading fpso units have been widely adopted by the oil and gas industry enabling the development of less accessible or more marginal fields in particular these facilities generally process large quantities of hydrocarbons and loss of containment has the potential to have significant environmental and financial impact brown et al 2005 to ensure production and offloading processes take place safely the mooring integrity of the fpso must be maintained however it has been acknowledged that the probability of mooring failures on offshore oil and gas facilities is relatively high notably since 2000 there have been on average two fpso mooring line failures per year ma et al 2013 several mooring failures were also deemed catastrophic with failure of risers and requiring an extended shut down of the field majhi and d souza 2013 of particular concern is that while mooring systems generally incorporate redundancy single line failures are often undetected in benign conditions the high rate of failure has subsequently drawn significant attention with the initiation of joint industry research programs brown et al 2005 and a growing body of literature on the subject such works have emphasised the need for monitoring systems capable of identifying single line failures in a timely manner which would allow for remediation prior to complete system failure both direct and indirect means of monitoring mooring integrity have been devised systems which are based on measurements of linetension or inclination have been found to lack reliability particularly when instrumentation is below the water line prislin and maroju 2017 to overcome these inherent shortcomings alternative dry methods of monitoring mooring lines have been developed these techniques are generally based on the use of differential global positioning systems dgps to measure the horizontal translations of the asset however those systems which make use of a watch circle often only enable failure to be detected in relatively severe environmental conditions such that remediation before complete failure may not be possible consequentially the offshore industry requires robust new approaches to address this issue one such potential solution is the application of machine learning and artificial neural networks anns see e g handoko 2018 jaiswal and ruskin 2019 and gumley et al 2019 to identify changes in the vessel response following a loss of a mooring line these studies have demonstrated that an ann trained on the mean turret offset or first order wave response can be capable of determining a single line failure for an fpso anns have similarly proved successful in aquaculture where they have been used to assess structural failure of nets and cages subjected to severe environmental loads zhao et al 2019 bi et al 2020 the application of anns in these contexts typically requires significant quantities of meteorological and oceanographic inputs and hydrodynamic response measurements for robust operation across all possible environmental conditions these data are often expensive to acquire limited by spatial and temporal resolution and affected by uncertainty it is therefore appropriate to consider that neural networks are capable of learning and classifying data based on visual qualities the visual features associated with the mooring response i e the time history of the turret offset plotted with respect to the easterly and northerly positions may contain the aforementioned metocean data implicitly as such the network would have the required data for training albeit in a different form the use of visual data in conjunction with neural networks for classification has proven successful for a wide range of applications including within the automotive aviation and medical sectors to the best of the authors knowledge it has not been applied to mooring line integrity monitoring in offshore engineering therefore it could potentially offer a novel solution to the mooring failure detection problem which is robust and more cost effective to implement than existing systems to this end herein a convolutional neural network cnn is developed using images of the turret offset response of a relatively soft moored fpso in the north west shelf of australia the objective is to establish the capabilities of the cnn in the detection of a single line failure over a wide range of metocean conditions expected in the region the cnn is trained and tested using numerical simulations of the vessel response with the metocean input data obtained from a state of the art numerical hindcast to simplify the problem in this study failure of one particular line within the mooring system at the turret is considered the loss of this line gives rise to a specific change in the mooring response of the fpso however the insights are considered to be generalisable to a cnn which may be developed to identify loss of the other mooring lines or different floating structures such as wind turbines furthermore it is also important to emphasise that the focus is on establishing the capability for the cnn to identify whether failure has occurred as opposed to predicting whether failure will occur the paper proceeds as follows an overview of cnns and relevant works are outlined in section 2 to justify the approaches adopted in this study section 3 details the methods by which the fpso data were generated and the describes the cnn architecture and training the performance of the cnn is demonstrated and discussed for a range of environmental conditions in section 4 and contextualises the findings and implications of the study finally the key conclusions are summarised in section 5 2 fundamentals and literature review 2 1 convolutional neural networks convolutional neural networks are a class of deep neural networks which are commonly employed to process imagery extensive coverage of the principles and application of cnns has been provided by goodfellow et al 2016 and yamashita et al 2018 among others fundamentally a cnn classifies imagery by matching pixel patterns within the image to specific learned feature maps via cross correlation of an input matrix image pixel values and a weight matrix creating a map indicating which patterns are found in the input image this process is commonly referred to as convolution the cnn architecture typically comprises convolution layers activation operations pooling layers followed by a fully connected layer generally cnns contain multiple convolution layers and sets of filters or kernels which progressively serve to detect increasingly more complex features in this paper as only two dimensional convolution is used the terms filter or kernel may be used interchangeably kernels are three dimensional arrays comprising numerical weights learned autonomously during training the array dimensions specify its size and the number of feature maps within the filters these feature maps or channels are used to extract different features from the input imagery which correlate to specific classes that the network will use in classification of the input image the presence of certain features on the input image will lead to strong activation of specific channels during convolution these outputs are commonly referred to as convolved features and act as the new input for each successive convolution layer pooling operations after the convolution layer reduce the dimensions of the data and provide spatial invariance in this way the network extracts and stores increasingly more complex features of the imagery while continually reducing the input array size the fully connected layer combines the feature maps of the final convolution layer and maps them to individual output nodes representing the potential output classes of the network these nodes output the probabilities for each class associated with the input image the training process of a cnn involves passing an image data set through the network each image contained in this data set has a pre specified class label in this context broken or intact the network maps each input image to a specific class label by calculating the probability that the image matches the class this probability is then compared to the pre specified class label for the specific image generating a cost function the cost function is minimised by varying the weights found within its kernels for each convolution layer prior to formal testing the network is validated on a sample of training data held back this provides an unbiased estimate of the skill of the model and can also be used for fine tuning the variables within a cnn which determine how the network trains processes and classifies data are referred to as hyperparameters covered in detail by patterson and gibson 2017 spatial hyperparameters define the physical architecture of the network and include the convolution layers filters and filter size amongst others training hyperparameters dictate how the network will train and encompass the learning rate number of epochs and batch size the learning rate refers to the step size within the learning algorithm used to update parameters such as weights based on the estimated error within the model a learning rate that is too low will result in excessive training times while high learning rates may cause divergence within the model the number of epochs defines how many times the complete set of training data is fed through the network during training batch size refers to number of images fed through the network for each training iteration in which learnable network parameters such as perceptron weights are updated these training hyperparameters are inherent to the training algorithm selected for the cnn a learning algorithm defines how the network will minimise its cost function which quantifies the classification error made by the network during training the gradient s of the cost function is calculated via back propagation and optimised using gradient descent methods popular algorithms include stochastic gradient descent with momentum adaptive moment estimation and root mean square propagation which ruder 2017 provides coverage on the effectiveness of the learning algorithm is governed by the selection of the hyperparameters which is discussed in further detail by bergstra and bengio 2012 while cnns have been employed since the 1980 s it is in more recent years where uptake has been most rapid rawat and wang 2017 attribute this in part to increases in the availability of computational resources and improved algorithms the use of cnns has proven to be highly successful in a variety of complex image processing applications including traffic sign recognition jin et al 2014 real time pedestrian identification tom√® et al 2016 and vehicle classification wang et al 2019 payan and montana 2015 schlemper et al 2017 and lin et al 2018 among others have also demonstrated the effectiveness of cnns in medical applications including neuro imaging these studies have demonstrated the ability of cnns to effectively identify and distinguish the edges corners and curvilinear features of numbers and characters in both spatial and temporal scenarios and reinforces their versatility therefore it could be expected that cnns may also be able to learn the features of an image depicting the turret motions of a fpso potentially enabling them to identify mooring failure due to the black box nature of cnns it can be challenging to intuitively understand what the network is learning during training mathworks 2020 zeiler and fergus 2014 utilised a deconvnet to visualise the feature maps and relevant activations of a cnn this was particularly useful for identifying the image features which cause the strongest activations and hence those used by the network for classification class activation mapping cam is another common method used to explore which attributes of an input image result in a strong class activation this involves overlaying a heat map of class specific activation strengths over the input image zhou et al 2016 utilised cam to visualise which areas of a 2d three channel image were most important for discrimination and hence classification as such cam can help inform the particular regions of the image which confused the network mathworks 2020 this is particularly valuable for assessing miss classifications both methods of visualisation are therefore considered appropriate here for exploring the capabilities of cnns when applied to mooring failure prediction and interpreting the results 2 2 acquisition of training data in order to rigorously evaluate the ability of a cnn to identify mooring line failure time histories of fpso responses for both intact and failed mooring line conditions representative of a wide range of environmental conditions are ultimately required these data are generally impractical to obtain in the field and as such numerical approaches are typically sought for this to be a viable alternative to field measurements simulations require input data which are an accurate representation of the environment and must account for the complex non linearities associated with the response of the vessel within the offshore industry long term i e 30 years metocean hindcasts of winds waves and currents are now routinely synthesised using numerical methods these hindcasts are formulated using physics based models of the underlying environmental processes together with assimilation of measurements milne et al 2016 and milne and zed 2018 for instance utilised a hindcast generated from a third generation spectral wave model and a global wind model for the purposes of quantifying the hydrodynamic response of fpsos and drillships through comparisons with measured data the numerically derived environmental data were demonstrated to generally be reliable and able to account for complex multi modal seastates i e comprising both significant swell and wind sea energy therefore justifying their suitability for the purposes of this study herein in terms of computing the response of an fpso i e the turret offset solutions in the time domain are generally necessary to account for the combined effects of low frequency i e difference frequency and wave frequency motions mooring line dynamics and the wind and current loading however as large numbers of simulations are required to obtain training and data sets these simulations must also be numerically efficient simulation techniques which predict the response of a moored vessel based on precomputing the wave induced hydrodynamic responses i e response amplitude operators raos and quadratic transfer functions qtfs and a quasi steady approximation of the mooring line dynamics such as ariane7 bureau veritas 2007 are widely employed within the offshore industry to assess the performance of a mooring system the application of these models is consequently considered to be justifiable for use in the both training and validation of a cnn to identify mooring line failure 3 methods 3 1 site and training data a turret moored fpso in the north west shelf of western australia is considered here the environment conditions are complex and both significant swell and wind wave energy are present throughout the year the region also exhibits significant seasonal variability in summer winds are generally from the south and south west while in winter strong storm winds from the east and south east are experienced in addition to semi diurnal tides the presence of solitions and large eddies can also induce significant surface currents which may persist for several days a state of the art numerical model based on the third generation spectral wave model wavewatch iii tolman 2014 was utilised to develop a hindcast of the complex environment the spectral model was forced using the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr global wind model saha et al 2010 and the wind data were calibrated using measurements from the north west cape owing to difficulties in modelling the surface currents in this region as discussed by astfalck et al 2018 the current data were obtained by repeating a 1 year period of measurements and including a wind shear component the complete hindcast data set spanned five years resulting in a total of 14 608 individual 3h environment cases the wave data were partitioned into both swell and wind sea energy components defining swell as corresponding to wave periods exceeding 9s from which jonswap model hasselmann et al 1973 parameters were estimated these cases were used as input data to the hydrodynamic analysis of the moored fpso response the fpso had an overall length of around 333m with a beam of 58m and draft of 17m fig 1 shows the mooring configuration which comprised nine catenary lines arranged in three bundles around an internal turret which was located 105m forward of the midship the responses were computed in the time domain using the commercial multi body mooring analysis software ariane7 bureau veritas 2007 the hydrodynamic wave responses of the vessel raos and qtfs required as inputs for the mooring analysis were computed using the three dimensional hydrodynamic analysis commercial software seasam hydrod dnv 2013 the wind and current coefficient data lateral and longitudinal forces and yaw moments as a function of heading were acquired from model tests the drag loads on the mooring and riser systems from currents as well as the damping forces acting on the fpso turret due to mooring and riser lines were obtained from a fully dynamic model in orcaflex orcina 2015 which also served to verify the ariane7 model the fpso and computational set up was consistent with that employed by astfalck et al 2019a b from which further details can be attained the simulated time history of the turret centre was recorded in easting and northing coordinates relative to a global datum at a rate of 1hz each simulation was 3h in duration and excluded an initial 3000s period which was associated with initial transients owing to the non linear nature of the responses 250 realisations were simulated for each environment by varying the phases of the underlying wave components initial investigations found that this provided an appropriate quantity of turret offset images for training and evaluating the cnn for each unique environment each environmental case was simulated for both the intact and single line failure scenarios examples of which are shown in fig 2 to simplify the problem only failure of mooring line e2 was considered in this study the loss of the mooring line effectively reduces the restoring force for the fpso which results in the equilibrium position shifting further west relative to the origin 3 2 cnn architecture training and initial validation the cnn was developed using the deep learning toolbox in matlab mathworks 2020 fig 3 shows the architecture of the cnn with four layers which was trained using the turret offset imagery datasets on an intel core i7 4770k cpu 3 50 ghz with 16 gb ram each inner layer of the network comprised the following operations convolution of the input image or output of previous layer using learned feature maps kernels batch normalisation and activation of a leaky rectified linear function relu utilising a scale factor of 0 01 a leaky relu as opposed to a standard relu was implemented due to the former having previously been demonstrated to result in a smaller verification error xu et al 2015 a max pooling operation zhou and chellappa 1988 was also completed between each inner layer to increase training efficiency by down sampling the output of the previous layer this max pooling operation was 2 by 2 with a stride of 2 2 and zero padding the outer layers of the network comprised an image input layer a fully connected layer connecting all weights and associated activation scores a soft max operation and a class output layer using cross entropy to calculate the final classification output of the image layer weight and bias matrices were trained via back propagation of the derivative of the loss cost function of the network the stochastic gradient descent with momentum algorithm with a fixed learning rate of 0 01 was used to solve this function updating network parameters accordingly this algorithm was selected due to the high training performance and frequent use within the literature dogo et al 2018 the images used to train the network were three channel red green blue rgb 875 pixels in width and 656 pixels in height such that the dimensions were 875 656 3 the image design was intentionally simple to reduce training and classification complexity specifically the turret offset was of a single colour the default blue in matlab rgb 0 114 189 with a white background rgb 255 255 255 and black axes rgb 0 0 0 the axes abscissa and ordinates in the images bounding the turret response spanned the physical distances 13 79 x 6 35 m and 7 09 y 8 11 m respectively these axes ranges were determined from the maximum and minimum turret offsets obtained from a random sample of 500 environments repeated for both intact and broken mooring cases and were deemed to provide an adequate resolution of the response during both benign and extreme conditions all images were rendered using opengl open graphics library hardware this is a commonly used programming interface which enables hardware based acceleration during rendering here using a nvidia geforce gtx 1080 ti graphics processing unit with 11gb vram once rendered as 2d vectors all images were saved in raster format as portable network graphics png files it may be noted that imagery used for training cnns can be pre processed to improve visual clarity reduce noise or to highlight specific features for the network during training using techniques such as bilateral filtering zhao et al 2020 this may be particularly advantageous for images originally sourced from photos for instance however since the images here were obtained from simulated data and considered to be sufficiently clear such pre processing techniques were not applied to any training imagery the raw png imagery was used directly as training data for the cnn as a means of visually demonstrating the cnn training and testing process fig 4 shows examples of the heat maps associated with the class activations of the final layer of the cnn in this instance these corresponded to the turret offset plots in fig 2 using cam these maps were generated by taking the product of the activations of the final relu layer within the network referred to as scores and the learned weights of the fully connected layer the activations reveal the location of the features of the input image which influenced the final classification output with red here signifying the greatest contribution mathworks 2020 images which resulted in a strong activation of each specific channel for the first and second layers in the network are shown in fig 5 these suggest that the first and second layer filters learned by the network served to primarily identify colours and edges subsequent layers would detect increasingly higher level and more abstract image attributes the activation strength of each channel on a typical offset image is depicted in fig 6 which is in greyscale the blue colour channels in the first convolution layer are shown to result in the strongest activations intense white conversely the red and orange colour feature maps i e colours which do not contain blue result in significantly smaller or even negative activations black fig 7 shows images causing strong activations within the fully connected layer of the cnn these images closely represent the learned feature maps of the fully connected layer this provides an insight to the specific attributes the network is searching for during classification the feature map for the intact system shows blue features which are searching for the turret offset response in the image the light grey tone of the intact feature map also indicates a strong activation by light white colours implying that the empty space within the image is also important for classification of the intact system conversely the feature map for the broken system contains more concentrated areas of orange this suggests that smaller more specific regions of white will cause a stronger activation of the broken feature map this is generally consistent with the characteristics of the physical system specifically while the system is intact the turret offset is expected to remain more concentrated in a specific area leaving relatively large areas of white empty space within the plot in contrast due to the reduced restoring force a broken system will generally result in more significant offset responses this would be expected to lead to smaller more specific areas of white within the plot additionally the broken fully connected filter is shown to be activated by a darker overall image it is postulated that the network will give a greater weighting to a broken classification if the input image is darker overall i e there is less white empty space in total 4 results and discussion 4 1 overall cnn classification performance on representative environments the performance of the four layer cnn in identifying failure of line e 2 was investigated for a range of environmental conditions which the fpso may operate within the north west shelf of australia firstly the cnn was tested on 500 environments selected at random from the hindcast thus the test was considered to assess the classification accuracy for wind wave and current conditions which would be routinely encountered by the fpso when trained on only 4 or 8 randomly selected environments from the hindcast incurring training times of 3951s and 8558s respectively high classification accuracies of 99 5 were achieved when trained on 16 environments taking 17 036s the test accuracy increased to 99 9 with only a single false classification as further increases the size of the training set did not appear justified relative to the additional training time the cnn trained on 16 environments was considered thereafter secondly to replicate a typical line failure scenario a fortnight period in winter and summer each comprising 112 consecutive environment cases was extracted from the hindcast during which a sudden line failure was simulated this was achieved by deactivating the mooring line from the 57th environmental case onward for both winter and summer periods the network correctly identified the instance when the line breakage occurred moreover for the winter network the first 56 images were all correctly classified as representing intact mooring conditions and the latter 56 images as broken for the period during summer only a single mis classification was observed therefore importantly the findings serve to demonstrate how the cnn can provide reliable assessments in an operational context the cnn was also explicitly assessed for extreme conditions representative of storms or strong surface currents which typically result in the largest turret offsets specifically the cnn was tested using the environments comprising the upper 10 wind and current speeds within the hindcast totalling 1461 and 1459 cases respectively as the extreme winds cases generally corresponded to the largest significant wave heights in the database using this approach the cnn was also inherently tested for extreme wave states the cnn achieved an accuracy of 95 0 and 93 6 for the extreme winds and currents respectively similar to the tests using 500 random environments the misclassifications were associated with false negatives i e a broken line classified as intact the reduction in the accuracy for the environmental extremes is attributed in part to the physical nature of the turret response as a means of demonstrating this the network activations for an image of a broken mooring which was incorrectly classified as intact in an extreme wind environment is shown in fig 8 for this case owing to the severity of the underlying forcing and the reduction in mooring stiffness part of the turret offset response is located around the origin 0 0 of the intact system confusing the network as previously discussed the performance of the cnn in benign environments is also of particular interest given that such conditions are more readily amendable to inspections and repairs to investigate this the network was tasked with classifying a data set comprising images of broken intact turret offsets for environments corresponding to the lowest 5 of wind speeds from the database these environments were also generally associated with the smallest significant wave heights i e less than 0 5m consequently giving rise to relatively small turret displacements about the equilibrium for the benign environments the cnn accuracy was 72 9 thus significantly lower than for the previous tests moreover the accuracy was found to be sensitive to the random generation of training and validation subsets from the original 16 environments from these environments comprising 250 realisations each for both broken and intact conditions 8000 images total 97 of the images were randomly selected to be fed through the network for training each time withholding 240 random images for validation 120 broken 120 intact specifically when an additional 3 identical networks were trained using different training validation subsets the accuracy varied between 77 9 and 100 this sensitivity was not exhibited for the 500 random or extreme environment tests as such it implies that there were particular attributes of the turret response in benign environments which made classification comparatively more challenging 4 2 effect of cnn architecture and retraining given the reduced performance of the cnn for benign conditions it is of interest to explore possible approaches to improve assessment accuracy firstly the sensitivity of the results to the cnn architecture was investigated by additionally developing four 10 layer networks each of these networks varied only in terms of the random selection of the training validation image subsets from the original 16 environments the final convolution layer of the 10 layer networks comprised 256 filters with 256 channels for activation compared to 64 filters and 32 channels for the 4 layer networks the 10 layer networks were found to achieve increased and less variable classification accuracy of between 94 8 and 99 6 therefore this implies that when trained on the same data increasing the number of layers and hence filters allowed for improved refinement of perceptron weights and deeper learning of critical image features the effect of retraining the network was also considered as an alternative independent approach to improving the classification in benign environments in this study retraining refers to the process of taking an already trained cnn and retraining it using a specific set of images which is intentionally similar to the misclassified test cases during retraining the network weights biases etc associated with the convolution layers are not reinitialised or reset instead these values are updated based on the back propagation of the derivative of the network loss during training here the original 4 layer network which was trained on the 16 random environments was retrained up to five times referred to as respective iterations using images associated with benign environments 10 intact and 10 broken no images withheld for validation the network was then tested against a benign image data set comprising 240 images 120 broken and 120 intact that were not included in any of the benign training sets of the respective networks table 1 summarises the classification results for four retrained networks referred to as a b c and d when tested on benign environments as well as the 500 random environments and the extremes the findings demonstrate that a significant increase in accuracy over the original i e zeroth iteration 4 layer network can generally be achieved through retraining however it should be noted that when applied to a network which already exhibited high classification performance retraining led to a reduction in accuracy as evident by the results for network d with 4 hidden layers denoted as d 4 this is attributed to overtraining where the network had begun learning specific image features that were attributed to random variance in the data set as opposed to learning the overall general features of the images used for classification given the improvements demonstrated through retraining it is also of interest to explore whether the technique could be effective when applied to a more simplified cnn architecture to this end following an equivalent approach four 2 layer networks were developed and subjected to multiple iterations of retraining these results are shown in table 2 as anticipated when tested in benign environments the zeroth iteration i e no retraining of the 2 layer network achieved relatively low accuracies of between 53 3 and 85 0 the two networks which had achieved the highest initial accuracies a 2 and b 2 were found to obtain perfect classification with only one iteration of retraining however for the two networks with the lowest initial accuracy the retraining was found to be less effective additionally the retraining process significantly reduced the performance of networks c 2 and d 2 when tested on random or extreme environments to explore whether the lower accuracy for network d 2 was attributed to the architecture or the retraining dataset the network was also retrained from its zeroth iteration using the retraining datasets used for network b furthermore an additional 4 layer network e 4 was also trained and then retrained using the equivalent image dataset for the network d 2 table 3 summarises these respective results which demonstrate that the 4 layer network could achieve high accuracies when retrained using the original d 2 training and retraining dataset however the 2 layer network could not be successfully retrained reinforcing the importance of the underlying architecture if retraining is to be used effectively to further aid in understanding the effect of the retraining and architecture the images which result in strong activations within the final fully connected feature maps learnt by d 2 and e 4 were examined figs 9 and 10 show images causing strong activations for the broken and intact classifications of the fully connected layer for the zeroth and third iteration of retraining of network d 2 respectively several observations and postulations about their attributes can be made firstly it is clear that the network has identified the locations of the turret offsets associated with the intact and broken mooring systems however the network has failed to learn the colour most strongly associated with the offset additionally for both the zeroth and third iteration the fully connected feature map for the 2 layer network is strongly activated by the axes in the image this can be contrasted to the 4 layer network shown in fig 7 for the zeroth iteration and in fig 12 for the third iteration which suggest that the axes possesses no information that is useful in classifying a broken or intact plot fig 11 compares the heat maps of the activation strengths from the final relu layer of both the d 2 and e 4 networks the results correspond to an image that was misclassified by d 2 but was correctly classified by e 4 it is evident that for the d 2 network the relu layer experiences activations over the entire image including the axes for network d 2 other regions where the network has learned that the turret offset could be are also activated highlighted with different shades of blue this suggests that the network did not have a sufficient number of hidden layers to ascertain the correct colour of these features resulting in the presence of white i e empty space still causing an activation this can be contrasted with the strong activation upon just the location of the turret offset for the e 4 network finally it is interesting to consider that when tested on the 500 random and the extreme environments the zeroth iteration of network d 2 achieved a high classification accuracy which then deteriorated substantially when the network was retrained for the zeroth iteration the multi colour including very small regions of blue ellipses in fig 9 suggest that while the correct colour has not been fully identified the network has learnt that some image feature other than white should be at this location the lighter shade of the feature map for the intact mooring compared to that of the broken case also indicates that the network is searching for images which contain more white i e empty space this is consistent with the smaller offset displacements for an intact mooring system it is postulated that it is the combination of these feature map attributes that enabled the network to classify nearly all of the images within the 500 random environment test correctly fig 10 shows that following retraining the images which result in strong activation include large vertical bands of orange these bands of orange serve to detect regions where the blue turret offset is specifically known to not be located for benign cases when the mooring system has failed the turret offset displacement is relatively small and the equilibrium i e mean offset is generally located westward i e in the negative x direction relative to the intact case however in more energetic environments the turret offset can be present in the locations corresponding to the orange bands subsequently resulting in incorrect classification 4 3 considerations for industry with an appropriate number of hidden layers and potentially the use of retraining it has been shown that a cnn has the ability to distinguish and draw on the complexities in the fpso turret response to accurately identify a mooring line failure across a range of representative environmental conditions for industry an appraisal of the proposed solution however requires due consideration of the associated costs and benefits mitigating riser failures and drift off events through early detection of a loss of a single mooring line and not continuing to operate while a failure remains undetected has obvious significant environmental benefits for assets containing hydrocarbons avoiding several years of downtime and losses exceeding us1 billion as has previously been incurred for fpsos which have experienced multi line mooring failures and loss of station keeping gemilang et al 2021 also reinforces the clear financial advantages of an effective monitoring system the performance that can ultimately be achieved for benign environments is particularly encouraging importantly it would provide a greater opportunity to repair a broken line and if necessary shutdown a facility in a timely and safe manner it is emphasised that the cnn was able to detect line failure solely from image processing of the turret offset displacement history with metocean data only required for training given that gps data are routinely available to record the turret offset on an asset and that metocean data are generally expensive to acquire it is envisaged that a robust cnn based system operating in real time for continuous monitoring can also be implemented efficiently and at lower cost compared to alternative mooring integrity systems here it has been demonstrated that this can be set up using only a desktop computer without requiring extensive computational resources cloud computing or the installation of additional instrumentation this is particular advantageous for deployment on an operating asset or remote locations and minimises both capex and opex further while it is acknowledged that the costs of metocean data may reduce in the future many locations where assets operate exhibit complex environmental conditions the provision of reliable continuous environmental data in these locations as required for alternative monitoring systems is likely to remain comparatively expensive this is particularly relevant for the north west shelf of australia where robust estimates of the surface currents require highly calibrated and well resolved numerical models or measurements capable of resolving the spatial variability associated with the strong internal tides while the cnn was specifically applied here to an fpso it is also important to recognise the potential for its wider application within oil and gas for instance the solution could foreseeably be deployed to assist in detecting mooring abnormalities on mobile offshore drilling units modus which have previously suffered progressive mooring line failure and drifted off during hurricanes in the gulf of mexico zhang et al 2009 more broadly the loss of a mooring may have a significant consequence on the operability and survivability of floating offshore wind turbines moorings and installation can comprise a significant portion of the cost of offshore wind projects the importance of monitoring of mooring lines on floating wind turbines for assessing the actual state and the reliability of the system has been emphasised by pham et al 2019 bae et al 2017 have demonstrated how a single line failure of a floating wind turbine leads to changes in the response of the turbine platform their simulations of the horizontal displacements of the platform would therefore provide the necessary input data for implementing a cnn based detection system this could ultimately improve the commercial viability of renewable energy technologies and highlights the transferability of the system across the offshore industry moreover since floating wind farms are likely to comprise large numbers of wind turbines each with their respective moorings systems this also reinforces the economies of scale potentially realisable 5 conclusion a novel application of a cnn to detect a mooring line failure of an fpso using images of the horizontal turret displacement has been demonstrated to an untrained observer the differences in the turret response between an intact and failed a mooring system failure can be particularly challenging to identify achieving a high classification accuracy over a wide range of environmental conditions such as those expected in the north west shelf of australia requires due consideration of the number of hidden layers within the cnn and potentially the use of retraining the ability to detect a failure in benign conditions is particularly advantageous as it could enable a broken line to be repaired in a timely manner as the cnn does not explicitly utilise metocean data as input apart from training it is envisaged that it offers an effective and lower cost alternative to existing mooring failure detection approaches moreover a cnn based solution is considered to be highly transferable and scaleable and thus likely to draw wide interest within the offshore engineering community credit authorship contribution statement k janas conceptualization

20719,a novel application of a convolutional neural network cnn for the identification of mooring line failure of a turret moored fpso is demonstrated the cnn was trained on images of the turret horizontal displacement history simulated for both an intact mooring and a system with one line that had failed when tested on operational and extreme environments representative of the north west shelf of australia the cnn successfully distinguished between the turret responses associated with the intact and broken mooring classification accuracy was found to be lower for relatively benign conditions when the turret offset response was minimal this was significantly improved through the use of additional hidden layers and retraining as the cnn does not explicitly utilise metocean data as input apart from training it is envisaged that it offers an effective and lower cost alternative to existing mooring failure detection approaches for the offshore industry keywords mooring systems machine learning convolutional neural networks 1 introduction floating production storage and offloading fpso units have been widely adopted by the oil and gas industry enabling the development of less accessible or more marginal fields in particular these facilities generally process large quantities of hydrocarbons and loss of containment has the potential to have significant environmental and financial impact brown et al 2005 to ensure production and offloading processes take place safely the mooring integrity of the fpso must be maintained however it has been acknowledged that the probability of mooring failures on offshore oil and gas facilities is relatively high notably since 2000 there have been on average two fpso mooring line failures per year ma et al 2013 several mooring failures were also deemed catastrophic with failure of risers and requiring an extended shut down of the field majhi and d souza 2013 of particular concern is that while mooring systems generally incorporate redundancy single line failures are often undetected in benign conditions the high rate of failure has subsequently drawn significant attention with the initiation of joint industry research programs brown et al 2005 and a growing body of literature on the subject such works have emphasised the need for monitoring systems capable of identifying single line failures in a timely manner which would allow for remediation prior to complete system failure both direct and indirect means of monitoring mooring integrity have been devised systems which are based on measurements of linetension or inclination have been found to lack reliability particularly when instrumentation is below the water line prislin and maroju 2017 to overcome these inherent shortcomings alternative dry methods of monitoring mooring lines have been developed these techniques are generally based on the use of differential global positioning systems dgps to measure the horizontal translations of the asset however those systems which make use of a watch circle often only enable failure to be detected in relatively severe environmental conditions such that remediation before complete failure may not be possible consequentially the offshore industry requires robust new approaches to address this issue one such potential solution is the application of machine learning and artificial neural networks anns see e g handoko 2018 jaiswal and ruskin 2019 and gumley et al 2019 to identify changes in the vessel response following a loss of a mooring line these studies have demonstrated that an ann trained on the mean turret offset or first order wave response can be capable of determining a single line failure for an fpso anns have similarly proved successful in aquaculture where they have been used to assess structural failure of nets and cages subjected to severe environmental loads zhao et al 2019 bi et al 2020 the application of anns in these contexts typically requires significant quantities of meteorological and oceanographic inputs and hydrodynamic response measurements for robust operation across all possible environmental conditions these data are often expensive to acquire limited by spatial and temporal resolution and affected by uncertainty it is therefore appropriate to consider that neural networks are capable of learning and classifying data based on visual qualities the visual features associated with the mooring response i e the time history of the turret offset plotted with respect to the easterly and northerly positions may contain the aforementioned metocean data implicitly as such the network would have the required data for training albeit in a different form the use of visual data in conjunction with neural networks for classification has proven successful for a wide range of applications including within the automotive aviation and medical sectors to the best of the authors knowledge it has not been applied to mooring line integrity monitoring in offshore engineering therefore it could potentially offer a novel solution to the mooring failure detection problem which is robust and more cost effective to implement than existing systems to this end herein a convolutional neural network cnn is developed using images of the turret offset response of a relatively soft moored fpso in the north west shelf of australia the objective is to establish the capabilities of the cnn in the detection of a single line failure over a wide range of metocean conditions expected in the region the cnn is trained and tested using numerical simulations of the vessel response with the metocean input data obtained from a state of the art numerical hindcast to simplify the problem in this study failure of one particular line within the mooring system at the turret is considered the loss of this line gives rise to a specific change in the mooring response of the fpso however the insights are considered to be generalisable to a cnn which may be developed to identify loss of the other mooring lines or different floating structures such as wind turbines furthermore it is also important to emphasise that the focus is on establishing the capability for the cnn to identify whether failure has occurred as opposed to predicting whether failure will occur the paper proceeds as follows an overview of cnns and relevant works are outlined in section 2 to justify the approaches adopted in this study section 3 details the methods by which the fpso data were generated and the describes the cnn architecture and training the performance of the cnn is demonstrated and discussed for a range of environmental conditions in section 4 and contextualises the findings and implications of the study finally the key conclusions are summarised in section 5 2 fundamentals and literature review 2 1 convolutional neural networks convolutional neural networks are a class of deep neural networks which are commonly employed to process imagery extensive coverage of the principles and application of cnns has been provided by goodfellow et al 2016 and yamashita et al 2018 among others fundamentally a cnn classifies imagery by matching pixel patterns within the image to specific learned feature maps via cross correlation of an input matrix image pixel values and a weight matrix creating a map indicating which patterns are found in the input image this process is commonly referred to as convolution the cnn architecture typically comprises convolution layers activation operations pooling layers followed by a fully connected layer generally cnns contain multiple convolution layers and sets of filters or kernels which progressively serve to detect increasingly more complex features in this paper as only two dimensional convolution is used the terms filter or kernel may be used interchangeably kernels are three dimensional arrays comprising numerical weights learned autonomously during training the array dimensions specify its size and the number of feature maps within the filters these feature maps or channels are used to extract different features from the input imagery which correlate to specific classes that the network will use in classification of the input image the presence of certain features on the input image will lead to strong activation of specific channels during convolution these outputs are commonly referred to as convolved features and act as the new input for each successive convolution layer pooling operations after the convolution layer reduce the dimensions of the data and provide spatial invariance in this way the network extracts and stores increasingly more complex features of the imagery while continually reducing the input array size the fully connected layer combines the feature maps of the final convolution layer and maps them to individual output nodes representing the potential output classes of the network these nodes output the probabilities for each class associated with the input image the training process of a cnn involves passing an image data set through the network each image contained in this data set has a pre specified class label in this context broken or intact the network maps each input image to a specific class label by calculating the probability that the image matches the class this probability is then compared to the pre specified class label for the specific image generating a cost function the cost function is minimised by varying the weights found within its kernels for each convolution layer prior to formal testing the network is validated on a sample of training data held back this provides an unbiased estimate of the skill of the model and can also be used for fine tuning the variables within a cnn which determine how the network trains processes and classifies data are referred to as hyperparameters covered in detail by patterson and gibson 2017 spatial hyperparameters define the physical architecture of the network and include the convolution layers filters and filter size amongst others training hyperparameters dictate how the network will train and encompass the learning rate number of epochs and batch size the learning rate refers to the step size within the learning algorithm used to update parameters such as weights based on the estimated error within the model a learning rate that is too low will result in excessive training times while high learning rates may cause divergence within the model the number of epochs defines how many times the complete set of training data is fed through the network during training batch size refers to number of images fed through the network for each training iteration in which learnable network parameters such as perceptron weights are updated these training hyperparameters are inherent to the training algorithm selected for the cnn a learning algorithm defines how the network will minimise its cost function which quantifies the classification error made by the network during training the gradient s of the cost function is calculated via back propagation and optimised using gradient descent methods popular algorithms include stochastic gradient descent with momentum adaptive moment estimation and root mean square propagation which ruder 2017 provides coverage on the effectiveness of the learning algorithm is governed by the selection of the hyperparameters which is discussed in further detail by bergstra and bengio 2012 while cnns have been employed since the 1980 s it is in more recent years where uptake has been most rapid rawat and wang 2017 attribute this in part to increases in the availability of computational resources and improved algorithms the use of cnns has proven to be highly successful in a variety of complex image processing applications including traffic sign recognition jin et al 2014 real time pedestrian identification tom√® et al 2016 and vehicle classification wang et al 2019 payan and montana 2015 schlemper et al 2017 and lin et al 2018 among others have also demonstrated the effectiveness of cnns in medical applications including neuro imaging these studies have demonstrated the ability of cnns to effectively identify and distinguish the edges corners and curvilinear features of numbers and characters in both spatial and temporal scenarios and reinforces their versatility therefore it could be expected that cnns may also be able to learn the features of an image depicting the turret motions of a fpso potentially enabling them to identify mooring failure due to the black box nature of cnns it can be challenging to intuitively understand what the network is learning during training mathworks 2020 zeiler and fergus 2014 utilised a deconvnet to visualise the feature maps and relevant activations of a cnn this was particularly useful for identifying the image features which cause the strongest activations and hence those used by the network for classification class activation mapping cam is another common method used to explore which attributes of an input image result in a strong class activation this involves overlaying a heat map of class specific activation strengths over the input image zhou et al 2016 utilised cam to visualise which areas of a 2d three channel image were most important for discrimination and hence classification as such cam can help inform the particular regions of the image which confused the network mathworks 2020 this is particularly valuable for assessing miss classifications both methods of visualisation are therefore considered appropriate here for exploring the capabilities of cnns when applied to mooring failure prediction and interpreting the results 2 2 acquisition of training data in order to rigorously evaluate the ability of a cnn to identify mooring line failure time histories of fpso responses for both intact and failed mooring line conditions representative of a wide range of environmental conditions are ultimately required these data are generally impractical to obtain in the field and as such numerical approaches are typically sought for this to be a viable alternative to field measurements simulations require input data which are an accurate representation of the environment and must account for the complex non linearities associated with the response of the vessel within the offshore industry long term i e 30 years metocean hindcasts of winds waves and currents are now routinely synthesised using numerical methods these hindcasts are formulated using physics based models of the underlying environmental processes together with assimilation of measurements milne et al 2016 and milne and zed 2018 for instance utilised a hindcast generated from a third generation spectral wave model and a global wind model for the purposes of quantifying the hydrodynamic response of fpsos and drillships through comparisons with measured data the numerically derived environmental data were demonstrated to generally be reliable and able to account for complex multi modal seastates i e comprising both significant swell and wind sea energy therefore justifying their suitability for the purposes of this study herein in terms of computing the response of an fpso i e the turret offset solutions in the time domain are generally necessary to account for the combined effects of low frequency i e difference frequency and wave frequency motions mooring line dynamics and the wind and current loading however as large numbers of simulations are required to obtain training and data sets these simulations must also be numerically efficient simulation techniques which predict the response of a moored vessel based on precomputing the wave induced hydrodynamic responses i e response amplitude operators raos and quadratic transfer functions qtfs and a quasi steady approximation of the mooring line dynamics such as ariane7 bureau veritas 2007 are widely employed within the offshore industry to assess the performance of a mooring system the application of these models is consequently considered to be justifiable for use in the both training and validation of a cnn to identify mooring line failure 3 methods 3 1 site and training data a turret moored fpso in the north west shelf of western australia is considered here the environment conditions are complex and both significant swell and wind wave energy are present throughout the year the region also exhibits significant seasonal variability in summer winds are generally from the south and south west while in winter strong storm winds from the east and south east are experienced in addition to semi diurnal tides the presence of solitions and large eddies can also induce significant surface currents which may persist for several days a state of the art numerical model based on the third generation spectral wave model wavewatch iii tolman 2014 was utilised to develop a hindcast of the complex environment the spectral model was forced using the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr global wind model saha et al 2010 and the wind data were calibrated using measurements from the north west cape owing to difficulties in modelling the surface currents in this region as discussed by astfalck et al 2018 the current data were obtained by repeating a 1 year period of measurements and including a wind shear component the complete hindcast data set spanned five years resulting in a total of 14 608 individual 3h environment cases the wave data were partitioned into both swell and wind sea energy components defining swell as corresponding to wave periods exceeding 9s from which jonswap model hasselmann et al 1973 parameters were estimated these cases were used as input data to the hydrodynamic analysis of the moored fpso response the fpso had an overall length of around 333m with a beam of 58m and draft of 17m fig 1 shows the mooring configuration which comprised nine catenary lines arranged in three bundles around an internal turret which was located 105m forward of the midship the responses were computed in the time domain using the commercial multi body mooring analysis software ariane7 bureau veritas 2007 the hydrodynamic wave responses of the vessel raos and qtfs required as inputs for the mooring analysis were computed using the three dimensional hydrodynamic analysis commercial software seasam hydrod dnv 2013 the wind and current coefficient data lateral and longitudinal forces and yaw moments as a function of heading were acquired from model tests the drag loads on the mooring and riser systems from currents as well as the damping forces acting on the fpso turret due to mooring and riser lines were obtained from a fully dynamic model in orcaflex orcina 2015 which also served to verify the ariane7 model the fpso and computational set up was consistent with that employed by astfalck et al 2019a b from which further details can be attained the simulated time history of the turret centre was recorded in easting and northing coordinates relative to a global datum at a rate of 1hz each simulation was 3h in duration and excluded an initial 3000s period which was associated with initial transients owing to the non linear nature of the responses 250 realisations were simulated for each environment by varying the phases of the underlying wave components initial investigations found that this provided an appropriate quantity of turret offset images for training and evaluating the cnn for each unique environment each environmental case was simulated for both the intact and single line failure scenarios examples of which are shown in fig 2 to simplify the problem only failure of mooring line e2 was considered in this study the loss of the mooring line effectively reduces the restoring force for the fpso which results in the equilibrium position shifting further west relative to the origin 3 2 cnn architecture training and initial validation the cnn was developed using the deep learning toolbox in matlab mathworks 2020 fig 3 shows the architecture of the cnn with four layers which was trained using the turret offset imagery datasets on an intel core i7 4770k cpu 3 50 ghz with 16 gb ram each inner layer of the network comprised the following operations convolution of the input image or output of previous layer using learned feature maps kernels batch normalisation and activation of a leaky rectified linear function relu utilising a scale factor of 0 01 a leaky relu as opposed to a standard relu was implemented due to the former having previously been demonstrated to result in a smaller verification error xu et al 2015 a max pooling operation zhou and chellappa 1988 was also completed between each inner layer to increase training efficiency by down sampling the output of the previous layer this max pooling operation was 2 by 2 with a stride of 2 2 and zero padding the outer layers of the network comprised an image input layer a fully connected layer connecting all weights and associated activation scores a soft max operation and a class output layer using cross entropy to calculate the final classification output of the image layer weight and bias matrices were trained via back propagation of the derivative of the loss cost function of the network the stochastic gradient descent with momentum algorithm with a fixed learning rate of 0 01 was used to solve this function updating network parameters accordingly this algorithm was selected due to the high training performance and frequent use within the literature dogo et al 2018 the images used to train the network were three channel red green blue rgb 875 pixels in width and 656 pixels in height such that the dimensions were 875 656 3 the image design was intentionally simple to reduce training and classification complexity specifically the turret offset was of a single colour the default blue in matlab rgb 0 114 189 with a white background rgb 255 255 255 and black axes rgb 0 0 0 the axes abscissa and ordinates in the images bounding the turret response spanned the physical distances 13 79 x 6 35 m and 7 09 y 8 11 m respectively these axes ranges were determined from the maximum and minimum turret offsets obtained from a random sample of 500 environments repeated for both intact and broken mooring cases and were deemed to provide an adequate resolution of the response during both benign and extreme conditions all images were rendered using opengl open graphics library hardware this is a commonly used programming interface which enables hardware based acceleration during rendering here using a nvidia geforce gtx 1080 ti graphics processing unit with 11gb vram once rendered as 2d vectors all images were saved in raster format as portable network graphics png files it may be noted that imagery used for training cnns can be pre processed to improve visual clarity reduce noise or to highlight specific features for the network during training using techniques such as bilateral filtering zhao et al 2020 this may be particularly advantageous for images originally sourced from photos for instance however since the images here were obtained from simulated data and considered to be sufficiently clear such pre processing techniques were not applied to any training imagery the raw png imagery was used directly as training data for the cnn as a means of visually demonstrating the cnn training and testing process fig 4 shows examples of the heat maps associated with the class activations of the final layer of the cnn in this instance these corresponded to the turret offset plots in fig 2 using cam these maps were generated by taking the product of the activations of the final relu layer within the network referred to as scores and the learned weights of the fully connected layer the activations reveal the location of the features of the input image which influenced the final classification output with red here signifying the greatest contribution mathworks 2020 images which resulted in a strong activation of each specific channel for the first and second layers in the network are shown in fig 5 these suggest that the first and second layer filters learned by the network served to primarily identify colours and edges subsequent layers would detect increasingly higher level and more abstract image attributes the activation strength of each channel on a typical offset image is depicted in fig 6 which is in greyscale the blue colour channels in the first convolution layer are shown to result in the strongest activations intense white conversely the red and orange colour feature maps i e colours which do not contain blue result in significantly smaller or even negative activations black fig 7 shows images causing strong activations within the fully connected layer of the cnn these images closely represent the learned feature maps of the fully connected layer this provides an insight to the specific attributes the network is searching for during classification the feature map for the intact system shows blue features which are searching for the turret offset response in the image the light grey tone of the intact feature map also indicates a strong activation by light white colours implying that the empty space within the image is also important for classification of the intact system conversely the feature map for the broken system contains more concentrated areas of orange this suggests that smaller more specific regions of white will cause a stronger activation of the broken feature map this is generally consistent with the characteristics of the physical system specifically while the system is intact the turret offset is expected to remain more concentrated in a specific area leaving relatively large areas of white empty space within the plot in contrast due to the reduced restoring force a broken system will generally result in more significant offset responses this would be expected to lead to smaller more specific areas of white within the plot additionally the broken fully connected filter is shown to be activated by a darker overall image it is postulated that the network will give a greater weighting to a broken classification if the input image is darker overall i e there is less white empty space in total 4 results and discussion 4 1 overall cnn classification performance on representative environments the performance of the four layer cnn in identifying failure of line e 2 was investigated for a range of environmental conditions which the fpso may operate within the north west shelf of australia firstly the cnn was tested on 500 environments selected at random from the hindcast thus the test was considered to assess the classification accuracy for wind wave and current conditions which would be routinely encountered by the fpso when trained on only 4 or 8 randomly selected environments from the hindcast incurring training times of 3951s and 8558s respectively high classification accuracies of 99 5 were achieved when trained on 16 environments taking 17 036s the test accuracy increased to 99 9 with only a single false classification as further increases the size of the training set did not appear justified relative to the additional training time the cnn trained on 16 environments was considered thereafter secondly to replicate a typical line failure scenario a fortnight period in winter and summer each comprising 112 consecutive environment cases was extracted from the hindcast during which a sudden line failure was simulated this was achieved by deactivating the mooring line from the 57th environmental case onward for both winter and summer periods the network correctly identified the instance when the line breakage occurred moreover for the winter network the first 56 images were all correctly classified as representing intact mooring conditions and the latter 56 images as broken for the period during summer only a single mis classification was observed therefore importantly the findings serve to demonstrate how the cnn can provide reliable assessments in an operational context the cnn was also explicitly assessed for extreme conditions representative of storms or strong surface currents which typically result in the largest turret offsets specifically the cnn was tested using the environments comprising the upper 10 wind and current speeds within the hindcast totalling 1461 and 1459 cases respectively as the extreme winds cases generally corresponded to the largest significant wave heights in the database using this approach the cnn was also inherently tested for extreme wave states the cnn achieved an accuracy of 95 0 and 93 6 for the extreme winds and currents respectively similar to the tests using 500 random environments the misclassifications were associated with false negatives i e a broken line classified as intact the reduction in the accuracy for the environmental extremes is attributed in part to the physical nature of the turret response as a means of demonstrating this the network activations for an image of a broken mooring which was incorrectly classified as intact in an extreme wind environment is shown in fig 8 for this case owing to the severity of the underlying forcing and the reduction in mooring stiffness part of the turret offset response is located around the origin 0 0 of the intact system confusing the network as previously discussed the performance of the cnn in benign environments is also of particular interest given that such conditions are more readily amendable to inspections and repairs to investigate this the network was tasked with classifying a data set comprising images of broken intact turret offsets for environments corresponding to the lowest 5 of wind speeds from the database these environments were also generally associated with the smallest significant wave heights i e less than 0 5m consequently giving rise to relatively small turret displacements about the equilibrium for the benign environments the cnn accuracy was 72 9 thus significantly lower than for the previous tests moreover the accuracy was found to be sensitive to the random generation of training and validation subsets from the original 16 environments from these environments comprising 250 realisations each for both broken and intact conditions 8000 images total 97 of the images were randomly selected to be fed through the network for training each time withholding 240 random images for validation 120 broken 120 intact specifically when an additional 3 identical networks were trained using different training validation subsets the accuracy varied between 77 9 and 100 this sensitivity was not exhibited for the 500 random or extreme environment tests as such it implies that there were particular attributes of the turret response in benign environments which made classification comparatively more challenging 4 2 effect of cnn architecture and retraining given the reduced performance of the cnn for benign conditions it is of interest to explore possible approaches to improve assessment accuracy firstly the sensitivity of the results to the cnn architecture was investigated by additionally developing four 10 layer networks each of these networks varied only in terms of the random selection of the training validation image subsets from the original 16 environments the final convolution layer of the 10 layer networks comprised 256 filters with 256 channels for activation compared to 64 filters and 32 channels for the 4 layer networks the 10 layer networks were found to achieve increased and less variable classification accuracy of between 94 8 and 99 6 therefore this implies that when trained on the same data increasing the number of layers and hence filters allowed for improved refinement of perceptron weights and deeper learning of critical image features the effect of retraining the network was also considered as an alternative independent approach to improving the classification in benign environments in this study retraining refers to the process of taking an already trained cnn and retraining it using a specific set of images which is intentionally similar to the misclassified test cases during retraining the network weights biases etc associated with the convolution layers are not reinitialised or reset instead these values are updated based on the back propagation of the derivative of the network loss during training here the original 4 layer network which was trained on the 16 random environments was retrained up to five times referred to as respective iterations using images associated with benign environments 10 intact and 10 broken no images withheld for validation the network was then tested against a benign image data set comprising 240 images 120 broken and 120 intact that were not included in any of the benign training sets of the respective networks table 1 summarises the classification results for four retrained networks referred to as a b c and d when tested on benign environments as well as the 500 random environments and the extremes the findings demonstrate that a significant increase in accuracy over the original i e zeroth iteration 4 layer network can generally be achieved through retraining however it should be noted that when applied to a network which already exhibited high classification performance retraining led to a reduction in accuracy as evident by the results for network d with 4 hidden layers denoted as d 4 this is attributed to overtraining where the network had begun learning specific image features that were attributed to random variance in the data set as opposed to learning the overall general features of the images used for classification given the improvements demonstrated through retraining it is also of interest to explore whether the technique could be effective when applied to a more simplified cnn architecture to this end following an equivalent approach four 2 layer networks were developed and subjected to multiple iterations of retraining these results are shown in table 2 as anticipated when tested in benign environments the zeroth iteration i e no retraining of the 2 layer network achieved relatively low accuracies of between 53 3 and 85 0 the two networks which had achieved the highest initial accuracies a 2 and b 2 were found to obtain perfect classification with only one iteration of retraining however for the two networks with the lowest initial accuracy the retraining was found to be less effective additionally the retraining process significantly reduced the performance of networks c 2 and d 2 when tested on random or extreme environments to explore whether the lower accuracy for network d 2 was attributed to the architecture or the retraining dataset the network was also retrained from its zeroth iteration using the retraining datasets used for network b furthermore an additional 4 layer network e 4 was also trained and then retrained using the equivalent image dataset for the network d 2 table 3 summarises these respective results which demonstrate that the 4 layer network could achieve high accuracies when retrained using the original d 2 training and retraining dataset however the 2 layer network could not be successfully retrained reinforcing the importance of the underlying architecture if retraining is to be used effectively to further aid in understanding the effect of the retraining and architecture the images which result in strong activations within the final fully connected feature maps learnt by d 2 and e 4 were examined figs 9 and 10 show images causing strong activations for the broken and intact classifications of the fully connected layer for the zeroth and third iteration of retraining of network d 2 respectively several observations and postulations about their attributes can be made firstly it is clear that the network has identified the locations of the turret offsets associated with the intact and broken mooring systems however the network has failed to learn the colour most strongly associated with the offset additionally for both the zeroth and third iteration the fully connected feature map for the 2 layer network is strongly activated by the axes in the image this can be contrasted to the 4 layer network shown in fig 7 for the zeroth iteration and in fig 12 for the third iteration which suggest that the axes possesses no information that is useful in classifying a broken or intact plot fig 11 compares the heat maps of the activation strengths from the final relu layer of both the d 2 and e 4 networks the results correspond to an image that was misclassified by d 2 but was correctly classified by e 4 it is evident that for the d 2 network the relu layer experiences activations over the entire image including the axes for network d 2 other regions where the network has learned that the turret offset could be are also activated highlighted with different shades of blue this suggests that the network did not have a sufficient number of hidden layers to ascertain the correct colour of these features resulting in the presence of white i e empty space still causing an activation this can be contrasted with the strong activation upon just the location of the turret offset for the e 4 network finally it is interesting to consider that when tested on the 500 random and the extreme environments the zeroth iteration of network d 2 achieved a high classification accuracy which then deteriorated substantially when the network was retrained for the zeroth iteration the multi colour including very small regions of blue ellipses in fig 9 suggest that while the correct colour has not been fully identified the network has learnt that some image feature other than white should be at this location the lighter shade of the feature map for the intact mooring compared to that of the broken case also indicates that the network is searching for images which contain more white i e empty space this is consistent with the smaller offset displacements for an intact mooring system it is postulated that it is the combination of these feature map attributes that enabled the network to classify nearly all of the images within the 500 random environment test correctly fig 10 shows that following retraining the images which result in strong activation include large vertical bands of orange these bands of orange serve to detect regions where the blue turret offset is specifically known to not be located for benign cases when the mooring system has failed the turret offset displacement is relatively small and the equilibrium i e mean offset is generally located westward i e in the negative x direction relative to the intact case however in more energetic environments the turret offset can be present in the locations corresponding to the orange bands subsequently resulting in incorrect classification 4 3 considerations for industry with an appropriate number of hidden layers and potentially the use of retraining it has been shown that a cnn has the ability to distinguish and draw on the complexities in the fpso turret response to accurately identify a mooring line failure across a range of representative environmental conditions for industry an appraisal of the proposed solution however requires due consideration of the associated costs and benefits mitigating riser failures and drift off events through early detection of a loss of a single mooring line and not continuing to operate while a failure remains undetected has obvious significant environmental benefits for assets containing hydrocarbons avoiding several years of downtime and losses exceeding us1 billion as has previously been incurred for fpsos which have experienced multi line mooring failures and loss of station keeping gemilang et al 2021 also reinforces the clear financial advantages of an effective monitoring system the performance that can ultimately be achieved for benign environments is particularly encouraging importantly it would provide a greater opportunity to repair a broken line and if necessary shutdown a facility in a timely and safe manner it is emphasised that the cnn was able to detect line failure solely from image processing of the turret offset displacement history with metocean data only required for training given that gps data are routinely available to record the turret offset on an asset and that metocean data are generally expensive to acquire it is envisaged that a robust cnn based system operating in real time for continuous monitoring can also be implemented efficiently and at lower cost compared to alternative mooring integrity systems here it has been demonstrated that this can be set up using only a desktop computer without requiring extensive computational resources cloud computing or the installation of additional instrumentation this is particular advantageous for deployment on an operating asset or remote locations and minimises both capex and opex further while it is acknowledged that the costs of metocean data may reduce in the future many locations where assets operate exhibit complex environmental conditions the provision of reliable continuous environmental data in these locations as required for alternative monitoring systems is likely to remain comparatively expensive this is particularly relevant for the north west shelf of australia where robust estimates of the surface currents require highly calibrated and well resolved numerical models or measurements capable of resolving the spatial variability associated with the strong internal tides while the cnn was specifically applied here to an fpso it is also important to recognise the potential for its wider application within oil and gas for instance the solution could foreseeably be deployed to assist in detecting mooring abnormalities on mobile offshore drilling units modus which have previously suffered progressive mooring line failure and drifted off during hurricanes in the gulf of mexico zhang et al 2009 more broadly the loss of a mooring may have a significant consequence on the operability and survivability of floating offshore wind turbines moorings and installation can comprise a significant portion of the cost of offshore wind projects the importance of monitoring of mooring lines on floating wind turbines for assessing the actual state and the reliability of the system has been emphasised by pham et al 2019 bae et al 2017 have demonstrated how a single line failure of a floating wind turbine leads to changes in the response of the turbine platform their simulations of the horizontal displacements of the platform would therefore provide the necessary input data for implementing a cnn based detection system this could ultimately improve the commercial viability of renewable energy technologies and highlights the transferability of the system across the offshore industry moreover since floating wind farms are likely to comprise large numbers of wind turbines each with their respective moorings systems this also reinforces the economies of scale potentially realisable 5 conclusion a novel application of a cnn to detect a mooring line failure of an fpso using images of the horizontal turret displacement has been demonstrated to an untrained observer the differences in the turret response between an intact and failed a mooring system failure can be particularly challenging to identify achieving a high classification accuracy over a wide range of environmental conditions such as those expected in the north west shelf of australia requires due consideration of the number of hidden layers within the cnn and potentially the use of retraining the ability to detect a failure in benign conditions is particularly advantageous as it could enable a broken line to be repaired in a timely manner as the cnn does not explicitly utilise metocean data as input apart from training it is envisaged that it offers an effective and lower cost alternative to existing mooring failure detection approaches moreover a cnn based solution is considered to be highly transferable and scaleable and thus likely to draw wide interest within the offshore engineering community credit authorship contribution statement k janas conceptualization
