8810,in the formation waters occurring in coal mines in the upper silesian coal basin poland different pollutants are present which may cause damages to the environment among them radium isotopes in several collieries the radium removal from mine water was necessary to mitigate negative results of radium release with mine effluents the most efficient method of radium removal is based on the application of barium chloride implemented in full technical scale in two of polish collieries another possibility of removal radium isotopes from salty waters is an application of zeolites in this paper a review of different techniques is given showing possibilities of application of different methods of radium removal its advantages and drawbacks keywords radium mine water water treatment brine purification 1 introduction the problem of enhanced concentrations of radium in effluents has been found in uranium mines and mills at first 1 3 it was necessary to treat wastewaters before disposal into the environment to remove radium and avoid contamination of watercourses 4 6 a similar problem of enhanced radium content in formation waters was found in the oil and gas industry 7 8 finally it became obvious that any underground exploitation may lead to the release of brines with an enhanced concentration of radium isotopes 9 11 radium isotopes can be found in drinking waters coming from underground aquifers too 12 13 the problem of high radium content in brines in polish coal mines has been discovered in the early 70s of last century 11 enhanced concentrations of radium in effluents from coal mines in upper silesian coal basin uscb are leading to the contamination of surface waters 14 therefore not only monitoring but control of radium concentrations in these waters is required 15 in the past enhanced radium activities have been measured in waters released from eleven out of sixty six coal mines in uscb nowadays due to mitigation measures applied in some mines this number is down to five mines within 15 years between 1990 and 2005 the total activity of radium isotopes released by the mining industry to the natural environment was lower of about 70 than previously 16 despite that the total release of radium activity was at the end of 2005 equal 120 mbq day for 226ra and 220 mbq day in case of 228ra 16 that was one of the reasons that further measures were required to solve the problem of radioactive pollution entirely unfortunately due to deepening of the mines in the period 2000 2015 the new inflows of radium rich brines appeared in uscb collieries therefore the total activity of radium isotopes released to the environment started to rise again 17 the more stringent environmental regulations concerning radioactive discharges 18 19 introduced into polish legal system at the end of the 80s of last century caused the need to investigate the possibility of decontaminating the mine waters the first task was to design the method for the treatment of waters containing radium and barium which was relatively simple 20 such method of radium removal has been implemented in two collieries in the early 1990s and have resulted in a substantial reduction in the amount of radium pumped to the surface 15 more difficult problem was the radium removal from sulphate rich brines without a carrier for radium in one of such collieries releasing radium isotopes into a surface settling pond and finally into vistula river saline brines are very common and the total inflow into mine galleries exceeds 20 m3 min radium concentration in these brines was as high as 12 kbq m3 for 226ra and 20 kbq m3 for 228ra due to the lack of barium in brines the spontaneous co precipitation of radium was negligible and only small part of radium remained underground as a result of adsorption on bottom sediments in underground water galleries 14 2 radium removal from water the treatment for removal of radium from waters has been introduced at first in uranium mining and milling 21 22 the purification of radium waters has been the subject of numerous studies mainly due to the fact that sewage from mines and uranium ore processing plants was a very serious source of environmental contamination with the 226ra isotope many different methods of water treatment were studied some of them have been used on an industrial scale the following methods of removing radium from water can be mentioned co precipitation of raso4 with baso4 filtration coagulation and flocculation adsorption and ion exchange reverse osmosis selective retention on mineral membranes aeration chelating agents ion exchange foam separation co precipitation with nitrate lead extraction in solvents most of the above mentioned methods have not gone beyond the experimental phase some are only used as supportive techniques like filtration coagulation etc yet others for example aeration are only used for drinking water there are some reports of using the above mentioned methods on a technical scale adsorption on barite was used to purify waters from the uranium processing plant in the united states and canada in the 1960s 23 but later this method has been changed for the co precipitation of radium barium sulphate ion exchangers were used for the purification of water from uranium mines in czechoslovakia 24 as well as in one installation in canada 23 where this method was the final stage of wastewater treatment from the processing plant after neutralization applied simultaneously with the barium chloride treatment and filtration of all the above mentioned methods of radium wastewater treatment co precipitation with barium sulphate is the most widespread because it is relatively simple and cheap as it has been mentioned the most common technique was the use of barium chloride leading to the co precipitation of barium and radium sulphates removal of radium is based on chemical reactions these reactions are as follows when barium chloride is used for this purpose at first the barium chloride dissolves in the water bacl2 ba2 2 cl next step of the reaction is the co precipitation of radium and barium ions as sulphates already present in the water in case of radium the reaction is not stoichiometric ba2 ra2 2so4 2 bara so2 4 as a result of the latter reaction small crystals of barium sulphate are formed but they need a certain time for sedimentation another option in uranium mining was the use of ion exchange resins 25 to remove radium from effluents usually very efficient but expensive the different problem has been encountered in the oil and gas industry where the formation waters usually contain not only radium but also barium and strontium in such cases when formation waters were mixed with any waters containing sulphate ions the spontaneous co precipitation of radium barium and strontium occurred and deposits with high radium activity concentration were formed 26 it was leading to scaling in pipelines and other elements of oil rigs but also contamination of the environment in the coal industry in poland there were technical but also legal reasons to start development of radium removal techniques from brines 18 19 at first the treatment technology was developed for radium and barium rich waters and implemented in two coal mines 20 it was based on the use of the waste product from the fertilizers industry phosphogypsum later on the technique of radium removal from sulphate and radium rich waters was developed patented and finally introduced in two collieries 15 this method is based on continuous feeding of powdered barium chloride into treated water which flows into sedimentation galleries where barium and radium sulphate is deposited a specific type of wastewater are mine waters for example barium and radium rich waters it means waters containing ba2 ions but no sulphate ions occurring in some hard coal mines in upper silesia they are heavily mineralized brines the method for cleaning such waters was developed by lebecka and co workers 20 it involved the feeding of gypsums to the waters for purification gypsum was slowly dissolved and the sulphate ions thus supplied reacted with the barium and radium ions present in the water causing coprecipitation of radium and barium sulphate barium ion concentrations in these waters ranged from several dozen mg l to 2 g l so it was quite sufficient to ensure the precipitation process waste gypsums such as phosphogypsum or gypsum from the mine water desalination plant were used for this purpose the radium concentration in these types of gypsum was between 500 800 bq kg in case of phosphogypsum and below 300 bq kg for gypsum from the desalination plant 27 the process was carried out in underground excavations of mines and possibly supplemented in a settling pond on the surface in some cases water flow through the phosphogypsum layer was used the amount of gypsum or phosphogypsum needed to clean 1 m3 of water was about 1 kg this method was implemented in full scale in two coal mines in one of them about 6 0 m3 min of water was purified in which the initial concentration of radium 226ra was approximately 20 kbq m3 and after the purification the water discharged into the settling pond did not contain more than 0 3 0 4 kbq m3 of 226ra in the second mine the initial concentration of radium 226ra in water was of about 12 kbq m3 and after purification it was below 0 7 kbq m3 the amount of treated water was about 1 5 m3 min radium waters from hard coal mines are characterized not only by the presence of radium 226ra but also 228ra in the case of barium and radium rich waters the ratio of the concentration of 228ra is usually 0 5 0 8 in comparison with the concentration level of 226ra in the case of sulphate and radium rich waters it means containing no barium but sulphates ions the ratio of 228ra to 226ra activity can reach even value about 3 then the critical problem was to bring down the total 226ra and 228ra concentrations below 0 7 kbq m3 in the purification process which level was a permissible concentration due to legislation in this period 19 nowadays the limit for radium isotopes concentration in wastewater from mines is 1 0 kbq m3 28 while the limit for barium content is 1 mg l 29 the reference levels of radium isotopes in drinking water in eu and in poland are 0 5 kbq m3 in case of 226ra and 0 2 kbq m3 for 228ra 29 30 the problems with the feeding of hygroscopic material enforced the investigations of other possible methods of radium removal from mine waters 31 the use of zeolite material has been tested in surface installation in one of the collieries in the period 2015 2016 but results were not sufficient mostly due to the presence of mechanical suspension in treated waters therefore for treatment the mine waters the solution of barium chloride was finally chosen as the best while zeolite beds can be used for the treatment of drinking waters spa waters etc mostly due to the fact that radium removal efficiency for such beds was not exceeding 60 32 the purification of radium from drinking water is usually carried out together with other water treatment processes these processes are not particularly effective in removing radium but generally allow the achievement of satisfactory results the following processes should be mentioned here 23 1 3 5 6 15 24 32 33 1 3 5 6 15 23 24 32 33 aeration 15 30 of radium removal efficiency iron and manganese removal efficiency 10 to 85 filtration and sedimentation 50 efficiency coagulation and sorption 80 efficiency demineralization high efficiency for some processes exceeding 90 reverse osmosis efficiency of 96 ion exchange 95 efficiency softening 85 efficiency the use of acrylic fibres impregnated with mno2 efficiency reaching 96 particularly noteworthy was the method used by friedman and coauthors 33 for treatment of mineral waters from radium using barite applied in full scale in the health resort of helein near salzburg the cleaning effect was satisfactory a significant reduction in the concentration of radium was achieved up to 70 80 while maintaining all the other parameters that determine the healing properties of mineral waters problems with enhanced radium content in drinking water supplies may lead to the formation of slags with enhanced radioactivity it occurs in cases when aeration is used to remove iron and manganese from water in this way iron hydroxide and manganese dioxide are produced and radium isotopes are adsorbed on these materials afterwards the disposal of slugs into the environment without any restrictions may be problematic as the exemption level for norm materials was set for the eu member states as 1 bq g 1 kbq kg 34 3 underground treatment installations in polish collieries the initial concept of radium bearing waters treatment in collieries was based on the following assumptions first of all formation waters from the entire mine must be treated then the water should be directed to the feeding station where phosphogypsum or barium chloride will be added after the chemical reaction of co precipitation of radium and barium the water will be directed to the system of sedimentary galleries or mined out zones where sedimentation of radium barium sulphate and the non radioactive suspension will occur from the sedimentation system clarified waters will go to water galleries and pumping stations and be pumped to the surface from there the treatment of sulphate and radium rich waters has been started in the colliery a since 1999 and in colliery b since 2006 during this time a lot of experience in the maintenance of the purification plant was gathered which confirmed the previously formulated criteria for the efficient functioning of the radium bearing water treatment system first of all the assumption was made that the use of barium chloride and continuous feeding of the chemical would allow achieving very good cleaning effects especially if all waters flowing to a particular horizon or to the whole mine are treated it also turned out that as a result of the isolation of the mine area where the treatment is carried out the radiation exposure of the mine crew can be kept at the low level as before cleaning it should be mentioned that the polish treatment installation was the first one worldwide built in non uranium mine 15 in a colliery the radium bearing water treatment system was constructed in the central part of the mine at the level of 650 m the feeding station of the barium chloride was located in the intersection between the main roadways of the level a gravitational inflow of water to the site from the western part of the colliery was constructed from the eastern part of the colliery water was supplied via a pipeline from a pumping station built specifically for this purpose in the feeding chamber a doubled barium chloride feeder was installed the water to be treated was flowing in the sewage channel underneath and the barium chloride was feeding continuously with dosage 50 g m3 special barriers were installed in the channel increasing the turbulence of the flowing water which ensured better conditions for mixing of the cleaning agent with water the reason for such a construction was to accelerate the dissolution of barium chloride and thus the subsequent reaction of the precipitation of barium and radium sulphate from the channel the water was gravitationally drained by a pipeline ø 600 mm and a length of about 600 m to the sedimentation galleries where the mechanical non radioactive suspension and sediments were deposited these settling system consisted of five parallel galleries with a length of about 1050 m each an average cross section of each gallery was approximately 18 m2 the sedimentation system was isolated from the remaining part of the mine water dams were built to prevent the leakage of water from the system to other workings in this area during the first 4 years of operation 1999 2003 the radium water treatment system at level 650 m was operating properly unfortunately in the following years there were problems with the maintenance of the installation these problems were solved on a regular basis but caused temporary deterioration of the cleaning results in 2007 the capacity of the system was so limited that only half of the water flowing into the level of 650 m was flowing through the system the operation of the purification system did not ensure the assumed parameters of removing radium from waters at level 650 m despite the high costs and workload incurred by the mine over its maintenance then the system was completely blocked at the end of 2009 and for this reason it was necessary to improve the existing technology in 2007 the reasons for blocking the system were identified the pipeline discharging water from the feeding station was partially blocked the reason for blocking was the improper constructional solution of the connection of downpipes with the pipeline leading to the insulating dam this resulted in a blind end where the accumulation of barium sulphate followed resulting in the gradual scaling of the downpipes and finally the decrease in the flow this problem was solved only in 2010 when the employees of the colliery disassembled the pipeline after cleaning the pipes the pipeline was reassembled and the radium water treatment system was put back into operation the experiments with the use of barium chloride solution for radium removal has been started in the year 2016 in colliery a the feeding station was designed and built at the level 500 m to treat medium salty waters at that level preliminary results of the treatment were very good described elsewhere 26 future treatment installations in other mines should be based on this technology the exploitation of the treatment installation in colliery b has been started in the year 2006 at the 650 m horizon see fig 1 there are also inflows of sulphate and radium rich brines therefore the method of treatment based on use the of barium chloride was applied the inflows of water were collected in raw water galleries then pumped to the feeding station and treated waster was flowing down the sedimentation galleries leaving the barium and radium sulphates there after sedimentation the purified water was transported gravitationally to the main pumping station and disposed to the surface this was the second installation of this type in polish coal mines therefore the research plan and their scope as well as the schedule for the implementation of the treatment technology were based on the experience acquired during the implementation of the method in the a colliery the start up period lasted several months and confirmed very good results of water treatment the calculations carried out after a year of operation of the system showed the following effects the average concentration of radium 228ra in the water before purification was of about 5 5 kbq m3 while radium 226ra concentration was lower 3 0 kbq m3 the measurements done during the implementation showed that in the water discharged to the surface the average concentrations of these isotopes were respectively 0 4 kbq m3 for 228ra while for 226ra approximately 0 2 kbq m3 assuming that about 13 000 m3 of saline water was discharged to the surface within 24 h the initial daily activity of radium isotopes in these waters was approximately 75 mbq for 228ra and almost 40 mbq for 226ra after treatment the radium isotopes activity in water decreases 10 times down to only 6 mbq day for 228ra and 3 mbq day for 226ra at the end of the first year of exploitation of the installation discharge of radium isotopes was reduced by more than 100 mbq per day or nearly 40 gbq per year as part of the ratzeo pbs b2 14 2014 research project investigations were conducted on the possibility of using a mixture of zeolites for the treatment of radium bearing waters these tests were performed in a pilot modular installation in which water was cleaned after sedimentation of the mechanical suspension in the surface settling these studies have shown that the use of a zeolite deposit in underground excavations will be complicated due to the filling of the bed by a mechanical suspension and a gradual decrease in the purification efficiency the zeolite based installation was built on the surface in the vicinity of the settling pond of colliery b in the year 2015 see fig 2 and fig 3 preceded by long term laboratory experiments 32 results of laboratory investigations were very promising the achieved radium removal efficiency was of about 95 98 for a mixture containing only 10 of zeolite materials the pilot tests lasted 15 months from october 2015 till december 2016 in total during the pilot tests about 1320 water samples were collected and tested about 40 samples of zeolite mixtures were taken and measured before and after their use environmental tests of possible changes in gamma background and doses received by employees were also conducted the system was a modular solution to allow easy exchange the zeolite after each experiment in two parallel pipelines 60 cartridges were connected to form pipelines containing roughly 1 ton of the zeolite bed in each pipeline contrary to laboratory experiments the low radium removal efficiency was achieved during the first 8 months of experiments not exceeding 30 experimental research has shown that in installations for removing radium from mine waters it will be necessary to use a zeolite bed with a much higher content of zeolite mixture at a level of at least 40 of the total mass of the deposit when used the radium removal efficiency was at level 60 70 for such a mixture such a deposit should provide purification of underground water for several months during this time the suspension in the treated waters would have a significant impact on the decrease of adsorption and filtration efficiency if the concentration of suspension at the inlet to the system will not exceed 10 15 mg l the system should work of about half of a year unfortunately with the increase of the suspension content the possible time of effective removal of radium by zeolites would decrease significantly the results of the field tests clearly show that the underground water should have to undergo the process of removing the mechanical suspension before treatment in the radium removal system 4 summary water treatment technologies aimed at the removal of natural radionuclides mostly radium are applied in different industrial branches not only in uranium mining one of the possible application in drinking water treatment in these countries where limits of radionuclides concentrations are set for example usa 0 148 bq l of 226ra or european union 0 5 bq l of 226ra and 0 2 bq l of 228ra the very important issue is not to worsen any other parameters of treated water removal of radium from formation waters in oil and gas industries is important especially when contamination of the marine environment is possible like at north sea norwegian or british platforms it must be taken into account that any type of underground mining and processing of minerals may lead to the release of effluents with enhanced concentrations of natural radionuclides and often mitigation measures are necessary one of the examples of the non uranium industry causing environmental pollution is the polish coal mining industry in several collieries mitigation measures were applied to prevent the technical problems with dewatering systems exploitation and contamination of the environment implementation of treatment technologies in active collieries proved that the best method of radium removal from sulphate rich water is the use of barium chloride application of this technology will ensure the high efficiency of radium removal exceeding 90 in two installations in polish collieries moreover the use of barium chloride solution instead of powdered chemical is a way to full automation of the process lower workload and much lower risk of contamination for the staff of course the risk assessment and radiation hazard calculations must be done in the case of barium rich waters the cleaning agent must be a soluble sulphate chemical gypsum sodium sulphate in amounts high enough to ensure complete removal of barium and co precipitation of radium it can be seen that for removal of radium isotopes from mine waters specific methods must be applied due to high salinity of brines and the presence of other contaminants therefore the chosen methods must be robust applicable for treatment huge volumes of water up to few tens of m3 per minute and selective for removal just radium isotopes acknowledgements this work was supported by the ministry of science and higher education poland 11355018 the research was partly supported by polish ministry of higher

worldwide built in non uranium mine 15 in a colliery the radium bearing water treatment system was constructed in the central part of the mine at the level of 650 m the feeding station of the barium chloride was located in the intersection between the main roadways of the level a gravitational inflow of water to the site from the western part of the colliery was constructed from the eastern part of the colliery water was supplied via a pipeline from a pumping station built specifically for this purpose in the feeding chamber a doubled barium chloride feeder was installed the water to be treated was flowing in the sewage channel underneath and the barium chloride was feeding continuously with dosage 50 g m3 special barriers were installed in the channel increasing the turbulence of the flowing water which ensured better conditions for mixing of the cleaning agent with water the reason for such a construction was to accelerate the dissolution of barium chloride and thus the subsequent reaction of the precipitation of barium and radium sulphate from the channel the water was gravitationally drained by a pipeline ø 600 mm and a length of about 600 m to the sedimentation galleries where the mechanical non radioactive suspension and sediments were deposited these settling system consisted of five parallel galleries with a length of about 1050 m each an average cross section of each gallery was approximately 18 m2 the sedimentation system was isolated from the remaining part of the mine water dams were built to prevent the leakage of water from the system to other workings in this area during the first 4 years of operation 1999 2003 the radium water treatment system at level 650 m was operating properly unfortunately in the following years there were problems with the maintenance of the installation these problems were solved on a regular basis but caused temporary deterioration of the cleaning results in 2007 the capacity of the system was so limited that only half of the water flowing into the level of 650 m was flowing through the system the operation of the purification system did not ensure the assumed parameters of removing radium from waters at level 650 m despite the high costs and workload incurred by the mine over its maintenance then the system was completely blocked at the end of 2009 and for this reason it was necessary to improve the existing technology in 2007 the reasons for blocking the system were identified the pipeline discharging water from the feeding station was partially blocked the reason for blocking was the improper constructional solution of the connection of downpipes with the pipeline leading to the insulating dam this resulted in a blind end where the accumulation of barium sulphate followed resulting in the gradual scaling of the downpipes and finally the decrease in the flow this problem was solved only in 2010 when the employees of the colliery disassembled the pipeline after cleaning the pipes the pipeline was reassembled and the radium water treatment system was put back into operation the experiments with the use of barium chloride solution for radium removal has been started in the year 2016 in colliery a the feeding station was designed and built at the level 500 m to treat medium salty waters at that level preliminary results of the treatment were very good described elsewhere 26 future treatment installations in other mines should be based on this technology the exploitation of the treatment installation in colliery b has been started in the year 2006 at the 650 m horizon see fig 1 there are also inflows of sulphate and radium rich brines therefore the method of treatment based on use the of barium chloride was applied the inflows of water were collected in raw water galleries then pumped to the feeding station and treated waster was flowing down the sedimentation galleries leaving the barium and radium sulphates there after sedimentation the purified water was transported gravitationally to the main pumping station and disposed to the surface this was the second installation of this type in polish coal mines therefore the research plan and their scope as well as the schedule for the implementation of the treatment technology were based on the experience acquired during the implementation of the method in the a colliery the start up period lasted several months and confirmed very good results of water treatment the calculations carried out after a year of operation of the system showed the following effects the average concentration of radium 228ra in the water before purification was of about 5 5 kbq m3 while radium 226ra concentration was lower 3 0 kbq m3 the measurements done during the implementation showed that in the water discharged to the surface the average concentrations of these isotopes were respectively 0 4 kbq m3 for 228ra while for 226ra approximately 0 2 kbq m3 assuming that about 13 000 m3 of saline water was discharged to the surface within 24 h the initial daily activity of radium isotopes in these waters was approximately 75 mbq for 228ra and almost 40 mbq for 226ra after treatment the radium isotopes activity in water decreases 10 times down to only 6 mbq day for 228ra and 3 mbq day for 226ra at the end of the first year of exploitation of the installation discharge of radium isotopes was reduced by more than 100 mbq per day or nearly 40 gbq per year as part of the ratzeo pbs b2 14 2014 research project investigations were conducted on the possibility of using a mixture of zeolites for the treatment of radium bearing waters these tests were performed in a pilot modular installation in which water was cleaned after sedimentation of the mechanical suspension in the surface settling these studies have shown that the use of a zeolite deposit in underground excavations will be complicated due to the filling of the bed by a mechanical suspension and a gradual decrease in the purification efficiency the zeolite based installation was built on the surface in the vicinity of the settling pond of colliery b in the year 2015 see fig 2 and fig 3 preceded by long term laboratory experiments 32 results of laboratory investigations were very promising the achieved radium removal efficiency was of about 95 98 for a mixture containing only 10 of zeolite materials the pilot tests lasted 15 months from october 2015 till december 2016 in total during the pilot tests about 1320 water samples were collected and tested about 40 samples of zeolite mixtures were taken and measured before and after their use environmental tests of possible changes in gamma background and doses received by employees were also conducted the system was a modular solution to allow easy exchange the zeolite after each experiment in two parallel pipelines 60 cartridges were connected to form pipelines containing roughly 1 ton of the zeolite bed in each pipeline contrary to laboratory experiments the low radium removal efficiency was achieved during the first 8 months of experiments not exceeding 30 experimental research has shown that in installations for removing radium from mine waters it will be necessary to use a zeolite bed with a much higher content of zeolite mixture at a level of at least 40 of the total mass of the deposit when used the radium removal efficiency was at level 60 70 for such a mixture such a deposit should provide purification of underground water for several months during this time the suspension in the treated waters would have a significant impact on the decrease of adsorption and filtration efficiency if the concentration of suspension at the inlet to the system will not exceed 10 15 mg l the system should work of about half of a year unfortunately with the increase of the suspension content the possible time of effective removal of radium by zeolites would decrease significantly the results of the field tests clearly show that the underground water should have to undergo the process of removing the mechanical suspension before treatment in the radium removal system 4 summary water treatment technologies aimed at the removal of natural radionuclides mostly radium are applied in different industrial branches not only in uranium mining one of the possible application in drinking water treatment in these countries where limits of radionuclides concentrations are set for example usa 0 148 bq l of 226ra or european union 0 5 bq l of 226ra and 0 2 bq l of 228ra the very important issue is not to worsen any other parameters of treated water removal of radium from formation waters in oil and gas industries is important especially when contamination of the marine environment is possible like at north sea norwegian or british platforms it must be taken into account that any type of underground mining and processing of minerals may lead to the release of effluents with enhanced concentrations of natural radionuclides and often mitigation measures are necessary one of the examples of the non uranium industry causing environmental pollution is the polish coal mining industry in several collieries mitigation measures were applied to prevent the technical problems with dewatering systems exploitation and contamination of the environment implementation of treatment technologies in active collieries proved that the best method of radium removal from sulphate rich water is the use of barium chloride application of this technology will ensure the high efficiency of radium removal exceeding 90 in two installations in polish collieries moreover the use of barium chloride solution instead of powdered chemical is a way to full automation of the process lower workload and much lower risk of contamination for the staff of course the risk assessment and radiation hazard calculations must be done in the case of barium rich waters the cleaning agent must be a soluble sulphate chemical gypsum sodium sulphate in amounts high enough to ensure complete removal of barium and co precipitation of radium it can be seen that for removal of radium isotopes from mine waters specific methods must be applied due to high salinity of brines and the presence of other contaminants therefore the chosen methods must be robust applicable for treatment huge volumes of water up to few tens of m3 per minute and selective for removal just radium isotopes acknowledgements this work was supported by the ministry of science and higher education poland 11355018 the research was partly supported by polish ministry of higher

8811,hydropower biomass and thermal power plants hpps bpps and tpps consume water the wf tool quantifies freshwater consumption we calculated direct and indirect wfs of 255 ecuadorian power plants using different technologies and fuels classified into eleven subclasses median wfs are largest for bpps followed by hpps while wfs of tpps were smallest but variation in subclasses is enormous for hpps dammed hpps have relatively large blue wfs run of the river hpps have relatively small wfs although they are significant to their electricity output the cooling system is paramount for tpps subclasses water efficient cooling systems once through and dry cooling have 20 smaller wfs than wet tower systems moreover the fuel used affects the direct wf of tpps significantly fuel and residue oil require water intensive preheating some diesel fired tpps use water as ghg control bpps are water intensive because biomass has a large wf technology and fuel variation indicate pathways towards more water efficient electricity mixes graphical abstract image 1 1 introduction in general traditional electricity generation in thermal power plants consumes significant volumes of freshwater for the operation mainly for cooling and for the fuel life cycles 1 5 electricity generated by renewable sources e g hydropower or biomass fired thermal power plants also consumes large amounts of water 6 7 while other renewable sources e g wind or solar have a small water consumption 1 electricity generation is expected to grow while freshwater sources are expected to become scarcer 3 8 electricity is not the only consumer of freshwater in a basin agriculture households and industries also require water freshwater availability is limited 9 and the growing demand from all users is the reason why water can become more scarce after the construction of power plants this constitutes a constraint for electricity production 10 existing knowledge about water footprints of electricity includes three clusters of studies the first cluster has assessed the water requirements of different electricity generation technologies and fuels 1 5 11 14 they have shown water consumption ranges of some technologies for benchmarking purposes they have shown that some technologies and fuels are more water efficient than others the second cluster includes studies that quantified water consumption for specific technologies to show differences within similar technologies in different regions 6 7 15 16 they have shown that there are large variations among power plants with similar technologies these variations are caused by spatial conditions regional differences and characteristics of fuel use however these two clusters of studies did not address specific electricity technologies e g certain types of run of the river hydropower plants or stationary internal combustion engines and other fossil fuels besides coal natural gas and crude oil e g crude oil derivatives used for electricity generation finally the third cluster includes studies that have used the two previous clusters to define water consumption for energy mixes including electricity at the global scale 17 19 or inside a particular boundary 20 21 they have shown that different mixes implicate different order of magnitude of water consumption all global studies have used average or median values from the two first clusters which could lead to over or underestimations of water consumption as it does not consider the large variation among power plants therefore there is a need for a more detailed analysis of the water consumption by power plants that includes a range of electricity generating technologies and fuels showing technologies that are more water efficient than others even for technologies that were previously estimated as water intensive e g hydropower and biomass results identify strategies for more water efficient electricity mixes many studies used the water footprint wf tool to quantify water consumption the wf is a tool that estimate the volume and impacts of freshwater consumed by anthropogenic activities 22 23 based on 22 the wf consist of three components green precipitation blue surface and groundwater and grey pollution wfs ecuador located at the equator in south america is suitable as a case study for a research into the wf of various electricity generating technologies because its electricity mix includes a large variety of technologies including the technologies that were considered water intensive in previous studies and it is small enough to permit a detailed assessment of each power plant that contributes to the mix 24 ecuador has a large variety of different hydropower technologies e g large medium and small sized dammed run of the river ror built in series in conduit and multipurpose technologies thermal power plant technologies rankine brayton and internal combustion engines with diverse cooling types wet tower once through and dry cooling wind and solar power plants moreover ecuadorian power plants use a large variety of fuels e g crude oil and its derivatives natural gas biogas and biomass sugarcane bagasse a residue of the sugar industry 25 this paper aims to give blue and green wfs of different types of power plants including hydropower and thermal power plants in ecuador which is representative of technologies available on a global scale the four research questions are i what are the direct blue and green wfs per power plant technology per unit of electricity m3 tjel in ecuador ii what are the blue and green indirect wfs of the fuels used to operate power plants in ecuador m3 tjth iii what is the total blue wf of electricity generation in ecuador per generating technology m3 iv what are the most water efficient electricity generating technologies to reduce the blue wf of electricity generation in a country like ecuador for the analysis the study uses the wf concept this paper is the first to provide a detailed estimation of wfs of different electricity generation technologies that use a larger range of fuels results show ways to make electricity supply more water efficient 2 electricity in ecuador ecuador s electricity is generated by different technologies that include several power plants pps types the technology type defines most of the operation conditions including water consumption these technologies are hydropower plants hpps thermal power plants tpps biomass power plants bpps wind power plants and solar power plants together denominated as other renewables power plants opps 2 1 ecuadorian electricity mix and its production ecuador lies at the equator in south america the average annual precipitation is 2274 mm the annual internal renewable water resources irwr are 442 km3 26 the andes mountains divide the country into two watersheds the amazon and pacific 27 rivers originate in the andes flowing either to the pacific ocean west or to the atlantic via the amazon basin east the combination of large annual precipitation and the andes makes ecuador suitable for hpps tpps function as backup systems for hpps as hpps production is prioritized over tpps and as stand alone power generators in remote areas e g in the amazon region generating electricity for the oil industry bpps use residues from the sugar industry opps have only started to become part of the national electricity grid recently 28 in 2017 hpps produced 72 3 pj 71 of the electricity in the country tpps 26 6 pj 26 and bpps 1 7 pj 2 the contribution of opps is small only 0 4 pj 0 4 in 2017 only 0 07 pj were imported from neighboring countries 0 07 of the electricity 28 so that ecuador is self sufficient fig 1 shows the power plants locations per electricity generating technology hpps tpps bpps and opps which are solar and wind pps in ecuador and the location of oil and gas mining and sugarcane plantations the hpps are in the andes mountains except for two multipurpose hpps that are in the western lowlands tpps are generally located in the vicinity of oil and gas fields solid biomass fired bpps are close to the sugarcane fields biogas fired bpps are in cities in the andes there is only one wind power plant and some solar power plants in the mountains in the north and the south 2 2 water consumption characteristics of different electricity generating technologies in ecuador the characteristics of the different electricity generating technologies affect their water consumption 2 2 1 hydropower plants hpps consume water in the form of evaporation from open water surfaces 6 the evaporation is a function of the evaporation rate and the size of the open water surface evaporation depends on climate characteristics the surface size on the hpp s infrastructure typical hpps include i dammed hpps ii run of the river ror hpps and iii in conduit hpps that have different characteristics affecting water consumption i dammed hpps have an artificial reservoir formed by a dam 29 these hpps include two types based on the shape of their artificial reservoir the first type includes hpps with flooded rivers in which the dam impounds rivers in narrow passages between mountains forming an artificial lake along the original river bank the second type includes hpps with flooded lakes in which a dam impounds rivers in wider and open areas forming an artificial lake that spreads in all directions along the original river bank their open water surfaces are wider and shallower than the ones of the flooded river type in ecuador flooded lakes are usually located high in the mountains and in the valleys flooded rivers are located in between them the surface size of artificial reservoirs affects the wf of dammed hpps 15 ii run of the river ror hpps do not have a dam but a construction to deviate the river flow store water and avoid damage to the turbines 29 weirs sand traps reservoirs open canals charge tanks or surge tanks are examples of the possible infrastructure of ror hpps that create open water surfaces from where water evaporates ror hpps include pps with and without reservoirs ror hpps with reservoirs are usually larger than rors without reservoirs have relatively large open water surfaces and water losses due to evaporation iii in conduit hpps take advantage of the water that flows through water supply installations 30 i e between storage reservoirs and treatment plants they generate electricity without the need for infrastructure that generates open water surfaces and therefore water is not consumed in ecuador ror and dammed hpps are sometimes built in a string along a river cascaded hpps in this way electricity generation increases as ror hpps benefit from the storage and flow regulation provided by dammed hpps moreover dammed hpps are often part of a multipurpose scheme that is used not only to generate electricity but also for other services as water supply irrigation and flood control 31 2 3 thermal power plants factors that determine water consumption of tpps are i the working fluid ii the cooling system 32 and iii the fuel the working fluid for power generation depends on the tpps thermodynamic cycle 33 in ecuador tpps use i rankine ii brayton and iii internal combustion engines otto and diesel thermodynamic cycles rankine pps use steam as a working fluid in a closed loop cycle brayton and internal combustion engines ice pps use an air fuel mix in an open loop cycle 33 rankine pps consume water when steam losses occur brayton and ice pps have negligible water consumption due to the working fluid tpps cooling system depends on the thermodynamic cycle and the availability of water ecuadorian tpps use three cooling systems i wet tower cooling ii once through cooling and iii dry cooling wet tower cooling systems use water in a closed loop cycle in which a share of the water evaporates 11 once through cooling uses an open loop cycle in which water is diverted from surface water into a heat exchanger and returns to where it came from with a higher temperature 2 these systems use fresh or saline water 34 dry cooling systems use refrigerant based cooling fluids in a closed loop cycle where flowing air removes waste heat this system does not use water in ecuador some ice pps use this cooling technology tpps use cooling for different functions rankine pps cool the working fluid 33 35 ice pps cool the engine 33 while brayton pps do not require cooling the fuel used by tpps also affects water consumption ecuador does not have exploitable coal or natural gas resources and no nuclear plants but it has oil 36 most of tpps use crude oil and oil derivatives 25 like fuel oil diesel naphtha lpg and residue oil 37 crude oil residue oil and fuel oil are highly viscous and require fuel preheating systems to store and transport the oil these systems are i water based systems which use steam or ii oil based systems which use thermal oil the first system consumes water as steam production has losses the second system s water requirement is negligible moreover diesel combustion in brayton turbines generates nox 38 to reduce emissions ecuadorian brayton tpps using diesel have a ghg control system using water to mix with the fumes 39 2 4 biomass power plants biomass power plants bpps are tpps using biomass as fuel water consumption of bpps depends on the type of fuel and the thermodynamic cycle in which the power plant operates ecuadorian bpps use two biomass types i solid biomass from sugarcane bagasse a residue of the sugar industry and ii biogas mostly methane from the waste decomposition of municipal landfills bagasse fired bpps are subsidiaries of companies whose main economic activity is sugar production bpps burn solid biomass in rankine pps that use wet tower cooling systems 40 they operate five months per year from may to november when bagasse in the sugarcane harvesting period is available 41 42 biogas fired bpps are subsidiaries of municipal waste disposal companies bpps burn biogas in ice pps that are usually dry cooled 43 2 5 wind and solar power plants solar power plant s water consumption depends on the pp s type there are two types of solar power plants i photovoltaic systems pvs and ii concentrated solar power thermal systems csps with different water consumption pvs only use water for cleaning purposes while csps use a rankine thermodynamic cycle that requires water as any other rankine tpp 11 ecuador only has pvs historically solar and wind power plants were stand alone systems recently they have started to become part of the national electricity grid 28 previous studies have shown that these two technologies have such small water consumptions that they are practically negligible 1 18 3 method the water footprint wf is a tool that estimates the volume of freshwater consumed by anthropogenic activities two methods exist for quantifying water consumption the wf method as described in ref 22 and the iso method as described in ref 23 the main difference between methods is observed in the impact assessment stage however they follow a similar life cycle approach for the quantification inventory stage 44 45 in this paper we address the quantification inventory stage only so any of the two could be used we chose to use the method described in ref 22 the assessment of water consumption of a product good or service using the wf is defined as a water footprint assessment wfa 22 the wf consist of three components green blue and grey wfs the green wf considers the consumption of green water sources precipitation the blue wf refers to the consumption of ground and surface water freshwater and the grey wf refers to pollution and is defined as the volume of freshwater required to assimilate pollutants into freshwater bodies to reach accepted water quality standards 22 this study included green and blue wfs and excluded grey wfs and non freshwater sources the wf of a power plant includes a direct wf and an indirect wf the direct wf is the blue water needed for the operations of the power plant itself the indirect wf considers the construction and decommissioning of the plant and the fuels life cycle several studies 1 18 46 have shown that construction and decommissioning of power plants have insignificant wfs when compared to the direct wf for hpps tpps and bpps for pvs the indirect wf is small and for wind pps is negligible 1 therefore we excluded wfs related to construction and decommissioning the indirect wf related to the fuels life cycle includes four stages i exploration crop growth in the case of biomass ii fuel mining harvesting in the case of biomass iii fuel transport and iv fuel processing the wf of the transport stage is negligible compared to the wf of the rest of the fuel s life cycle 1 moreover in ecuador power plants are located near the fuel mining locations and processing factories with small transport distances fig 1 thus we assumed that the transport wf is negligible fig 2 shows the stages of the indirect and direct wf components for the assessment of the wf of electricity in ecuador the indirect wf includes the water evaporated incorporated or lost during the life cycle production of the fuels the direct wf includes the freshwater consumed during electricity generation for biomass the life cycle considers ratooning or seeding growing harvesting and sugarcane milling sugar cane is a perennial crop after harvesting the stem base and roots are left on the field to grow again in the next growing period of 5 6 months 42 the residue bagasse is used as fuel by bpps for fossil fuels primary sources natural gas and crude oil 25 are extracted wells are explored drilled and mined a few power plants use the primary sources without further processing but most plants use derived fuel products of the crude oil distillation we calculated the green and blue wfs associated with the operation per ecuadorian power plant applying the wf calculation method as given in ref 22 the assessment included three clusters i inventory of the current composition of the ecuadorian electricity mix and related water consumption ii assessment of blue and green fuel wfs iii assessment of blue wfs of electricity generating technologies the clusters include a series of calculation steps 31 the most relevant steps 16 are given below while appendix a gives all calculation steps fig 3 shows the steps of the second and third clusters and how they relate to each other 3 1 the composition of the ecuadorian electricity mix 3 1 1 inventory of ecuadorian power plants step 1 makes an inventory of ecuadorian power plants in 2017 and their operating characteristics data were derived from ref 28 3 1 2 classification of power plants previous studies have aggregated power plants into categories according to their operating conditions and types of fuels used gleick 5 macknick et al 11 meldrum et al 1 and mekonnen et al 18 first categorized pps based on their energy source introducing subcategories according to specific characteristics e g fuel mining preparation technologies cooling types we expanded the categories including classes and subclasses based on water consumption characteristics described in subsection 2 2 step 2 classifies the ecuadorian power plants into four categories ten classes and eleven subclasses the four categories were based on the energy source hpps tpps which include power plants that use natural gas oil and its derivatives bpps and opps which include solar and wind power plants hpps include three classes dammed hpps ror hpps and in conduit hpps dammed and ror hpps both have two subclasses the flooded lake hfl and flooded river hfr for dammed hpps and the reservoir hrr and no reservoir hnr subclass for ror hpps in conduit hpps were not subclassified because they do not have open water surfaces and no blue wf tpps include three classes the rankine brayton and ice pps class the rankine and brayton class include two subclasses the wet tower rwt and once through rot cooling subclass for rankine pps and the diesel and gas fired class for brayton pps ices include three subclasses i wet tower iwt cooling ii once through iot cooling and iii dry idc cooling bpps include two classes solid biomass fired power plants bsb and biogas fired power plants in ecuador solid biomass fired power plants use sugarcane bagasse as fuel biogas fired bpps direct blue wf is negligible so they were not considered in this study finally opps include solar and wind power plants which were excluded as they have negligible direct and indirect wfs and because their electricity generation in ecuador is relatively small compared to other generating technologies fig 4 shows the classification scheme of ecuadorian power plants for the classification we derived power plant characteristics from national databases 28 47 and sources that give information per power plant when the hpp type or tpp cooling system could not be identified we used google maps and bing maps aerial images to identify infrastructure using the method described in ref 32 and tpps cooling systems appendix b gives the power plants classes and subclasses and the references used 3 2 the fuels water footprint of ecuadorian power plants 3 2 1 natural gas crude oil and oil derivatives ecuador has natural gas fields data on water requirements for natural gas extraction are available from ref 1 we assumed that the indirect blue wf for natural gas of 4 21 m3 tjth related to extraction is representative for all blue wfs of natural gas in ecuador for crude oil and derivatives step 3 calculates the blue wf of crude oil extraction from ecuadorian wells w f e x m3 m3 oil as the sum of the blue wf for oil well exploration and drilling w f e d m3 m3 oil and the blue wf of oil mining w f m m3 m3 oil as 1 w f e x w f e d w f m ecuadorian oil has a high viscosity 48 requiring enhanced oil recovery methods eor to facilitate extraction we calculated the w f e d m3 m3 oil based on the average freshwater consumption per well w f w e l l m3 well and the relation between the number of oil wells explored and drilled n w e l l s and the annual oil production p m3 oil data on well numbers and annual oil production were derived from the national oil trading company petroecuador ep 49 data on average water consumption per well was derived from the national oil extraction company petroamazonas ep 50 for the w f m we derived data from ref 51 of 2 97 m3 m3 oil considering an eor of steam injection that reuses 71 of the process water appendix a gives the calculation of w f e d distillation produces several derivatives step 4 estimates blue wfs of crude oil derivatives used for electricity generation in ecuador we allocated the blue wf of crude oil to each derivative d using the stepwise accumulative approach as defined in hoekstra et al 22 first we calculated the product fraction f p d and value fraction f v d of the oil distillation products as 2 f p d w d w i 3 f v d u p d w d d 1 k u p d w d where f p d is the fraction of derivative d processed from input product i it is the ratio of the weight w d of derivative d and the weight w i of input product i f v d is the fraction of the market value of derivative d to the aggregated market value of all derivatives d 1 to k obtained from the input products i the market value is the multiplication of the market price of derivate d u p d to the w d data on ecuadorian oil derivatives for 2013 were taken from ref 48 we assumed that there is no significant annual variation in the distillation process and crude oil properties remain constant appendix a gives the price energy content product and value fractions for oil distillation products for the esmeraldas refinery in 2013 next we allocated the blue wf to each product d of the crude oil distillation as 4 w f f d w f p r o c e s s i f p d i i 1 y w f p r o d u c t i f p d i f v d where the process wf is given per unit of input product i divided by the product fraction of that input product f p d i the second part of equation 4 calculates the sum of the blue wf of the input products i divided by the product fraction of those input products in this case there is only one product wf crude oil w f e x and the process wf is the distillation blue wf w f p which we calculated based on the average water consumption rate of the distillation process and the average oil distillation rate over the period of 2010 2016 data for the esmeraldas refinery were taken from refs 49 52 we assumed that the other ecuadorian refineries two smaller ones have similar wfs appendix a gives the w f p calculation 3 2 2 sugarcane and bagasse for the calculation of the green and blue wf of sugar cane bagasse we used the method described in ref 7 sugarcane blue wfs b l u e w f s c m3 t and green wfs g r e e n w f s c m3 t are calculated using annual blue and green crop water requirements b l u e and g r e e n c w r y r as b l u e w f s c b l u e c w r y r y s c 5 g r e e n w f s c g r e e n c w r y r y s c where y s c is the average annual sugar cane yield t ha data on yields of sugarcane producing bagasse for electricity were derived from refs 53 60 appendix c gives the annual yields for the different sugarcane fields step 5 calculates the sugarcane b l u e and g r e e n c w r y r m3 ha producing bagasse for electricity in ecuador as b l u e c w r y r m 1 12 b l u e c w r m 6 g r e e n c w r y r m 1 12 g r e e n c w r m where b l u e c w r m is the blue component of the monthly cwr of month m and g r e e n c w r m is the green component of the monthly cwr of month m m3 ha the c w r includes a b l u e and g r e e n c w r as sometimes the crop water requirement is fulfilled with a mix of rainfall and irrigation in ecuador bagasse for electricity originates from irrigated sugarcane when rainfall is not enough irrigation is applied as sugar cane companies use hydrological models to estimate the appropriate cwrs to improve yields 61 the assessment of b l u e and g r e e n cwrs was done by assessing the contribution of precipitation to total cwrs if monthly precipitation is larger or equals cwrs we assumed the b l u e c w r is zero when precipitation is smaller the b l u e c w r is the additional water provided to the crop usually during the wet season november to april rainfall is enough for cwrs and little or no irrigation is needed during the dry season may to october irrigation is needed we assessed monthly b l u e and g r e e n c w r s because the seasonal variation of water availability influences the ratio of b l u e and g r e e n components the calculation of the b l u e and g r e e n c w r m is based on the crop s daily evapotranspiration e t c appendix a gives the calculation step 6 calculates the b l u e and g r e e n w f s c of sugarcane using equation 5 sugarcane is the primary source of different products and by products sugar molasses and bagasse step 7 allocates the wf to bagasse based on the product and value fractions using equations 2 4 in a similar way as step 4 the product fractions were taken from ref 62 and the unitary prices from ref 63 bbps only use bagasse and no other residues like leaves or stems appendix a gives products and byproducts of sugarcane production including product fractions and unitary prices 3 3 assessment of the blue water footprint of electricity generating technologies in ecuador 3 3 1 wfs of hydropower plants the blue wf of hpps is determined by the evaporation from their open water surfaces step 8 calculates this evaporation w f o w s p per hydropower plant p m3 using the gross method described by ref 6 as 7 w f o w s p r 1 r 10 e v r a r r where e v r is the annual evaporation mm of open water surface r the factor 10 is used to convert mm to m3 ha and a r r is the area of the open water surface r ha a hpp p can have one or more open water surfaces depending on their infrastructure the w f o w s p was calculated as the sum of the evaporation from those open water surfaces from r 1 to r the e v r was calculated based on meteorological data using the modified penman method as described by ref 64 as it is suitable for equatorial regions 46 meteorological data were derived from the national meteorological agency inamhi 65 and the ecuadorian solar atlas 66 the a r r was estimated using geo referencing and geographic information software gis and topographic and bathymetric maps polygons per open water surface r were generated and measured maps of the ecuadorian terrain were derived from ref 67 appendix a gives the description of the calculation of e v r and a r r appendix d gives the location of the hpps the area of their open water surfaces and the nearby meteorological station from which data were taken for the evaporation calculation step 9 calculates the direct blue wf w f d i r p in m3 of the hydropower plant p based on the whether their open water surfaces are shared or not usually in ecuador the open water surfaces of power plant p are only used by that hpp in this case the w f d i r p is the same as the evaporation from the ows however some hpps open water surfaces are shared with more than one power plant power plants in cascade or they also serve for other ecological services multipurpose reservoirs for both cases we calculated the w f d i r p using the approach defined by refs 15 68 as follows 8 w f d i r p w f o w s p η where η is the allocation factor equation 8 refers to the stepwise accumulative approach described in step 4 when the w f p r o c e s s i is zero the product fraction f p is equal to 1 and the value fraction f v changest to the allocation factor η this is the case for hpps as there is no consumption during the electricity production inside the hpps multipurpose reservoirs could have a few potential ecosystem services such as electricity generation water supply flood control irrigation recreation aquaculture or conservation however ecuadorian multipurpose reservoirs considered in this study have been designed only for electricity generation water supply flood control irrigation for hpps with multipurpose open water surfaces the allocation factor is defined as the ratio between the economic values of hydroelectricity and the economic value of the sum of the ecosystem services in the reservoir for hpps in cascade the allocation factor η is defined as the ratio of the electricity generation of the hpp p and the total electricity production of the power plants in the string considering that all hpps in the string receive the same price per unit of electricity generated appendix a gives the calculation of the allocation factor appendix e shows the allocation calculation of the cases of multipurpose and cascaded hpps 3 3 2 wfs of thermal and biomass power plants data on water consumption of tpps in ecuador are scarce and available for a few pps to assess the wfs of tpps in ecuador we defined typical power plants which are the pps with available data of water consumption we assumed that these water consumption data were representative for all tpps inside each subclass of tpps appendix f gives a list of typical power plants per tpp subclass the data sources and their timeframe step 10 calculates the annual water consumption of typical tpps w f d i r t m3 by summing the average water consumption w p r o c k per operational process k from 1 to a for the pp e g water filtering demineralization cooling as 9 w f d i r t k 1 a w p r o c k appendix f gives water consumption and characteristics per typical thermal power plant step 11 calculates the direct blue wf per unit of energy w f e d i r t s m3 tj of a typical tpp t per subclass s by dividing the w f d i r t by the average annual electricity output over the period 1999 2017 e t tj 10 w f e d i r t s w f d i r t e t we assumed that typical power plants are representative for the entire subclass s step 12 calculates the direct blue wf of the rest of the tpps w f d i r p s m3 by multiplying the annual average electricity output per tpp over the period 1999 2017 e p tj by the direct blue wf per unit of energy w f e d i r t s 11 w f d i r p s e p w f e d i r t s bpps operate like rankine wet tower power plants we used the average monthly direct blue wf per unit of energy w f e d i r t s of wet tower rwt power plants to calculate the bpps direct blue wf w f d i r p s 3 3 3 blue wfs per power plant subclass and category step 13 calculates the indirect blue wf w f i n d p m3 per power plant p tpps and bpps only as hpps do not have indirect wf it was defined as the sum of the blue wfs of the fuels used by the pp from f 1 to f which was calculated by multiplying the blue wf of fuel d w f f d m3 m3 f or m3 tf for biomass by the average of the total volume or mass for biomass of that fuel consumed over the period 1999 2017 v d m3 f or t f as follows 12 w f i n d p f 1 f v d w f f d p data on fuel consumption were derived from ref 28 step 14 calculates the annual direct wf w f e d i r p and indirect wf w f e i n d p per unit of electricity generated m3 tjel per power plant p by dividing the direct and indirect wfs to its average annual electricity output e p tjel over the period 1999 2017 data on electricity generation were derived from ref 28 step 15 calculates the total blue wf w f p m3 for power plant p as the sum of the w f i n d p and the w f d i r p of power plant p in a similar way the total wf per unit of electricity generated of power plant p w f e p in m3 tjel is the sum of the w f e d i r p and w f e i n d p step 16 calculates the blue wf per subclass and category the subclasses blue wf w f s m3 is calculated by summing all the power plants w f p per subclass s the categories blue wf w f c m3 is calculated in the same way the wf per unit of electricity per subclass is expressed as a range showing the smallest and largest w f e t o t p s as well as the median value 4 results 4 1 ecuadorian power plant technologies and their contribution to the gross electricity production of the country fig 5 shows the number of pps per subclass class and category and their contribution to the national electricity output of ecuador in 2017 there were 287 pps in operation most pps 165 belong to the tpps idc subclass they generate 15 of the electricity or 64 times more than iots which produce 7 of rot and 19 times more than iwts which produce 60 of rwt in the other tpps subclasses bgf electricity output is five times larger than the bdf output and rots generate twice as much as rwts for hydropower the hfr and hfl subclasses both have five pps but hfrs produce more than four times as much electricity than hfls of the 49 ror pps the 31 hnrs generate 26 of the electricity generated by 18 hrrs fig 5 shows that in conduit biogas wind and solar pv pps include 32 pps but only generate 1 of the electricity in ecuador 4 2 water footprints of fuels used in ecuadorian power plants 4 2 1 blue water footprints of crude oil and its derived fuels the average exploration and drilling blue wf of crude oil is 0 02 cubic meter of water per cubic meter of fuel m3 m3 f the distillation blue wf is 0 71 m3 m3 f both footprints are smaller than the blue wf for the mining of crude oil of 2 98 m3 m3 f table 1 gives the blue wfs of crude oil and its derived fuels used for electricity generation per unit of volume m3 m3 f and unit of energy m3 tjth table 1 shows that the difference between the fuel with the largest blue wf per unit of volume diesel 2 with 2 9 m3 m3 f and the smallest wf lpg with 1 07 m3 m3 f is almost threefold wfs of naphtha fuel oil and residue range in between these values the same order is observed for the wf per unit of energy except for lpg which has a larger wf than residue because lpg has a smaller energy content per unit of volume than residue 0 024 tj m3 and 0 037 tj m3 respectively 4 2 2 green and blue water footprints of sugarcane bagasse fig 6 shows the average green and blue wfs of bagasse used for electricity generation between 1990 and 2012 for three power plants and the average annual precipitation per location the wf varies in volume and color due to differences in local crop yields and rainfall patterns 42 in ecuador bagasse used for electricity generation has an average total blue and green wf of 37 m3 t and 4911 m3 tjh the green wf is 23 m3 t and the blue wf 14 m3 t fig 6 also shows that the san carlos power plant has a smaller blue wf and higher precipitation so there is little need for irrigation appendix a gives the precipitation data of the sugarcane fields that provide bagasse for the three bpps and the monthly blue and green cwr of ecuadorian sugarcane 4 2 3 blue water footprint of electricity generating technologies in ecuador table 2 shows the annual indirect direct and total blue wfs of electricity from 1999 to 2017 for the subclasses of the three categories of power plants hpps bpps and tpps appendix g gives the blue wf of individual ecuadorian power plants table 2 shows large variation among the blue wf of ecuadorian power plants first in terms of the differences between categories second in terms of the differences between subclasses that are part of the same class and finally in terms of the variation inside each subclass firstly there is a large blue wf variation among subclasses of different categories bpps have the largest median blue wf 18069 m3 tjel almost five times larger than the median blue wf of electricity from the hfl subclass the latter is the subclass with the largest blue wf of the hpps category almost five times larger than the blue wf of the iwt subclass the subclass with the largest blue wf of the tpps category these variations are caused by large differences in operation conditions for instance bpps have larger blue wfs because they combine a large direct blue wf for wet tower cooling and a large indirect blue wf because they use bagasse from irrigated sugar cane secondly table 2 shows that there is large variation among subclasses in the same category in the tpp category the iwts median blue wf is almost 16 times larger than the smallest blue wf of the bgf subclass this difference correlates to the significant variation of the direct blue wf per cooling type wet tower subclasses rwt and iwt have the largest wf because their cooling system is water intensive rots and iots do not use freshwater for cooling but they have a blue wf because most of them use heavy fuels that require an additional preheating system consuming water rwts and iwts have an average direct blue wf 15 times larger than the direct blue wf of rots and iots and 72 times larger than idcs the most water efficient cooling technology moreover hpps show the largest wf variation inside a category because hpps wfs are determined by the volume of water that evaporates from the hpp open water surfaces and the four hpps subclasses have large differences in the volumes of water evaporating from their open water surfaces for instance the hfls median blue wfs is around 48 times larger than the median blue wf of the smallest hpps subclass hrr as larger volumes of water evaporate from hfl than for hrr hpps wfs are determined by the water volume that evaporates from the hpp open water surfaces where evaporation is a function of i the size of the open water surfaces and ii the evaporation rates determined by climatic conditions fig 7 a and b shows to which extent these two factors affect the blue wf of hpps fig 7a shows a linear relationship between open water surfaces and blue wfs as the area of the open water surface increases so does the blue wf the outliers of this trend correspond to ror hpps that benefit from upstream reservoirs so they have small open water surfaces but relatively large blue wfs due to the allocation of the evaporation from the reservoirs upstream the subclasses cluster in groups from smaller open water surfaces hnr to larger surfaces hfl hrrs and hfrs are in between these two subclasses fig 7b shows that in ecuador the evaporation rate does not have a significant correlation with the blue wf hpp subclasses do not show an increasing or decreasing pattern this suggests that the size of the open water surfaces has a larger effect on the blue wf of the hpps than the evaporation rate of the reservoir this is probably due to the country s equatorial climate and the hpp locations in the andes mountains fig 8 shows the relation between annual average electricity generation tj and the open water surface of the ecuadorian hpps reservoirs the outliers correspond to the ror hpps that benefit from the reservoirs of other hpps upstream fig 8 shows that for ror hpps the larger the open water surface the larger the annual electricity generation independently of the subclass in this way they can produce large amounts of electricity with significantly smaller sizes of their open water surfaces however fig 8 also shows a difference between the trend of dammed hpps and its subclasses hfls hpps have large open water surfaces and lower electricity production than their hfr counterparts table 2 figs 7 and 8 indicate that the large wf differences of hpps are caused by differences among their infrastructure the smallest blue wfs are observed for hpps that benefit from infrastructure with small and deep open water surfaces producing relatively large amounts of electricity e g hfrs or for medium and small sized hpps that do not require large open water surfaces e g hrrs finally table 2 shows that there is large variation inside each subclass these differences are due to the unique operating conditions of each power plant inside each subclass for example the difference between hpps with the smallest and largest blue wf in the hrr subclass is almost 250 fold similar differences are observed in the hfr and hnr subclasses 109 fold and 108 fold respectively in this case too the variation of blue wf for hrr hfr and hnr happens because each pp inside those subclasses has different infrastructure for bpps the variation within the bsb class is caused by the sugarcane bagasse used the bagasse has different wfs depending on the site where the sugarcane is grown fig 6 weather conditions of sugarcane fields define when and how much the crop needs to be irrigated during the dry season this correlates to the variation among bsb indirect blue wfs there are also large differences in tpps subclasses the largest difference between the tpp with the smallest and largest blue wf is observed in the idc subclass 63 fold and it is mainly due to the differences in the fuel use the lowest end of this subclass uses diesel 2 and the highest end of the range uses a mix of diesel 2 and heavy fuels crude oil residue oil and fuel oil fig 9 shows blue wf variation m3 of tpps in relation to their electricity production the tpps have been grouped first in terms of their cooling system once through wet tower dry cooling no cooling next by the fuel used fuel oil residue oil crude oil diesel and natural gas showing the significant differences between cooling systems tpps with wet tower cooling squares have the largest blue wf in relation to their electricity production the tpps with the lowest blue wf in relation to their electricity production are a group of tpps with dry cooling moreover fig 9 shows the difference between fuels used by the tpps and their blue wf natural gas fired tpps brown have the smallest blue wf per tj of electricity crude oil yellow fuel oil orange and diesel green using plants have wfs between plants using residue oil blue and gas the wf variation for tpp subclasses is mainly correlated with the specific fuel mix applied for example in table 2 the bgf subclass has a large blue wf variation they mostly consume natural gas but one plant in the bgf subclass uses diesel resulting in seven times larger blue wf compared to the other bgf plants the fuel mix also affects the wfs of rankine and ice tpps that use heavy fuels crude oil residue oil and fuel oil the use of heavy fuels also includes diesel 2 consumption the volume of diesel 2 in the fuel mix of the tpp affects the relation between direct and indirect wf of the tpps fig 10 shows the indirect and direct blue wf per unit of electricity of the typical power tpps that use a mix of heavy fuels and diesel of two comparable subclasses rwt and iwt as they have similar cooling systems it shows that the addition of diesel 2 has a larger effect on the increase of the direct blue wf than in the decrease of indirect blue wf 4 3 blue water footprint of the current ecuadorian electricity mix fig 11 a and b shows the composition of the blue wf of electricity in ecuador fig 11a shows blue wfs per power plant category hpps bpps and tpps compared to the gross electricity output fig 11b shows blue wfs and gross electricity output per pp subclass fig 11a shows that tpps have the smallest contribution to the total ecuadorian blue wf for electricity 11 followed by bpps 24 and hpps 65 when comparing the blue wf of power plant categories and their gross electricity output fig 11a the blue wf does not linearly relate to the amount of electricity generated from 1999 to 2017 tpps produced 41 of the electricity but the contribution to the blue wf was relatively small bpps electricity generation is small compared to hpps or tpps only 1 but they have the second largest blue wf after hydropower fig 11b shows that subclasses with large blue wfs are not necessarily the ones with large electricity output for instance hfls have the largest blue wf six times larger than hfrs wfs but they only generate one fourth of their electricity rwts and iwts contribute 44 to the blue wf of the tpp category but generate 8 of the category s electricity 5 discussion 5 1 implications for the water electricity nexus previous studies have focused on assessing the most evident water intensive electricity generating technologies like hpps with large reservoirs hfl in our classification biomass fired and water cooled tpps 6 7 12 13 16 69 our study assessed wfs of these technologies in more detail for instance we also assessed tpps operational wfs besides cooling for fuel use and ghg control the studies of meldrum et al 1 mekonnen and hoekstra 6 and gleick 5 have shown large wf variations for power plant categories by including more technologies per category we show that there are large differences among wfs in subclasses of electricity generating technologies the variation of the blue wfs of pps is large as reported in previous studies but the order of magnitude varies between subclasses for instance we found that for hpps hfls have the largest blue wf per unit of electricity generated followed by hfrs hnrs and finally the smallest blue wf for hrrs these differences have not been reported in previous studies additionally we assessed the wf of two electricity generating technologies for which no wf data were available ror hpps and ice pps and included wfs of hpps with open water surfaces smaller than 0 1 ha we show that water that evaporates from ror hpps open water surfaces weirs sand traps and reservoirs is significant in relation to their electricity output small ror hpps therefore have a comparable blue wf per unit of electricity m3 tjel as hpps with large open water surfaces the linear relationship between water evaporation and electricity output of small ror hpps is the reason that we advise that small ror hpps should be included in future wfas of electricity ice tpps indirect blue wf is the largest of all technologies but they are usually water efficient when combined with dry cooling radiators mekonnen and hoekstra 70 calculated an average annual blue wf of 2443 million m3 for the productive sectors of ecuador agriculture livestock industry and domestic water supply between 1996 and 2005 our results show that ecuadorian electricity generation consumes 86 5 million m3 of water yearly or 3 5 of the total blue wf which is small in comparison to the 2186 million m3 of freshwater consumed yearly for crop production and livestock water supply 70 in the country the small contribution indicates that electricity generation does not have a significant impact on the country s total wf and that its optimization has limited impact on the country s freshwater consumption if there are always plenty resources in the country for all users then the optimization of a water efficient mix for ecuador is not relevant for the country itself but might provide insights towards the more efficient use of water for electricity especially for other countries with different conditions and resources nonetheless this remains to be defined in a more detailed study that considers the spatial and temporal constraints of freshwater in the country s basins and the competition between users 5 2 influential factors of the wf of electricity generating technologies our results show a large variation of direct and indirect blue wfs between different electricity generating technologies affected by several factors for bsb bpps sugarcane irrigation is the most influential factor also regional differences in precipitation patterns affect blue wfs of bsb bpps wetter regions could have lower blue wfs than the ones described in this study for hpps blue wfs are mainly determined by their open water surfaces size and not by evaporation rates due to the equatorial climate further studies are required to assess this relationship for higher latitudes dammed hpps with small and deep reservoirs hfr are more water efficient than dammed hpps with large and shallow reservoirs hfl mainly because hfrs produce more electricity with smaller open water surfaces than hfls ror hpps have relatively large blue wfs in hrr but this permits them to produce more electricity which results in relatively small blue wfs per unit of electricity compared to wfs of rors without reservoirs hnr although hnrs have relatively small open water surfaces their blue wfs are comparable to hfrs or larger than hrr wfs the most water efficient hpps technologies are hfr and hrr and they should be prioritized for tpps the cooling system is the most influential factor affecting blue wfs tpps with water intensive cooling systems like wet tower cooling have the largest blue wf of the category brayton cycle tpps which do not require cooling have the smallest blue wf however the tpps fuel use also has a large impact there is a large difference between brayton subclasses and idc tpps due to different fuel use brayton and ice power plants using natural gas have smaller blue wfs than diesel fired brayton and ice pps tpps using heavy fuel oils crude oil residue oil and fuel oil have larger wfs than their counterparts because of the additional requirement of having a fuel preheating system that usually is steam based and the addition of diesel 2 into the fuel mix the volume of diesel 2 in relation to the heavy fuel required in these tpps is also an influential factor for tpps especially for the direct wf on the one hand diesel 2 has a small share in the fuel mix of rankine tpps rwt in these tpps diesel 2 is only used to start the boiler and then heavy oil is burnt alone for the rest of the operation on the other hand diesel 2 has a larger share in the fuel mix of ices iwt they mix diesel 2 with heavy fuels throughout the operation of the tpp the direct blue wf of iwts is larger than the direct blue wf of rwt because iwt only need to produce steam for the fuel s preheating system and this implicates larger blue wf than in the case of rwt that already produce steam for its thermodynamic cycle and can divert part of it to the preheating system 5 3 limitations of the study lack of data gave rise to the following assumptions i we used available data on oil extraction and distillation from a state owned company assuming their wfs are representative for the sector there are 17 oil extracting companies 71 but only one petroamazonas ep a company producing 71 of ecuador s oil provides data on water consumption for operations in ecuador there are three refineries but only one the esmeraldas refinery which produces half of the ecuadorian oil derivatives 49 provides data on water consumption for operations we assumed the wf data are representative for the other two refineries ii we did not calculate the direct wf of all tpps and bpps because data for each power plant were not available we categorized tpps and bpps into classes and subclasses with similar operating conditions and assumed that wfs of typical power plants that had data were representative this assumption did not influence the results of the country s blue wf because the direct wfs of tpps and bpps is relatively small in comparison to their indirect blue wf iii when available we used multiannual monthly water consumption averages to assess the multiannual average blue wf of power plants however multiannual averages do not always cover the same period due to lack of data for example we used the period 1999 2017 to calculate the average power plant electricity generation and fuel consumption and the period 1981 2010 for meteorological data we assumed that these averages are representative of the processes and operations and that the ecuadorian climate does not have large annual variation moreover we excluded the gray wf for some power plant subclasses the gray wfs could be large in comparison to green or blue wfs i e for thermal power plants with once through cooling causing thermal water pollution if also gray wfs are considered the country s total electricity wf is larger and some subclasses have larger wfs than the ones presented in this paper 5 4 comparison of results with previous studies there are fuel blue wfs available from the literature gerbens leenes et al 72 have calculated a blue wf range for diesel of 28 376 m3 tjth and for heavy fuel oil of 10 133 m3 tjth our results are 79 and 46 m3 tjth respectively which are in the range found by gerbens leenes et al for sugarcane bagasse mathioudakis et al 13 have calculated a blue wf of 20 m3 t using data from ref 73 our monthly average blue wf is 15 m3 t 25 smaller than the blue wf assessed by mathioudakis et al that was based on global average blue wfs of sugar cane including countries with relatively small yields our smaller wf is probably caused by the relatively large sugarcane yield in ecuador that is 20 larger than the country s average yield reported by fao 74 previous studies have shown that hpps have large blue wfs but differences are large and depend on local circumstances i e on the size of the open water surfaces and local climate differences can be four orders of magnitude mekonnen and hoekstra 6 have shown that the average global wf of hydropower ranges between 39000 and 69400 m3 tjel liu et al 15 have calculated a wf for hydropower in china between 3900 and 100000 m3 tjel and zhao and liu 68 have calculated a range between 800 and 9200 m3 tjel for hpps with multipurpose reservoirs our calculations give a blue wf from 14 to 13085 m3 tjel with a median wf of 197 m3 tjel which are smaller than the wfs reported previously earlier studies however only included large hpps hfl category while this study also included small hpps when only comparing hfl s wfs our results range from 1254 to 13085 m3 tjel similar to results of zhao and liu 68 mathioudakis et al 13 have calculated a blue wf of electricity from sugarcane bagasse of 9100 m3 tjel our calculations give a median blue wf of 18069 m3 tjel almost twice the wf of mathioudakis et al 13 this difference is likely to result from the differences between sugarcane bagasse s higher heating values hhv ecuadorian sugarcane has an hhv of 7 6 mj kg 75 which is almost half the hhv value used by mathioudakis et al 13 who used the average of a large range of hhvs reported for case studies around the world the ecuadorian sugarcane hhv is relatively small compared to the hhvs of those case studies mekonnen et al 18 and meldrum et al 1 have shown that the direct blue wfs of coal fired power plants range between 61 and 1410 m3 tjel for rwt class tpps with similar cooling systems the median blue direct wf is 802 m3 tjel comparable to earlier results meldrum et al 1 give a wf of 52 3 m3 tjel for coal fired power plants with open loop cooling this study calculated a median blue wf of a rot power plant of 176 m3 tjel three times larger than the value obtained by meldrum et al 1 ecuadorian rot power plants use steam to preheat the fuel oil before burning generating a relatively large wf our result for bgf power plants median blue wfs 54 m3 tjel is comparable to the wf of gas combustion turbines of 52 7 m3 tjel reported by meldrum et al 1 ecuadorian bdf power plants use freshwater to reduce nox emissions their median blue wf is 354 m3 tj almost seven times larger than wfs reported by meldrum et al 1 that study however excluded water consumption to reduce ghg emissions mekonnen et al 18 have presented regional estimates of wfs for heat and electricity latin america and the caribbean have an annual average blue wf of 17000 m3 tjel for hpps and 405 m3 tjel for tpps our results show that ecuador s average blue wfs for hpps and tpps are 732 m3 tjel and 253 m3 tjel respectively the tpps blue wfs are similar to the value given by mekonnen et al 18 but the hpps blue wf assessed in this study is 23 times smaller than the one calculated by mekonnen et al 18 ecuadorian large hfl power plants have blue wfs ranging from 1200 to 13000 m3 tjel hfr and ror hpps have a blue wf range of 14 4000 m3 tj including small hpps lowered the average blue wf per unit of electricity in ecuador most of our results are comparable to results of previous studies which suggest that the methods used and the assumptions made were logic however deviations indicate that earlier estimations based on regional averages and large installations might overestimate the wfs the efficient use of freshwater for electricity generation is paramount in a context where electricity demand is increasing and freshwater resources are becoming scarcer our results show that there are opportunities for a more water efficient power generation not only for ecuador but probably also for other countries and regions 6 conclusions there are large differences among blue wfs of different power plant technologies in ecuador these variations can be ascribed to the difference in fuel use operating conditions and infrastructure electricity from biomass has the largest blue wf 14557 26377 m3 tjel followed by electricity from hydropower 14 13085 m3 tjel electricity generated in thermal power plants using fossil fuels have wfs between 9 and 936 m3 tjel the largest blue wf variation occurs in the hydropower plant category where blue wfs mainly depend on the power plant s infrastructure large dammed flooded lake hydropower plants have the largest blue wf small ror hydropower plants with reservoirs the smallest dammed hydropower plants have larger blue wfs than ror however ror hydropower plants have a significant blue wf in relation to their electricity output in the category of tpp s the subclass of thermal power plants with wet tower cooling have the largest blue wfs gas fired brayton power plants the smallest the blue wfs of the power plants with once through cooling or internal combustion engines with dry cooling is smaller than power plants with wet tower cooling nonetheless even though their cooling system does not consume water their direct blue wf is comparable with other technologies due to the fuel mix they use heavy fuels crude oil fuel oil and residue oil require preheating which can be water intensive if it is steam based moreover diesel fired brayton power plants use water for ghg control which is water intensive in terms of fuels natural gas is the most water efficient fuel 4 21 m3 tjth followed by crude oil and derivatives 36 4 83 3 m3 tjth biomass is the least efficient 4910 8 m3 tjh overall gas fired power plants have seven times smaller blue wfs than crude oil and crude oil derivatives fired power plants wf variations suggest that there are water efficient technologies even for the technologies that were considered water intensive in previous studies hydropower run of the river hydropower plants with reservoirs and dammed flooded river hydropower plants have relatively small blue wfs per unit of electricity that are in the same order of magnitude as wfs of electricity from thermal power plants some subclasses of the run of the river hydropower plants and the stationary internal combustion engines contribute relatively little to ecuador s blue wf for electricity this shows that there are alternatives to optimize the electricity mix from a water efficiency point of view the ecuadorian electricity generation consumes 86 5 million m3 of water yearly or 3 5 of the total blue wf hydropower plants consume 66 of the total water for electricity biomass power plants 23 and thermal power plants 11 technology variation and differences among fuel wfs indicate pathways towards water efficient electricity mixes besides the benchmark wfs calculated in this study future studies should also consider spatial and temporal constraints of freshwater availability and competition between users in basins where

8811,hydropower biomass and thermal power plants hpps bpps and tpps consume water the wf tool quantifies freshwater consumption we calculated direct and indirect wfs of 255 ecuadorian power plants using different technologies and fuels classified into eleven subclasses median wfs are largest for bpps followed by hpps while wfs of tpps were smallest but variation in subclasses is enormous for hpps dammed hpps have relatively large blue wfs run of the river hpps have relatively small wfs although they are significant to their electricity output the cooling system is paramount for tpps subclasses water efficient cooling systems once through and dry cooling have 20 smaller wfs than wet tower systems moreover the fuel used affects the direct wf of tpps significantly fuel and residue oil require water intensive preheating some diesel fired tpps use water as ghg control bpps are water intensive because biomass has a large wf technology and fuel variation indicate pathways towards more water efficient electricity mixes graphical abstract image 1 1 introduction in general traditional electricity generation in thermal power plants consumes significant volumes of freshwater for the operation mainly for cooling and for the fuel life cycles 1 5 electricity generated by renewable sources e g hydropower or biomass fired thermal power plants also consumes large amounts of water 6 7 while other renewable sources e g wind or solar have a small water consumption 1 electricity generation is expected to grow while freshwater sources are expected to become scarcer 3 8 electricity is not the only consumer of freshwater in a basin agriculture households and industries also require water freshwater availability is limited 9 and the growing demand from all users is the reason why water can become more scarce after the construction of power plants this constitutes a constraint for electricity production 10 existing knowledge about water footprints of electricity includes three clusters of studies the first cluster has assessed the water requirements of different electricity generation technologies and fuels 1 5 11 14 they have shown water consumption ranges of some technologies for benchmarking purposes they have shown that some technologies and fuels are more water efficient than others the second cluster includes studies that quantified water consumption for specific technologies to show differences within similar technologies in different regions 6 7 15 16 they have shown that there are large variations among power plants with similar technologies these variations are caused by spatial conditions regional differences and characteristics of fuel use however these two clusters of studies did not address specific electricity technologies e g certain types of run of the river hydropower plants or stationary internal combustion engines and other fossil fuels besides coal natural gas and crude oil e g crude oil derivatives used for electricity generation finally the third cluster includes studies that have used the two previous clusters to define water consumption for energy mixes including electricity at the global scale 17 19 or inside a particular boundary 20 21 they have shown that different mixes implicate different order of magnitude of water consumption all global studies have used average or median values from the two first clusters which could lead to over or underestimations of water consumption as it does not consider the large variation among power plants therefore there is a need for a more detailed analysis of the water consumption by power plants that includes a range of electricity generating technologies and fuels showing technologies that are more water efficient than others even for technologies that were previously estimated as water intensive e g hydropower and biomass results identify strategies for more water efficient electricity mixes many studies used the water footprint wf tool to quantify water consumption the wf is a tool that estimate the volume and impacts of freshwater consumed by anthropogenic activities 22 23 based on 22 the wf consist of three components green precipitation blue surface and groundwater and grey pollution wfs ecuador located at the equator in south america is suitable as a case study for a research into the wf of various electricity generating technologies because its electricity mix includes a large variety of technologies including the technologies that were considered water intensive in previous studies and it is small enough to permit a detailed assessment of each power plant that contributes to the mix 24 ecuador has a large variety of different hydropower technologies e g large medium and small sized dammed run of the river ror built in series in conduit and multipurpose technologies thermal power plant technologies rankine brayton and internal combustion engines with diverse cooling types wet tower once through and dry cooling wind and solar power plants moreover ecuadorian power plants use a large variety of fuels e g crude oil and its derivatives natural gas biogas and biomass sugarcane bagasse a residue of the sugar industry 25 this paper aims to give blue and green wfs of different types of power plants including hydropower and thermal power plants in ecuador which is representative of technologies available on a global scale the four research questions are i what are the direct blue and green wfs per power plant technology per unit of electricity m3 tjel in ecuador ii what are the blue and green indirect wfs of the fuels used to operate power plants in ecuador m3 tjth iii what is the total blue wf of electricity generation in ecuador per generating technology m3 iv what are the most water efficient electricity generating technologies to reduce the blue wf of electricity generation in a country like ecuador for the analysis the study uses the wf concept this paper is the first to provide a detailed estimation of wfs of different electricity generation technologies that use a larger range of fuels results show ways to make electricity supply more water efficient 2 electricity in ecuador ecuador s electricity is generated by different technologies that include several power plants pps types the technology type defines most of the operation conditions including water consumption these technologies are hydropower plants hpps thermal power plants tpps biomass power plants bpps wind power plants and solar power plants together denominated as other renewables power plants opps 2 1 ecuadorian electricity mix and its production ecuador lies at the equator in south america the average annual precipitation is 2274 mm the annual internal renewable water resources irwr are 442 km3 26 the andes mountains divide the country into two watersheds the amazon and pacific 27 rivers originate in the andes flowing either to the pacific ocean west or to the atlantic via the amazon basin east the combination of large annual precipitation and the andes makes ecuador suitable for hpps tpps function as backup systems for hpps as hpps production is prioritized over tpps and as stand alone power generators in remote areas e g in the amazon region generating electricity for the oil industry bpps use residues from the sugar industry opps have only started to become part of the national electricity grid recently 28 in 2017 hpps produced 72 3 pj 71 of the electricity in the country tpps 26 6 pj 26 and bpps 1 7 pj 2 the contribution of opps is small only 0 4 pj 0 4 in 2017 only 0 07 pj were imported from neighboring countries 0 07 of the electricity 28 so that ecuador is self sufficient fig 1 shows the power plants locations per electricity generating technology hpps tpps bpps and opps which are solar and wind pps in ecuador and the location of oil and gas mining and sugarcane plantations the hpps are in the andes mountains except for two multipurpose hpps that are in the western lowlands tpps are generally located in the vicinity of oil and gas fields solid biomass fired bpps are close to the sugarcane fields biogas fired bpps are in cities in the andes there is only one wind power plant and some solar power plants in the mountains in the north and the south 2 2 water consumption characteristics of different electricity generating technologies in ecuador the characteristics of the different electricity generating technologies affect their water consumption 2 2 1 hydropower plants hpps consume water in the form of evaporation from open water surfaces 6 the evaporation is a function of the evaporation rate and the size of the open water surface evaporation depends on climate characteristics the surface size on the hpp s infrastructure typical hpps include i dammed hpps ii run of the river ror hpps and iii in conduit hpps that have different characteristics affecting water consumption i dammed hpps have an artificial reservoir formed by a dam 29 these hpps include two types based on the shape of their artificial reservoir the first type includes hpps with flooded rivers in which the dam impounds rivers in narrow passages between mountains forming an artificial lake along the original river bank the second type includes hpps with flooded lakes in which a dam impounds rivers in wider and open areas forming an artificial lake that spreads in all directions along the original river bank their open water surfaces are wider and shallower than the ones of the flooded river type in ecuador flooded lakes are usually located high in the mountains and in the valleys flooded rivers are located in between them the surface size of artificial reservoirs affects the wf of dammed hpps 15 ii run of the river ror hpps do not have a dam but a construction to deviate the river flow store water and avoid damage to the turbines 29 weirs sand traps reservoirs open canals charge tanks or surge tanks are examples of the possible infrastructure of ror hpps that create open water surfaces from where water evaporates ror hpps include pps with and without reservoirs ror hpps with reservoirs are usually larger than rors without reservoirs have relatively large open water surfaces and water losses due to evaporation iii in conduit hpps take advantage of the water that flows through water supply installations 30 i e between storage reservoirs and treatment plants they generate electricity without the need for infrastructure that generates open water surfaces and therefore water is not consumed in ecuador ror and dammed hpps are sometimes built in a string along a river cascaded hpps in this way electricity generation increases as ror hpps benefit from the storage and flow regulation provided by dammed hpps moreover dammed hpps are often part of a multipurpose scheme that is used not only to generate electricity but also for other services as water supply irrigation and flood control 31 2 3 thermal power plants factors that determine water consumption of tpps are i the working fluid ii the cooling system 32 and iii the fuel the working fluid for power generation depends on the tpps thermodynamic cycle 33 in ecuador tpps use i rankine ii brayton and iii internal combustion engines otto and diesel thermodynamic cycles rankine pps use steam as a working fluid in a closed loop cycle brayton and internal combustion engines ice pps use an air fuel mix in an open loop cycle 33 rankine pps consume water when steam losses occur brayton and ice pps have negligible water consumption due to the working fluid tpps cooling system depends on the thermodynamic cycle and the availability of water ecuadorian tpps use three cooling systems i wet tower cooling ii once through cooling and iii dry cooling wet tower cooling systems use water in a closed loop cycle in which a share of the water evaporates 11 once through cooling uses an open loop cycle in which water is diverted from surface water into a heat exchanger and returns to where it came from with a higher temperature 2 these systems use fresh or saline water 34 dry cooling systems use refrigerant based cooling fluids in a closed loop cycle where flowing air removes waste heat this system does not use water in ecuador some ice pps use this cooling technology tpps use cooling for different functions rankine pps cool the working fluid 33 35 ice pps cool the engine 33 while brayton pps do not require cooling the fuel used by tpps also affects water consumption ecuador does not have exploitable coal or natural gas resources and no nuclear plants but it has oil 36 most of tpps use crude oil and oil derivatives 25 like fuel oil diesel naphtha lpg and residue oil 37 crude oil residue oil and fuel oil are highly viscous and require fuel preheating systems to store and transport the oil these systems are i water based systems which use steam or ii oil based systems which use thermal oil the first system consumes water as steam production has losses the second system s water requirement is negligible moreover diesel combustion in brayton turbines generates nox 38 to reduce emissions ecuadorian brayton tpps using diesel have a ghg control system using water to mix with the fumes 39 2 4 biomass power plants biomass power plants bpps are tpps using biomass as fuel water consumption of bpps depends on the type of fuel and the thermodynamic cycle in which the power plant operates ecuadorian bpps use two biomass types i solid biomass from sugarcane bagasse a residue of the sugar industry and ii biogas mostly methane from the waste decomposition of municipal landfills bagasse fired bpps are subsidiaries of companies whose main economic activity is sugar production bpps burn solid biomass in rankine pps that use wet tower cooling systems 40 they operate five months per year from may to november when bagasse in the sugarcane harvesting period is available 41 42 biogas fired bpps are subsidiaries of municipal waste disposal companies bpps burn biogas in ice pps that are usually dry cooled 43 2 5 wind and solar power plants solar power plant s water consumption depends on the pp s type there are two types of solar power plants i photovoltaic systems pvs and ii concentrated solar power thermal systems csps with different water consumption pvs only use water for cleaning purposes while csps use a rankine thermodynamic cycle that requires water as any other rankine tpp 11 ecuador only has pvs historically solar and wind power plants were stand alone systems recently they have started to become part of the national electricity grid 28 previous studies have shown that these two technologies have such small water consumptions that they are practically negligible 1 18 3 method the water footprint wf is a tool that estimates the volume of freshwater consumed by anthropogenic activities two methods exist for quantifying water consumption the wf method as described in ref 22 and the iso method as described in ref 23 the main difference between methods is observed in the impact assessment stage however they follow a similar life cycle approach for the quantification inventory stage 44 45 in this paper we address the quantification inventory stage only so any of the two could be used we chose to use the method described in ref 22 the assessment of water consumption of a product good or service using the wf is defined as a water footprint assessment wfa 22 the wf consist of three components green blue and grey wfs the green wf considers the consumption of green water sources precipitation the blue wf refers to the consumption of ground and surface water freshwater and the grey wf refers to pollution and is defined as the volume of freshwater required to assimilate pollutants into freshwater bodies to reach accepted water quality standards 22 this study included green and blue wfs and excluded grey wfs and non freshwater sources the wf of a power plant includes a direct wf and an indirect wf the direct wf is the blue water needed for the operations of the power plant itself the indirect wf considers the construction and decommissioning of the plant and the fuels life cycle several studies 1 18 46 have shown that construction and decommissioning of power plants have insignificant wfs when compared to the direct wf for hpps tpps and bpps for pvs the indirect wf is small and for wind pps is negligible 1 therefore we excluded wfs related to construction and decommissioning the indirect wf related to the fuels life cycle includes four stages i exploration crop growth in the case of biomass ii fuel mining harvesting in the case of biomass iii fuel transport and iv fuel processing the wf of the transport stage is negligible compared to the wf of the rest of the fuel s life cycle 1 moreover in ecuador power plants are located near the fuel mining locations and processing factories with small transport distances fig 1 thus we assumed that the transport wf is negligible fig 2 shows the stages of the indirect and direct wf components for the assessment of the wf of electricity in ecuador the indirect wf includes the water evaporated incorporated or lost during the life cycle production of the fuels the direct wf includes the freshwater consumed during electricity generation for biomass the life cycle considers ratooning or seeding growing harvesting and sugarcane milling sugar cane is a perennial crop after harvesting the stem base and roots are left on the field to grow again in the next growing period of 5 6 months 42 the residue bagasse is used as fuel by bpps for fossil fuels primary sources natural gas and crude oil 25 are extracted wells are explored drilled and mined a few power plants use the primary sources without further processing but most plants use derived fuel products of the crude oil distillation we calculated the green and blue wfs associated with the operation per ecuadorian power plant applying the wf calculation method as given in ref 22 the assessment included three clusters i inventory of the current composition of the ecuadorian electricity mix and related water consumption ii assessment of blue and green fuel wfs iii assessment of blue wfs of electricity generating technologies the clusters include a series of calculation steps 31 the most relevant steps 16 are given below while appendix a gives all calculation steps fig 3 shows the steps of the second and third clusters and how they relate to each other 3 1 the composition of the ecuadorian electricity mix 3 1 1 inventory of ecuadorian power plants step 1 makes an inventory of ecuadorian power plants in 2017 and their operating characteristics data were derived from ref 28 3 1 2 classification of power plants previous studies have aggregated power plants into categories according to their operating conditions and types of fuels used gleick 5 macknick et al 11 meldrum et al 1 and mekonnen et al 18 first categorized pps based on their energy source introducing subcategories according to specific characteristics e g fuel mining preparation technologies cooling types we expanded the categories including classes and subclasses based on water consumption characteristics described in subsection 2 2 step 2 classifies the ecuadorian power plants into four categories ten classes and eleven subclasses the four categories were based on the energy source hpps tpps which include power plants that use natural gas oil and its derivatives bpps and opps which include solar and wind power plants hpps include three classes dammed hpps ror hpps and in conduit hpps dammed and ror hpps both have two subclasses the flooded lake hfl and flooded river hfr for dammed hpps and the reservoir hrr and no reservoir hnr subclass for ror hpps in conduit hpps were not subclassified because they do not have open water surfaces and no blue wf tpps include three classes the rankine brayton and ice pps class the rankine and brayton class include two subclasses the wet tower rwt and once through rot cooling subclass for rankine pps and the diesel and gas fired class for brayton pps ices include three subclasses i wet tower iwt cooling ii once through iot cooling and iii dry idc cooling bpps include two classes solid biomass fired power plants bsb and biogas fired power plants in ecuador solid biomass fired power plants use sugarcane bagasse as fuel biogas fired bpps direct blue wf is negligible so they were not considered in this study finally opps include solar and wind power plants which were excluded as they have negligible direct and indirect wfs and because their electricity generation in ecuador is relatively small compared to other generating technologies fig 4 shows the classification scheme of ecuadorian power plants for the classification we derived power plant characteristics from national databases 28 47 and sources that give information per power plant when the hpp type or tpp cooling system could not be identified we used google maps and bing maps aerial images to identify infrastructure using the method described in ref 32 and tpps cooling systems appendix b gives the power plants classes and subclasses and the references used 3 2 the fuels water footprint of ecuadorian power plants 3 2 1 natural gas crude oil and oil derivatives ecuador has natural gas fields data on water requirements for natural gas extraction are available from ref 1 we assumed that the indirect blue wf for natural gas of 4 21 m3 tjth related to extraction is representative for all blue wfs of natural gas in ecuador for crude oil and derivatives step 3 calculates the blue wf of crude oil extraction from ecuadorian wells w f e x m3 m3 oil as the sum of the blue wf for oil well exploration and drilling w f e d m3 m3 oil and the blue wf of oil mining w f m m3 m3 oil as 1 w f e x w f e d w f m ecuadorian oil has a high viscosity 48 requiring enhanced oil recovery methods eor to facilitate extraction we calculated the w f e d m3 m3 oil based on the average freshwater consumption per well w f w e l l m3 well and the relation between the number of oil wells explored and drilled n w e l l s and the annual oil production p m3 oil data on well numbers and annual oil production were derived from the national oil trading company petroecuador ep 49 data on average water consumption per well was derived from the national oil extraction company petroamazonas ep 50 for the w f m we derived data from ref 51 of 2 97 m3 m3 oil considering an eor of steam injection that reuses 71 of the process water appendix a gives the calculation of w f e d distillation produces several derivatives step 4 estimates blue wfs of crude oil derivatives used for electricity generation in ecuador we allocated the blue wf of crude oil to each derivative d using the stepwise accumulative approach as defined in hoekstra et al 22 first we calculated the product fraction f p d and value fraction f v d of the oil distillation products as 2 f p d w d w i 3 f v d u p d w d d 1 k u p d w d where f p d is the fraction of derivative d processed from input product i it is the ratio of the weight w d of derivative d and the weight w i of input product i f v d is the fraction of the market value of derivative d to the aggregated market value of all derivatives d 1 to k obtained from the input products i the market value is the multiplication of the market price of derivate d u p d to the w d data on ecuadorian oil derivatives for 2013 were taken from ref 48 we assumed that there is no significant annual variation in the distillation process and crude oil properties remain constant appendix a gives the price energy content product and value fractions for oil distillation products for the esmeraldas refinery in 2013 next we allocated the blue wf to each product d of the crude oil distillation as 4 w f f d w f p r o c e s s i f p d i i 1 y w f p r o d u c t i f p d i f v d where the process wf is given per unit of input product i divided by the product fraction of that input product f p d i the second part of equation 4 calculates the sum of the blue wf of the input products i divided by the product fraction of those input products in this case there is only one product wf crude oil w f e x and the process wf is the distillation blue wf w f p which we calculated based on the average water consumption rate of the distillation process and the average oil distillation rate over the period of 2010 2016 data for the esmeraldas refinery were taken from refs 49 52 we assumed that the other ecuadorian refineries two smaller ones have similar wfs appendix a gives the w f p calculation 3 2 2 sugarcane and bagasse for the calculation of the green and blue wf of sugar cane bagasse we used the method described in ref 7 sugarcane blue wfs b l u e w f s c m3 t and green wfs g r e e n w f s c m3 t are calculated using annual blue and green crop water requirements b l u e and g r e e n c w r y r as b l u e w f s c b l u e c w r y r y s c 5 g r e e n w f s c g r e e n c w r y r y s c where y s c is the average annual sugar cane yield t ha data on yields of sugarcane producing bagasse for electricity were derived from refs 53 60 appendix c gives the annual yields for the different sugarcane fields step 5 calculates the sugarcane b l u e and g r e e n c w r y r m3 ha producing bagasse for electricity in ecuador as b l u e c w r y r m 1 12 b l u e c w r m 6 g r e e n c w r y r m 1 12 g r e e n c w r m where b l u e c w r m is the blue component of the monthly cwr of month m and g r e e n c w r m is the green component of the monthly cwr of month m m3 ha the c w r includes a b l u e and g r e e n c w r as sometimes the crop water requirement is fulfilled with a mix of rainfall and irrigation in ecuador bagasse for electricity originates from irrigated sugarcane when rainfall is not enough irrigation is applied as sugar cane companies use hydrological models to estimate the appropriate cwrs to improve yields 61 the assessment of b l u e and g r e e n cwrs was done by assessing the contribution of precipitation to total cwrs if monthly precipitation is larger or equals cwrs we assumed the b l u e c w r is zero when precipitation is smaller the b l u e c w r is the additional water provided to the crop usually during the wet season november to april rainfall is enough for cwrs and little or no irrigation is needed during the dry season may to october irrigation is needed we assessed monthly b l u e and g r e e n c w r s because the seasonal variation of water availability influences the ratio of b l u e and g r e e n components the calculation of the b l u e and g r e e n c w r m is based on the crop s daily evapotranspiration e t c appendix a gives the calculation step 6 calculates the b l u e and g r e e n w f s c of sugarcane using equation 5 sugarcane is the primary source of different products and by products sugar molasses and bagasse step 7 allocates the wf to bagasse based on the product and value fractions using equations 2 4 in a similar way as step 4 the product fractions were taken from ref 62 and the unitary prices from ref 63 bbps only use bagasse and no other residues like leaves or stems appendix a gives products and byproducts of sugarcane production including product fractions and unitary prices 3 3 assessment of the blue water footprint of electricity generating technologies in ecuador 3 3 1 wfs of hydropower plants the blue wf of hpps is determined by the evaporation from their open water surfaces step 8 calculates this evaporation w f o w s p per hydropower plant p m3 using the gross method described by ref 6 as 7 w f o w s p r 1 r 10 e v r a r r where e v r is the annual evaporation mm of open water surface r the factor 10 is used to convert mm to m3 ha and a r r is the area of the open water surface r ha a hpp p can have one or more open water surfaces depending on their infrastructure the w f o w s p was calculated as the sum of the evaporation from those open water surfaces from r 1 to r the e v r was calculated based on meteorological data using the modified penman method as described by ref 64 as it is suitable for equatorial regions 46 meteorological data were derived from the national meteorological agency inamhi 65 and the ecuadorian solar atlas 66 the a r r was estimated using geo referencing and geographic information software gis and topographic and bathymetric maps polygons per open water surface r were generated and measured maps of the ecuadorian terrain were derived from ref 67 appendix a gives the description of the calculation of e v r and a r r appendix d gives the location of the hpps the area of their open water surfaces and the nearby meteorological station from which data were taken for the evaporation calculation step 9 calculates the direct blue wf w f d i r p in m3 of the hydropower plant p based on the whether their open water surfaces are shared or not usually in ecuador the open water surfaces of power plant p are only used by that hpp in this case the w f d i r p is the same as the evaporation from the ows however some hpps open water surfaces are shared with more than one power plant power plants in cascade or they also serve for other ecological services multipurpose reservoirs for both cases we calculated the w f d i r p using the approach defined by refs 15 68 as follows 8 w f d i r p w f o w s p η where η is the allocation factor equation 8 refers to the stepwise accumulative approach described in step 4 when the w f p r o c e s s i is zero the product fraction f p is equal to 1 and the value fraction f v changest to the allocation factor η this is the case for hpps as there is no consumption during the electricity production inside the hpps multipurpose reservoirs could have a few potential ecosystem services such as electricity generation water supply flood control irrigation recreation aquaculture or conservation however ecuadorian multipurpose reservoirs considered in this study have been designed only for electricity generation water supply flood control irrigation for hpps with multipurpose open water surfaces the allocation factor is defined as the ratio between the economic values of hydroelectricity and the economic value of the sum of the ecosystem services in the reservoir for hpps in cascade the allocation factor η is defined as the ratio of the electricity generation of the hpp p and the total electricity production of the power plants in the string considering that all hpps in the string receive the same price per unit of electricity generated appendix a gives the calculation of the allocation factor appendix e shows the allocation calculation of the cases of multipurpose and cascaded hpps 3 3 2 wfs of thermal and biomass power plants data on water consumption of tpps in ecuador are scarce and available for a few pps to assess the wfs of tpps in ecuador we defined typical power plants which are the pps with available data of water consumption we assumed that these water consumption data were representative for all tpps inside each subclass of tpps appendix f gives a list of typical power plants per tpp subclass the data sources and their timeframe step 10 calculates the annual water consumption of typical tpps w f d i r t m3 by summing the average water consumption w p r o c k per operational process k from 1 to a for the pp e g water filtering demineralization cooling as 9 w f d i r t k 1 a w p r o c k appendix f gives water consumption and characteristics per typical thermal power plant step 11 calculates the direct blue wf per unit of energy w f e d i r t s m3 tj of a typical tpp t per subclass s by dividing the w f d i r t by the average annual electricity output over the period 1999 2017 e t tj 10 w f e d i r t s w f d i r t e t we assumed that typical power plants are representative for the entire subclass s step 12 calculates the direct blue wf of the rest of the tpps w f d i r p s m3 by multiplying the annual average electricity output per tpp over the period 1999 2017 e p tj by the direct blue wf per unit of energy w f e d i r t s 11 w f d i r p s e p w f e d i r t s bpps operate like rankine wet tower power plants we used the average monthly direct blue wf per unit of energy w f e d i r t s of wet tower rwt power plants to calculate the bpps direct blue wf w f d i r p s 3 3 3 blue wfs per power plant subclass and category step 13 calculates the indirect blue wf w f i n d p m3 per power plant p tpps and bpps only as hpps do not have indirect wf it was defined as the sum of the blue wfs of the fuels used by the pp from f 1 to f which was calculated by multiplying the blue wf of fuel d w f f d m3 m3 f or m3 tf for biomass by the average of the total volume or mass for biomass of that fuel consumed over the period 1999 2017 v d m3 f or t f as follows 12 w f i n d p f 1 f v d w f f d p data on fuel consumption were derived from ref 28 step 14 calculates the annual direct wf w f e d i r p and indirect wf w f e i n d p per unit of electricity generated m3 tjel per power plant p by dividing the direct and indirect wfs to its average annual electricity output e p tjel over the period 1999 2017 data on electricity generation were derived from ref 28 step 15 calculates the total blue wf w f p m3 for power plant p as the sum of the w f i n d p and the w f d i r p of power plant p in a similar way the total wf per unit of electricity generated of power plant p w f e p in m3 tjel is the sum of the w f e d i r p and w f e i n d p step 16 calculates the blue wf per subclass and category the subclasses blue wf w f s m3 is calculated by summing all the power plants w f p per subclass s the categories blue wf w f c m3 is calculated in the same way the wf per unit of electricity per subclass is expressed as a range showing the smallest and largest w f e t o t p s as well as the median value 4 results 4 1 ecuadorian power plant technologies and their contribution to the gross electricity production of the country fig 5 shows the number of pps per subclass class and category and their contribution to the national electricity output of ecuador in 2017 there were 287 pps in operation most pps 165 belong to the tpps idc subclass they generate 15 of the electricity or 64 times more than iots which produce 7 of rot and 19 times more than iwts which produce 60 of rwt in the other tpps subclasses bgf electricity output is five times larger than the bdf output and rots generate twice as much as rwts for hydropower the hfr and hfl subclasses both have five pps but hfrs produce more than four times as much electricity than hfls of the 49 ror pps the 31 hnrs generate 26 of the electricity generated by 18 hrrs fig 5 shows that in conduit biogas wind and solar pv pps include 32 pps but only generate 1 of the electricity in ecuador 4 2 water footprints of fuels used in ecuadorian power plants 4 2 1 blue water footprints of crude oil and its derived fuels the average exploration and drilling blue wf of crude oil is 0 02 cubic meter of water per cubic meter of fuel m3 m3 f the distillation blue wf is 0 71 m3 m3 f both footprints are smaller than the blue wf for the mining of crude oil of 2 98 m3 m3 f table 1 gives the blue wfs of crude oil and its derived fuels used for electricity generation per unit of volume m3 m3 f and unit of energy m3 tjth table 1 shows that the difference between the fuel with the largest blue wf per unit of volume diesel 2 with 2 9 m3 m3 f and the smallest wf lpg with 1 07 m3 m3 f is almost threefold wfs of naphtha fuel oil and residue range in between these values the same order is observed for the wf per unit of energy except for lpg which has a larger wf than residue because lpg has a smaller energy content per unit of volume than residue 0 024 tj m3 and 0 037 tj m3 respectively 4 2 2 green and blue water footprints of sugarcane bagasse fig 6 shows the average green and blue wfs of bagasse used for electricity generation between 1990 and 2012 for three power plants and the average annual precipitation per location the wf varies in volume and color due to differences in local crop yields and rainfall patterns 42 in ecuador bagasse used for electricity generation has an average total blue and green wf of 37 m3 t and 4911 m3 tjh the green wf is 23 m3 t and the blue wf 14 m3 t fig 6 also shows that the san carlos power plant has a smaller blue wf and higher precipitation so there is little need for irrigation appendix a gives the precipitation data of the sugarcane fields that provide bagasse for the three bpps and the monthly blue and green cwr of ecuadorian sugarcane 4 2 3 blue water footprint of electricity generating technologies in ecuador table 2 shows the annual indirect direct and total blue wfs of electricity from 1999 to 2017 for the subclasses of the three categories of power plants hpps bpps and tpps appendix g gives the blue wf of individual ecuadorian power plants table 2 shows large variation among the blue wf of ecuadorian power plants first in terms of the differences between categories second in terms of the differences between subclasses that are part of the same class and finally in terms of the variation inside each subclass firstly there is a large blue wf variation among subclasses of different categories bpps have the largest median blue wf 18069 m3 tjel almost five times larger than the median blue wf of electricity from the hfl subclass the latter is the subclass with the largest blue wf of the hpps category almost five times larger than the blue wf of the iwt subclass the subclass with the largest blue wf of the tpps category these variations are caused by large differences in operation conditions for instance bpps have larger blue wfs because they combine a large direct blue wf for wet tower cooling and a large indirect blue wf because they use bagasse from irrigated sugar cane secondly table 2 shows that there is large variation among subclasses in the same category in the tpp category the iwts median blue wf is almost 16 times larger than the smallest blue wf of the bgf subclass this difference correlates to the significant variation of the direct blue wf per cooling type wet tower subclasses rwt and iwt have the largest wf because their cooling system is water intensive rots and iots do not use freshwater for cooling but they have a blue wf because most of them use heavy fuels that require an additional preheating system consuming water rwts and iwts have an average direct blue wf 15 times larger than the direct blue wf of rots and iots and 72 times larger than idcs the most water efficient cooling technology moreover hpps show the largest wf variation inside a category because hpps wfs are determined by the volume of water that evaporates from the hpp open water surfaces and the four hpps subclasses have large differences in the volumes of water evaporating from their open water surfaces for instance the hfls median blue wfs is around 48 times larger than the median blue wf of the smallest hpps subclass hrr as larger volumes of water evaporate from hfl than for hrr hpps wfs are determined by the water volume that evaporates from the hpp open water surfaces where evaporation is a function of i the size of the open water surfaces and ii the evaporation rates determined by climatic conditions fig 7 a and b shows to which extent these two factors affect the blue wf of hpps fig 7a shows a linear relationship between open water surfaces and blue wfs as the area of the open water surface increases so does the blue wf the outliers of this trend correspond to ror hpps that benefit from upstream reservoirs so they have small open water surfaces but relatively large blue wfs due to the allocation of the evaporation from the reservoirs upstream the subclasses cluster in groups from smaller open water surfaces hnr to larger surfaces hfl hrrs and hfrs are in between these two subclasses fig 7b shows that in ecuador the evaporation rate does not have a significant correlation with the blue wf hpp subclasses do not show an increasing or decreasing pattern this suggests that the size of the open water surfaces has a larger effect on the blue wf of the hpps than the evaporation rate of the reservoir this is probably due to the country s equatorial climate and the hpp locations in the andes mountains fig 8 shows the relation between annual average electricity generation tj and the open water surface of the ecuadorian hpps reservoirs the outliers correspond to the ror hpps that benefit from the reservoirs of other hpps upstream fig 8 shows that for ror hpps the larger the open water surface the larger the annual electricity generation independently of the subclass in this way they can produce large amounts of electricity with significantly smaller sizes of their open water surfaces however fig 8 also shows a difference between the trend of dammed hpps and its subclasses hfls hpps have large open water surfaces and lower electricity production than their hfr counterparts table 2 figs 7 and 8 indicate that the large wf differences of hpps are caused by differences among their infrastructure the smallest blue wfs are observed for hpps that benefit from infrastructure with small and deep open water surfaces producing relatively large amounts of electricity e g hfrs or for medium and small sized hpps that do not require large open water surfaces e g hrrs finally table 2 shows that there is large variation inside each subclass these differences are due to the unique operating conditions of each power plant inside each subclass for example the difference between hpps with the smallest and largest blue wf in the hrr subclass is almost 250 fold similar differences are observed in the hfr and hnr subclasses 109 fold and 108 fold respectively in this case too the variation of blue wf for hrr hfr and hnr happens because each pp inside those subclasses has different infrastructure for bpps the variation within the bsb class is caused by the sugarcane bagasse used the bagasse has different wfs depending on the site where the sugarcane is grown fig 6 weather conditions of sugarcane fields define when and how much the crop needs to be irrigated during the dry season this correlates to the variation among bsb indirect blue wfs there are also large differences in tpps subclasses the largest difference between the tpp with the smallest and largest blue wf is observed in the idc subclass 63 fold and it is mainly due to the differences in the fuel use the lowest end of this subclass uses diesel 2 and the highest end of the range uses a mix of diesel 2 and heavy fuels crude oil residue oil and fuel oil fig 9 shows blue wf variation m3 of tpps in relation to their electricity production the tpps have been grouped first in terms of their cooling system once through wet tower dry cooling no cooling next by the fuel used fuel oil residue oil crude oil diesel and natural gas showing the significant differences between cooling systems tpps with wet tower cooling squares have the largest blue wf in relation to their electricity production the tpps with the lowest blue wf in relation to their electricity production are a group of tpps with dry cooling moreover fig 9 shows the difference between fuels used by the tpps and their blue wf natural gas fired tpps brown have the smallest blue wf per tj of electricity crude oil yellow fuel oil orange and diesel green using plants have wfs between plants using residue oil blue and gas the wf variation for tpp subclasses is mainly correlated with the specific fuel mix applied for example in table 2 the bgf subclass has a large blue wf variation they mostly consume natural gas but one plant in the bgf subclass uses diesel resulting in seven times larger blue wf compared to the other bgf plants the fuel mix also affects the wfs of rankine and ice tpps that use heavy fuels crude oil residue oil and fuel oil the use of heavy fuels also includes diesel 2 consumption the volume of diesel 2 in the fuel mix of the tpp affects the relation between direct and indirect wf of the tpps fig 10 shows the indirect and direct blue wf per unit of electricity of the typical power tpps that use a mix of heavy fuels and diesel of two comparable subclasses rwt and iwt as they have similar cooling systems it shows that the addition of diesel 2 has a larger effect on the increase of the direct blue wf than in the decrease of indirect blue wf 4 3 blue water footprint of the current ecuadorian electricity mix fig 11 a and b shows the composition of the blue wf of electricity in ecuador fig 11a shows blue wfs per power plant category hpps bpps and tpps compared to the gross electricity output fig 11b shows blue wfs and gross electricity output per pp subclass fig 11a shows that tpps have the smallest contribution to the total ecuadorian blue wf for electricity 11 followed by bpps 24 and hpps 65 when comparing the blue wf of power plant categories and their gross electricity output fig 11a the blue wf does not linearly relate to the amount of electricity generated from 1999 to 2017 tpps produced 41 of the electricity but the contribution to the blue wf was relatively small bpps electricity generation is small compared to hpps or tpps only 1 but they have the second largest blue wf after hydropower fig 11b shows that subclasses with large blue wfs are not necessarily the ones with large electricity output for instance hfls have the largest blue wf six times larger than hfrs wfs but they only generate one fourth of their electricity rwts and iwts contribute 44 to the blue wf of the tpp category but generate 8 of the category s electricity 5 discussion 5 1 implications for the water electricity nexus previous studies have focused on assessing the most evident water intensive electricity generating technologies like hpps with large reservoirs hfl in our classification biomass fired and water cooled tpps 6 7 12 13 16 69 our study assessed wfs of these technologies in more detail for instance we also assessed tpps operational wfs besides cooling for fuel use and ghg control the studies of meldrum et al 1 mekonnen and hoekstra 6 and gleick 5 have shown large wf variations for power plant categories by including more technologies per category we show that there are large differences among wfs in subclasses of electricity generating technologies the variation of the blue wfs of pps is large as reported in previous studies but the order of magnitude varies between subclasses for instance we found that for hpps hfls have the largest blue wf per unit of electricity generated followed by hfrs hnrs and finally the smallest blue wf for hrrs these differences have not been reported in previous studies additionally we assessed the wf of two electricity generating technologies for which no wf data were available ror hpps and ice pps and included wfs of hpps with open water surfaces smaller than 0 1 ha we show that water that evaporates from ror hpps open water surfaces weirs sand traps and reservoirs is significant in relation to their electricity output small ror hpps therefore have a comparable blue wf per unit of electricity m3 tjel as hpps with large open water surfaces the linear relationship between water evaporation and electricity output of small ror hpps is the reason that we advise that small ror hpps should be included in future wfas of electricity ice tpps indirect blue wf is the largest of all technologies but they are usually water efficient when combined with dry cooling radiators mekonnen and hoekstra 70 calculated an average annual blue wf of 2443 million m3 for the productive sectors of ecuador agriculture livestock industry and domestic water supply between 1996 and 2005 our results show that ecuadorian electricity generation consumes 86 5 million m3 of water yearly or 3 5 of the total blue wf which is small in comparison to the 2186 million m3 of freshwater consumed yearly for crop production and livestock water supply 70 in the country the small contribution indicates that electricity generation does not have a significant impact on the country s total wf and that its optimization has limited impact on the country s freshwater consumption if there are always plenty resources in the country for all users then the optimization of a water efficient mix for ecuador is not relevant for the country itself but might provide insights towards the more efficient use of water for electricity especially for other countries with different conditions and resources nonetheless this remains to be defined in a more detailed study that considers the spatial and temporal constraints of freshwater in the country s basins and the competition between users 5 2 influential factors of the wf of electricity generating technologies our results show a large variation of direct and indirect blue wfs between different electricity generating technologies affected by several factors for bsb bpps sugarcane irrigation is the most influential factor also regional differences in precipitation patterns affect blue wfs of bsb bpps wetter regions could have lower blue wfs than the ones described in this study for hpps blue wfs are mainly determined by their open water surfaces size and not by evaporation rates due to the equatorial climate further studies are required to assess this relationship for higher latitudes dammed hpps with small and deep reservoirs hfr are more water efficient than dammed hpps with large and shallow reservoirs hfl mainly because hfrs produce more electricity with smaller open water surfaces than hfls ror hpps have relatively large blue wfs in hrr but this permits them to produce more electricity which results in relatively small blue wfs per unit of electricity compared to wfs of rors without reservoirs hnr although hnrs have relatively small open water surfaces their blue wfs are comparable to hfrs or larger than hrr wfs the most water efficient hpps technologies are hfr and hrr and they should be prioritized for tpps the cooling system is the most influential factor affecting blue wfs tpps with water intensive cooling systems like wet tower cooling have the largest blue wf of the category brayton cycle tpps which do not require cooling have the smallest blue wf however the tpps fuel use also has a large impact there is a large difference between brayton subclasses and idc tpps due to different fuel use brayton and ice power plants using natural gas have smaller blue wfs than diesel fired brayton and ice pps tpps using heavy fuel oils crude oil residue oil and fuel oil have larger wfs than their counterparts because of the additional requirement of having a fuel preheating system that usually is steam based and the addition of diesel 2 into the fuel mix the volume of diesel 2 in relation to the heavy fuel required in these tpps is also an influential factor for tpps especially for the direct wf on the one hand diesel 2 has a small share in the fuel mix of rankine tpps rwt in these tpps diesel 2 is only used to start the boiler and then heavy oil is burnt alone for the rest of the operation on the other hand diesel 2 has a larger share in the fuel mix of ices iwt they mix diesel 2 with heavy fuels throughout the operation of the tpp the direct blue wf of iwts is larger than the direct blue wf of rwt because iwt only need to produce steam for the fuel s preheating system and this implicates larger blue wf than in the case of rwt that already produce steam for its thermodynamic cycle and can divert part of it to the preheating system 5 3 limitations of the study lack of data gave rise to the following assumptions i we used available data on oil extraction and distillation from a state owned company assuming their wfs are representative for the sector there are 17 oil extracting companies 71 but only one petroamazonas ep a company producing 71 of ecuador s oil provides data on water consumption for operations in ecuador there are three refineries but only one the esmeraldas refinery which produces half of the ecuadorian oil derivatives 49 provides data on water consumption for operations we assumed the wf data are representative for the other two refineries ii we did not calculate the direct wf of all tpps and bpps because data for each power plant were not available we categorized tpps and bpps into classes and subclasses with similar operating conditions and assumed that wfs of typical power plants that had data were representative this assumption did not influence the results of the country s blue wf because the direct wfs of tpps and bpps is relatively small in comparison to their indirect blue wf iii when available we used multiannual monthly water consumption averages to assess the multiannual average blue wf of power plants however multiannual averages do not always cover the same period due to lack of data for example we used the period 1999 2017 to calculate the average power plant electricity generation and fuel consumption and the period 1981 2010 for meteorological data we assumed that these averages are representative of the processes and operations and that the ecuadorian climate does not have large annual variation moreover we excluded the gray wf for some power plant subclasses the gray wfs could be large in comparison to green or blue wfs i e for thermal power plants with once through cooling causing thermal water pollution if also gray wfs are considered the country s total electricity wf is larger and some subclasses have larger wfs than the ones presented in this paper 5 4 comparison of results with previous studies there are fuel blue wfs available from the literature gerbens leenes et al 72 have calculated a blue wf range for diesel of 28 376 m3 tjth and for heavy fuel oil of 10 133 m3 tjth our results are 79 and 46 m3 tjth respectively which are in the range found by gerbens leenes et al for sugarcane bagasse mathioudakis et al 13 have calculated a blue wf of 20 m3 t using data from ref 73 our monthly average blue wf is 15 m3 t 25 smaller than the blue wf assessed by mathioudakis et al that was based on global average blue wfs of sugar cane including countries with relatively small yields our smaller wf is probably caused by the relatively large sugarcane yield in ecuador that is 20 larger than the country s average yield reported by fao 74 previous studies have shown that hpps have large blue wfs but differences are large and depend on local circumstances i e on the size of the open water surfaces and local climate differences can be four orders of magnitude mekonnen and hoekstra 6 have shown that the average global wf of hydropower ranges between 39000 and 69400 m3 tjel liu et al 15 have calculated a wf for hydropower in china between 3900 and 100000 m3 tjel and zhao and liu 68 have calculated a range between 800 and 9200 m3 tjel for hpps with multipurpose reservoirs our calculations give a blue wf from 14 to 13085 m3 tjel with a median wf of 197 m3 tjel which are smaller than the wfs reported previously earlier studies however only included large hpps hfl category while this study also included small hpps when only comparing hfl s wfs our results range from 1254 to 13085 m3 tjel similar to results of zhao and liu 68 mathioudakis et al 13 have calculated a blue wf of electricity from sugarcane bagasse of 9100 m3 tjel our calculations give a median blue wf of 18069 m3 tjel almost twice the wf of mathioudakis et al 13 this difference is likely to result from the differences between sugarcane bagasse s higher heating values hhv ecuadorian sugarcane has an hhv of 7 6 mj kg 75 which is almost half the hhv value used by mathioudakis et al 13 who used the average of a large range of hhvs reported for case studies around the world the ecuadorian sugarcane hhv is relatively small compared to the hhvs of those case studies mekonnen et al 18 and meldrum et al 1 have shown that the direct blue wfs of coal fired power plants range between 61 and 1410 m3 tjel for rwt class tpps with similar cooling systems the median blue direct wf is 802 m3 tjel comparable to earlier results meldrum et al 1 give a wf of 52 3 m3 tjel for coal fired power plants with open loop cooling this study calculated a median blue wf of a rot power plant of 176 m3 tjel three times larger than the value obtained by meldrum et al 1 ecuadorian rot power plants use steam to preheat the fuel oil before burning generating a relatively large wf our result for bgf power plants median blue wfs 54 m3 tjel is comparable to the wf of gas combustion turbines of 52 7 m3 tjel reported by meldrum et al 1 ecuadorian bdf power plants use freshwater to reduce nox emissions their median blue wf is 354 m3 tj almost seven times larger than wfs reported by meldrum et al 1 that study however excluded water consumption to reduce ghg emissions mekonnen et al 18 have presented regional estimates of wfs for heat and electricity latin america and the caribbean have an annual average blue wf of 17000 m3 tjel for hpps and 405 m3 tjel for tpps our results show that ecuador s average blue wfs for hpps and tpps are 732 m3 tjel and 253 m3 tjel respectively the tpps blue wfs are similar to the value given by mekonnen et al 18 but the hpps blue wf assessed in this study is 23 times smaller than the one calculated by mekonnen et al 18 ecuadorian large hfl power plants have blue wfs ranging from 1200 to 13000 m3 tjel hfr and ror hpps have a blue wf range of 14 4000 m3 tj including small hpps lowered the average blue wf per unit of electricity in ecuador most of our results are comparable to results of previous studies which suggest that the methods used and the assumptions made were logic however deviations indicate that earlier estimations based on regional averages and large installations might overestimate the wfs the efficient use of freshwater for electricity generation is paramount in a context where electricity demand is increasing and freshwater resources are becoming scarcer our results show that there are opportunities for a more water efficient power generation not only for ecuador but probably also for other countries and regions 6 conclusions there are large differences among blue wfs of different power plant technologies in ecuador these variations can be ascribed to the difference in fuel use operating conditions and infrastructure electricity from biomass has the largest blue wf 14557 26377 m3 tjel followed by electricity from hydropower 14 13085 m3 tjel electricity generated in thermal power plants using fossil fuels have wfs between 9 and 936 m3 tjel the largest blue wf variation occurs in the hydropower plant category where blue wfs mainly depend on the power plant s infrastructure large dammed flooded lake hydropower plants have the largest blue wf small ror hydropower plants with reservoirs the smallest dammed hydropower plants have larger blue wfs than ror however ror hydropower plants have a significant blue wf in relation to their electricity output in the category of tpp s the subclass of thermal power plants with wet tower cooling have the largest blue wfs gas fired brayton power plants the smallest the blue wfs of the power plants with once through cooling or internal combustion engines with dry cooling is smaller than power plants with wet tower cooling nonetheless even though their cooling system does not consume water their direct blue wf is comparable with other technologies due to the fuel mix they use heavy fuels crude oil fuel oil and residue oil require preheating which can be water intensive if it is steam based moreover diesel fired brayton power plants use water for ghg control which is water intensive in terms of fuels natural gas is the most water efficient fuel 4 21 m3 tjth followed by crude oil and derivatives 36 4 83 3 m3 tjth biomass is the least efficient 4910 8 m3 tjh overall gas fired power plants have seven times smaller blue wfs than crude oil and crude oil derivatives fired power plants wf variations suggest that there are water efficient technologies even for the technologies that were considered water intensive in previous studies hydropower run of the river hydropower plants with reservoirs and dammed flooded river hydropower plants have relatively small blue wfs per unit of electricity that are in the same order of magnitude as wfs of electricity from thermal power plants some subclasses of the run of the river hydropower plants and the stationary internal combustion engines contribute relatively little to ecuador s blue wf for electricity this shows that there are alternatives to optimize the electricity mix from a water efficiency point of view the ecuadorian electricity generation consumes 86 5 million m3 of water yearly or 3 5 of the total blue wf hydropower plants consume 66 of the total water for electricity biomass power plants 23 and thermal power plants 11 technology variation and differences among fuel wfs indicate pathways towards water efficient electricity mixes besides the benchmark wfs calculated in this study future studies should also consider spatial and temporal constraints of freshwater availability and competition between users in basins where

8812,the middle east and north africa region mena is one of the most water scarce worldwide up to date estimates of the origin and types of water use in various industries are necessary to manage water resources and guide food and water policies the objective of this study is to determine new estimates for the color coded water footprint wf using the water footprint network approach country specific blue green and grey wfs and total virtual water were calculated for 2010 2016 using recent production data we find that animal production in mena increased by 50 as compared to the previous decade virtual water consumption account for more than 80 billion m3 annually mostly for beef 61 followed by broilers 20 and sheep 17 40 of which is local almost 50 of the feed grains used in the region are produced locally accounting for 40 of the total wf for animal production in mena keywords poultry sheep and goats beef dairy blue water green water 1 introduction the mena region is already one of the driest and most water scarce regions of the world 1 and it currently faces severe challenges posed by climate change and limited water supplies it is characterized by its low internal water resources which are expected to be further depleted because of the increasing water demand coupled with a growing population the internal renewable water resources in mena have been estimated at 609 m3 per year per capita compared to a world figure of 6080 m3 2 waterbury 3 states that out of the 33 of the world s most water stressed countries 14 are in the mena region per capita water resources range from 1077 m3 per year in iraq to only 53 m3 per year in saudi arabia 4 because a large share of the mena region s freshwater resources is used in the agriculture and livestock production sectors 5 6 this water scarcity is threatening the sustainability of these production systems as a result a competition between the human population and the major components of production systems crops and livestock will rise 7 where water will be allocated away from agriculture to domestic and industrial use 7 the agriculture sector in the region offers the most effective target for improvement in efficiency in water use 3 also agriculture and especially livestock represent a major fraction of the global wf where 30 of the global agricultural wf is related to livestock production 8 this situation has surged the importance of quantifying the water used in feeding servicing and watering livestock to select the best system in terms of water use and thus optimize water use in livestock farming for the purpose of doing so the concept of wf developed by hoekstra et al 9 has been increasingly used the feed that is consumed by the animal represents a major fraction of the wf of livestock 8 the wf of the feed items has three color coded major components green blue and grey 10 green water refers to water originating in the short term sense directly from rainfall that is stored in the crop root zone blue water refers to water originating from surface water or groundwater i e diverted or pumped and grey water refers to the amount of water needed to assimilate the load of pollutants produced by the production system globally green water accounts for 90 of the consumptive water used by livestock in comparison to 2 8 of blue water that is used in servicing watering and feed mixing 8 few papers have been published on the wf of farm animal products mekonnen and hoekstra 8 made a global study on the wf of farm animals and concluded that the blue and grey wf of animal products is the largest for industrial systems with the exception for chicken products the objective of this study was to determine new estimates for the imported and local wf blue green and grey and the corresponding virtual water content blue green and grey for the different animal products eggs chickens beef milk goat and sheep meat in the mena region our motivation stems from the fact that the latest available figures in the literature reflect the averages for the period 1995 2005 as developed globally population expansion in the region in the last decade must have had an effect on these figures and therefore a new estimate is needed to guide water and food policies 2 methods 2 1 study area fourteen countries from the mena region were included in this study namely algeria egypt israel jordan kuwait lebanon mauritania morocco oman qatar saudi arabia sudan tunisia turkey and yemen libya iraq iran and syria and are not included due to a lack of recent data the main farm animals of this region are beef cattle used for meat production dairy cows used for milk production sheep and goats used for meat and milk broilers used for meat production in addition to laying hens used for egg production dairy and beef are raised under intensive systems while sheep and goats are mostly managed under nomadic and semi nomadic systems feeding on native pastures and crop residues the majority of dairy cows are of the holstein friesian breed nearly all beef breeds are imported and simply fattened and used locally the predominant sheep breed is the awassi and in some countries there are specialized breeds like the tunis breed and the barbarine breed in tunisia goats are predominantly of the baladi breed with some shami and their crosses there are also some specialized country breeds like the black bedouin in saudi arabia poultry production is highly commercialized with over 95 of chicken meat coming from commercial broiler operations and over 90 of eggs from layer operations commercial crosses for broiler operations are white plymouth rock x cornish white commercial egg producing flocks are made up of white leghorns of both white and brown layers while backyard chickens are of mixed breeds mainly the baladi and in egypt the fayoumi in this analysis the feed composition and water consumption for the aforementioned animals prior to reaching their slaughter age were obtained from farms based on lebanon and were validated through data obtained from the literature 9 in order to calculate the wf of the animal products the wf network approach 8 was followed the wf of an animal is expressed as 1 w f a c s w f f e e d a c s w f d r i n k a c s w f s e r v i c e a c s where wf a c s represents the wf for category a animal in country c for production system s wffeed a c s wfdrink a c s wfservice a c s represent the wf for category a animal in country c for production system s related to feed drinking water and service water consumption respectively in this study country specific blue green and grey wf were calculated as an average for 2010 2016 with respect to the industrial systems of production the region is dependent on imported feedstuffs mainly yellow corn wheat barley and soybeans whose production constitutes over 90 of the wf the wf of these was calculated for both imported as well as locally produced feedstuffs we also calculate the per capita annual virtual water consumption for each animal category in the studied countries the feeding systems in animal production consist of three categories industrial mixed and grazing in the industrial category we assume that concentrate represents 100 of the feed consumed by the animal in the mixed category feed is a combination of both concentrate and pasture in the grazing category pasture represents 100 of the feed but in the mena region there is no animal product that relies completely on grazing even sheep and goats are fed some concentrate when pasture is not available dairy and beef are raised under intensive systems while sheep and goats are mostly managed under nomadic and semi nomadic systems feeding on native pastures and crop residues the majority of dairy cows are of the holstein friesian breed nearly all beef breeds are imported and simply fattened and used locally the predominant sheep breed is the awassi and in some countries there are specialized breeds like the tunis breed and the barbarine breed in tunisia goats are predominantly of the baladi breed with some shami and their crosses there are also some specialized country breeds like the black bedouin in saudi arabia poultry production is highly commercialized with over 95 of chicken meat coming from commercial broiler operations and over 90 of eggs from layer operations commercial crosses for broiler operations are white plymouth rock x cornish white commercial egg producing flocks are made up of white leghorns of both white and brown layers while backyard chickens are of mixed breeds mainly the baladi and in egypt the fayoumi in this current study the wf of animal products was calculated for six animal categories beef cows dairy cows sheep goats broiler chickens and laying hens certain assumptions were made based on data gathered from farms in lebanon which makes the methodology followed in this study different from other studies these assumptions include the diet composition of farm animals percentage feed composition average daily water requirement and animal live weight falling under the mixed production system are the beef cattle diet composition 50 concentrate 50 roughage and dairy cows diet composition 40 concentrate 60 roughage for the sheep and goat the rangeland and concentrate contribution to the diet were assumed to be 70 and 30 for the sheep and 90 10 for the goat falling under the industrial production system category are the broiler chickens and laying hens of 100 concentrate diet composition it is important to note that animal feed items in the mena region originate from both domestic and imported products we calculated the wf of feed ingredients according to mekonnen and hoekstra 8 using the weighted average wf for domestic and imported products the weighted average wf of feed ingredients was calculated using equation 2 2 w f p p p w f p n e t i n e p w f n e p p p n e t i n e p where p p is the domestic production of feed item p ton year ti ne p is the imported amount of feed item p ton year from exporting country ne wf p is the wf of feed item p for domestic production m3 ton wf ne p is the wf of feed item p for exporting country ne m3 ton and wf is the weighted average wf for feed item p m3 ton the amount of the imported feed items from exporting countries and the domestic production of these items were obtained from faostat database 11 the wf of the feed ingredient in the source countries was adopted from mekonnen and hoekstra 12 similarly the weighted average wf of roughages was derived from that of the concentrate the wf of roughages was estimated according to hoekstra 13 using equation 3 3 w f r o u g h a g e s w f c o n c e n t r a t e 5 where wf concentrate is the weighted average of the wf for the feed ingredients for the respective animal 2 2 local and imported wf for the animal feed ingredients to calculate the proportion of local to the imported wf of the animal products in the studied countries we need to determine the proportion of local to the imported wf of the corresponding feed ingredients the local wf local and the imported wf imported weighted average wf m3 ton of the animal feed ingredients were calculated as follows we first determine the production of the ingredient average for 2010 2016 and the import average 2011 2013 for each country as reported by foastat database 11 then we multiply this production by the wf of that ingredient and divide it by the total imports and production to get the local fraction of the weighted average wf of each feed ingredient as for the imported fraction we multiply the imported amount of the feed item by its corresponding wf in the exporting country the result of this multiplication was summed and then divided over the total imports and production equations 4 and 5 both wf p and wf ne p were obtained from mekonnen and hoekstra 12 assuming that this wf for the feed ingredient did not change 4 wf

country are presented in tables a1 a2 and a3 supplementary file 2 3 the wf of animal feed intake the wf for feed intake was calculated based on the amount of feed consumed by the animal the wf of the feed ingredient and the slaughter age 5 9 the wf for feed intake wffeed m3 animal was calculated according to chapagain and hoekstra 9 as per equations 8 10 8 w f f e e d t w f s a where twf is the total wf of feed crops per animal m3 year sa is the slaughter age year twf was calculated from the amount of feed for each ingredient consumed per animal afv tons year and the weighted average wf of

assuming that the feed consumption increases linearly with age until the start of adulthood 8 9 2 3 1 feed conversion ratio to determine the required amount of feed by the animal expressed as feed volume fv tons per animal we multiplied the live weight of the animal tons by the feed conversion of the corresponding animal equation 10 according to chapagain and hoekstra 9 and zhang et al 14 10 f

highest increase in production more than double that of eggs and sheep meat this situation will be even worse with the increase in meat consumption where fiala 27 predicted that the consumption of meat worldwide is going to rise by 72 between 2000 and 2030 the percent increase in animal production in the mena region during the past decade 2006 2016 was about 50 compared to the previous decade 1995 2005 by 2050 animal growth rates are estimated to reach 1 8 globally and 2 4 per year in developing countries the increase in cattle meat is due to increases in the dairy sector since male calves are usually fattened for meat rather than actual increases in the production of beef animal breeds 3 2 water allocation for wf calculations an interpretation of water use showed that over 94 of the water in the mena region is used to produce the feed for the studied animals and less than 4 is used for drinking and less than 2 is used for servicing those animals this varied from one species to another as table 5 shows 3 3 imports and local production of feedstuffs an analysis of imports and local production of feedstuffs showed that 52 of wheat is produced locally while 48 is imported barley imports amounted to 53 compared to the local production of 47 corn imports exceed 58 nearly all soybeans used locally were imported with only about 4 produced locally see table 6 these results show that the region is dependent on agricultural imports this is how it compensates for its relative lack of water resources however this dependency will increase in the future because of a projected population increase from about 380 million in 2000 to over 600 million people in 2050 this will also be aggravated by global warming as indicated by waterbury 3 3 4 the wf of the animal products in mena the wf of the animal products was obtained by combining the feed conversion efficiency of each animal and the wf of the feedstuffs the results show that the wf of the livestock product differs among the animals due to differences in feed conversion efficiency overall 50 of the wf in mena is beef meat 6 broiler meat 3 milk 7 eggs 15 goats and 20 is sheep meat also wf differs among studied countries due to the difference in climatic conditions agricultural practices and origin of feed for animal production our results show that milk followed by chicken meat has the lowest wf this result is proved by mottet et al 28 who reported that poultry emerges as the most efficient sub sector in the animal sector in its use of natural resources and in providing protein as a supply for growing global demand this is also clarified by mekonnen and hoekstra 8 who showed that poultry production requires 11 times less feed per kg compared to producing beef the wf of broiler meat differs from other animal products due to other factors including the feed consumption type of production system and feed origin the feed consumed by the broiler is mainly made up of concentrate as reported by gerbens leenes et al 26 the concentrated feed has a larger wf than roughage but better feed conversion also broilers in the studied countries are raised in an industrial system generally industrial systems have a smaller wf than other systems because animals are bred to grow faster move less and have better feed conversion therefore governments of the region should introduce legislation in favor of poultry meat production in an attempt to save on valuable water resources detailed results on the wf of animal products for each country are presented in table 7 3 5 local and imported total virtual water content of livestock animals the virtual water consumption due to meat products for the studies countries of the mena region is 77 7 billion m3 yr turkey alone constitutes 35 of mena s virtual water consumption 47 of which is imported fig 1 north africa constitutes 37 of total mena s virtual water use 68 of which is imported the near east countries constitute 20 of total mena s virtual water use 61 of which is imported the gulf region s share is only 8 due to its relatively small population 70 of which is imported among the meat products beef constitutes the largest percentage of virtual water consumption in mena 61 followed by broilers 20 and sheep 17 consumption fig 2 these percentages vary by region for example the near east countries and turkey spend more than 70 of their virtual water consumption both local and imported on beef and around 15 on broiler meat in contrast the gulf region spends only 29 of its virtual water on beef meat around 40 on broilers and 28 on sheep meat north africa spends 52 on beef 22 on the broiler and 23 on sheep more than 77 of the virtual water in mena originates from green water the majority of which 70 is imported only 15 of the total virtual water used for meat in mena is blue water and only 15 of this water is imported turkey imports only 10 of its blue water for animal meat and uses 90 from local sources local grey water percentage is also highest in turkey 72 of its total grey water turkey yemen egypt and morocco have the highest number of slaughtered beef animals the major animals that contribute to the vwc of each country include sheep and beef for algeria oman and mauritania beef and broilers for egypt lebanon jordan morocco saudi arabia and israel sheep and broilers for kuwait beef for tunisia and yemen beef broilers and sheep for turkey table 8 shows the detailed virtual water of livestock animal per country 3 6 comparison to global estimates the wf of the six animal products for the mena region was compared to global figures fig 3 wf for milk in mena 951 m3 ton was found to be nearly identical to the global figure of 956 m3 ton wf for eggs were found to be slightly lower than the global figure of 2872 m3 ton while wf for goats 5421 m3 ton was slightly higher than the global figure compared to the global figure of 5007 m3 ton on the other hand the wf of broiler and sheep meat was lower than the global figure the wf of broiler and sheep meat in the studied countries of the mena region is 2092 m3 ton and 6975 m3 ton respectively which is significantly less than that of the global figure reported as 2873 m3 ton and 8335 m3 ton respectively the wf of beef meat goat meat and milk is not as good as the global figure wf of beef meat in countries of mena 17267 m3 ton was found to be 10 higher than the global estimate reported as 15712m3 ton an analysis of the change in the wf of animal products for 1995 2005 in mena compared to 2006 2016 shows that beef meat wf has increased by 20 from 13831 m3 ton to 17267 m3 ton the wf of the eggs has decreased from 3152 m3 ton to 2843 m3 ton the wf of the sheep and goats did not change 3 7 green blue and grey wf of animal products the highest proportion of the wf of the animal products in mena is green 82 followed by blue 13 and grey 7 some variations across the region do exist fig 4 the lowest percentage of green water from the total wf 76 is in the near east region israel jordan and lebanon which also has the highest percentage of blue wf 18 the gulf and north african countries have the highest percentage of green water 84 ten percent of turkey s wf goes to grey water the highest in the region this is justified by the fact that a high percentage of water imported in feedstuff is green water when comparing the various wfs of animal products eggs and broiler meat both have lower blue and grey water fig 5 the reason is that broilers and laying hens rely mostly on concentrate more than 90 of the concentrate fed to the broilers and hens originates from imported green water this result shows that broiler and egg production out less pressure on the depletion of the groundwater resources and pollution of the surface water resources 3 8 local and imported wf in the studied countries fig 6 shows that the imported wf of animal products represents a higher proportion of the total wf as compared to the local wf of these products this is mainly due to the fact that the mena region highly depends on food imports furthermore the mena region has been enjoying a kind of food security by importing foods from world markets that have high wf since the 1970s all the region s economies are net food importers also a high percentage of the region s food consumption depends on green water since 90 of water imported in food commodities is green water 3 9 local and imported green blue and grey per capita virtual water associated with livestock production fig 7 shows the per capita annual virtual water for each animal category in mena in all of the studied countries beef comprises the highest contribution to the total per capita virtual water 55 followed by sheep 22 broiler chicken 20 and goats 3 all countries have similar per capita imported blue virtual water associated with livestock production israel and mauritania have the highest per capita imported virtual water yemen turkey and mauritania have the highest imported per capita virtual green water and also the highest local blue water associated with livestock production results also show that while mena countries share similar per capita imported virtual blue water there is high variability in their per capita imported green water turkey tunis and yemen have the highest per capita blue water consumption mainly for beef our results show that the production of meat milk and eggs has increased in the mena region during the past decade 2006 2016 by about 50 compared to the previous decade 1995 2005 the greatest increases were in poultry meat beef and milk 4 uncertainty analysis and limitations there are some uncertainties that can be identified in such a study because the mena region consists of three regions namely north africa the near east and the gulf countries we have assumed in this study that countries of the mena region have similar feed composition feed conversion efficiencies and similar growth rates for each species and age group based on over 50 years experience with the animal production sector in this region we believe that this was a reasonable assumption particularly for large commercial units since management practices and feed formulations for these enterprises have become very similar moreover due to the lack of data on the production and export quantities of feed ingredients some countries of the mena region were not studied therefore the total virtual water of animal products in all of mena i e including iran iraq syria and libya is larger than what is estimated in this study the total population 2015 in these countries was no less than 140 million compared to 360 million in the studied countries assuming the same per capita average water consumption for animal products applies those countries may consume an additional 31 billion m3 of water for their animal products 5 conclusions the results of this study highlight the water consumption in the livestock and poultry farming sectors in the selected countries of the mena region this study estimated the local green blue and grey and imported green blue and grey of animal products for the selected countries of the mena region which was not reported earlier beef meat had the largest fraction of wf to reduce the overall wf for livestock products a shift in the diet should take place from the high local blue wf of meat to low local blue high imported blue and high local green of wf of meat as we found that more than 90 of the water needed for producing animal products in the mena region goes into the production of feed for these animals about 50 of corn wheat and barley and over 95 of soybeans used in the mena region are imported and the balance is produced locally these imports save about 48 billion m3 year of water in the region mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 have shown that globally the wf of meat increases starting from chicken meat 2873 m3 ton goat 5007 m3 ton and sheep 8335 m3 ton to beef 15 712 m3 ton our study shows a similar trend with increases from chicken meat 2092 m3 ton goat 5500 m3 ton sheep 6975 m3 ton to beef 17 267 m3 ton wp for sheep meat is globally higher because it follows more intensive production than that of the mena region where there is more dependence on grazing since our findings on the mena region regarding poultry products agree with those that have been reported for other countries and regions of the world this region should also be pushing more for the production of poultry products in preference to that of the red meats provided a secure import source for the feed is available the mena region should also concentrate more on the production of feeds from rain fed crops rather than irrigated crops in an attempt to save on blue waters this conclusion is made in light of the increases in beef consumption during the past decade in comparison to the previous decade 1995 2005 acknowledgments funds

8812,the middle east and north africa region mena is one of the most water scarce worldwide up to date estimates of the origin and types of water use in various industries are necessary to manage water resources and guide food and water policies the objective of this study is to determine new estimates for the color coded water footprint wf using the water footprint network approach country specific blue green and grey wfs and total virtual water were calculated for 2010 2016 using recent production data we find that animal production in mena increased by 50 as compared to the previous decade virtual water consumption account for more than 80 billion m3 annually mostly for beef 61 followed by broilers 20 and sheep 17 40 of which is local almost 50 of the feed grains used in the region are produced locally accounting for 40 of the total wf for animal production in mena keywords poultry sheep and goats beef dairy blue water green water 1 introduction the mena region is already one of the driest and most water scarce regions of the world 1 and it currently faces severe challenges posed by climate change and limited water supplies it is characterized by its low internal water resources which are expected to be further depleted because of the increasing water demand coupled with a growing population the internal renewable water resources in mena have been estimated at 609 m3 per year per capita compared to a world figure of 6080 m3 2 waterbury 3 states that out of the 33 of the world s most water stressed countries 14 are in the mena region per capita water resources range from 1077 m3 per year in iraq to only 53 m3 per year in saudi arabia 4 because a large share of the mena region s freshwater resources is used in the agriculture and livestock production sectors 5 6 this water scarcity is threatening the sustainability of these production systems as a result a competition between the human population and the major components of production systems crops and livestock will rise 7 where water will be allocated away from agriculture to domestic and industrial use 7 the agriculture sector in the region offers the most effective target for improvement in efficiency in water use 3 also agriculture and especially livestock represent a major fraction of the global wf where 30 of the global agricultural wf is related to livestock production 8 this situation has surged the importance of quantifying the water used in feeding servicing and watering livestock to select the best system in terms of water use and thus optimize water use in livestock farming for the purpose of doing so the concept of wf developed by hoekstra et al 9 has been increasingly used the feed that is consumed by the animal represents a major fraction of the wf of livestock 8 the wf of the feed items has three color coded major components green blue and grey 10 green water refers to water originating in the short term sense directly from rainfall that is stored in the crop root zone blue water refers to water originating from surface water or groundwater i e diverted or pumped and grey water refers to the amount of water needed to assimilate the load of pollutants produced by the production system globally green water accounts for 90 of the consumptive water used by livestock in comparison to 2 8 of blue water that is used in servicing watering and feed mixing 8 few papers have been published on the wf of farm animal products mekonnen and hoekstra 8 made a global study on the wf of farm animals and concluded that the blue and grey wf of animal products is the largest for industrial systems with the exception for chicken products the objective of this study was to determine new estimates for the imported and local wf blue green and grey and the corresponding virtual water content blue green and grey for the different animal products eggs chickens beef milk goat and sheep meat in the mena region our motivation stems from the fact that the latest available figures in the literature reflect the averages for the period 1995 2005 as developed globally population expansion in the region in the last decade must have had an effect on these figures and therefore a new estimate is needed to guide water and food policies 2 methods 2 1 study area fourteen countries from the mena region were included in this study namely algeria egypt israel jordan kuwait lebanon mauritania morocco oman qatar saudi arabia sudan tunisia turkey and yemen libya iraq iran and syria and are not included due to a lack of recent data the main farm animals of this region are beef cattle used for meat production dairy cows used for milk production sheep and goats used for meat and milk broilers used for meat production in addition to laying hens used for egg production dairy and beef are raised under intensive systems while sheep and goats are mostly managed under nomadic and semi nomadic systems feeding on native pastures and crop residues the majority of dairy cows are of the holstein friesian breed nearly all beef breeds are imported and simply fattened and used locally the predominant sheep breed is the awassi and in some countries there are specialized breeds like the tunis breed and the barbarine breed in tunisia goats are predominantly of the baladi breed with some shami and their crosses there are also some specialized country breeds like the black bedouin in saudi arabia poultry production is highly commercialized with over 95 of chicken meat coming from commercial broiler operations and over 90 of eggs from layer operations commercial crosses for broiler operations are white plymouth rock x cornish white commercial egg producing flocks are made up of white leghorns of both white and brown layers while backyard chickens are of mixed breeds mainly the baladi and in egypt the fayoumi in this analysis the feed composition and water consumption for the aforementioned animals prior to reaching their slaughter age were obtained from farms based on lebanon and were validated through data obtained from the literature 9 in order to calculate the wf of the animal products the wf network approach 8 was followed the wf of an animal is expressed as 1 w f a c s w f f e e d a c s w f d r i n k a c s w f s e r v i c e a c s where wf a c s represents the wf for category a animal in country c for production system s wffeed a c s wfdrink a c s wfservice a c s represent the wf for category a animal in country c for production system s related to feed drinking water and service water consumption respectively in this study country specific blue green and grey wf were calculated as an average for 2010 2016 with respect to the industrial systems of production the region is dependent on imported feedstuffs mainly yellow corn wheat barley and soybeans whose production constitutes over 90 of the wf the wf of these was calculated for both imported as well as locally produced feedstuffs we also calculate the per capita annual virtual water consumption for each animal category in the studied countries the feeding systems in animal production consist of three categories industrial mixed and grazing in the industrial category we assume that concentrate represents 100 of the feed consumed by the animal in the mixed category feed is a combination of both concentrate and pasture in the grazing category pasture represents 100 of the feed but in the mena region there is no animal product that relies completely on grazing even sheep and goats are fed some concentrate when pasture is not available dairy and beef are raised under intensive systems while sheep and goats are mostly managed under nomadic and semi nomadic systems feeding on native pastures and crop residues the majority of dairy cows are of the holstein friesian breed nearly all beef breeds are imported and simply fattened and used locally the predominant sheep breed is the awassi and in some countries there are specialized breeds like the tunis breed and the barbarine breed in tunisia goats are predominantly of the baladi breed with some shami and their crosses there are also some specialized country breeds like the black bedouin in saudi arabia poultry production is highly commercialized with over 95 of chicken meat coming from commercial broiler operations and over 90 of eggs from layer operations commercial crosses for broiler operations are white plymouth rock x cornish white commercial egg producing flocks are made up of white leghorns of both white and brown layers while backyard chickens are of mixed breeds mainly the baladi and in egypt the fayoumi in this current study the wf of animal products was calculated for six animal categories beef cows dairy cows sheep goats broiler chickens and laying hens certain assumptions were made based on data gathered from farms in lebanon which makes the methodology followed in this study different from other studies these assumptions include the diet composition of farm animals percentage feed composition average daily water requirement and animal live weight falling under the mixed production system are the beef cattle diet composition 50 concentrate 50 roughage and dairy cows diet composition 40 concentrate 60 roughage for the sheep and goat the rangeland and concentrate contribution to the diet were assumed to be 70 and 30 for the sheep and 90 10 for the goat falling under the industrial production system category are the broiler chickens and laying hens of 100 concentrate diet composition it is important to note that animal feed items in the mena region originate from both domestic and imported products we calculated the wf of feed ingredients according to mekonnen and hoekstra 8 using the weighted average wf for domestic and imported products the weighted average wf of feed ingredients was calculated using equation 2 2 w f p p p w f p n e t i n e p w f n e p p p n e t i n e p where p p is the domestic production of feed item p ton year ti ne p is the imported amount of feed item p ton year from exporting country ne wf p is the wf of feed item p for domestic production m3 ton wf ne p is the wf of feed item p for exporting country ne m3 ton and wf is the weighted average wf for feed item p m3 ton the amount of the imported feed items from exporting countries and the domestic production of these items were obtained from faostat database 11 the wf of the feed ingredient in the source countries was adopted from mekonnen and hoekstra 12 similarly the weighted average wf of roughages was derived from that of the concentrate the wf of roughages was estimated according to hoekstra 13 using equation 3 3 w f r o u g h a g e s w f c o n c e n t r a t e 5 where wf concentrate is the weighted average of the wf for the feed ingredients for the respective animal 2 2 local and imported wf for the animal feed ingredients to calculate the proportion of local to the imported wf of the animal products in the studied countries we need to determine the proportion of local to the imported wf of the corresponding feed ingredients the local wf local and the imported wf imported weighted average wf m3 ton of the animal feed ingredients were calculated as follows we first determine the production of the ingredient average for 2010 2016 and the import average 2011 2013 for each country as reported by foastat database 11 then we multiply this production by the wf of that ingredient and divide it by the total imports and production to get the local fraction of the weighted average wf of each feed ingredient as for the imported fraction we multiply the imported amount of the feed item by its corresponding wf in the exporting country the result of this multiplication was summed and then divided over the total imports and production equations 4 and 5 both wf p and wf ne p were obtained from mekonnen and hoekstra 12 assuming that this wf for the feed ingredient did not change 4 wf

assuming that the feed consumption increases linearly with age until the start of adulthood 8 9 2 3 1 feed conversion ratio to determine the required amount of feed by the animal expressed as feed volume fv tons per animal we multiplied the live weight of the animal tons by the feed conversion of the corresponding animal equation 10 according to chapagain and hoekstra 9 and zhang et al 14 10 f

livestock live weight feed items amount of feed consumed and slaughter ages are provided in tables 1 and 2 the feed items are divided into concentrate corn wheat barley soybean and roughages alfalfa

water consumption for broilers and layers were taken from ref 24 for sheep and goats from refs 19 23 and for beef cattle and dairy cows from ref 26 based on this collected data estimates for wf for drinking and servicing are made for the animals studied herein the yearly water requirement was estimated as per equations 18 and 19 according to zhang et al 14 and chowdhury 5 18 w f d r i n k a d d

population 3 results and discussions 3 1 livestock production an analysis of the percentage change in production for 1995 2005 compared to 2006 2016 is shown in table 4 beef production witnessed the highest increase in production more than double that of eggs and sheep meat this situation will be even worse with the increase in meat consumption where fiala 27 predicted that the consumption of meat worldwide is going to rise by 72 between 2000 and 2030 the percent increase in animal production in the mena region during the past decade 2006 2016 was about 50 compared to the previous decade 1995 2005 by 2050 animal growth rates are estimated to reach 1 8 globally and 2 4 per year in developing countries the increase in cattle meat is due to increases in the dairy sector since male calves are usually fattened for meat rather than actual increases in the production of beef animal breeds 3 2 water allocation for wf calculations an interpretation of water use showed that over 94 of the water in the mena region is used to produce the feed for the studied animals and less than 4 is used for drinking and less than 2 is used for servicing those animals this varied from one species to another as table 5 shows 3 3 imports and local production of feedstuffs an analysis of imports and local production of feedstuffs showed that 52 of wheat is produced locally while 48 is imported barley imports amounted to 53 compared to the local production of 47 corn imports exceed 58 nearly all soybeans used locally were imported with only about 4 produced locally see table 6 these results show that the region is dependent on agricultural imports this is how it compensates for its relative lack of water resources however this dependency will increase in the future because of a projected population increase from about 380 million in 2000 to over 600 million people in 2050 this will also be aggravated by global warming as indicated by waterbury 3 3 4 the wf of the animal products in mena the wf of the animal products was obtained by combining the feed conversion efficiency of each animal and the wf of the feedstuffs the results show that the wf of the livestock product differs among the animals due to differences in feed conversion efficiency overall 50 of the wf in mena is beef meat 6 broiler meat 3 milk 7 eggs 15 goats and 20 is sheep meat also wf differs among studied countries due to the difference in climatic conditions agricultural practices and origin of feed for animal production our results show that milk followed by chicken meat has the lowest wf this result is proved by mottet et al 28 who reported that poultry emerges as the most efficient sub sector in the animal sector in its use of natural resources and in providing protein as a supply for growing global demand this is also clarified by mekonnen and hoekstra 8 who showed that poultry production requires 11 times less feed per kg compared to producing beef the wf of broiler meat differs from other animal products due to other factors including the feed consumption type of production system and feed origin the feed consumed by the broiler is mainly made up of concentrate as reported by gerbens leenes et al 26 the concentrated feed has a larger wf than roughage but better feed conversion also broilers in the studied countries are raised in an industrial system generally industrial systems have a smaller wf than other systems because animals are bred to grow faster move less and have better feed conversion therefore governments of the region should introduce legislation in favor of poultry meat production in an attempt to save on valuable water resources detailed results on the wf of animal products for each country are presented in table 7 3 5 local and imported total virtual water content of livestock animals the virtual water consumption due to meat products for the studies countries of the mena region is 77 7 billion m3 yr turkey alone constitutes 35 of mena s virtual water consumption 47 of which is imported fig 1 north africa constitutes 37 of total mena s virtual water use 68 of which is imported the near east countries constitute 20 of total mena s virtual water use 61 of which is imported the gulf region s share is only 8 due to its relatively small population 70 of which is imported among the meat products beef constitutes the largest percentage of virtual water consumption in mena 61 followed by broilers 20 and sheep 17 consumption fig 2 these percentages vary by region for example the near east countries and turkey spend more than 70 of their virtual water consumption both local and imported on beef and around 15 on broiler meat in contrast the gulf region spends only 29 of its virtual water on beef meat around 40 on broilers and 28 on sheep meat north africa spends 52 on beef 22 on the broiler and 23 on sheep more than 77 of the virtual water in mena originates from green water the majority of which 70 is imported only 15 of the total virtual water used for meat in mena is blue water and only 15 of this water is imported turkey imports only 10 of its blue water for animal meat and uses 90 from local sources local grey water percentage is also highest in turkey 72 of its total grey water turkey yemen egypt and morocco have the highest number of slaughtered beef animals the major animals that contribute to the vwc of each country include sheep and beef for algeria oman and mauritania beef and broilers for egypt lebanon jordan morocco saudi arabia and israel sheep and broilers for kuwait beef for tunisia and yemen beef broilers and sheep for turkey table 8 shows the detailed virtual water of livestock animal per country 3 6 comparison to global estimates the wf of the six animal products for the mena region was compared to global figures fig 3 wf for milk in mena 951 m3 ton was found to be nearly identical to the global figure of 956 m3 ton wf for eggs were found to be slightly lower than the global figure of 2872 m3 ton while wf for goats 5421 m3 ton was slightly higher than the global figure compared to the global figure of 5007 m3 ton on the other hand the wf of broiler and sheep meat was lower than the global figure the wf of broiler and sheep meat in the studied countries of the mena region is 2092 m3 ton and 6975 m3 ton respectively which is significantly less than that of the global figure reported as 2873 m3 ton and 8335 m3 ton respectively the wf of beef meat goat meat and milk is not as good as the global figure wf of beef meat in countries of mena 17267 m3 ton was found to be 10 higher than the global estimate reported as 15712m3 ton an analysis of the change in the wf of animal products for 1995 2005 in mena compared to 2006 2016 shows that beef meat wf has increased by 20 from 13831 m3 ton to 17267 m3 ton the wf of the eggs has decreased from 3152 m3 ton to 2843 m3 ton the wf of the sheep and goats did not change 3 7 green blue and grey wf of animal products the highest proportion of the wf of the animal products in mena is green 82 followed by blue 13 and grey 7 some variations across the region do exist fig 4 the lowest percentage of green water from the total wf 76 is in the near east region israel jordan and lebanon which also has the highest percentage of blue wf 18 the gulf and north african countries have the highest percentage of green water 84 ten percent of turkey s wf goes to grey water the highest in the region this is justified by the fact that a high percentage of water imported in feedstuff is green water when comparing the various wfs of animal products eggs and broiler meat both have lower blue and grey water fig 5 the reason is that broilers and laying hens rely mostly on concentrate more than 90 of the concentrate fed to the broilers and hens originates from imported green water this result shows that broiler and egg production out less pressure on the depletion of the groundwater resources and pollution of the surface water resources 3 8 local and imported wf in the studied countries fig 6 shows that the imported wf of animal products represents a higher proportion of the total wf as compared to the local wf of these products this is mainly due to the fact that the mena region highly depends on food imports furthermore the mena region has been enjoying a kind of food security by importing foods from world markets that have high wf since the 1970s all the region s economies are net food importers also a high percentage of the region s food consumption depends on green water since 90 of water imported in food commodities is green water 3 9 local and imported green blue and grey per capita virtual water associated with livestock production fig 7 shows the per capita annual virtual water for each animal category in mena in all of the studied countries beef comprises the highest contribution to the total per capita virtual water 55 followed by sheep 22 broiler chicken 20 and goats 3 all countries have similar per capita imported blue virtual water associated with livestock production israel and mauritania have the highest per capita imported virtual water yemen turkey and mauritania have the highest imported per capita virtual green water and also the highest local blue water associated with livestock production results also show that while mena countries share similar per capita imported virtual blue water there is high variability in their per capita imported green water turkey tunis and yemen have the highest per capita blue water consumption mainly for beef our results show that the production of meat milk and eggs has increased in the mena region during the past decade 2006 2016 by about 50 compared to the previous decade 1995 2005 the greatest increases were in poultry meat beef and milk 4 uncertainty analysis and limitations there are some uncertainties that can be identified in such a study because the mena region consists of three regions namely north africa the near east and the gulf countries we have assumed in this study that countries of the mena region have similar feed composition feed conversion efficiencies and similar growth rates for each species and age group based on over 50 years experience with the animal production sector in this region we believe that this was a reasonable assumption particularly for large commercial units since management practices and feed formulations for these enterprises have become very similar moreover due to the lack of data on the production and export quantities of feed ingredients some countries of the mena region were not studied therefore the total virtual water of animal products in all of mena i e including iran iraq syria and libya is larger than what is estimated in this study the total population 2015 in these countries was no less than 140 million compared to 360 million in the studied countries assuming the same per capita average water consumption for animal products applies those countries may consume an additional 31 billion m3 of water for their animal products 5 conclusions the results of this study highlight the water consumption in the livestock and poultry farming sectors in the selected countries of the mena region this study estimated the local green blue and grey and imported green blue and grey of animal products for the selected countries of the mena region which was not reported earlier beef meat had the largest fraction of wf to reduce the overall wf for livestock products a shift in the diet should take place from the high local blue wf of meat to low local blue high imported blue and high local green of wf of meat as we found that more than 90 of the water needed for producing animal products in the mena region goes into the production of feed for these animals about 50 of corn wheat and barley and over 95 of soybeans used in the mena region are imported and the balance is produced locally these imports save about 48 billion m3 year of water in the region mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 have shown that globally the wf of meat increases starting from chicken meat 2873 m3 ton goat 5007 m3 ton and sheep 8335 m3 ton to beef 15 712 m3 ton our study shows a similar trend with increases from chicken meat 2092 m3 ton goat 5500 m3 ton sheep 6975 m3 ton to beef 17 267 m3 ton wp for sheep meat is globally higher because it follows more intensive production than that of the mena region where there is more dependence on grazing since our findings on the mena region regarding poultry products agree with those that have been reported for other countries and regions of the world this region should also be pushing more for the production of poultry products in preference to that of the red meats provided a secure import source for the feed is available the mena region should also concentrate more on the production of feeds from rain fed crops rather than irrigated crops in an attempt to save on blue waters this conclusion is made in light of the increases in beef consumption during the past decade in comparison to the previous decade 1995 2005 acknowledgments funds

8813,dairy manufacturing sector generates large quantity of nutrient rich wastewater which requires treatment before it can be released into the environment this study aimed to use a low cost food grade sodium lignosulphonate na lignosulphonate to recover proteins and lipids from dairy wastewater and reduce the bod the colloidal particles of wastewater sample were precipitated with varying the concentration of na lignosulphonate 0 002 0 032 w v and ph of medium 1 0 3 5 experiments were conducted at ambient 22 c and mildly elevated 40 c temperatures at the optimum concentration 0 016 w v of na lignosulphonate the highest turbidity removal 98 was achieved at ph 3 5 and at both temperatures this method recovered 96 lipids and 46 proteins mostly caseins and reduced the bod by 73 at 22 c na lignosulphonate is found to be an effective coagulant owing to its ability to readily complex with positively charged colloidal particles at acidic ph keywords dairy wastewater sodium lignosulphonate proteins lipid complexation coagulation recovery 1 introduction demand for finite natural resources such as fresh water continues to increase with population growth agricultural and irrigational needs the dairy industry produces large quantities of wastewater with characteristic high biochemical oxygen demand bod because of the presence of proteins fats and carbohydrates although dairy wastewater is generally treated it may contain higher than legally permitted bod and may cause serious impact on the environment 1 it is therefore necessary to effectively and economically treat dairy waste streams before discharging to the environment manufacturers recognize the nutritional value of macronutrients such as milk proteins and lipids lost in waste streams and there is an increased demand for an efficient method for the recovery of these macronutrients dairy discharge is high in nutrients and if recovered with low cost biopolymers it can be used as viable animal feed stock colloidal particles suspended in dairy wastewater exhibit brownian motion and repel one another forming a stable dispersion which creates difficulties in downstream operations 2 organic polymers such as sodium lignosulphonate and bentonite are used as flocculants to help remove organic pollutants in wastewater these organic polymers can be anionic cationic and non ionic and adopt a random coil conformation in aqueous medium with the size of coil proportional to the square root of their molecular weight 2 3 they help in floc formation through charge neutralization and bridging between suspended particles and have the potential to treat dairy wastewater lignosulphonic acid is a dark brown colored by product from the sulphite wood pulping industry with coagulating dispersing and emulsifying properties it has industrial applications as an ingredinet in feed stock as well as for recovering protein and lipids in dairy poultry and fish industries 4 the wood lignin present in the spent sulphite liquor is made water soluble by the addition of sulphonated groups in its molecular structure the ability of sodium lignosulphonate na lignosulphonate to coagulate organic compounds such as protein depends on the ph and the concentration of na lignosulphonate 5 na lignosulphonate is highly negatively charged in the ph range of most of the dairy effluents at ph below the isoelectric point proteins in dairy effluent gain a net positive charge and bind with the negatively charged sulphonate groups in the lignosulphonic acid molecule at acidic ph the fat molecules also lose their negative charge on the carboxyl group hence in acidic ph most of the fat molecules float to the surface and form complexes with proteins and na lignosulphonate which makes it easier to separate by physical processes 6 the advantages of using organic polymers for precipitation are numerous including the production of lower amount of sludge for an equivalent amount of inorganic coagulant dosage and easier downstream of the recovered sludge 7 organic polymers are often effective at low concentrations and reduce bod in treated water 2 the ability of lignosulphonate to precipitate proteins from beef abattoirs effluent was reported by foltz et al 4 these authors used the lignosulphonic acid to recover protein and reduced bod from beef abattoirs and achieved reduction of 60 90 6 wallerstien stated as early as 1944 that a 2 5 ratio of lignin to protein was optimum for protein recovery at a ph of 2 4 4 pearl 1957 observed the formation of insoluble complex when lignosulphonic acid reacted with the fish protein in fish processing effluent 4 jorgensen et al 1971 compared lignosulphonic acid with other precipitating agents such as sulphuric acid aluminum sulphate glucose tri sulphate glucose tri sulphate plus azoprotein and sulphite liquor and observed maximum recovery of crude protein with lignosulphonate 4 in dairy industry biopolymers such as carboxymethyl cellulose lignosulfonate and bentonite are used to recover proteins in cheese whey 5 8 it is observed that lignosulphonate at a concentration of 1 has the effectiveness of 3 bentonite and makes the recovery more cost effective 5 another advantage of using lignosulphonate is that it contributes to only 10 of the total protein concentrate also the composition and quality of protein recovered by this method is least affected if conventional drying methods that follow the precipitation process to convert the precipitate to solid form 6 xu et al 9 compared protein recovery using biopolymers lignosulphonate carboxymethyl cellulose and inorganic coagulants ferric chloride and bentonite from wastewater from egg processing plant the application of lignosulphonate and ferric chloride reduced the chemical oxygen demand by 90 95 and 80 91 respectively these two compounds were also found to be more cost effective than carboxymethyl cellulose and bentonite the authors also observed that the composition of the recovered protein was similar to that of fresh whole egg although applications of inorganic coagulants are widely used in dairy effluent treatment only a few organic polymers have employed for the recovery process wolf et al 10 used natural organic polymer tannin tanfloc sg and sh in the treatment of dairy waste streams at ph 6 0 and 5 0 respectively at a concentration of 20 mg l and observed turbidity removal of greater than 80 there is no known study dealing with the application of lignosulphonate to recover proteins from dairy wastewater milk proteins i e globular whey proteins and micellar caseins have quite different ph dependent solubility and electrostatic charge density these two proteins are affected by mineral composition fat content differently thus it is expected that recovery of milk proteins from dairy wastewater using na lignosulphonate requires a systematic study in this context this study aims to investigate the efficacy of na lignosulphonate to reduce the bod of dairy process water by recovering the organic materials especially proteins and lipids 2 materials and methods untreated dairy wastewater was collected from a commercial manufacturing site producing infant formula and cheese in northern victoria australia chemicals such as na lignosulphonate nitric acid bicinchoninic acid bca copper sulphate pentahydrate dinitrosalicylic acid dnsa phenol sodium sulphite

sodium sulphite and 1 naoh was added to 3 ml of sample solution sample was heated for 15 min in boiling water bath one ml of 40 w v solution of rochelle salt was then added to the mixture once the mixture turned red brown it was cooled to ambient temperature under running tap water the intensity of the developed color was measured at 575 nm using the uv visible spectrometer mentioned above 2 1 3 total fat the rose gottlieb method was used to determine fat content 14 in brief the sample was treated with 1 5 ml ammonia and 10 ml ethanol to precipitate the protein the fat content was then extracted with 25 ml of diethyl ether and an equal amount of petroleum spirit in an evaporating dish this extracted fat was dried at 101 c in an atmospheric oven until no further change in weight was observed the extraction was performed at least in triplicate 2 1 4 bod the sample was diluted in a 300 ml bod bottle to achieve a bod depletion of at least 2 mg l the diluted sample was treated with calcium chloride 1 mg l sodium hydroxide 1n magnesium sulphate 1 mg l and ferric chloride 1 mg l 15 a dissolved oxygen measuring instrument seven2go mettler toledo u s a was used to measure the

dilution factor 2 2 particle size analysis a laser diffraction based particle size analyser mastersizer 3000 malvern instruments ltd malvern uk for liquid hydro was used to measures the particle size distribution of the samples the measurement was carried out by determining the intensity of the laser scattered when it passed through the sample refractive indices of 1 50 and 1 33 for sample and dispersant respectively and an absorbance coefficient of 0 01 were used as input parameters the obscuration limit was set between 10 and 20 the analysis was carried out in triplicate at 22 c and expressed as volume mean particle size d 4 3 2 3 confocal microscopy an upright confocal microscope nikon eclipse 90i nikon u s a was used to observe the distribution of milk fat and protein present in the trade waste stream the sample was stained with nile red 0 1 mg ml dissolved in acetone and fast green 0 1 mg ml dissolved in water dyes for 10 min and visualized at a 40 magnification at an excitation wavelength of 488 and 633 nm respectively 16 2 4 measurement of zeta potential a zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments ltd uk was used to measure the zeta potential of samples before and after treatment with na lignosulphonate refractive index of 1 5 was selected for the sample and the measurements were carried out at 25 0 1 c in triplicate using disposable cuvettes the velocity of the particle was measured using laser doppler electrophoresis which is proportional to the field strength and the zeta potential 2 5 measurment of turbidity a turbidity meter hi 93703 hanna instruments australia was used to measure the turbidity of samples before and after treatment with na lignosulphonate the sample was diluted with milli q water to achieve turbidity reading below 40 formazine turbidity unit ftu to improve the accuracy of measurement a beam of infrared light with a wavelength of 890 nm was passed through a clear vial containing the sample the amount of light scattered by the suspended particles was measured by a sensor positioned at 90 to the direction of infrared light the instrument was equipped with a microprocessor which then converted the reading to ftu formazin turbidity unit values at 22 c 2 6 measurement of viscosity viscosity pa s of the samples was measured using a rheometer rs 100 thermo haake u s a a cone and plate sensor system of 14 mm diameter and a 2 angle was used at a constant shear rate of 200 s 1 measurements were made between 22 c to 40 c 2 7 precipitation of dairy wastewater using na lignosulphonate experiments were carried out in a ph range of 1 0 3 5 0 5 increments at added na lignosulphonate concentrations of 0 002 0 004 0 008 0 016 and 0 032 w v at 22 c the experiments were also conducted at 40 c at ph 1 0 2 0 and 3 5 to study the effect of temperature on the recovery efficiency of na lignosulphonate the above listed acidic ph range was selected to enable protein to carry net positive charge and facilitate its charge induced binding or complexation with negatively charged lignosulphonate 6 the concentration of na lignosulphonate was chosen such a way that it produced a net zero or near zero zeta potential of the na lignosulphonate waste water mixture at the optimum ph the sample was mixed at 200 rpm using a magnetic stirrer coupled with a hot plate heidolph instruments germany for 1 min to ensure uniformity in sample mixture this sample was agitated 30 more minutes at a slower mixing rate 100 rpm to enhance floc formation optimum conditions such as ph and concentration of na lignosulphonate were selected to achieve the highest possible reduction of turbidity the turbidity of the supernatant solutions was measured on 15 30 60 and 120 min during 120 min settling period the precipitated sample was then centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min allegra 64 r beckman coultier u s a and filtered through 0 45 μm filter paper to separate the soluble and insoluble phases the soluble phase i e supernatant was analysed to observe the reduction in bod and recovery of organic components proteins fats and carbohydrates 2 8 statistical analysis all the experiments were performed at least in triplicate the results are presented as mean standard deviation data were subjected to one way anova using ibm spss version 24 the significance difference between two mean values was determined at 95 confidence level p 0 05 using duncan s test 3 results and discussion 3 1 composition ph and particle size of the trade waste stream the proximate composition ph and particle size of dairy wastewater are presented in table 1 the wastewater samples had a bod of 1312 mg l due to the presence of fat 360 mg l and protein 388 mg l and carbohydrates 121 mg l the mean colloidal particle size and turbidity of this wastewater stream was 1 μm and 839 6 ftu respectively the effluent was only marginally acidic ph 6 6 due to neutralization at the manufacturing site as practiced prior to discharge from the treatment facility neutralization of waste stream is commonly carried out in dairy industries in australia confocal analysis fig 1 shows the distribution of fat and protein in the wastewater samples as can be observed the fat molecules yellow color are trapped inside the protein matrix stained green due to the hydrophobic nature of lipid globules this observation is consistent with that of gallier et al 16 that milk fat globules are surrounded by protein matrix in this type of colloidal system this figure also indicates that that most of the proteins and the fat in these wastewater samples existed as complex of around 1 μm size the membrane of the fat globule is a complex structure consisting of three layers and can be identified as an inner most layer of polar lipids a middle layer of protein and an outer layer of polar lipids with embedded proteins 17 hence it is expected that the lipid content of dairy trade waste can be recovered along with the protein precipitation and recovery of protein by using na lignosulphonate 3 2 coagulation of dairy waste stream with na lignosulphonate the variation of zeta potential and turbidity removal with na lignosulphonate concentration at a set ph 3 5 and temperature 22 c is shown in fig 2 as can be observed the highest turbidity removal 98 occurred when the surface charge was close to the isoelectric point charge neutrality this is because the floc formation is maximized when the positively charged molecules undergo complexation with the negatively charged na lignosulphonate and produce charge neutral flocs 18 the ph of the wastewater was adjusted to 3 5 to make the protein component in sample positively charged so that the binding efficiency of sample and na lignosulphonate is increased at 0 016 w v of na lignosulphonate and ph 3 5 the zeta potential of the sample lignosulphonate mixture was 10 83 the same trend can be seen at 40 c where the percentage of turbidity removal is also at 98 at a zeta potential value of 10 08 these results indicate that zeta potential is a suitable parameter to optimise the treatment condition e g ph of the mixture and concentration of coagulant used to achieve maximum turbidity removal turbidity removal efficiency also depends on the concentration of coagulant at each ph there is an optimum concentration of coagulant to be added to achieve maximum turbidity removal as shown in fig 2 the optimum concentration of na lignosulphonate at the optimal ph of 3 5 was 0 016 w v at which 98 of sample turbidity was reduced it can also be observed that a further increase in the concentration of na lignosulphonate led to the destabilization of solution making the sample more turbid for example an increase of the concentration of na lignosulphonate to 0 032 decreased the turbidity reduction to 58 and 76 at 22 c and 40 c respectively this is due to the presence of excess coagulant na lignosulphonate ions present in wastewater sample for which there was not enough colloidal particles to bind the optimum concentration of na lignosulphonate remained the same at 0 016 w v at studied ph range 1 0 3 5 the optimum concentration at each ph is selected on the basis of removal or reduction of highest possible turbidity from the samples table 2 shows the turbidity data in a ph range of 1 0 3 5 as mentioned above maximum turbidity removal from wastewater samples occurred at ph 3 5 both at 22 c and 40 c at 0 016 w v of na lignosulphonate as the ph decreased from 3 5 to 1 0 at 22 c the efficiency of na lignosulphonate to remove the colloidal materials reduced significantly p 0 05 from 98 0 to 96 9 this is due to the loss of negative charge in the sulphonate group at ph 1 0 unlike at 22 c the turbidity removal efficiency remained the same in this ph range at 40 c due to the decrease in sample viscosity at higher temperature leading to efficient settling of coagulated particles when the temperature was increased from 22 c to 40 c the viscosity of the sample at a set concentration of 0 016 w v reduced significantly from 1 27 cp to 0 83 cp fig 3 giving rise to a clearer supernatant containing fewer colloidal particles after the precipitation process a report by the european food safety authority efsa recommended a concentration of 10 g for lignosulphonate per kg of feedstock i e 1 w w to be safe for cattle pigs and chickens for fattening 19 up to 4 w w of lignosulphonate is considered to be safe to use in the live feedstock in several countries with an extensive range of formulation ratios 6 hence concentration of 0 016 w v of na lignosulphonate is a safe concentration to be used in animal feed stock the turbidity of the samples was measured up to 120 min during the settling process fig 4 the graph represents all samples at optimum concentration of na lignosulphonate from ph 3 5 to 1 0 it can be observed that most of the settling 82 84 of the coagulated particles occurred in the first 15 min the turbidity removal efficiency increased to 98 when the settling time is increased to 120 min 3 3 effect of na lignosulphonate in bod reduction the fig 5 shows the reduction in bod at different treatment conditions as observed from the graph at optimum ph of 3 5 and at na lignosulphonate concentration of 0 016 w v the bod is reduced by 73 7 at 22 c and 70 at 40 c this indicates that the treatment of dairy waste stream with na lignosulphonate can significantly reduce its bod this reduction in bod is due to the removal of organic materials mostly the proteins and lipids through the precipitation process which would otherwise be available as nutrients for microbial growth the reduction of bod as a function of temperature at 22 c and at 40 c was significantly different at a set ph value ph 1 0 and 3 5 at ph 1 0 bod was reduced by 66 at 22 c due to the loss of negative charge in sulphonate group leading to a reduction in its binding efficiency particularly to positively charged proteins the bod reduction efficiency of na lignosulphonate decreased significantly p 0 05 to 50 at ph 1 0 and 40 c this can be attributed to the higher solubilisation of inorganic minerals and cations such as calcium at higher temperature and under highly acidic conditions 20 under optimum condition of ph 3 5 and concentration of na lignosulphonate 0 016 w v it was observed that 96 of lipid was recovered at both 22 c and 40oc table 3 this level of recovery was achieved as the fat molecules lost their negative charge on the carboxyl group at acidic ph most of the fat molecules then floated to the surface and combined with the protein na lignosulphonate complex which made it easier to recovery them 6 the higher solubility and relatively low concentration of carbohydrates table 1 in the effluent led to negligible recovery of carbohydrates using na lignosulphonate precipitation analysis of precipitated sample shows that under acidic condition ph 1 0 to 3 5 the recovery of total protein remained the same at an average value of 46 fig 6 there is no significant variation p 0 05 in protein recovery at both 22 c and 40 c at the given ph range and at given 0 016 w v na lignosulphonate concentration milk proteins below the isoelectric point of 4 6 carry a net positive charge and bind with the negatively charged sulphonate groups of na lignosulphonate forming insoluble complexes these complexes can be subsequently separated by most physical separation processes the reaction that is involved in charge neutralization is understood to be an instantaneous reaction 4 fig 7 shows sds page analysis of protein standards and protein in wastewater sample before and after precipitation process the analysis of purified protein standards shows that caseins can be successfully separated from whey proteins using sds page under reducing conditions because of the significant difference in their molecular mass whey protein such as α lactalbumin and β lactoglobulin can also be differentiated due to their difference in the molecular mass the three fractions of casein fractions i e α casein β casein and κ casein showed identical band location due to their similar molecular mass bovine serum albumin bsa has a larger molecular mass and its band appeared at higher location the analysis of these bands before precipitation showed a higher concentration of whey proteins than caseins this can be attributed to the necessity of adding higher amount of whey proteins in infant formula production this necessity arises from the fact that human milk has higher whey protein to casein ratio 60 40 than in bovine milk 20 80 21 whey protein is added to the bovine milk based formlations to mimick the human milk the gel showed no bands for casein in supernatant fractions and hence the recovered protein should mostly be the caseins the isoelectric point of caseins is at ph 4 6 below which they carry net positive charge hence bind effectively with the negatively charged na lignosulphonate form casein lignosulphonate complexes the fact that the recovered protein fraction was mostly comprised of casein can also be correlated from the fact that residual protein content in the supernatant was comprised of mostly whey proteins fig 7 the band formation for whey proteins was also identical in the entire test conditions ph 1 0 to 3 5 and temperature 22 c and 40 c in contrast to the micellar structure of caseins whey proteins exist as monomers or as small quaternary structures hence whey protein remain soluble at the ph at which the casein readily precipitates 20 the greater number of non ionisable polar groups in whey protein also makes it soluble even at their isoelectric point hence difficult to coalesce with the addition of organic coagulants 22 4 conclusion this study shows that under acidic condition ph 1 0 to 3 5 mild temperature 22 c 40 c na lignosulphonate is an efficient coagulant of dairy wastewater even at its low concentration 0 016 w v and removes up to 98 sample turbidity at the optimum ph of 3 5 na lignosulphonate was able to reduce the bod of the dairy waste stream by 74 at 22 c and 70 at 40 c even at conentration as low as 0 016 w v due to its ability to effectively remove lipids and proteins forty six percent of protein was recoved caseins comprising most of the recovered fractions it was not possible to remove whey proteins using na lignosuphonate and remained in the treated wastewater ninety six percent of the total lipids was recovered by the na lignosulphonate precipitation process the recovered biomass was rich in caseins and lipids can be

8813,dairy manufacturing sector generates large quantity of nutrient rich wastewater which requires treatment before it can be released into the environment this study aimed to use a low cost food grade sodium lignosulphonate na lignosulphonate to recover proteins and lipids from dairy wastewater and reduce the bod the colloidal particles of wastewater sample were precipitated with varying the concentration of na lignosulphonate 0 002 0 032 w v and ph of medium 1 0 3 5 experiments were conducted at ambient 22 c and mildly elevated 40 c temperatures at the optimum concentration 0 016 w v of na lignosulphonate the highest turbidity removal 98 was achieved at ph 3 5 and at both temperatures this method recovered 96 lipids and 46 proteins mostly caseins and reduced the bod by 73 at 22 c na lignosulphonate is found to be an effective coagulant owing to its ability to readily complex with positively charged colloidal particles at acidic ph keywords dairy wastewater sodium lignosulphonate proteins lipid complexation coagulation recovery 1 introduction demand for finite natural resources such as fresh water continues to increase with population growth agricultural and irrigational needs the dairy industry produces large quantities of wastewater with characteristic high biochemical oxygen demand bod because of the presence of proteins fats and carbohydrates although dairy wastewater is generally treated it may contain higher than legally permitted bod and may cause serious impact on the environment 1 it is therefore necessary to effectively and economically treat dairy waste streams before discharging to the environment manufacturers recognize the nutritional value of macronutrients such as milk proteins and lipids lost in waste streams and there is an increased demand for an efficient method for the recovery of these macronutrients dairy discharge is high in nutrients and if recovered with low cost biopolymers it can be used as viable animal feed stock colloidal particles suspended in dairy wastewater exhibit brownian motion and repel one another forming a stable dispersion which creates difficulties in downstream operations 2 organic polymers such as sodium lignosulphonate and bentonite are used as flocculants to help remove organic pollutants in wastewater these organic polymers can be anionic cationic and non ionic and adopt a random coil conformation in aqueous medium with the size of coil proportional to the square root of their molecular weight 2 3 they help in floc formation through charge neutralization and bridging between suspended particles and have the potential to treat dairy wastewater lignosulphonic acid is a dark brown colored by product from the sulphite wood pulping industry with coagulating dispersing and emulsifying properties it has industrial applications as an ingredinet in feed stock as well as for recovering protein and lipids in dairy poultry and fish industries 4 the wood lignin present in the spent sulphite liquor is made water soluble by the addition of sulphonated groups in its molecular structure the ability of sodium lignosulphonate na lignosulphonate to coagulate organic compounds such as protein depends on the ph and the concentration of na lignosulphonate 5 na lignosulphonate is highly negatively charged in the ph range of most of the dairy effluents at ph below the isoelectric point proteins in dairy effluent gain a net positive charge and bind with the negatively charged sulphonate groups in the lignosulphonic acid molecule at acidic ph the fat molecules also lose their negative charge on the carboxyl group hence in acidic ph most of the fat molecules float to the surface and form complexes with proteins and na lignosulphonate which makes it easier to separate by physical processes 6 the advantages of using organic polymers for precipitation are numerous including the production of lower amount of sludge for an equivalent amount of inorganic coagulant dosage and easier downstream of the recovered sludge 7 organic polymers are often effective at low concentrations and reduce bod in treated water 2 the ability of lignosulphonate to precipitate proteins from beef abattoirs effluent was reported by foltz et al 4 these authors used the lignosulphonic acid to recover protein and reduced bod from beef abattoirs and achieved reduction of 60 90 6 wallerstien stated as early as 1944 that a 2 5 ratio of lignin to protein was optimum for protein recovery at a ph of 2 4 4 pearl 1957 observed the formation of insoluble complex when lignosulphonic acid reacted with the fish protein in fish processing effluent 4 jorgensen et al 1971 compared lignosulphonic acid with other precipitating agents such as sulphuric acid aluminum sulphate glucose tri sulphate glucose tri sulphate plus azoprotein and sulphite liquor and observed maximum recovery of crude protein with lignosulphonate 4 in dairy industry biopolymers such as carboxymethyl cellulose lignosulfonate and bentonite are used to recover proteins in cheese whey 5 8 it is observed that lignosulphonate at a concentration of 1 has the effectiveness of 3 bentonite and makes the recovery more cost effective 5 another advantage of using lignosulphonate is that it contributes to only 10 of the total protein concentrate also the composition and quality of protein recovered by this method is least affected if conventional drying methods that follow the precipitation process to convert the precipitate to solid form 6 xu et al 9 compared protein recovery using biopolymers lignosulphonate carboxymethyl cellulose and inorganic coagulants ferric chloride and bentonite from wastewater from egg processing plant the application of lignosulphonate and ferric chloride reduced the chemical oxygen demand by 90 95 and 80 91 respectively these two compounds were also found to be more cost effective than carboxymethyl cellulose and bentonite the authors also observed that the composition of the recovered protein was similar to that of fresh whole egg although applications of inorganic coagulants are widely used in dairy effluent treatment only a few organic polymers have employed for the recovery process wolf et al 10 used natural organic polymer tannin tanfloc sg and sh in the treatment of dairy waste streams at ph 6 0 and 5 0 respectively at a concentration of 20 mg l and observed turbidity removal of greater than 80 there is no known study dealing with the application of lignosulphonate to recover proteins from dairy wastewater milk proteins i e globular whey proteins and micellar caseins have quite different ph dependent solubility and electrostatic charge density these two proteins are affected by mineral composition fat content differently thus it is expected that recovery of milk proteins from dairy wastewater using na lignosulphonate requires a systematic study in this context this study aims to investigate the efficacy of na lignosulphonate to reduce the bod of dairy process water by recovering the organic materials especially proteins and lipids 2 materials and methods untreated dairy wastewater was collected from a commercial manufacturing site producing infant formula and cheese in northern victoria australia chemicals such as na lignosulphonate nitric acid bicinchoninic acid bca copper sulphate pentahydrate dinitrosalicylic acid dnsa phenol sodium sulphite rochelle salt ammonia ethanol diethyl ether petroleum spirit calcium chloride sodium hydroxide magnesium sulphate ferric chloride nile red fast green and protein standards used in the study were analytical grade and were obtained from sigma aldrich australia deionised milli q water was used in all preparations 2 1 characterisation of the waste stream the untreated dairy wastewater sample was characterized to determine its composition analysis was done to determine the following paramters 2 1 1 protein total protein was determined by using the bicinchoninic acid assay method 11 the sample was treated with bca reagent and copper sulphate pentahydrate the sample was then incubated for 30 min at 37 c and allowed to cool to 22 c the color developed due to the reaction was measured at 562 nm using uv visible spectrometer lambda 35 parkinelmer usa the protein fractions of the waste stream and precipitated sample were analysed with sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sds page under reducing conditions as described by laemmli 12 the 4 15 mini protean tgx precast protein gels biorad 4561083 were used and stained with coomassie blue r 250 followed by coomassie destaining solution samples and protein standards bovine serum albumin bsa α lactalbumin β lactoglobulin α casein β casein and κ casein were prepared by mixing with 2 concentrated loading dye laemelle buffer biorad 1610737 with 200 mm β mercaptoethanol at 1 2 ratio and heated in a water bath at 95 c for 10 min the gel was run for 30 min at 200 v or until the bottom ladder kaleidoscope biorad 1610375 reached the end of the gel 2 1 2 total carbohydrates total carbohydrate content was measured using dinitrosalicylic acid dnsa assay method 13 three ml of reagent 1 dnsa 0 2 phenol 0 05 sodium sulphite and 1 naoh was added to 3 ml of sample solution sample was heated for 15 min in boiling water bath one ml of 40 w v solution of rochelle salt was then added to the mixture once the mixture turned red brown it was cooled to ambient temperature under running tap water the intensity of the developed color was measured at 575 nm using the uv visible spectrometer mentioned above 2 1 3 total fat the rose gottlieb method was used to determine fat content 14 in brief the sample was treated with 1 5 ml ammonia and 10 ml ethanol to precipitate the protein the fat content was then extracted with 25 ml of diethyl ether and an equal amount of petroleum spirit in an evaporating dish this extracted fat was dried at 101 c in an atmospheric oven until no further change in weight was observed the extraction was performed at least in triplicate 2 1 4 bod the sample was diluted in a 300 ml bod bottle to achieve a bod depletion of at least 2 mg l the diluted sample was treated with calcium chloride 1 mg l sodium hydroxide 1n magnesium sulphate 1 mg l and ferric chloride 1 mg l 15 a dissolved oxygen measuring instrument seven2go mettler toledo u s a was used to measure the dissolved oxygen d o on day zero d o initial and upon five day of incubation d o final at 21 2 c bod was obtained using equation 1 1 bod d o initial d o final volume of sample 300 where 300 is the dilution factor 2 2 particle size analysis a laser diffraction based particle size analyser mastersizer 3000 malvern instruments ltd malvern uk for liquid hydro was used to measures the particle size distribution of the samples the measurement was carried out by determining the intensity of the laser scattered when it passed through the sample refractive indices of 1 50 and 1 33 for sample and dispersant respectively and an absorbance coefficient of 0 01 were used as input parameters the obscuration limit was set between 10 and 20 the analysis was carried out in triplicate at 22 c and expressed as volume mean particle size d 4 3 2 3 confocal microscopy an upright confocal microscope nikon eclipse 90i nikon u s a was used to observe the distribution of milk fat and protein present in the trade waste stream the sample was stained with nile red 0 1 mg ml dissolved in acetone and fast green 0 1 mg ml dissolved in water dyes for 10 min and visualized at a 40 magnification at an excitation wavelength of 488 and 633 nm respectively 16 2 4 measurement of zeta potential a zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments ltd uk was used to measure the zeta potential of samples before and after treatment with na lignosulphonate refractive index of 1 5 was selected for the sample and the measurements were carried out at 25 0 1 c in triplicate using disposable cuvettes the velocity of the particle was measured using laser doppler electrophoresis which is proportional to the field strength and the zeta potential 2 5 measurment of turbidity a turbidity meter hi 93703 hanna instruments australia was used to measure the turbidity of samples before and after treatment with na lignosulphonate the sample was diluted with milli q water to achieve turbidity reading below 40 formazine turbidity unit ftu to improve the accuracy of measurement a beam of infrared light with a wavelength of 890 nm was passed through a clear vial containing the sample the amount of light scattered by the suspended particles was measured by a sensor positioned at 90 to the direction of infrared light the instrument was equipped with a microprocessor which then converted the reading to ftu formazin turbidity unit values at 22 c 2 6 measurement of viscosity viscosity pa s of the samples was measured using a rheometer rs 100 thermo haake u s a a cone and plate sensor system of 14 mm diameter and a 2 angle was used at a constant shear rate of 200 s 1 measurements were made between 22 c to 40 c 2 7 precipitation of dairy wastewater using na lignosulphonate experiments were carried out in a ph range of 1 0 3 5 0 5 increments at added na lignosulphonate concentrations of 0 002 0 004 0 008 0 016 and 0 032 w v at 22 c the experiments were also conducted at 40 c at ph 1 0 2 0 and 3 5 to study the effect of temperature on the recovery efficiency of na lignosulphonate the above listed acidic ph range was selected to enable protein to carry net positive charge and facilitate its charge induced binding or complexation with negatively charged lignosulphonate 6 the concentration of na lignosulphonate was chosen such a way that it produced a net zero or near zero zeta potential of the na lignosulphonate waste water mixture at the optimum ph the sample was mixed at 200 rpm using a magnetic stirrer coupled with a hot plate heidolph instruments germany for 1 min to ensure uniformity in sample mixture this sample was agitated 30 more minutes at a slower mixing rate 100 rpm to enhance floc formation optimum conditions such as ph and concentration of na lignosulphonate were selected to achieve the highest possible reduction of turbidity the turbidity of the supernatant solutions was measured on 15 30 60 and 120 min during 120 min settling period the precipitated sample was then centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min allegra 64 r beckman coultier u s a and filtered through 0 45 μm filter paper to separate the soluble and insoluble phases the soluble phase i e supernatant was analysed to observe the reduction in bod and recovery of organic components proteins fats and carbohydrates 2 8 statistical analysis all the experiments were performed at least in triplicate the results are presented as mean standard deviation data were subjected to one way anova using ibm spss version 24 the significance difference between two mean values was determined at 95 confidence level p 0 05 using duncan s test 3 results and discussion 3 1 composition ph and particle size of the trade waste stream the proximate composition ph and particle size of dairy wastewater are presented in table 1 the wastewater samples had a bod of 1312 mg l due to the presence of fat 360 mg l and protein 388 mg l and carbohydrates 121 mg l the mean colloidal particle size and turbidity of this wastewater stream was 1 μm and 839 6 ftu respectively the effluent was only marginally acidic ph 6 6 due to neutralization at the manufacturing site as practiced prior to discharge from the treatment facility neutralization of waste stream is commonly carried out in dairy industries in australia confocal analysis fig 1 shows the distribution of fat and protein in the wastewater samples as can be observed the fat molecules yellow color are trapped inside the protein matrix stained green due to the hydrophobic nature of lipid globules this observation is consistent with that of gallier et al 16 that milk fat globules are surrounded by protein matrix in this type of colloidal system this figure also indicates that that most of the proteins and the fat in these wastewater samples existed as complex of around 1 μm size the membrane of the fat globule is a complex structure consisting of three layers and can be identified as an inner most layer of polar lipids a middle layer of protein and an outer layer of polar lipids with embedded proteins 17 hence it is expected that the lipid content of dairy trade waste can be recovered along with the protein precipitation and recovery of protein by using na lignosulphonate 3 2 coagulation of dairy waste stream with na lignosulphonate the variation of zeta potential and turbidity removal with na lignosulphonate concentration at a set ph 3 5 and temperature 22 c is shown in fig 2 as can be observed the highest turbidity removal 98 occurred when the surface charge was close to the isoelectric point charge neutrality this is because the floc formation is maximized when the positively charged molecules undergo complexation with the negatively charged na lignosulphonate and produce charge neutral flocs 18 the ph of the wastewater was adjusted to 3 5 to make the protein component in sample positively charged so that the binding efficiency of sample and na lignosulphonate is increased at 0 016 w v of na lignosulphonate and ph 3 5 the zeta potential of the sample lignosulphonate mixture was 10 83 the same trend can be seen at 40 c where the percentage of turbidity removal is also at 98 at a zeta potential value of 10 08 these results indicate that zeta potential is a suitable parameter to optimise the treatment condition e g ph of the mixture and concentration of coagulant used to achieve maximum turbidity removal turbidity removal efficiency also depends on the concentration of coagulant at each ph there is an optimum concentration of coagulant to be added to achieve maximum turbidity removal as shown in fig 2 the optimum concentration of na lignosulphonate at the optimal ph of 3 5 was 0 016 w v at which 98 of sample turbidity was reduced it can also be observed that a further increase in the concentration of na lignosulphonate led to the destabilization of solution making the sample more turbid for example an increase of the concentration of na lignosulphonate to 0 032 decreased the turbidity reduction to 58 and 76 at 22 c and 40 c respectively this is due to the presence of excess coagulant na lignosulphonate ions present in wastewater sample for which there was not enough colloidal particles to bind the optimum concentration of na lignosulphonate remained the same at 0 016 w v at studied ph range 1 0 3 5 the optimum concentration at each ph is selected on the basis of removal or reduction of highest possible turbidity from the samples table 2 shows the turbidity data in a ph range of 1 0 3 5 as mentioned above maximum turbidity removal from wastewater samples occurred at ph 3 5 both at 22 c and 40 c at 0 016 w v of na lignosulphonate as the ph decreased from 3 5 to 1 0 at 22 c the efficiency of na lignosulphonate to remove the colloidal materials reduced significantly p 0 05 from 98 0 to 96 9 this is due to the loss of negative charge in the sulphonate group at ph 1 0 unlike at 22 c the turbidity removal efficiency remained the same in this ph range at 40 c due to the decrease in sample viscosity at higher temperature leading to efficient settling of coagulated particles when the temperature was increased from 22 c to 40 c the viscosity of the sample at a set concentration of 0 016 w v reduced significantly from 1 27 cp to 0 83 cp fig 3 giving rise to a clearer supernatant containing fewer colloidal particles after the precipitation process a report by the european food safety authority efsa recommended a concentration of 10 g for lignosulphonate per kg of feedstock i e 1 w w to be safe for cattle pigs and chickens for fattening 19 up to 4 w w of lignosulphonate is considered to be safe to use in the live feedstock in several countries with an extensive range of formulation ratios 6 hence concentration of 0 016 w v of na lignosulphonate is a safe concentration to be used in animal feed stock the turbidity of the samples was measured up to 120 min during the settling process fig 4 the graph represents all samples at optimum concentration of na lignosulphonate from ph 3 5 to 1 0 it can be observed that most of the settling 82 84 of the coagulated particles occurred in the first 15 min the turbidity removal efficiency increased to 98 when the settling time is increased to 120 min 3 3 effect of na lignosulphonate in bod reduction the fig 5 shows the reduction in bod at different treatment conditions as observed from the graph at optimum ph of 3 5 and at na lignosulphonate concentration of 0 016 w v the bod is reduced by 73 7 at 22 c and 70 at 40 c this indicates that the treatment of dairy waste stream with na lignosulphonate can significantly reduce its bod this reduction in bod is due to the removal of organic materials mostly the proteins and lipids through the precipitation process which

semiconductor chip or wafer level from the life cycle literature and industry estimates electricity water use intensity wui factors were gleaned from the literature and regional electricity wui factors were derived for china and the u s geolocation of semiconductor manufacturing facilities allowed for summation of water withdrawals at various spatial extents i e watershed country and globally this data was combined with calculated regional or country level electricity water use factors to estimate total water withdrawals by a facility geolocation of data also allowed for calculation of watershed specific scarcity weighted withdrawals scarcity weighted withdrawals were ascertained by multiplying facility water withdrawal data by the aware water scarcity characterization factor available for each of 202 watersheds associated with semiconductor manufacturing facilities these data were used to identify and map hotspots of industry water use which is especially important for areas of industry growth such as china this analysis is useful as a benchmark for global semiconductor industry water withdrawals and may assist oems in decisions about supply chain sourcing this could also guide semiconductor manufacturers in prioritizing locations and time periods to implement water saving technologies or employ less water intensive electricity sources additionally the spatially explicit water use data for the semiconductor sector can be used to improve existing databases of national and regional sector specific water use coefficients that are often applied in lca input output studies graphical abstract image 1 keywords semiconductor industry industrial water use water scarcity index water energy nexus scarcity weighted withdrawals spatiotemporal impacts 1 background the high tech semiconductor manufacturing sector is integral to the international electronics industry and was valued at over 400 billion usd in 2017 1 semiconductors are the silicon microchips utilized in electronics to control the flow of electrical signals the complex transistor circuitry required to transmit these signals is layered onto silicon wafers at semiconductor fabrication plants fabs semiconductor fabs are largely concentrated in the united states taiwan china south korea and japan these areas currently account for 83 of fab manufacturing capacity and the rapid evolution of the technology sector means that new fab facilities are being constructed at a high rate as such china and taiwan are outpacing the growth rates of other industry leaders 48 2 which will result in a spatial shift in resource demands by the industry 1 1 water use in semiconductor manufacturing semiconductor fabrication is a water intensive process and efforts have been made by individual companies to assess the water related risks posed by supply chain raw materials transportation and electricity operations use and end of life 3 industry has focused on reducing water use in their operations and correspondingly relative water use efficiency has improved over the years 4 however growth in absolute water use is predicted due to year to year increases in chip sales 2 24 from 2016 2018 and associated production capacity including a 41 increase in capacity for multi layer flash memory 5 and despite overall improving trends in water reuse efficiency industry pursuit of moore s law i e doubling of transistor density every two years has led to increases in the use of higher purity water and chemicals and more complex processing steps in addition increases in wafer size i e moving from predominantly 200 mm 300 mm and now 450 mm and the associated transition from batch processing to single wafer processing which requires more water per wafer has also contributed to increased water demands by the industry 4 6 2 7 indicated that the use phase i e use of the chips within the electronic devices and manufacturing phase are the two most water intense stages in the life cycle of a semiconductor chip 2012 electricity related water from the use phase is the primary water user for most chip types and the manufacturing phase is the second largest user of water 2 within the chip manufacturing process water used in the production of electricity to power the semiconductor fabs i e indirect water use is the single largest user of water while fab feedwater i e direct water use represents another major user 2 7 fab manufacturing water or feedwater serves three major functions in chip manufacturing process cooling water production of ultrapure water to rinse the wafer between processes and cooling water to maintain cleanroom heating ventilation and cooling hvac systems the focus of this assessment is on fab feedwater fw and electricity related water erw withdrawals for the following reasons i as mentioned these two elements represent the two largest water use categories in chip manufacturing 7 ii there is precedent for manufacturing i e direct or scope 1 and electricity related i e indirect or scope 2 resource use as the boundary for analysis within the carbon footprinting literature 8 iii both fw and erw withdrawals associated with a fab are likely to be spatially related and impacts may occur within the same watershed and iv water uses related to other processes in the life cycle of a semiconductor chip e g silicon ingot processing infrastructure transportation are comparatively smaller withdrawals total just 6 according to estimates from 7 another important consideration is that feedwater and electricity use are managed by the manufacturer as opposed to embedded within the supply chain thus quantification of withdrawals and associated decisions related to water reduction efforts can be more easily managed within this scope 9 manufacturing process data from the life cycle assessment literature 2 and industry reports 4 provide estimates of water and energy use intensity reported at the single microchip or wafer i e hundreds of chips level 1 1 1 electricity related water withdrawals estimates of water use from electricity production has been examined over the last decade 10 17 as understanding of the large impact of the energy sector on water use the water energy nexus has emerged water use data have been categorized by electricity generating type e g coal natural gas hydroelectric and associated cooling technologies i e open loop cooling closed loop cooling and air cooling 18 summarized and reported withdrawal factors by life cycle phase for ease of use in life cycle assessment lca studies a closer examination of the application of electricity water withdrawal metrics is appropriate 19 20 and addressed here by calculating regionalized electricity water use intensity factors for two of the world s major semiconductor producing countries the u s and china in the u s electricity generation by fuel type for each of the country s eight major electricity trading regions collectively known as the north american electric reliability corporation or nerc are provided by the u s epa egrid program 21 and 22 provide water use estimates for many of the country s largest electricity generating facilities in china provincial electricity data is supplied by the national bureau of statistics of china and summarized by 10 12 23 for china s six regional energy grids for all countries except the u s and china country averaged estimates of electricity mixes are provided by the international energy agency 24 it should be noted that power plants commonly use freshwater resources for cooling for example in the u s it is estimated that power plants account for 40 of the nation s freshwater withdrawals 25 1 2 industrial water use water withdrawals are defined as water removed from the ground or diverted from a surface water source for use 26 alternatively consumptive water use refers to water withdrawn that is incorporated into a product or crop or evaporated transpired or consumed by animals or humans water that is withdrawn but ultimately returned to the same watershed from which it came does not count as consumptive use 26 this study is an extension of our previous work 27 and assesses water withdrawals for manufacturing and electricity from fab facilities note the terms water use and water withdrawals are used interchangeably in this text thus this assessment does not consider a facility s efforts to recycle or return water to the watershed and although individual companies have invested considerable effort into lowering their consumptive water use rates reuse rates across the industry are highly variable thus difficult to quantify on an industry wide basis 6 reported a benchmarking study in which only 2 out of 7 companies met the water consumption targets set by the international technology roadmap for semiconductors itrs with exceedances ranging from 10 50 of the target water withdrawn is a good measure of potential water use impacts because water used in manufacturing would rarely be returned to the same water body without some loss in water quality the appropriation of water resources due to degradation in water quality known as grey water 28 is often quantified separately from consumptive water use i e blue water 29 however as this study does not separately address water quality issues associated with semiconductor manufacturing and the associated freshwater required to assimilate pollution water withdrawals serve as a proxy for both consumptive and degradative uses of water 30 however water withdrawn may not be a good measure of actual physical scarcity of water 31 and could overestimate impacts from manufacturing water demands in a watershed therefore withdrawals based water use inventories represent a conservative approach to estimating water use impacts and should be used as a screening level assessment of potential impacts rather than an absolute measurement of volumetric water use in most countries including the u s industrial water use is not understood with a high degree of spatial or temporal granularity 9 27 as mentioned the water energy nexus is vital to capture since industry is estimated to use 22 of total energy in the united states 32 and 54 of the world s total delivered energy although 33 reported that the electronics sector is currently considered a smaller user of water when compared to the major users i e paper primary metals and chemical manufacturing sectors they report that the electronics sector has the third highest energy water ratio further enumerating the importance of the water energy nexus for electronics according to the u s energy information agency the semiconductor subsector comprises 1 2 of u s manufacturing net demand for electricity 58 this indicates that the semiconductor industry constitutes a small but growing demand for direct water use and energy related water use 1 3 water scarcity many areas of the globe are already reaching the limits of a sustainable supply of freshwater for human and ecosystem demands 34 35 and later 36 reviewed several water scarcity indices and methodologies that have been developed over the past thirty years to quantify vulnerability of water resources these metrics have converged around two basic approaches as defined by 36 water crowding indices which are focused on per capita human water needs and use to resource ratio indices which are focused on the ratio of water withdrawals or consumption to available resources although there is considerable debate as to which metric of the almost two dozen available is appropriate to quantify sustainable water use 36 38 this study incorporates the aware available water remaining indicator the aware indicator is the result of a consensus based process from the united nations environment program society of environmental toxicology and chemistry unep setac water use life cycle assessment wulca group comprised of industry academic government and consulting experts which was charged with creating a standardized water footprinting method that could be implemented in life cycle based assessments of products services and economies 39 the aware index utilizes data from the watergap3 model which implements a global hydrology model 60 and a study simulating global industrial and domestic water use 40 the available water remaining aka aware in a watershed is calculated by assessing freshwater availability surface renewable groundwater minus demand amd by humans i e domestic industrial agricultural livestock and energy sectors and by freshwater aquatic ecosystems per area and by month the aware method is described by 31 and represented by the following equation expressed in terms of volume of water remaining per month m3 month within a watershed area m2 a m d i a v a i l a b i l i t y s u r f r e n e w g r d w a t e r h u m a n w a t e r c o n s u m p s u r f g r d w a t e r e n v i r o n w a t e r r e q s s u r f m 3 w a t e r s h e d a r e a m 2 m o n t h the inverse of amdi or 1 amdi is used to represent the potential for water deprivation in a watershed i this potential for deprivation is then used to create a scarcity characterization factor cfaware for a watershed to calculate the cf 1 amdi is first normalized to the world average m3 i m3 world avg and a dimensionless index is created by ranking each watershed against the normalized values calculated for all of the other watersheds in the world on a scale from 0 01 to 100 where 1 represents the world average and 100 represents areas that have 100 times less water available than the world average 31 the aware method and its associated scarcity cf was selected as the scarcity indicator for this work because it is i a consensus indicator and associated with an iso standard 31 ii the metric is ecocentric as it considers ecosystem water requirements ewr 36 iii it is relatively simple to apply and communicate consisting of a single characterization weighting factor to measure potential to deprive another user human or ecosystem of water 31 36 and iv it has been integrated as a midpoint impact characterization factor in the major lca software tools e g gabi and simapro and is thus gaining wider use in lca and water footprinting communities however the aware indicator only addresses physical water scarcity and does not take into account socio economic water scarcity e g aqueduct and its associated risk factors another point of debate regarding the use of a scarcity characterization factor such as those employed by the aware method is that multiplying a water use inventory by a scarcity cf lacks physical meaning 37 however 38 argued that the process of transforming inventory flows and their associated potential impacts into a common unit represented here as h2o equivalents is common in both lca and footprinting methods e g carbon equivalents toxicity equivalents thus in our study the goal of the water scarcity weighted characterization step is to transform the water use inventory i e h2o in liters to an impact equivalent that relates the pressure exerted on the resource to the resource in question i e h2o in liter equivalents 38 maps displaying the water scarcity impact data will help locate regions of potential concern and will be utilized to identify current locales with the highest potential water use impacts from semiconductor production this study represents the first report of total global water withdrawals for the semiconductor manufacturing industry and improves upon our prior water withdrawal estimates 27 using a bottom up approach and application of derived regional electricity water use intensity coefficients this study also presents facility level estimates of fw and erw withdrawals addressing the need for highly granular data due to the local and regional issues surrounding water use and water scarcity we report watershed specific impacts by presenting scarcity weighted withdrawals quantified in liters of h2o equivalents for semiconductor fab feedwater to better understand the potential for manufacturers in a watershed to deprive other users both ecosystems and humans of water semiconductor manufacturing and other industrial water use estimates within the literature have either been limited geographically 41 not technology specific based on sector wide input output assessment use only national averages for electricity related water use 7 and often do not address spatial variation in impacts 42 reporting of water withdrawals by semiconductor manufacturers typically through their corporate social responsibility csr reports is often limited in its usefulness because withdrawals are reported at a company wide level instead of individual facilities where impacts are felt and the metrics for reporting may not be easily compared with other companies due to a lack of metrics standardization within the industry 67 further with the exception of a few companies rarely report their scope 2 indirect water withdrawals i e erw withdrawals 2 material and methods 2 1 estimating facility water use 2 1 1 semiconductor facility production data semi is an industry association which tracks global semiconductor fabrication fab manufacturing facilities for both current and planned operations 43 the semi database consists of 1129 individual production lines and its characteristics are described in detail in our previous work 27 most notably the database contains information about location integrated circuit ic technology node produced at the plant e g 250 nm 32 nm wafer size e g 8 inch 200 mm and fab production capacity reported in wafer starts per month in the past a technology node referred to the transistor gate length which approximately scaled with transistor density in a microchip improvements in chip technology allowed for smaller gate lengths and thus tighter packing of transistors over time e g a 350 nm logic chip was state of the art in 1995 compared to 45 nm in 2007 however as the industry has reached the physical limits of size scaling the term technology node has become uncoupled with gate length and now generally refers to a specific generation of microchip and its associated processes and design parameters production capacity was used as a proxy for actual production as many of these facilities would be expected to operate at full or near full capacity although this assumption may lead to overestimates of water withdrawals in some locations operating below capacity the database was used to estimate total chip production by product and per technology node at each facility using the aforementioned parameters only production lines with valid wafer production data from the fourth quarter of 2016 were used n 1021 2 1 2 geocoding for each production line addresses provided by semi were geocoded using two software services to obtain geographic coordinates for input into a geographic information system gis the environmental systems research institute s world geocoder accessed via arcgis pro 44 and the googlemaps api accessed through the r ggmap library 45 geocoding services were used to obtain the latitude and longitude in decimal degrees for each geocoded address the geocoding software returns information about the estimated precision of each geocode for each geocoded address that returned a rooftop centroid indicating a high level of precision we utilized the data as provided by either software n 594 if neither geocoding service provided a rooftop geocode n 427 corrections to the data were made using a manual geocoding process which included use of aerial imagery from googlemaps or bing and if needed confirmation of the correct address by investigation of the company s website manual correction of geocoded data is vital to ensure accurate locations 46 47 of fab facilities which are used to estimate localized water use impacts if manual correction of an address was not feasible less precise location data provided by the geocoding software was used n 12 only one facility was unable to be located and was excluded from the analysis thus water use analysis was conducted for 1020 fab production lines 2 1 3 fab feedwater fw use water use by technology type as previously described 27 the semi database is categorized by the product type and technology node for each production line this includes major categories such as logic memory foundry and discrete which represent various types of semiconductor products such as cmos complementary metal oxide semiconductor dram dynamic random access memory nand logic gate that stands for negative and and asics application specific integrated circuits foundry facilities comprise a growing portion of the semiconductor manufacturing sector 48 and may produce multiple technologies however specific production lines will often produce one dominant product type the use of general product categories provided by the semi database was determined to be adequate for purposes of water withdrawal estimation but would need to be refined with facility level data for a detailed local assessment estimates of fab fw are drawn from the lca work of 2 49 and semiconductor industry reports 4 61 66 see table 1 boyd reports comprehensive estimates of fw and electricity use for cmos dram and nand products for technology nodes during the period 1995 2013 350 nm 22 nm at the chip level for a typical u s semiconductor facility feedwater estimates for other technology types e g mems and newer technology nodes i e 2013 2016 were estimated using itrs reports from 2001 2013 sematech these industry targets were used when specific values from boyd were not available and may represent an optimistic estimate of feedwater withdrawals other estimates of semiconductor chip water use from the life cycle literature were difficult to interpret due to aggregated reporting of results further difficulties arise from trying to pinpoint the exact kind of chip made from a foundry facility as it may manufacture a mix of technology types and nodes so assumptions about the primary technology produced at these facilities were made by using text analysis from the semi database 2 2 electricity water use electricity use by each fab was calculated using technology specific values from boyd and where these values were not available industry targets reported by itrs were used electricity use values from boyd reported in kwh per chip were normalized to kwh per cm2 of wafer semiconductor fabs typically use electricity purchased from the grid so determining the grid mix the fuel mix and or power sources for electricity generation in each area of a region or country is vital to determining the water use associated with electricity consumption typically water use intensity values from electricity are based on lca estimates of the impacts of 1 kwh of net electricity from a standard national grid mix of electricity because electricity use is such a large determinant of water use in a scope 2 assessment and often dominates water use values for technology 2 this study includes refined electricity values estimated for china and the u s regional electricity factors were calculated for the u s and china because of the large geographic variation in grid mixes across these two countries 2 2 1 u s electricity water use water withdrawal data from 13 22 and 18 were used to characterize water use intensity water withdrawal per kwh of production for each electricity generation type diehl and harris calculated detailed water withdrawal estimates in mgal day for 1290 thermoelectric power plants in the u s covering a variety of fuels and cooling technologies they also provided net generation values for each plant in megawatt hours mwh and these values were used to calculate water use intensity in liters per kwh for each thermoelectric facility fig 1 depicts the locations of each thermoelectric facility in the u s 50 that were estimated by diehl and harris an average of water use intensities wui weighted by annual net generation of electricity for each facility was used to calculate an average thermoelectric wui over the electricity trading regions in which the facilities were located this approach is preferred over national or regional grid mixes from the lca literature because it incorporates a large and representative amount of detailed facility level water use data the north american electric reliability corporation nerc is the entity responsible for coordinating and supplying electricity to various regions of the u s a nerc region operates as a trading region and electricity supply is mixed and redistributed within this region thus this is the appropriate level of spatial aggregation to calculate electricity water use intensity for non thermoelectric power plants in the u s i e hydroelectric solar photovoltaic and wind estimates of water withdrawal from 18 were used and production weighted water use intensities were calculated by averaging known production levels of thermoelectric and non thermoelectric power within each nerc region

however electricity grid mixes by region were not directly accessible thus a weighted average of production capacity for each province within the electricity region was used to calculate a production capacity weighted average for the region a map of electricity regions was adopted from 51 and using spatial overlays each fab within that electricity region was assigned a water use intensity associated with its regional mix of electricity production fig 2 this may result in error if a fab does not purchase electricity from the grid of the electricity region in which it is located 2 2 3 rest of world for all other countries in which fab production takes place country specific average grid mixes from the iea were utilized average water use intensity factors 13 18 were applied per generation type to electricity production within these countries table 2 summarizes the water use factors associated with each generating type and table a4 displays the water use intensities calculated for each country based on their grid mix and factors from table 2 2 3 characterizing water use per facility as developed in detail in our previous work an estimate of global water use by the semiconductor industry can be calculated using the following basic equation 27 3 s m g w u i 1 n f w w i e w w i m w s i fww wuitech sawafer eww eitech wuielec sawafer where smgwu semiconductor

factors cfs described in section 1 3 have been developed for 11 050 watersheds with the largest 34 watersheds divided into subwatersheds these are available for download from the wulca website as a kmz file and are provided both on a monthly basis and as an annual average 52 by utilizing location specific information about semiconductor production water use at various spatial extents e g watershed country globally could be aggregated this data was summed at the watershed level and was weighted by the aware cfs available for each watershed this analysis resulted in 202 scarcity weighted watersheds associated with the 1020 fab facilities due to the difficulty and potential error associated with allocating water withdrawn for electricity from the grid mix to a specific watershed only fab fw withdrawals which can be associated with an exact location or area was considered as part of the scarcity weighted assessment for the purposes of this assessment it was assumed that facilities were withdrawing water from within their own watershed to meet their manufacturing needs all of the fab facility water withdrawals within a watershed were summed across the watershed using spatial libraries in r 53 and visualized using arcmap 10 5 1 54 this work modified our previously developed equation to summarize the scarcity weighted withdrawals for each of the watersheds that contain semiconductor facilities and was expanded to include many more facilities and watersheds 27 4 s w w u i 1 m a f w n w s f a v g afwn fwwn mwsn 12 months where swwu scarcity weighted water

were also considered for each of the 202 watersheds associated with fab production the minimum annual scarcity values as well as maximum annual scarcity values for each watershed in a year were mapped to represent best and worst case scenarios of water scarcity these maps identified seasonal hotspots locations characterized by seasonally high water scarcity and water withdrawals by semiconductor fabrication 3 results the following results describe the facility level production data and associated fw and erw withdrawals for the 1020 semiconductor fab production lines available for analysis scarcity weighted withdrawals were calculated using aware scarcity characterization factors applied to each of the 1020 facilities located in 202 watersheds across the globe and are summarized and presented here the raw data used to produce each of these graphs and maps are available along with an interactive web map 55 3 1 feedwater fw withdrawals the annual fw withdrawals by semiconductor facilities were summarized over various spatial extents total annual semiconductor wafer production and total annual water withdrawals per country for the top global producers is presented in figs 3 and 4 the top five producers are japan taiwan south korea china and the united states respectively japan has the largest fw withdrawals for any single semiconductor producing country which aligns with its large wafer production numbers taiwan is the second largest semiconductor producer despite having the third largest water withdrawals after south korea and japan this is likely due to the type of chips being produced in taiwan compared to south korea which are dominated by newer more water intensive chip production fig 6 is a map of fab annual fw withdrawals summed at the aware watershed level table 3 indicates that watersheds located in south korea taiwan malaysia and china display the highest levels of fab fw withdrawals summarizing by watershed reveals potentially high impact areas that may not be apparent when delineated at the state province or country level manufacturing facilities in these watersheds have the potential to cause physical shortages of water resources however this must be further investigated with consideration of existing watershed scarcity related factors such as climate ecosystem water needs and human water use patterns 3 2 scarcity weighted withdrawals wafer production and watershed scarcity data can be combined to gain a general understanding of how much semiconductor production is located in areas with high potential water use impacts see fig 5 table 4 summarizes the amount of total wafer production in areas considered to be water scarce by the aware index indicating that almost 13 of production occurs in very water scarce areas 60 100 times less water than the global average and nearly half 47 of all semiconductor manufacturing occurs in locales exhibiting more scarcity than the global average scarcity factor 1 while four of the top five countries are the same as for unweighted fw withdrawals the order of the countries changes somewhat see table 5 the greatest volume of weighted fw withdrawals from semiconductor manufacturing occurs in china despite having lower wafer production numbers than japan taiwan and south korea scarcity weighted withdrawals indicate potential areas of concern with relation to existing water availability for humans and ecosystems regional water issues in china are attributed to heavy water demands from agriculture energy and dense manufacturing especially in the heavily populated and industrialized eastern provinces which comprise 47 of china s total industrial output 56 fig 8 maps the interaction of existing water scarcity and semiconductor fw withdrawals across the globe at the watershed level by summing and displaying scarcity weighted withdrawals for each watershed by comparing figs 8 and 6 one can see the spatial shift in impacts when scarcity is considered 3 3 temporal analysis the aware factors provided by wulca are comprised of annual average scarcity factors and monthly scarcity factors with the latter representing the temporal variation in water scarcity throughout the year the figure below represents the difference in withdrawals when using a best case minimum annual scarcity value versus worst case maximum annual scarcity value scenario in fig 9 the dark orange areas highlight the top 10 of watersheds that are of the most concern with regard to seasonal scarcity representing the largest annual variation in absolute terms with respect to scarcity weighted withdrawals fig 10 represents the coefficient of variation standard deviation of each watershed s annual scarcity factor normalized by mean annual scarcity this shows areas that may display a large swing in annual scarcity but which may not appear problematic with respect to total withdrawals 3 4 fab electricity water use the annual electricity related water withdrawals by semiconductor facilities were summarized over various spatial extents water withdrawals for electricity consumption are not weighted since they are not accurately attributable to a specific watershed a country level summary of fab erw withdrawals for the top global producers is presented in fig 11 this analysis indicates that south korea has the largest erw withdrawals for any single semiconductor producing country and china is the second largest user of erw china and south korea s higher water withdrawals is due to water intensive electricity production such as coal and hydroelectric and coal and nuclear respectively see the appendix for breakdown of electricity demand by generating type for each country although it is difficult to directly associate electricity use from the grid with impacts on a specific watershed in fig 12 we overlay fab electricity use with water scarce areas in east asia to draw a general picture of the relationship between water scarcity and fab erw withdrawals in this important semiconductor manufacturing region 3 5 total water withdrawals the total water withdrawal for each fab is the sum of withdrawals for the fab fw and the erw withdrawals this metric is not scarcity weighted the annual total global scope 2 water withdrawal for semiconductor manufacturing is 2 096 1013 liters per year or approximately 21 trillion liters 2 1 billion m3 per year as seen in fig 13 electricity water withdrawals dominate water use for fabs thus south korea s fabs are the largest total water users given the relative dominance of erw withdrawals 10 50 times more than fw withdrawals in some cases it is expected that south korea and china have the largest total withdrawals 4 discussion and conclusion 4 1 discussion current understanding of global water use emphasizes agricultural and thermoelectric demand and less data is available about industrial water uses many of the industrial water use studies analyze a single facility or industry or consider the water use of an entire industry without being spatially explicit thus the methodologies are not easily applied across industries or spatial scales the present study reports total global water use by an important and growing sector semiconductor manufacturing and provides a methodology that could be applied to many other manufacturing sectors the increasing production of electronics will likely represent a growing share of the global water demand by the semiconductor industry thus this study enhances the current understanding of water use by semiconductor manufacturing operations around the globe we report annual water use for nearly 100 of semiconductor manufacturing capacity in q4 2016 and identify scope 2 electricity related water withdrawals as more significant than scope 1 production data indicates a high level of water use in south korean chinese japanese u s and taiwanese electronics manufacturing sectors however we have also segmented semiconductor manufacturing capacity with respect to water scarce locations using watershed level scarcity characterization factors provided by the aware index this analysis indicated that almost 13 of production occurs in very water scarce areas and nearly half 47 of all semiconductor manufacturing occurs in locales exhibiting more scarcity than the global average this study also examined areas that undergo seasonal scarcity which is not captured by annual average scarcity values that are often reported manufacturers should consider the variability in water use impacts on ecosystems and humans that may occur seasonally this study presents a method for applying regional electricity water withdrawals and lca industry water use coefficients to calculate industry wide global scarcity weighted withdrawals the granularity of the present analysis allows for summary of data at various spatial extents the regional electricity water use factors calculated for the us using plant specific data and china using provincial production data provide more accurate withdrawal data for large countries that may exhibit regionally variable electricity production and water scarcity the derived regional electricity water use factors used in this study can be applied to other industrial sectors 4 2 limitations this work does not provide a complete picture of water use by all users industrial commercial and residential within a watershed area thus additional studies of global water withdrawals by other industrial sectors at the same spatial granularity as this one are vital to a better understanding of water use and potential impacts withdrawals based estimates were used here as a conservative estimate of water use given that degradative consumption water used to dilute pollutants to an acceptable level was not included in the analysis this study also does not provide a complete water footprint for the semiconductor industry as it focuses on manufacturing water use and excludes the significant erw withdrawals attributed to the use phase of these semiconductor chips additionally while some basic benchmarking was conducted against limited available data more complete benchmarking of facility level data against these lca based estimates should be completed scarcity weighted water withdrawals quantified in liters of h2o equivalents are not a direct measurement of physical water scarcity thus estimates provided here serve as a screening level indicator of the potential of this industry to deprive other users ecosystems or humans of clean water resulting in regulatory or reputational risk this study does not explicitly address the operational risks to the manufacturer associated with the withdrawal of feedwater in a water scarce area 4 3 conclusions this study may serve as a benchmark for global withdrawals by the semiconductor industry and could be used by industry or regulatory bodies to set withdrawals based standards additionally the spatially explicit water withdrawal data for the semiconductor sector can be used to improve existing databases of national and regional water use coefficients that are often applied in lca input output studies 42 57 industry leaders such as intel and taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc have shown that large reductions in fab water use can be achieved with the appropriate investments in water saving technologies and although these water savings are vital for reducing localized water impacts this study indicates that in the case of semiconductor manufacturing the most efficient way to reduce overall manufacturing water withdrawals and associated regional watershed impacts is through reduction in fab electricity use reductions in electricity water use can also be achieved by using less water intensive sources of electricity such as solar pv and wind which is especially important during seasons of higher water scarcity large electronics oems can use this location specific data to determine water use impacts of operations from this energy and water intensive component within their supply chain specifically the rise in semiconductor manufacturing growth in certain regions in china may enhance water scarcity in areas that are already water stressed due to existing demands by industry agriculture and domestic users supply chain decisions such as sourcing semiconductor chips from less water stressed areas may be a potential approach to reducing the overall water footprint of electronic products and managing the associated regulatory or reputational risk acknowledgements

8814,the high tech semiconductor manufacturing sector is integral to the international electronics industry and was valued at over 400 billion usd in 2017 intensive water use by this industry is well documented and this work provides a spatially explicitly assessment of water use impacts by nearly 100 of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity both direct manufacturing water use and water use from electricity were considered as part of a facility s total withdrawal manufacturing water withdrawals were estimated by using technology specific water and electricity use data reported at the semiconductor chip or wafer level from the life cycle literature and industry estimates electricity water use intensity wui factors were gleaned from the literature and regional electricity wui factors were derived for china and the u s geolocation of semiconductor manufacturing facilities allowed for summation of water withdrawals at various spatial extents i e watershed country and globally this data was combined with calculated regional or country level electricity water use factors to estimate total water withdrawals by a facility geolocation of data also allowed for calculation of watershed specific scarcity weighted withdrawals scarcity weighted withdrawals were ascertained by multiplying facility water withdrawal data by the aware water scarcity characterization factor available for each of 202 watersheds associated with semiconductor manufacturing facilities these data were used to identify and map hotspots of industry water use which is especially important for areas of industry growth such as china this analysis is useful as a benchmark for global semiconductor industry water withdrawals and may assist oems in decisions about supply chain sourcing this could also guide semiconductor manufacturers in prioritizing locations and time periods to implement water saving technologies or employ less water intensive electricity sources additionally the spatially explicit water use data for the semiconductor sector can be used to improve existing databases of national and regional sector specific water use coefficients that are often applied in lca input output studies graphical abstract image 1 keywords semiconductor industry industrial water use water scarcity index water energy nexus scarcity weighted withdrawals spatiotemporal impacts 1 background the high tech semiconductor manufacturing sector is integral to the international electronics industry and was valued at over 400 billion usd in 2017 1 semiconductors are the silicon microchips utilized in electronics to control the flow of electrical signals the complex transistor circuitry required to transmit these signals is layered onto silicon wafers at semiconductor fabrication plants fabs semiconductor fabs are largely concentrated in the united states taiwan china south korea and japan these areas currently account for 83 of fab manufacturing capacity and the rapid evolution of the technology sector means that new fab facilities are being constructed at a high rate as such china and taiwan are outpacing the growth rates of other industry leaders 48 2 which will result in a spatial shift in resource demands by the industry 1 1 water use in semiconductor manufacturing semiconductor fabrication is a water intensive process and efforts have been made by individual companies to assess the water related risks posed by supply chain raw materials transportation and electricity operations use and end of life 3 industry has focused on reducing water use in their operations and correspondingly relative water use efficiency has improved over the years 4 however growth in absolute water use is predicted due to year to year increases in chip sales 2 24 from 2016 2018 and associated production capacity including a 41 increase in capacity for multi layer flash memory 5 and despite overall improving trends in water reuse efficiency industry pursuit of moore s law i e doubling of transistor density every two years has led to increases in the use of higher purity water and chemicals and more complex processing steps in addition increases in wafer size i e moving from predominantly 200 mm 300 mm and now 450 mm and the associated transition from batch processing to single wafer processing which requires more water per wafer has also contributed to increased water demands by the industry 4 6 2 7 indicated that the use phase i e use of the chips within the electronic devices and manufacturing phase are the two most water intense stages in the life cycle of a semiconductor chip 2012 electricity related water from the use phase is the primary water user for most chip types and the manufacturing phase is the second largest user of water 2 within the chip manufacturing process water used in the production of electricity to power the semiconductor fabs i e indirect water use is the single largest user of water while fab feedwater i e direct water use represents another major user 2 7 fab manufacturing water or feedwater serves three major functions in chip manufacturing process cooling water production of ultrapure water to rinse the wafer between processes and cooling water to maintain cleanroom heating ventilation and cooling hvac systems the focus of this assessment is on fab feedwater fw and electricity related water erw withdrawals for the following reasons i as mentioned these two elements represent the two largest water use categories in chip manufacturing 7 ii there is precedent for manufacturing i e direct or scope 1 and electricity related i e indirect or scope 2 resource use as the boundary for analysis within the carbon footprinting literature 8 iii both fw and erw withdrawals associated with a fab are likely to be spatially related and impacts may occur within the same watershed and iv water uses related to other processes in the life cycle of a semiconductor chip e g silicon ingot processing infrastructure transportation are comparatively smaller withdrawals total just 6 according to estimates from 7 another important consideration is that feedwater and electricity use are managed by the manufacturer as opposed to embedded within the supply chain thus quantification of withdrawals and associated decisions related to water reduction efforts can be more easily managed within this scope 9 manufacturing process data from the life cycle assessment literature 2 and industry reports 4 provide estimates of water and energy use intensity reported at the single microchip or wafer i e hundreds of chips level 1 1 1 electricity related water withdrawals estimates of water use from electricity production has been examined over the last decade 10 17 as understanding of the large impact of the energy sector on water use the water energy nexus has emerged water use data have been categorized by electricity generating type e g coal natural gas hydroelectric and associated cooling technologies i e open loop cooling closed loop cooling and air cooling 18 summarized and reported withdrawal factors by life cycle phase for ease of use in life cycle assessment lca studies a closer examination of the application of electricity water withdrawal metrics is appropriate 19 20 and addressed here by calculating regionalized electricity water use intensity factors for two of the world s major semiconductor producing countries the u s and china in the u s electricity generation by fuel type for each of the country s eight major electricity trading regions collectively known as the north american electric reliability corporation or nerc are provided by the u s epa egrid program 21 and 22 provide water use estimates for many of the country s largest electricity generating facilities in china provincial electricity data is supplied by the national bureau of statistics of china and summarized by 10 12 23 for china s six regional energy grids for all countries except the u s and china country averaged estimates of electricity mixes are provided by the international energy agency 24 it should be noted that power plants commonly use freshwater resources for cooling for example in the u s it is estimated that power plants account for 40 of the nation s freshwater withdrawals 25 1 2 industrial water use water withdrawals are defined as water removed from the ground or diverted from a surface water source for use 26 alternatively consumptive water use refers to water withdrawn that is incorporated into a product or crop or evaporated transpired or consumed by animals or humans water that is withdrawn but ultimately returned to the same watershed from which it came does not count as consumptive use 26 this study is an extension of our previous work 27 and assesses water withdrawals for manufacturing and electricity from fab facilities note the terms water use and water withdrawals are used interchangeably in this text thus this assessment does not consider a facility s efforts to recycle or return water to the watershed and although individual companies have invested considerable effort into lowering their consumptive water use rates reuse rates across the industry are highly variable thus difficult to quantify on an industry wide basis 6 reported a benchmarking study in which only 2 out of 7 companies met the water consumption targets set by the international technology roadmap for semiconductors itrs with exceedances ranging from 10 50 of the target water withdrawn is a good measure of potential water use impacts because water used in manufacturing would rarely be returned to the same water body without some loss in water quality the appropriation of water resources due to degradation in water quality known as grey water 28 is often quantified separately from consumptive water use i e blue water 29 however as this study does not separately address water quality issues associated with semiconductor manufacturing and the associated freshwater required to assimilate pollution water withdrawals serve as a proxy for both consumptive and degradative uses of water 30 however water withdrawn may not be a good measure of actual physical scarcity of water 31 and could overestimate impacts from manufacturing water demands in a watershed therefore withdrawals based water use inventories represent a conservative approach to estimating water use impacts and should be used as a screening level assessment of potential impacts rather than an absolute measurement of volumetric water use in most countries including the u s industrial water use is not understood with a high degree of spatial or temporal granularity 9 27 as mentioned the water energy nexus is vital to capture since industry is estimated to use 22 of total energy in the united states 32 and 54 of the world s total delivered energy although 33 reported that the electronics sector is currently considered a smaller user of water when compared to the major users i e paper primary metals and chemical manufacturing sectors they report that the electronics sector has the third highest energy water ratio further enumerating the importance of the water energy nexus for electronics according to the u s energy information agency the semiconductor subsector comprises 1 2 of u s manufacturing net demand for electricity 58 this indicates that the semiconductor industry constitutes a small but growing demand for direct water use and energy related water use 1 3 water scarcity many areas of the globe are already reaching the limits of a sustainable supply of freshwater for human and ecosystem demands 34 35 and later 36 reviewed several water scarcity indices and methodologies that have been developed over the past thirty years to quantify vulnerability of water resources these metrics have converged around two basic approaches as defined by 36 water crowding indices which are focused on per capita human water needs and use to resource ratio indices which are focused on the ratio of water withdrawals or consumption to available resources although there is considerable debate as to which metric of the almost two dozen available is appropriate to quantify sustainable water use 36 38 this study incorporates the aware available water remaining indicator the aware indicator is the result of a consensus based process from the united nations environment program society of environmental toxicology and chemistry unep setac water use life cycle assessment wulca group comprised of industry academic government and consulting experts which was charged with creating a standardized water footprinting method that could be implemented in life cycle based assessments of products services and economies 39 the aware index utilizes data from the watergap3 model which implements a global hydrology model 60 and a study simulating global industrial and domestic water use 40 the available water remaining aka aware in a watershed is calculated by assessing freshwater availability surface renewable groundwater minus demand amd by humans i e domestic industrial agricultural livestock and energy sectors and by freshwater aquatic ecosystems per area and by month the aware method is described by 31 and represented by the following equation expressed in terms of volume of water remaining per month m3 month

e r s h e d a r e a m 2 m o n t h the inverse of amdi or 1 amdi is used to represent the potential for water deprivation in a watershed i this potential for deprivation is then used to create a scarcity characterization factor cfaware for a watershed to calculate the cf 1 amdi is first normalized to the world average m3 i m3 world avg and a dimensionless index is created by ranking each watershed against the normalized values calculated for all of the other watersheds in the world on a scale from 0 01 to 100 where 1 represents the world average and 100 represents areas that have 100 times less water available than the world average 31 the aware method and its associated scarcity cf was selected as the scarcity indicator for this work because it is i a consensus indicator and associated with an iso standard 31 ii the metric is ecocentric as it considers ecosystem water requirements ewr 36 iii it is relatively simple to apply and communicate consisting of a single characterization weighting factor to measure potential to deprive another user human or ecosystem of water 31 36 and iv it has been integrated as a midpoint impact characterization factor in the major lca software tools e g gabi and simapro and is thus gaining wider use in lca and water footprinting communities however the aware indicator only addresses physical water scarcity and does not take into account socio economic water scarcity e g aqueduct and its associated risk factors another point of debate regarding the use of a scarcity characterization factor such as those employed by the aware method is that multiplying a water use inventory by a scarcity cf lacks physical meaning 37 however 38 argued that the process of transforming inventory flows and their associated potential impacts into a common unit represented here as h2o equivalents is common in both lca and footprinting methods e g carbon equivalents toxicity equivalents thus in our study the goal of the water scarcity weighted characterization step is to transform the water use inventory i e h2o in liters to an impact equivalent that relates the pressure exerted on the resource to the resource in question i e h2o in liter equivalents 38 maps displaying the water scarcity impact data will help locate regions of potential concern and will be utilized to identify current locales with the highest potential water use impacts from semiconductor production this study represents the first report of total global water withdrawals for the semiconductor manufacturing industry and improves upon our prior water withdrawal estimates 27 using a bottom up approach and application of derived regional electricity water use intensity coefficients this study also presents facility level estimates of fw and erw withdrawals addressing the need for highly granular data due to the local and regional issues surrounding water use and water scarcity we report watershed specific impacts by presenting scarcity weighted withdrawals quantified in liters of h2o equivalents for semiconductor fab feedwater to better understand the potential for manufacturers in a watershed to deprive other users both ecosystems and humans of water semiconductor manufacturing and other industrial water use estimates within the literature have either been limited geographically 41 not technology specific based on sector wide input output assessment use only national averages for electricity related water use 7 and often do not address spatial variation in impacts 42 reporting of water withdrawals by semiconductor manufacturers typically through their corporate social responsibility csr reports is often limited in its usefulness because withdrawals are reported at a company wide level instead of individual facilities where impacts are felt and the metrics for reporting may not be easily compared with other companies due to a lack of metrics standardization within the industry 67 further with the exception of a few companies rarely report their scope 2 indirect water withdrawals i e erw withdrawals 2 material and methods 2 1 estimating facility water use 2 1 1 semiconductor facility production data semi is an industry association which tracks global semiconductor fabrication fab manufacturing facilities for both current and planned operations 43 the semi database consists of 1129 individual production lines and its characteristics are described in detail in our previous work 27 most notably the database contains information about location integrated circuit ic technology node produced at the plant e g 250 nm 32 nm wafer size e g 8 inch 200 mm and fab production capacity reported in wafer starts per month in the past a technology node referred to the transistor gate length which approximately scaled with transistor density in a microchip improvements in chip technology allowed for smaller gate lengths and thus tighter packing of transistors over time e g a 350 nm logic chip was state of the art in 1995 compared to 45 nm in 2007 however as the industry has reached the physical limits of size scaling the term technology node has become uncoupled with gate length and now generally refers to a specific generation of microchip and its associated processes and design parameters production capacity was used as a proxy for actual production as many of these facilities would be expected to operate at full or near full capacity although this assumption may lead to overestimates of water withdrawals in some locations operating below capacity the database was used to estimate total chip production by product and per technology node at each facility using the aforementioned parameters only production lines with valid wafer production data from the fourth quarter of 2016 were used n 1021 2 1 2 geocoding for each production line addresses provided by semi were geocoded using two software services to obtain geographic coordinates for input into a geographic information system gis the environmental systems research institute s world geocoder accessed via arcgis pro 44 and the googlemaps api accessed through the r ggmap library 45 geocoding services were used to obtain the latitude and longitude in decimal degrees for each geocoded address the geocoding software returns information about the estimated precision of each geocode for each geocoded address that returned a rooftop centroid indicating a high level of precision we utilized the data as provided by either software n 594 if neither geocoding service provided a rooftop geocode n 427 corrections to the data were made using a manual geocoding process which included use of aerial imagery from googlemaps or bing and if needed confirmation of the correct address by investigation of the company s website manual correction of geocoded data is vital to ensure accurate locations 46 47 of fab facilities which are used to estimate localized water use impacts if manual correction of an address was not feasible less precise location data provided by the geocoding software was used n 12 only one facility was unable to be located and was excluded from the analysis thus water use analysis was conducted for 1020 fab production lines 2 1 3 fab feedwater fw use water use by technology type as previously described 27 the semi database is categorized by the product type and technology node for each production line this includes major categories such as logic memory foundry and discrete which represent various types of semiconductor products such as cmos complementary metal oxide semiconductor dram dynamic random access memory nand logic gate that stands for negative and and asics application specific integrated circuits foundry facilities comprise a growing portion of the semiconductor manufacturing sector 48 and may produce multiple technologies however specific production lines will often produce one dominant product type the use of general product categories provided by the semi database was determined to be adequate for purposes of water withdrawal estimation but would need to be refined with facility level data for a detailed local assessment estimates of fab fw are drawn from the lca work of 2 49 and semiconductor industry reports 4 61 66 see table 1 boyd reports comprehensive estimates of fw and electricity use for cmos dram and nand products for technology nodes during the period 1995 2013 350 nm 22 nm at the chip level for a typical u s semiconductor facility feedwater estimates for other technology types e g mems and newer technology nodes i e 2013 2016 were estimated using itrs reports from 2001 2013 sematech these industry targets were used when specific values from boyd were not available and may represent an optimistic estimate of feedwater withdrawals other estimates of semiconductor chip water use from the life cycle literature were difficult to interpret due to aggregated reporting of results further difficulties arise from trying to pinpoint the exact kind of chip made from a foundry facility as it may manufacture a mix of technology types and nodes so assumptions about the primary technology produced at these facilities were made by using text analysis from the semi database 2 2 electricity water use electricity use by each fab was calculated using technology specific values from boyd and where these values were not available industry targets reported by itrs were used electricity use values from boyd reported in kwh per chip were normalized to kwh per cm2 of wafer semiconductor fabs typically use electricity purchased from the grid so determining the grid mix the fuel mix and or power sources for electricity generation in each area of a region or country is vital to determining the water use associated with electricity consumption typically water use intensity values from electricity are based on lca estimates of the impacts of 1 kwh of net electricity from a standard national grid mix of electricity because electricity use is such a large determinant of water use in a scope 2 assessment and often dominates water use values for technology 2 this study includes refined electricity values estimated for china and the u s regional electricity factors were calculated for the u s and china because of the large geographic variation in grid mixes across these two countries 2 2 1 u s electricity water use water withdrawal data from 13 22 and 18 were used to characterize water use intensity water withdrawal per kwh of production for each electricity generation type diehl and harris calculated detailed water withdrawal estimates in mgal day for 1290 thermoelectric power plants in the u s covering a variety of fuels and cooling technologies they also provided net generation values for each plant in megawatt hours mwh and these values were used to calculate water use intensity in liters per kwh for each thermoelectric facility fig 1 depicts the locations of each thermoelectric facility in the u s 50 that were estimated by diehl and harris an average of water use intensities wui weighted by annual net generation of electricity for each facility was used to calculate an average thermoelectric wui over the electricity trading regions in which the facilities were located this approach is preferred over national or regional grid mixes from the lca literature because it incorporates a large and representative amount of detailed facility level water use data the north american electric reliability corporation nerc is the entity responsible for coordinating and supplying electricity to various regions of the u s a nerc region operates as a trading region and electricity supply is mixed and redistributed within this region thus this is the appropriate level of spatial aggregation to calculate electricity water use intensity for non thermoelectric power plants in the u s i e hydroelectric solar photovoltaic and wind estimates of water withdrawal from 18 were used and production weighted water use intensities were calculated by averaging known production levels of thermoelectric and non thermoelectric power within each nerc region

however electricity grid mixes by region were not directly accessible thus a weighted average of production capacity for each province within the electricity region was used to calculate a production capacity weighted average for the region a map of electricity regions was adopted from 51 and using spatial overlays each fab within that electricity region was assigned a water use intensity associated with its regional mix of electricity production fig 2 this may result in error if a fab does not purchase electricity from the grid of the electricity region in which it is located 2 2 3 rest of world for all other countries in which fab production takes place country specific average grid mixes from the iea were utilized average water use intensity factors 13 18 were applied per generation type to electricity production within these countries table 2 summarizes the water use factors associated with each generating type and table a4 displays the water use intensities calculated for each country based on their grid mix and factors from table 2 2 3 characterizing water use per facility as developed in detail in our previous work an estimate of global water use by the semiconductor industry can be calculated using the following basic equation 27 3 s m g w u i 1 n f w w i e w w i m w s i fww wuitech sawafer eww eitech wuielec sawafer where smgwu semiconductor

factors cfs described in section 1 3 have been developed for 11 050 watersheds with the largest 34 watersheds divided into subwatersheds these are available for download from the wulca website as a kmz file and are provided both on a monthly basis and as an annual average 52 by utilizing location specific information about semiconductor production water use at various spatial extents e g watershed country globally could be aggregated this data was summed at the watershed level and was weighted by the aware cfs available for each watershed this analysis resulted in 202 scarcity weighted watersheds associated with the 1020 fab facilities due to the difficulty and potential error associated with allocating water withdrawn for electricity from the grid mix to a specific watershed only fab fw withdrawals which can be associated with an exact location or area was considered as part of the scarcity weighted assessment for the purposes of this assessment it was assumed that facilities were withdrawing water from within their own watershed to meet their manufacturing needs all of the fab facility water withdrawals within a watershed were summed across the watershed using spatial libraries in r 53 and visualized using arcmap 10 5 1 54 this work modified our previously developed equation to summarize the scarcity weighted withdrawals for each of the watersheds that contain semiconductor facilities and was expanded to include many more facilities and watersheds 27 4 s w w u i 1 m a f w n w s f a v g afwn fwwn mwsn 12 months where swwu scarcity weighted water

were also considered for each of the 202 watersheds associated with fab production the minimum annual scarcity values as well as maximum annual scarcity values for each watershed in a year were mapped to represent best and worst case scenarios of water scarcity these maps identified seasonal hotspots locations characterized by seasonally high water scarcity and water withdrawals by semiconductor fabrication 3 results the following results describe the facility level production data and associated fw and erw withdrawals for the 1020 semiconductor fab production lines available for analysis scarcity weighted withdrawals were calculated using aware scarcity characterization factors applied to each of the 1020 facilities located in 202 watersheds across the globe and are summarized and presented here the raw data used to produce each of these graphs and maps are available along with an interactive web map 55 3 1 feedwater fw withdrawals the annual fw withdrawals by semiconductor facilities were summarized over various spatial extents total annual semiconductor wafer production and total annual water withdrawals per country for the top global producers is presented in figs 3 and 4 the top five producers are japan taiwan south korea china and the united states respectively japan has the largest fw withdrawals for any single semiconductor producing country which aligns with its large wafer production numbers taiwan is the second largest semiconductor producer despite having the third largest water withdrawals after south korea and japan this is likely due to the type of chips being produced in taiwan compared to south korea which are dominated by newer more water intensive chip production fig 6 is a map of fab annual fw withdrawals summed at the aware watershed level table 3 indicates that watersheds located in south korea taiwan malaysia and china display the highest levels of fab fw withdrawals summarizing by watershed reveals potentially high impact areas that may not be apparent when delineated at the state province or country level manufacturing facilities in these watersheds have the potential to cause physical shortages of water resources however this must be further investigated with consideration of existing watershed scarcity related factors such as climate ecosystem water needs and human water use patterns 3 2 scarcity weighted withdrawals wafer production and watershed scarcity data can be combined to gain a general understanding of how much semiconductor production is located in areas with high potential water use impacts see fig 5 table 4 summarizes the amount of total wafer production in areas considered to be water scarce by the aware index indicating that almost 13 of production occurs in very water scarce areas 60 100 times less water than the global average and nearly half 47 of all semiconductor manufacturing occurs in locales exhibiting more scarcity than the global average scarcity factor 1 while four of the top five countries are the same as for unweighted fw withdrawals the order of the countries changes somewhat see table 5 the greatest volume of weighted fw withdrawals from semiconductor manufacturing occurs in china despite having lower wafer production numbers than japan taiwan and south korea scarcity weighted withdrawals indicate potential areas of concern with relation to existing water availability for humans and ecosystems regional water issues in china are attributed to heavy water demands from agriculture energy and dense manufacturing especially in the heavily populated and industrialized eastern provinces which comprise 47 of china s total industrial output 56 fig 8 maps the interaction of existing water scarcity and semiconductor fw withdrawals across the globe at the watershed level by summing and displaying scarcity weighted withdrawals for each watershed by comparing figs 8 and 6 one can see the spatial shift in impacts when scarcity is considered 3 3 temporal analysis the aware factors provided by wulca are comprised of annual average scarcity factors and monthly scarcity factors with the latter representing the temporal variation in water scarcity throughout the year the figure below represents the difference in withdrawals when using a best case minimum annual scarcity value versus worst case maximum annual scarcity value scenario in fig 9 the dark orange areas highlight the top 10 of watersheds that are of the most concern with regard to seasonal scarcity representing the largest annual variation in absolute terms with respect to scarcity weighted withdrawals fig 10 represents the coefficient of variation standard deviation of each watershed s annual scarcity factor normalized by mean annual scarcity this shows areas that may display a large swing in annual scarcity but which may not appear problematic with respect to total withdrawals 3 4 fab electricity water use the annual electricity related water withdrawals by semiconductor facilities were summarized over various spatial extents water withdrawals for electricity consumption are not weighted since they are not accurately attributable to a specific watershed a country level summary of fab erw withdrawals for the top global producers is presented in fig 11 this analysis indicates that south korea has the largest erw withdrawals for any single semiconductor producing country and china is the second largest user of erw china and south korea s higher water withdrawals is due to water intensive electricity production such as coal and hydroelectric and coal and nuclear respectively see the appendix for breakdown of electricity demand by generating type for each country although it is difficult to directly associate electricity use from the grid with impacts on a specific watershed in fig 12 we overlay fab electricity use with water scarce areas in east asia to draw a general picture of the relationship between water scarcity and fab erw withdrawals in this important semiconductor manufacturing region 3 5 total water withdrawals the total water withdrawal for each fab is the sum of withdrawals for the fab fw and the erw withdrawals this metric is not scarcity weighted the annual total global scope 2 water withdrawal for semiconductor manufacturing is 2 096 1013 liters per year or approximately 21 trillion liters 2 1 billion m3 per year as seen in fig 13 electricity water withdrawals dominate water use for fabs thus south korea s fabs are the largest total water users given the relative dominance of erw withdrawals 10 50 times more than fw withdrawals in some cases it is expected that south korea and china have the largest total withdrawals 4 discussion and conclusion 4 1 discussion current understanding of global water use emphasizes agricultural and thermoelectric demand and less data is available about industrial water uses many of the industrial water use studies analyze a single facility or industry or consider the water use of an entire industry without being spatially explicit thus the methodologies are not easily applied across industries or spatial scales the present study reports total global water use by an important and growing sector semiconductor manufacturing and provides a methodology that could be applied to many other manufacturing sectors the increasing production of electronics will likely represent a growing share of the global water demand by the semiconductor industry thus this study enhances the current understanding of water use by semiconductor manufacturing operations around the globe we report annual water use for nearly 100 of semiconductor manufacturing capacity in q4 2016 and identify scope 2 electricity related water withdrawals as more significant than scope 1 production data indicates a high level of water use in south korean chinese japanese u s and taiwanese electronics manufacturing sectors however we have also segmented semiconductor manufacturing capacity with respect to water scarce locations using watershed level scarcity characterization factors provided by the aware index this analysis indicated that almost 13 of production occurs in very water scarce areas and nearly half 47 of all semiconductor manufacturing occurs in locales exhibiting more scarcity than the global average this study also examined areas that undergo seasonal scarcity which is not captured by annual average scarcity values that are often reported manufacturers should consider the variability in water use impacts on ecosystems and humans that may occur seasonally this study presents a method for applying regional electricity water withdrawals and lca industry water use coefficients to calculate industry wide global scarcity weighted withdrawals the granularity of the present analysis allows for summary of data at various spatial extents the regional electricity water use factors calculated for the us using plant specific data and china using provincial production data provide more accurate withdrawal data for large countries that may exhibit regionally variable electricity production and water scarcity the derived regional electricity water use factors used in this study can be applied to other industrial sectors 4 2 limitations this work does not provide a complete picture of water use by all users industrial commercial and residential within a watershed area thus additional studies of global water withdrawals by other industrial sectors at the same spatial granularity as this one are vital to a better understanding of water use and potential impacts withdrawals based estimates were used here as a conservative estimate of water use given that degradative consumption water used to dilute pollutants to an acceptable level was not included in the analysis this study also does not provide a complete water footprint for the semiconductor industry as it focuses on manufacturing water use and excludes the significant erw withdrawals attributed to the use phase of these semiconductor chips additionally while some basic benchmarking was conducted against limited available data more complete benchmarking of facility level data against these lca based estimates should be completed scarcity weighted water withdrawals quantified in liters of h2o equivalents are not a direct measurement of physical water scarcity thus estimates provided here serve as a screening level indicator of the potential of this industry to deprive other users ecosystems or humans of clean water resulting in regulatory or reputational risk this study does not explicitly address the operational risks to the manufacturer associated with the withdrawal of feedwater in a water scarce area 4 3 conclusions this study may serve as a benchmark for global withdrawals by the semiconductor industry and could be used by industry or regulatory bodies to set withdrawals based standards additionally the spatially explicit water withdrawal data for the semiconductor sector can be used to improve existing databases of national and regional water use coefficients that are often applied in lca input output studies 42 57 industry leaders such as intel and taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc have shown that large reductions in fab water use can be achieved with the appropriate investments in water saving technologies and although these water savings are vital for reducing localized water impacts this study indicates that in the case of semiconductor manufacturing the most efficient way to reduce overall manufacturing water withdrawals and associated regional watershed impacts is through reduction in fab electricity use reductions in electricity water use can also be achieved by using less water intensive sources of electricity such as solar pv and wind which is especially important during seasons of higher water scarcity large electronics oems can use this location specific data to determine water use impacts of operations from this energy and water intensive component within their supply chain specifically the rise in semiconductor manufacturing growth in certain regions in china may enhance water scarcity in areas that are already water stressed due to existing demands by industry agriculture and domestic users supply chain decisions such as sourcing semiconductor chips from less water stressed areas may be a potential approach to reducing the overall water footprint of electronic products and managing the associated regulatory or reputational risk acknowledgements
