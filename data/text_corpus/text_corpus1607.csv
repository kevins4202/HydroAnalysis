may be possible that δ15n in lichen thalli sphagnum capitula top 1 cm of plants or leaves needles of vascular plants especially those representing current growth in bogs could provide an indicator of the importance of oil sands n emissions and deposition to the region s bog ecosystems with this in mind over three growing seasons we quantified δ15n in tissues of two lichen two sphagnum and six vascular plant species in six bogs ranging from 11 to 251 km distant from the heart of the athabasca oil sands operations in northern alberta taken as the midpoint between the syncrude and suncor upgrader stacks as a preliminary study to assess which bog plant or lichen species if any might serve as a proxy for oil sands derived n inputs we expected that the lichens cladonia mitis and evernia mesomorpha would be the most likely species to exhibit an 15n response given their reliance on wet and dry deposition as sources of n followed by sphagnum mosses given their position at the peat atmosphere interface and lack of vascular tissues vascular plants should be the least likely to exhibit an 15n response given the efficient scavenging of atmospherically deposited n at the peat

resin collectors 5 in the open and 5 beneath black spruce trees with 2 control collectors capped at each end at each site resin tubes were replaced in may or june and october see wieder et al 2016 for

bog plant or lichen species examined in this study table 2 are comparable to those found in other bog studies table s1 we characterized the 10 species examined as one of five types lichens evernia mesomorpha cladonia mitis bryophytes sphagnum capillifolium sphagnum fuscum nonmycorrhizal rubus chamaemorus maianthemum trifolium ericoid mycorrhizal rhododendron groenlandicum vaccinium oxycoccos vaccinium vitis idaea and ectomycorrhizal picea mariana averaged across all sites and collection dates mean δ15n values for each of five plant or lichen types were significantly different from all other types nonmycorrhizal 1 3 0 1 n 447 bryophytes 4 2 01 n 698 lichens 4 8 01 n 764 ericoid mycorrhizal 5 7 0 1 n 1107 and ectomycorrhizal 10 4 0 1 n 385 the trend of vascular plant foliar δ15n values of nonmycorrhizal arbuscular mycorrhizal ericoid mycorrhizal ectomycorrhizal has been related to differences in the distances from the roots that different types of mycorrhizae can explore different enzymatic capabilities to access different forms of n and the extent to which different mycorrhizal groups preferentially retain 15n while preferentially transferring 14n to the host plant michelsen et al 1998 emmerton et al 2001 craine et al 2015 the separation of the five plant or lichen types is even more pronounced when tissue δ15n values are plotted as a function of tissue n concentrations fig 1 the nonmycorrhizal species rubus chamaemorus and maianthemum trifolium had the highest leaf δ15n values and n concentrations the high δ15n values for these species are likely the result of their non mycorrhizal status deep aerenchymatous roots allowing for n acquisition from deep peat and the general pattern of increasing δ15n of bog peat with depth kohzu et al 2003 blodau et al 2006 hobbie et al 2017 drollinger et al 2019 the lichen and sphagnum species cluster together differing more in n concentrations than in δ15n values and ericoid mycorrhizal species are more similar to each other than to the ectomycorrhizal picea mariana fig 1 the key question though is whether for any of these 10 species the within species between site variability in δ15n values reflects the influence of oil sands n emissions we used the approach of proemse and mayer 2012 plotting plant or lichen δ15n values as a function of the inverse of the n concentration in tissues for each species across all bog sites to evaluate whether plant or lichen tissue n and 15n chemistry could be explained as the mixing of two or more sources of n such mixing would be reflected by a significant linear regression and by the six bog sites being arrayed along distance from oil sands operations the only species that clearly exhibited such patterns was the epiphytic lichen evernia mesomorpha suggesting background δ15n values of about 4 0 at remote sites presumably reflecting wet and dry deposition unaffected by oil sands emissions and possible oil sands sources with more negative δ15n values fig 2 this result is in contrast to the findings of proemse and mayer 2012 who analyzed 32 evernia mesomorpha samples collected from 24 sites ranging from 3 to 113 km from oil sands operations while n concentrations increased with proximity to the oil sands 30 of the 32 samples had δ15n values 5 3 1 0 similar to pristine atmospheric no3 and nh4 deposition unaffected by oil sands development duplicate samples from the site closest to oil sands operations however had δ15n values of 11 6 and 9 8 suggesting an oil sands n source with a very positive δ15n signature for the terricolous lichen cladonia mitis n concentrations increased with proximity to oil sands operations table 1 wieder et al 2021 but there was no clear evidence of an oil sands related 15n influence fig 2 although the regression in fig 2 was significant the r2 value was low and the six bog sites were not clearly arrayed according to distance from oil sands facilities the contrasting patterns of evernia mesomorpha and cladonia mitis are consistent with the concept that epiphytic lichens may be more responsive to varying n inputs than terricolous lichens graney et al 2017 watmough et al 2019 both sphagnum species exhibited an increase in δ15n with increasing capitulum n concentrations fig 2 the two sphagnum species behaved similarly with background δ15n values of about 4 5 that became more positive with proximity to oil sands operations fig 2 however the r2 values for the sphagnum regressions in fig 2 were quite low and despite significant site differences in both δ15n and capitulum n concentrations table 1 the six bog sites are not clearly separated in fig 2 delgado et al 2013 reported that mosses thought to rely entirely on atmospheric n can vary by up to 8 within a narrow geographic region underscoring the complications of δ15n interpretations along a european n bulk deposition gradient ranging from 0 8 to 20 kg n ha 1 yr 1 n concentrations in sphagnum capitula increased logarithmically with no significant change in δ15n values bragazza et al 2005 along an eastern canadian n deposition gradient ranging from 1 3 to 10 6 kg n ha 1 yr 1 with increasing n deposition sphagnum n concentrations increased while δ15n values became more negative 1 to 6 živkovič et al 2017 in contrast to our result that as n concentrations increased δ15n values became more positive we cannot definitively conclude that the δ15n patterns in the two sphagnum species fig 2 reflect an oil sands n source four of the six vascular plant species exhibited significant regressions albeit with low r2 values and none of these species showed a clear separation of sites with distance from oil sands facilities fig 2 for these vascular plant species either atmospherical deposition does not provide the major source of n for plant uptake or the δ15n signatures of oil sands emissions are not sufficiently distinct to be reflected in leaf needle δ15n values when we began sampling of the bog sites in 2009 the only data on the δ15n signatures of oil sands n emissions were for pm2 5 emissions from two upgrader stacks in the oil sands region δ15n nh4 values ranged from 4 5 20 1 while δ15n no3 values ranged from 9 4 to 17 9 proemse et al 2012 subsequently proemse et al 2013 reported a wide range of δ15n values for wet atmospheric deposition of nh4 6 3 to 11 3 and no3 4 9 to 6 3 somewhat different results were reported by hemsley et al 2019 wet atmospheric deposition of δ15n nh4 of 9 6 1 2 and δ15n no3 of 1 8 2 7 there is evidence for considerable nh3 deposition in the oil sands region originating from the oil sands bitumen upgrading processes nh3 emissions from tailings ponds and volatilization of nh3 from urea fertilizer used in land reclamation bytnerowicz et al 2010 although the relative magnitude of these sources has not been well established tailings pond δ15n nh4 values are quite positive 28 8 2 5 and urea used as a fertilizer in land reclamation has a δ15n of 0 33 hemsley et al 2019 any nh3 volatilized from tailings ponds or from land to which urea has been applied would be enriched in 14n relative to their sources due to the high fractionation associated with the conversion of nh4 to nh3 nômmik et al 1994 two major sources of n emissions from oil sands operations for which there are no data are n gases from upgrader stacks and n in exhaust from diesel fueled mine fleets the major fuel used in upgrading bitumen is natural gas walters et al 2015a report δ15n nox from natural gas combustion sources of 16 5 1 7 the δ15n nox values of diesel truck exhaust have ranged from 12 0 to 23 3 heaton 1990 walters et al 2015b it is likely that the δ15n nox signatures of upgrader stack and diesel fueled trucks in the oil sands region are quite negative we note that even with improved data on the 15n signatures of n emissions from various sources oil sands once n compounds are emitted n compounds participate in a diverse set of atmospheric chemical reactions often with isotope fractionation cf elliott et al 2019 liu et al 2020 complicating efforts to relate 15n in plant or lichen tissues to oil sands n emissions 4 conclusions while δ15n values can be an effective tool to trace anthropogenic n emissions e g heaton 1986 pearson et al 2000 pardo et al 2007 elliott et al 2007 xiao et al 2011 a prerequisite is that the anthropogenic n source has a δ15n signature that is distinct from background values even if this prerequisite is met plant tissue δ15n interpretations are not necessarily straightforward given the wide variation in signatures of atmospheric sources multiple fractionating processes in the soil variation across both spatial and temporal gradients craine et al 2015 and n fractionation associated with atmospheric chemical reactions elliott et al 2019 liu et al 2020 of the 10 bog plant or lichen species examined in this study evernia mesomorpha has the highest potential for use as a biomonitor of oil sands n emissions through δ15n values the increasingly negative δ15n values for evernia mesomorpha with increasing proximity to oil sands operations table 3 figs 1 2 may well reflect an oil sands influence with an δ15n signature of about 7 however the scarcity of data on δ15n values for potential oil sands n sources and the variability that exists in this scarce data set preclude definitive interpretations funding

vaccinium vitis idaea and ectomycorrhizal picea mariana averaged across all sites and collection dates mean δ15n values for each of five plant or lichen types were significantly different from all other types nonmycorrhizal 1 3 0 1 n 447 bryophytes 4 2 01 n 698 lichens 4 8 01 n 764 ericoid mycorrhizal 5 7 0 1 n 1107 and ectomycorrhizal 10 4 0 1 n 385 the trend of vascular plant foliar δ15n values of nonmycorrhizal arbuscular mycorrhizal ericoid mycorrhizal ectomycorrhizal has been related to differences in the distances from the roots that different types of mycorrhizae can explore different enzymatic capabilities to access different forms of n and the extent to which different mycorrhizal groups preferentially retain 15n while preferentially transferring 14n to the host plant michelsen et al 1998 emmerton et al 2001 craine et al 2015 the separation of the five plant or lichen types is even more pronounced when tissue δ15n values are plotted as a function of tissue n concentrations fig 1 the nonmycorrhizal species rubus chamaemorus and maianthemum trifolium had the highest leaf δ15n values and n concentrations the high δ15n values for these species are likely the result of their non mycorrhizal status deep aerenchymatous roots allowing for n acquisition from deep peat and the general pattern of increasing δ15n of bog peat with depth kohzu et al 2003 blodau et al 2006 hobbie et al 2017 drollinger et al 2019 the lichen and sphagnum species cluster together differing more in n concentrations than in δ15n values and ericoid mycorrhizal species are more similar to each other than to the ectomycorrhizal picea mariana fig 1 the key question though is whether for any of these 10 species the within species between site variability in δ15n values reflects the influence of oil sands n emissions we used the approach of proemse and mayer 2012 plotting plant or lichen δ15n values as a function of the inverse of the n concentration in tissues for each species across all bog sites to evaluate whether plant or lichen tissue n and 15n chemistry could be explained as the mixing of two or more sources of n such mixing would be reflected by a significant linear regression and by the six bog sites being arrayed along distance from oil sands operations the only species that clearly exhibited such patterns was the epiphytic lichen evernia mesomorpha suggesting background δ15n values of about 4 0 at remote sites presumably reflecting wet and dry deposition unaffected by oil sands emissions and possible oil sands sources with more negative δ15n values fig 2 this result is in contrast to the findings of proemse and mayer 2012 who analyzed 32 evernia mesomorpha samples collected from 24 sites ranging from 3 to 113 km from oil sands operations while n concentrations increased with proximity to the oil sands 30 of the 32 samples had δ15n values 5 3 1 0 similar to pristine atmospheric no3 and nh4 deposition unaffected by oil sands development duplicate samples from the site closest to oil sands operations however had δ15n values of 11 6 and 9 8 suggesting an oil sands n source with a very positive δ15n signature for the terricolous lichen cladonia mitis n concentrations increased with proximity to oil sands operations table 1 wieder et al 2021 but there was no clear evidence of an oil sands related 15n influence fig 2 although the regression in fig 2 was significant the r2 value was low and the six bog sites were not clearly arrayed according to distance from oil sands facilities the contrasting patterns of evernia mesomorpha and cladonia mitis are consistent with the concept that epiphytic lichens may be more responsive to varying n inputs than terricolous lichens graney et al 2017 watmough et al 2019 both sphagnum species exhibited an increase in δ15n with increasing capitulum n concentrations fig 2 the two sphagnum species behaved similarly with background δ15n values of about 4 5 that became more positive with proximity to oil sands operations fig 2 however the r2 values for the sphagnum regressions in fig 2 were quite low and despite significant site differences in both δ15n and capitulum n concentrations table 1 the six bog sites are not clearly separated in fig 2 delgado et al 2013 reported that mosses thought to rely entirely on atmospheric n can vary by up to 8 within a narrow geographic region underscoring the complications of δ15n interpretations along a european n bulk deposition gradient ranging from 0 8 to 20 kg n ha 1 yr 1 n concentrations in sphagnum capitula increased logarithmically with no significant change in δ15n values bragazza et al 2005 along an eastern canadian n deposition gradient ranging from 1 3 to 10 6 kg n ha 1 yr 1 with increasing n deposition sphagnum n concentrations increased while δ15n values became more negative 1 to 6 živkovič et al 2017 in contrast to our result that as n concentrations increased δ15n values became more positive we cannot definitively conclude that the δ15n patterns in the two sphagnum species fig 2 reflect an oil sands n source four of the six vascular plant species exhibited significant regressions albeit with low r2 values and none of these species showed a clear separation of sites with distance from oil sands facilities fig 2 for these vascular plant species either atmospherical deposition does not provide the major source of n for plant uptake or the δ15n signatures of oil sands emissions are not sufficiently distinct to be reflected in leaf needle δ15n values when we began sampling of the bog sites in 2009 the only data on the δ15n signatures of oil sands n emissions were for pm2 5 emissions from two upgrader stacks in the oil sands region δ15n nh4 values ranged from 4 5 20 1 while δ15n no3 values ranged from 9 4 to 17 9 proemse et al 2012 subsequently proemse et al 2013 reported a wide range of δ15n values for wet atmospheric deposition of nh4 6 3 to 11 3 and no3 4 9 to 6 3 somewhat different results were reported by hemsley et al 2019 wet atmospheric deposition of δ15n nh4 of 9 6 1 2 and δ15n no3 of 1 8 2 7 there is evidence for considerable nh3 deposition in the oil sands region originating from the oil sands bitumen upgrading processes nh3 emissions from tailings ponds and volatilization of nh3 from urea fertilizer used in land reclamation bytnerowicz et al 2010 although the relative magnitude of these sources has not been well established tailings pond δ15n nh4 values are quite positive 28 8 2 5 and urea used as a fertilizer in land reclamation has a δ15n of 0 33 hemsley et al 2019 any nh3 volatilized from tailings ponds or from land to which urea has been applied would be enriched in 14n relative to their sources due to the high fractionation associated with the conversion of nh4 to nh3 nômmik et al 1994 two major sources of n emissions from oil sands operations for which there are no data are n gases from upgrader stacks and n in exhaust from diesel fueled mine fleets the major fuel used in upgrading bitumen is natural gas walters et al 2015a report δ15n nox from natural gas combustion sources of 16 5 1 7 the δ15n nox values of diesel truck exhaust have ranged from 12 0 to 23 3 heaton 1990 walters et al 2015b it is likely that the δ15n nox signatures of upgrader stack and diesel fueled trucks in the oil sands region are quite negative we note that even with improved data on the 15n signatures of n emissions from various sources oil sands once n compounds are emitted n compounds participate in a diverse set of atmospheric chemical reactions often with isotope fractionation cf elliott et al 2019 liu et al 2020 complicating efforts to relate 15n in plant or lichen tissues to oil sands n emissions 4 conclusions while δ15n values can be an effective tool to trace anthropogenic n emissions e g heaton 1986 pearson et al 2000 pardo et al 2007 elliott et al 2007 xiao et al 2011 a prerequisite is that the anthropogenic n source has a δ15n signature that is distinct from background values even if this prerequisite is met plant tissue δ15n interpretations are not necessarily straightforward given the wide variation in signatures of atmospheric sources multiple fractionating processes in the soil variation across both spatial and temporal gradients craine et al 2015 and n fractionation associated with atmospheric chemical reactions elliott et al 2019 liu et al 2020 of the 10 bog plant or lichen species examined in this study evernia mesomorpha has the highest potential for use as a biomonitor of oil sands n emissions through δ15n values the increasingly negative δ15n values for evernia mesomorpha with increasing proximity to oil sands operations table 3 figs 1 2 may well reflect an oil sands influence with an δ15n signature of about 7 however the scarcity of data on δ15n values for potential oil sands n sources and the variability that exists in this scarce data set preclude definitive interpretations funding

8036,soil moisture sm is an indispensable variable in drought monitoring and weather forecast l band is found to be the most suitable band for retrieving surface sm here we evaluate two l band passive microwave sm products soil moisture active and passive smap and soil moisture and ocean salinity smos in inner mongolia the collected in situ data from 24 measured sites and the triple collocation tc analysis method using global land data assimilation system gldas noah and the advanced scatterometer ascat sm data as a reference dataset are used to evaluate smap and smos sm products in the validation based on in situ sm smap shows the highest correlation with the in situ sm followed by gldas and smos the root mean square error rmse and bias value of smap is the lowest the validation results of each in situ station show that the median correlation coefficient of ascat is the highest followed by smap gldas and smos the median rmse and bias of smap are the lowest while smos performs the worst among the three products tc analysis results show that smap has better performance with the majority of the random errors distributed between 0 02 and 0 03 m3 m3 the average random error of smap is small while smos has relatively large random errors simultaneously smap performs better than gldas and smos in grassland and low vegetation coverage areas the research results and analysis of this paper are expected to provide some insights for improving the quality of sm products keywords triple collocation smap smos soil moisture 1 introduction in the global water cycle soil moisture sm influences multiple hydrological processes such as infiltration runoff and evaporation santi et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 for hydrological and climate models sm is also an important input parameter kim and hogue 2012 in many research fields sm is essential including drought monitoring weather forecasting and vegetation status prediction brocca et al 2017 champagne et al 2012 park et al 2017 accurate estimation of soil moisture can improve the prediction accuracy of related applications an et al 2016 wu et al 2016 currently sm is retrieved via many approaches including in situ measurement satellite observation and land surface model simulation the sm products based on active microwave remote sensing mainly include advanced scatterometer ascat bartalis et al 2007 and the european remote sensing ers scatterometer wagner et al 1999 sm products based on passive microwave remote sensing include advanced microwave scanning radiometer for the earth observing system amsr e njoku et al 2003

evaporation amsterdam model gleam martens et al 2017 european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis v5 era5 dee et al 2011 etc microwave remote sensing data have a low temporal resolution compared to remote sensing data from optical sensors however microwave remote sensing can directly measure the dielectric contrast between dry soil and liquid water regardless of weather conditions sabaghy et al 2018 making it possible to monitor sm in a large area in particular l band radiometry is considered an effective method for monitoring sm zhao et al 2020 generally passive microwave sm products are assessed through the core dense or sparse sm monitoring network nevertheless most in situ monitoring stations are located in north america and europe and cannot cover the whole world well brocca et al 2011 assessed the reliability of ascat and amsr products in europe based on in situ sites beck et al 2021 evaluated 18 satellite based or model based sm products using 826 in situ stations from the united states europe and australia karthikeyan et al 2017 validated 11 sm products including passive sensors active sensors and active passive fusion products with in situ sm crow and zhan 2007 al bitar et al 2012 wu et al 2016 zeng et al 2016 all evaluated the performance of sm products in the united states zeng et al 2015 evaluated and reanalyzed several sm products in the qinghai tibet plateau region via three sm measurement networks chen et al 2017 liu et al 2019 yang et al 2020 evaluated the performance of several sm products on the tibetan plateau based on in situ data cui et al 2017 evaluated amsr 2 smos and smap sm products in the genhe area of china wang et al 2021 evaluated smos and smap sm products over the huaihe river basin based on physical models statistical models and in situ observations ma et al 2017 evaluated the smap active products passive products and active passive combined products over the heihe river basin china in general sm products are validated mainly in developed regions and hotspots with well established in situ monitoring networks draper et al 2009 oozeer et al 2020 while the sparse in situ observations areas are rarely validated furthermore the assessment of sm products based on in situ observation also has some limitations the scales of the in situ measured sm and the satellite retrieved sm data do not match the sm retrieved by satellites usually represents a range of several kilometers to tens of kilometers while in situ site measurements typically represent several square meters of sm near the site these differences introduce some representative errors into the verification and evaluation of sm products xu et al 2021 thereby increasing the difficulty of validation the triple collocation tc method is a statistical method first proposed for error estimation of near surface wind speed products stoffelen 1998 then it is used to calculate the errors of several geophysical quantities including precipitation lai etc fang et al 2012 lu et al 2021 lyu et al 2021 wu et al 2019 it is suitable for estimating the random error variance of three mutually independent data sets in the absence or lack of in situ data as one of the essential methods to evaluate the accuracy of geophysical parameters tc analytical method has been used to evaluate several geophysical parameters including sm pierdicca et al 2015 analyzed sm of ascat and smos in europe and north africa by tc method in the latest study wu et al 2021 evaluated the error characteristics of smap and ascat sm using the tc method mousa and shu 2020 evaluated the error patterns of satellites sm products via the tc method inner mongolia is situated in the inland of china far away from the sea with low and uneven rainfall sm monitoring is essential for drought monitoring and agricultural management in this region however sm products are not well evaluated in inner mongolia due to the lack of in situ monitoring sites the research objective of this paper is to use in situ data from 24 sparse monitoring sites and other auxiliary data to evaluate the performance of smap and smos sm products over inner mongolia four evaluation metrics were calculated between the satellite sm and in situ data furthermore random error distributions of smap and smos were analyzed based on the tc method finally this paper analyzed the performance of sm products under different land coverage scenarios and the impact of radio frequency interference rfi on satellite sm products the remaining sections are organized as follows section 2 describes the data used in this paper including sm products in situ data and other ancillary data along with a further description of the study area section 3 focuses on the sm evaluation methods used in this paper sections 4 and 5 present the sm evaluation results and related discussions respectively the conclusion is presented in section 6 2 data and study area descriptions 2 1 remote sensing soil moisture data the smap satellite designed to monitor surface sm and freeze thaw conditions was launched by nasa in 2015 it carries both an l band radiometer and an l band radar and the frequency of the center band is 1 41 ghz the radar ceased operation in july 2015 since then smap only provides sm products retrieved by an l band radiometer currently the single channel algorithm using the vertically polarized brightness temperature is the baseline algorithm for smap to estimate sm spl3smp is a smap level 3 passive microwave sm product with a spatial resolution of 36 km and projection coordinates of ease grid 2 0 brodzik et al 2012 the spl3smp products include the 6 00 a m descending orbit product and the 6 00 p m ascending orbit product in this study we choose the descending orbit spl3smp product version 7 for validation spl3smp is available from https nsidc org data spl3smp versions 7 during the frozen season there is uncertainty in satellite retrieval of sm hu et al 2020 liu et al 2019 wei et al 2019 seasonal frozen soil in inner mongolia occurs from october to april during march to april of each year the frozen soil begins to thaw beck et al 2021 gan et al 2012 liu et al 2015 zhao et al 2011 therefore in this paper we use sm data from april to september for each year between 2017 and 2020 for analysis the smos satellite carrying an l band radiometer is dedicated to the global observation of sm and ocean salinity it was launched by esa in november 2009 data products have been accumulated for almost 12 years now smos l3 products including barcelona expert center bec products and centre aval de traitement des données catds products are available through the bec http bec icm csic es data available products and catds smos https www catds fr the temporal resolution of the catds products is 2 3 days the spatial resolution is 25 km and the projection is ease grid 2 0 meanwhile catds sm products include the 6 00 a m ascending orbit product and the 6 00 p m descending orbit product the smos mission relies on the l band microwave emission of biosphere l meb model to retrieve sm in this paper we analyze the smos ascending orbit product version 3 which are available at ftp ftp ifremer fr to align the smos and smap satellite spatial resolutions we resample the smos sm products using a bilinear interpolation method to obtain a dataset that matches the smap spatial resolution the smos sm retrieval is affected by rfi so we use rfi prob layer to quality control smos sm and remove sm with rfi probability greater than 0 3 al yaari et al 2014 the european space agency s climate change initiative esa cci aims to monitor essential climate variables globally and has been releasing sm products since 2012 esa cci sm consists of three harmonised products including the active sm product the passive sm product and the combined active and passive sm product dorigo et al 2017 which are available for download through the climate data dashboard of the esa cci website https climate esa int en odp project soil moisture in this paper to form the triplet of the tc method the active product version 06 1 will be used for experiments the active product derived from the instruments ami ws and ascat covers the period august 05 1991 to december 31 2020 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 degrees the units of active sm products need to be converted since the percentage of saturation is different from the volumetric water content m3 m3 of smap and smos sm with the soil porosity data obtained from harmonized world soil database the units of active sm products can be converted to soil volumetric water content al yaari et al 2019 peng et al 2021 2 2 model simulated soil moisture data gldas version 2 1 gldas 2 1 is a global data assimilation system and drives multiple land surface models using gldas 2 1 we can obtain land surface state and flux parameters and apply them in relevant studies the gldas 2 1 noah model is one of the land surface models providing sm products with a temporal resolution of 3 h and a spatial resolution of 0 25 degree the sm is measured at four depths 0 10 cm 10 40 cm 40 100 cm and 100 200 cm gldas 2 1 sm products perform better and have wide applications in the existing evaluation of sm products based on tc methods gldas 2 1 sm is more often used as a reference dataset gruber et al 2016a kolassa et al 2017 wu et al 2021 in this paper we use 0 10 cm gldas 2 1 sm data for triple collocation analysis the units of gldas 2 1 noah sm data kg m2 do not correspond to the units of satellite sm products m3 m3 here we can convert the units of gldas 2 1 noah sm to soil volumetric water content by the method in liu et al 2021 the smap and smos sm data evaluated in this paper are recorded through local time while the gldas 2 1 noah sm product is recorded through utc the local time in the study area at 6 00 a m is utc 8 therefore we selected the gldas 2 1 data from the study area at 21 00 the previous day as the reference data set for the experiment during processing gldas 2 1 data were available at https disc gsfc nasa gov datasets keywords gldas 2 3 in situ data in situ observation sm was available from the china meteorological administration in this paper we collected 24 in situ monitoring stations in the study area sm at 10 20 40 cm depth was measured by the in situ sites at 8 00 a m and 3 00 p m each day and the soil volumetric water content was determined based on the principle of time domain reflectometer sun et al 2017 in this paper in situ sm data at 10 cm depth were used to validate the smap and smos sm products 2 4 auxiliary data in this paper we also used some auxiliary data to evaluate the performance of smap and smos sm from different perspectives including precipitation data huffman et al 2019 and land cover data friedl et al 2010 to validate the sm products precipitation data gpm 3imergdf were used to validate the response of sm products when precipitation occurred land cover data mcd12q1 were used to discuss the performance of sm products under different land cover classifications the gpm 3imergdf product has a spatial resolution of 0 1 degree and a temporal resolution of daily obtained from the nasa goddard earth sciences ges data and information services center disc mcd12q1 is an annual product available from https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov search with a spatial resolution of 500 m the land cover was classified using the igbp global vegetation classification scheme as described in sulla menashe and friedl 2018 2 5 study area inner mongolia is located in the mid latitudes of northern china most of the study area is a plateau except for the south eastern part the elevation of the south eastern part is below 400 m and most of the remaining parts have an elevation of about 1000 1500 m the study area has a predominantly temperate continental climate far from the ocean with low and uneven rainfall precipitation occurs mainly in summer and is influenced by topography and distance from the sea the annual precipitation shows a decreasing trend from northeast to southwest while the evaporation is the opposite from the eastern to the western regions the study area gradually changes from humid and semi humid areas to semi arid and arid areas fig 1 shows the geographic scope of the study area and the distribution of the 24 in situ sites the elevation data used in fig 1 are srtm elevation data rabus et al 2003 land cover classification of inner mongolia is classified by igbp global vegetation classification scheme 3 method 3 1 triple collocation tc is one of the most critical evaluation methods in earth observation to estimate the random error variance of geophysical variables usually tc analysis requires three mutually independent datasets and does not require the reference dataset to have high data quality gruber et al 2016b here we use four sm datasets smap smos gldas and ascat for tc analysis in existing researches gldas sm products have been used as a reference dataset for tc analysis gruber et al 2017 wu et al 2021 therefore we also choose gldas as the reference dataset for tc analysis the sm triplet sample must be at least greater than 100 since the revisit interval of 2 3 days for satellites the number of triplet samples may not meet the requirement to make the tc analysis results more reliable when the number of sm triplet samples involved in the calculation is less than 100 we remove this part of the data for tc analysis the tc method is based on the following assumptions linear correlation between observed and true values zero error intercorrelation between data sets independence of errors in each data set no correlation between errors and true values signal and error smoothness eq 1 is the mathematical expression of the tc method 1 x i α i β i t ε i where i 1 2 3 x 1 x 2 x 3 are three independent sm data sets t represents the true value of sm α i and β i represent the additive and multiplicative deviations of sm respectively ε i represents the zero mean random error by performing the difference operation and covariance estimation on eq 1 the error variance of the three datasets can be calculated eq 2 is the formula for the error variance 2 σ ε 1 2 σ x 1 2 σ x 1 x 2 σ x 1 x 3 σ x 2 x 3 3 σ ε 2 2 σ x 2 2 σ x 2 x 1 σ x 2 x 3 σ x 1 x 3 4 σ ε 3 2 σ x 3 2 σ x 3 x 1 σ x 3 x 2 σ x 1 x 2 where σ ε 1 2 σ ε 2 2 and σ ε 3 2 are the random error variances of datasets x 1 x 2 and x 3 respectively σ x 1 2 σ x 1 2 and σ x 1 2 are the variances of datasets x 1 x 2 and x 3 respectively σ x 1 x 2 σ x 1 x 3 and σ x 2 x 3 are the covariances between datasets x 1 and x 2 datasets x 1 and x 3 and datasets x 2 and x 3 respectively 3 2 evaluation metrics the correlation coefficient rmse ubrmse and bias between in situ and sm products are used to assess the sm data in this paper the correlation coefficient reflects the strength of the relationship between in situ sm and satellite sm ranging from 1 to 1 rmse measures the closeness between in situ sm and satellite sm data a smaller rmse value indicates a smaller absolute difference ubrmse measures the rmse that removes the average deviation between satellite sm and in situ sm bias is the average deviation of satellite sm from in situ sm entekhabi et al 2010b bias greater than 0 indicates a wet deviation while less than 0 indicates dry deviation the four metrics correlation coefficient rmse ubrmse and bias are presented in eqs 5 6 7 and 8 respectively 5 r e θ sat e θ sat θ in situ e θ in situ σ sat σ in situ 6 rmse e θ sat θ in situ 2 7 ubrmse e θ sat e θ sat θ in situ e θ in situ 2 8 bias e θ sat e θ in situ where e is mean operator θ in situ represents in situ sm θ sat represents satellite sm σ sat represents the standard deviation of satellite sm and σ in situ represents the standard deviation of the in situ sm 4 result 4 1 product evaluation based on in situ sm since there is a scale difference between in situ measured sm and satellite retrieved sm the heterogeneity of the satellite footprint where the in situ sites are located needs to be evaluated before the validation of sm products based on in situ sm gini simpson index gsi proposed by simpson 1949 and subsequently used in many studies to evaluate satellite footprint heterogeneity chaparro et al 2018 konings et al 2016 ma et al 2019 in this study gsi was introduced to evaluate the heterogeneity of satellite footprints gsi was calculated as eq 9 9 gsi 1 i p i 2 where p i denotes the probability of the pixels belonging to igbp type i as the gsi gets closer to 0 it indicates small heterogeneity in the satellite footprint table 1 shows the latitude longitude igbp type and the gsi of each in situ station table 1 shows the latitude longitude igbp type and the gsi of each in situ station as can be seen in table 1 the satellite footprint of in situ station 53505 has the highest heterogeneity with a gsi of 0 682 indicating more land cover classes and greater variability within this satellite footprint followed by in situ stations 53513 and 53467 with gsi values of 0 539 and 0 513 respectively while the satellite footprint of in situ station 53357 has a lower heterogeneity of 0 009 indicating that there are fewer surface coverage categories and less variability within this satellite footprint however the satellite footprint in which in situ station 53357 is located has a low heterogeneity with a gsi of 0 009 indicating that there are fewer land cover classes and less variation within this satellite footprint fig 2 shows the density scatter plots of gldas smap smos and ascat sm data with in situ sm respectively where the x axis is the measured data and the y axis is the corresponding satellite data the scatter points are the sm observations of the 24 in situ sites with the correspondent sm products four statistical metrics are shown in fig 3 meanwhile fig 3 presents the linear relationship between in situ and satellite sm the correlation between smap and in situ sm is 0 512 slightly higher than the correlation between ascat sm and in situ sm the correlation between ascat and in situ sm is 0 39 gldas sm and in situ sm demonstrate a poor correlation of 0 344 while smos and in situ sm demonstrate a negative correlation of 0 178 smap also has a lower rmse than the other two products at 0 078 m3 m3 furthermore smap has a lower bias of 0 0452 m3 m3 showing a dry deviation gldas has a relatively low ubrmse of 0 059 m3 m3 the rmse bias values between gldas sm and in situ sm are 0 136 m3 m3 and 0 1223 m3 m3 respectively showing a dry bias the rmse bias values between ascat sm and in situ sm are 0 14 m3 m3 and 0 1088 m3 m3 among the four sm products smos performs poorly smos shows a weak correlation with in situ sm as for rmse ubrmse and bias smos sm performance is 0 258 0 192 and 0 1723 m3 m3 respectively the poor performance of smos may be related to the greater impact of rfi in the china region fig 3 demonstrates box plots of the evaluation results based on in situ sites for gldas smap smos and ascat including correlation coefficients rmse ubrmse and bias the statistical analysis in fig 3 provides a more visual representation of the four satellite sm data performance at all in situ sites from the box plot of correlation coefficients the median correlation coefficient of ascat is the highest and the distribution of correlation coefficients is relatively close indicating that ascat performs relatively similarly at all stations the median correlation coefficient of gldas and smap is in the middle level while the median correlation coefficient of smos is the lowest the rmse box plot shows that the median rmse of smap is the lowest the median rmse of gldas is in the middle and the median rmse of smos is the highest the rmse distribution of smap is more concentrated indicating that the rmse performance is more similar at 24 stations the rmse distribution of smos is more dispersed for ubrmse the median ubrmse of gldas is the lowest while the overall distribution is more concentrated ubrmse of smap is in the middle with the median less than 0 05 m3 m3 ubrmse of smos is the highest at around 0 15 m3 m3 and there are more outliers the median bias of smap is close to 0 m3 m3 while the gldas is close to 0 12 m3 m3 the bias of smos is more dispersed with the highest median deviation table 2 shows the specific statistics of the satellite sm at 24 in situ stations and n indicates the number of valid data counted at the in situ stations as shown in table 2 the correlation coefficients of gldas at 24 in situ stations range from 0 142 to 0 798 and the average value of correlation coefficients is 0 566 the gldas shows a poor correlation of 0 142 at the in situ station of 53505 the correlation coefficients of smap at the in situ stations range from 0 404 to 0 827 with a mean value of 0 588 the correlation coefficients of smos at the in situ stations range from 0 694 to 0 408 with a mean value of 0 133 smap shows a better correlation at all in situ stations while smos performs poorly the rmse performance of gldas ranges from 0 067 to 0 207 m3 m3 with an intermediate performance among the four sm products smap performs better in terms of rmse with small absolute differences ranging from 0 037 m3 m3 to 0 124 m3 m3 the rmse of smos ranges from 0 096 to 0 433 m3 m3 which is the worst performance among the four sm data the average rmse values for gldas smap smos and ascat sm products are 0 130 0 070 0 234 and 0 134 m3 m3 respectively for ubrmse performance at each station the mean values for gldas smap smos and ascat are 0 039 0 049 0 147 and 0 070 m3 m3 respectively with gldas performing better the mean values for bias performance at each station for gldas smap smos and ascat are 0 121 m3 m3 0 042 m3 m3 0 160 and 0 108 m3 m3 respectively smap shows a lower bias 4 2 time series performance of sm products fig 4 shows time series plots for in situ sites 50425 50525 50928 and 53357 during the periods of april 1 2018 to september 30 2018 and april 1 2019 to september 30 2019 overall all three sm products capture changes in sm over the time series and have similar variation trends to the observed sm at the in situ station when precipitation occurs there is a significant increase in sm for all three products in particular we can clearly see that smap and gldas are sensitive to in situ sm changes however smos sm has a high deviation from in situ sm which clearly illustrates the difference between smos sm and in situ sm the time series trend of the gldas sm is more consistent with the in situ sm with a wet deviation at the in situ station shown in fig 5 overall the three sm products respond to precipitation and show similar trends to in situ sm smap has a smaller deviation while smos has a larger uncertainty 4 3 the results of triple collocation fig 5 shows the distribution of gldas ascat smap and smos sm error standard deviation results for tc analysis using gldas as the reference dataset fig 5 a c and e show the error standard deviation for gldas smap and ascat sm tc analysis based on gldas smap and ascat respectively fig 5 b d and f show the error standard deviation for gldas smos and ascat sm tc analysis based on gldas smos and ascat the dataset used for the tc analysis covers the period from 2017 to 2020 from april 1 to september 30 of each year the error standard deviation of the northeast part of the study area is blank because when the number of sm triplet samples is less than 100 we prevent this part of data from participating in tc analysis this is due to the coverage capability of smos sm and the use of rfi prob layer for quality control most of the blank area in the northeastern region is covered with forest the western part of the study area is also vacant and most of this area is sandy desert from the comparison between the left and right columns of fig 5 excluding the blank area in the right column of the figure it can be seen that gldas sm has a relatively similar error standard deviation distribution in the left and right columns with a smaller error standard deviation in the central region of the study area ascat sm also has similar error standard deviation distributions in the left and right columns with smaller error standard deviations in most of the central part of the study area and relatively larger error standard deviation in the western part of the study area however the error standard deviation distributions of smos and smap have large differences the error standard deviation of smap is relatively small and only some individual pixels exhibit a large error standard deviation in particular smos sm indicates large error standard deviations in the southern and midwestern parts of the study area while indicates relatively small error standard deviations in the western part of the study area nevertheless smos tc results performed better around 40 n 100e comparing the land cover classification of the study area we found that the area is barren or sparsely vegetated the low vegetation cover may be the reason for the good performance of smos in this area fig 6 a c and e show the histograms of the error standard deviation of gldas smap and ascat sm tc analysis based on gldas smap and ascat respectively fig 6 b d and f show the histograms of the error standard deviation of gldas smos and ascat sm tc analysis based on gldas smos and ascat the left vertical axis shows the probability density calculated by dividing the original number of bins to be displayed by the total number and the width of each bin the right vertical axis shows the cumulative frequency with the final cumulative value of the frequency being 1 pd indicates the probability density and cf indicates the cumulative frequency the maximum minimum and mean values of the error standard deviation are also statistically presented in fig 6 in fig 6 a the maximum error standard deviation of gldas is 0 067 m3 m3 the minimum error standard deviation of gldas is 0 017 m3 m3 and the average error standard deviation of gldas is 0 031 m3 m3 the error standard deviation of the cumulative frequency curve of gldas less than 0 045 m3 m3 is close to 1 while in fig 6 b the maximum error standard deviation of gldas is 0 056 m3 m3 the minimum error standard deviation of gldas is 0 008 m3 m3 as for the statistical results of smap in fig 6 c the maximum minimum and mean error standard deviations of smap are 0 05 0 01 and 0 027 m3 m3 respectively in addition the majority of the smap error standard deviations are less than 0 03 m3 m3 the cumulative frequency curve of smap shows that the error standard deviation of less than 0 04 m3 m3 is close to 1 in fig 6 d the maximum error standard deviation of smos is 0 093 m3 m3 the minimum error standard deviation is 0 015 m3 m3 and the average error standard deviation is 0 05 m3 m3 fig 6 d also reveals that most smos error standard deviations are greater than 0 04 m3 m3 meanwhile from the cumulative frequency curve of smos we can see that the standard deviation of errors less than 0 08 m3 m3 is close to 1 in conclusion the standard deviation of smos errors is relatively large 5 discussions 5 1 impact of land cover on sm satellite retrieved sm is impacted by several factors this section focuses on the impact of different land cover conditions on the error standard deviation fig 7 shows the box plots smap and smos of tc results for different land covers the land cover types are classified based on igbp the horizontal axis in fig 7 represents the modis igbp type and the vertical axis shows the standard error values for the different products the number of pixels with land cover type igbp 3 5 6 7 deciduous needleleaf forest mixed forest closed shrubland open shrubland is small and box plots cannot effectively count such random errors therefore we will not discuss these land cover types here the standard deviations of smos sm are larger under different land covers while the standard deviations of smap sm are relatively small as shown in fig 1 igbp 10 grasslands and igbp 16 barren or sparsely vegetated are the two land cover types that occupy the largest area of the study area smap and smos sm also perform very differently in these two land cover types the median error standard deviation of smap at igbp 16 is lower than the median error standard deviation of igbp 10 indicating that smap performs better at igbp 16 the median standard error of smap sm at igbp 10 is about 0 025 and the standard error of smap is more concentrated the median error standard deviation of smos in igbp 10 is around 0 05 which is worse than smap in the performance of the land cover igbp 16 the median standard deviation of smap sm is about 0 025 while the median deviation of smos is at 0 04 which also performs worse than smap sm in the smap sm retrieval algorithm the effective scattering albedo is based on vegetation type and is considered to be equal to 0 05 in most land cover mohsen et al 2018 however the effective scattering albedo is different for different land cover improving the estimation accuracy of effective scattering albedo will be helpful for improving the estimation accuracy of smap sm at present the smap algorithm uses an empirical model to convert the normalized difference vegetation index into the vegetation water content to calculate the vegetation optical depth however the normalized difference vegetation index is prone to saturation sellers 1985 which also reduces the sensitivity of the vegetation water content the smos sm retrieval algorithm avoids the empirical estimation method of vegetation optical depth and does not depend on the type of land cover 5 2 impact of rfi on remote sensing sm retrieval rfi can affect the accuracy of satellite retrieval of sm fig 8 shows the average probability of rfi in the study area for 2017 2020 calculated by averaging the rfi prob layer data using the smos products for 2017 2020 the darker the blue color in the graph the higher the probability of having rfi we can see clearly that the blue color is darker around 50 n 117 e figs 5 and 8 show that smos sm has higher random errors than smap and gldas sm products in regions with high rfi probability simultaneously the study area near 43 n 119 e also has a higher probability of rfi the random error value of smos in this region is 0 8 m3 m3 which is close to the maximum value of random error while smap is not significantly affected in this region the influence of rfi on remote sensing sm retrieval in the china region has been discussed in many studies burgin et al 2017 chen et al 2018 parinussa et al 2017 the smos team has developed algorithms to detect rfi soldo et al 2017 and thus improve the accuracy of sm estimation smap reduces the impact of rfi by multidomain approach to rfi mitigation piepmeier et al 2014 which is evident from the comparison with smos in brief the smap random error distribution is very different from the average probability of rfi the region with a higher average probability of rfi will also have a higher random error in smos since the accuracy of remotely sensed sm is influenced by factors such as vegetation cover soil texture rfi and surface temperature deng et al 2019 liu et al 2021 the reasons for the high smos random errors need further discussion 6 conclusions using gldas as reference data this paper analyzes the error performance of smap and smos sm data in inner mongolia by using the tc method meanwhile the correlation coefficients rmse ubrmse and bias between in situ data and gldas smap smos and ascat are calculated based on the collected data from 24 in situ stations the validation results based on in situ data indicate that smap data have a better correlation in the inner mongolia region and are sensitive to sm changes for the performance of bias and rmse smap performs best ubrmse of gldas is the lowest in comparison smos has a poor performance in this region with the weakest correlation with in situ data meanwhile the bias rmse and ubrmse are also higher which may be related to the fact that smos is more severely affected by rfi the tc analysis shows consistent results performance with the validation based on in situ data the tc analysis experiments indicate that the overall error of smap is smaller compared with smos in terms of the cumulative frequency of errors most of the random errors in smap are less than 0 04 m3 m3 however the probability of greater than 0 04 in smos sm products was above 80 with a larger deviation in the study area in the random error analysis for different land cover conditions smap performs better in grasslands and barren or sparsely vegetated than gldas and smos and is more suitable for sm monitoring in grassland and low vegetation cover areas like inner mongolia for regions with a higher probability of rfi the smos sm products also have a higher error and show a more consistent correlation the smos team reduces the impact of rfi by preventing rfi affected pixels from retrieving sm although the corresponding rfi detection algorithm has been developed the smos sm product has a high random error in the china region which is more severely affected by rfi smos also shows significant bias and low correlation in in situ data validation further algorithm improvements are needed to suppress the influence of rfi to improve the overall precision of smos sm estimation since the accuracy of sm retrieved by remote sensing is affected by surface roughness soil texture and other related factors this paper only discusses surface cover and rfi in future works we will discuss the impact of other potential factors on the accuracy of remotely sensed sm credit authorship contribution statement fengmin hu conceptualization writing original draft software zushuai wei methodology validation xining yang validation wenjun xie investigation

8036,soil moisture sm is an indispensable variable in drought monitoring and weather forecast l band is found to be the most suitable band for retrieving surface sm here we evaluate two l band passive microwave sm products soil moisture active and passive smap and soil moisture and ocean salinity smos in inner mongolia the collected in situ data from 24 measured sites and the triple collocation tc analysis method using global land data assimilation system gldas noah and the advanced scatterometer ascat sm data as a reference dataset are used to evaluate smap and smos sm products in the validation based on in situ sm smap shows the highest correlation with the in situ sm followed by gldas and smos the root mean square error rmse and bias value of smap is the lowest the validation results of each in situ station show that the median correlation coefficient of ascat is the highest followed by smap gldas and smos the median rmse and bias of smap are the lowest while smos performs the worst among the three products tc analysis results show that smap has better performance with the majority of the random errors distributed between 0 02 and 0 03 m3 m3 the average random error of smap is small while smos has relatively large random errors simultaneously smap performs better than gldas and smos in grassland and low vegetation coverage areas the research results and analysis of this paper are expected to provide some insights for improving the quality of sm products keywords triple collocation smap smos soil moisture 1 introduction in the global water cycle soil moisture sm influences multiple hydrological processes such as infiltration runoff and evaporation santi et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 for hydrological and climate models sm is also an important input parameter kim

resolution compared to remote sensing data from optical sensors however microwave remote sensing can directly measure the dielectric contrast between dry soil and liquid water regardless of weather conditions sabaghy et al 2018 making it possible to monitor sm in a large area in particular l band radiometry is considered an effective method for monitoring sm zhao et al 2020 generally passive microwave sm products are assessed through the core dense or sparse sm monitoring network nevertheless most in situ monitoring stations are located in north america and europe and cannot cover the whole world well brocca et al 2011 assessed the reliability of ascat and amsr products in europe based on in situ sites beck et al 2021 evaluated 18 satellite based or model based sm products using

physical models statistical models and in situ observations ma et al 2017 evaluated the smap active products passive products and active passive combined products over the heihe river basin china in general sm products are validated mainly in developed regions and hotspots with well established in situ monitoring networks draper et al 2009 oozeer et al 2020 while the sparse in situ observations areas are rarely validated furthermore the assessment of sm products based on in situ observation also has some limitations the scales of the in situ measured sm and the satellite retrieved sm data do not match the sm retrieved by satellites usually represents a range of several kilometers to tens of kilometers while in situ site measurements typically represent several square meters of sm near the site these differences introduce some representative errors into the verification and evaluation of sm products xu et al 2021 thereby increasing the difficulty of validation the triple collocation tc method is a statistical method first proposed for error estimation of near surface wind speed products stoffelen 1998 then it is used to calculate the errors of several geophysical quantities including precipitation lai etc fang et al 2012 lu et al 2021 lyu et al 2021 wu et al 2019 it is suitable for estimating the random error variance of three mutually independent data sets in the absence or lack of in situ data as one of the essential methods to evaluate the accuracy of geophysical parameters tc analytical method has been used to evaluate several geophysical parameters including sm pierdicca et al 2015 analyzed sm of ascat and smos in europe and north africa by tc method in the latest study wu et al 2021 evaluated the error characteristics of smap and ascat sm using the tc method mousa and shu 2020 evaluated the error patterns of satellites sm products via the tc method inner mongolia is situated in the inland of china far away from the sea with low and uneven rainfall sm monitoring is essential for drought monitoring and agricultural management in this region however sm products are not well evaluated in inner mongolia due to the lack of in situ monitoring sites the research objective of this paper is to use in situ data from 24 sparse monitoring sites and other auxiliary data to evaluate the performance of smap and smos sm products over inner mongolia four evaluation metrics were calculated between the satellite sm and in situ data furthermore random error distributions of smap and smos were analyzed based on the tc method finally this paper analyzed the performance of sm products under different land coverage scenarios and the impact of radio frequency interference rfi on satellite sm products the remaining sections are organized as follows section 2 describes the data used in this paper including sm products in situ data and other ancillary data along with a further description of the study area section 3 focuses on the sm evaluation methods used in this paper sections 4 and 5 present the sm evaluation results and related discussions respectively the conclusion is presented in section 6 2 data and study area descriptions 2 1 remote sensing soil moisture data the smap satellite designed to monitor surface sm and freeze thaw conditions was launched by nasa in 2015 it carries both an l band radiometer and an l band radar and the frequency of the center band is 1 41 ghz the radar ceased operation in july 2015 since then smap only provides sm products retrieved by an l band radiometer currently the single channel algorithm using the vertically polarized brightness temperature is the baseline algorithm for smap to estimate sm spl3smp is a smap level 3 passive microwave sm product with a spatial resolution of 36 km and projection coordinates of ease grid 2 0 brodzik et al 2012 the spl3smp products include the 6 00 a m descending orbit product and the 6 00 p m ascending orbit product in this study we choose the descending orbit spl3smp product version 7 for validation spl3smp is available from https nsidc org data spl3smp versions 7 during the frozen season there is uncertainty in satellite retrieval of sm hu et al 2020 liu et al 2019 wei et al 2019 seasonal frozen soil in inner mongolia occurs from october to april during march to april of each year the frozen soil begins to thaw beck et al 2021 gan et al 2012 liu et al 2015 zhao et al 2011 therefore in this paper we use sm data from april to september for each year between 2017 and 2020 for analysis the smos satellite carrying an l band radiometer is dedicated to the global observation of sm and ocean salinity it was launched by esa in november 2009 data products have been accumulated for almost 12 years now smos l3 products including barcelona expert center bec products and centre aval de traitement des données catds products are available through the bec http bec icm csic es data available products and catds smos https www catds fr the temporal resolution of the catds products is 2 3 days the spatial resolution is 25 km and the projection is ease grid 2 0 meanwhile catds sm products include the 6 00 a m ascending orbit product and the 6 00 p m descending orbit product the smos mission relies on the l band microwave emission of biosphere l meb model to retrieve sm in this paper we analyze the smos ascending orbit product version 3 which are available at ftp ftp ifremer fr to align the smos and smap satellite spatial resolutions we resample the smos sm products using a bilinear interpolation method to obtain a dataset that matches the smap spatial resolution the smos sm retrieval is affected by rfi so we use rfi prob layer to quality control smos sm and remove sm with rfi probability greater than 0 3 al yaari et al 2014 the european space agency s climate change initiative esa cci aims to monitor essential climate variables globally and has been releasing sm products since 2012 esa cci sm consists of three harmonised products including the active sm product the passive sm product and the combined active and passive sm product dorigo et al 2017 which are available for download through the climate data dashboard of the esa cci website https climate esa int en odp project soil moisture in this paper to form the triplet of the tc method the active product version 06 1 will be used for experiments the active product derived from the instruments ami ws and ascat covers the period august 05 1991 to december 31 2020 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 degrees the units of active sm products need to be converted since the percentage of saturation is different from the volumetric water content m3 m3 of smap and smos sm with the soil porosity data obtained from harmonized world soil database the units of active sm products can be converted to soil volumetric water content al yaari et al 2019 peng et al 2021 2 2 model simulated soil moisture data gldas version 2 1 gldas 2 1 is a global data assimilation system and drives multiple land surface models using gldas 2 1 we can obtain land surface state and flux parameters and apply them in relevant studies the gldas 2 1 noah model is one of the land surface models providing sm products with a temporal resolution of 3 h and a spatial resolution of 0 25 degree the sm is measured at four depths 0 10 cm 10 40 cm 40 100 cm and 100 200 cm gldas 2 1 sm products perform better and have wide applications in the existing evaluation of sm products based on tc methods gldas 2 1 sm is more often used as a reference dataset gruber et al 2016a kolassa et al 2017 wu et al 2021 in this paper we use 0 10 cm gldas 2 1 sm data for triple collocation analysis the units of gldas 2 1 noah sm data kg m2 do not correspond to the units of satellite sm products m3 m3 here we can convert the units of gldas 2 1 noah sm to soil volumetric water content by the method in liu et al 2021 the smap and smos sm data evaluated in this paper are recorded through local time while the gldas 2 1 noah sm product is recorded through utc the local time in the study area at 6 00 a m is utc 8 therefore we selected the gldas 2 1 data from the study area at 21 00 the previous day as the reference data set for the experiment during processing gldas 2 1 data were available at https disc gsfc nasa gov datasets keywords gldas 2 3 in situ data in situ observation sm was available from the china meteorological administration in this paper we collected 24 in situ monitoring stations in the study area sm at 10 20 40 cm depth was measured by the in situ sites at 8 00 a m and 3 00 p m each day and the soil volumetric water content was determined based on the principle of time domain reflectometer sun et al 2017 in this paper in situ sm data at 10 cm depth were used to validate the smap and smos sm products 2 4 auxiliary data in this paper we also used some auxiliary data to evaluate the performance of smap and smos sm from different perspectives including precipitation data huffman et al 2019 and land cover data friedl et al 2010 to validate the sm products precipitation data gpm 3imergdf were used to validate the response of sm products when precipitation occurred land cover data mcd12q1 were used to discuss the performance of sm products under different land cover classifications the gpm 3imergdf product has a spatial resolution of 0 1 degree and a temporal resolution of daily obtained from the nasa goddard earth sciences ges data and information services center disc mcd12q1 is an annual product available from https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov search with a spatial resolution of 500 m the land cover was classified using the igbp global vegetation classification scheme as described in sulla menashe and friedl 2018 2 5 study area inner mongolia is located in the mid latitudes of northern china most of the study area is a plateau except for the south eastern part the elevation of the south eastern part is below 400 m and most of the remaining parts have an elevation of about 1000 1500 m the study area has a predominantly temperate continental climate far from the ocean with low and uneven rainfall precipitation occurs mainly in summer and is influenced by topography and distance from the sea the annual precipitation shows a decreasing trend from northeast to southwest while the evaporation is the opposite from the eastern to the western regions the study area gradually changes from humid and semi humid areas to semi arid and arid areas fig 1 shows the geographic scope of the study area and the distribution of the 24 in situ sites the elevation data used in fig 1 are srtm elevation data rabus et al 2003 land cover classification of inner mongolia is classified by igbp global vegetation classification scheme 3 method 3 1 triple collocation tc is one of the most critical evaluation methods in earth observation to estimate the random error variance of geophysical variables usually tc analysis requires three mutually independent datasets and does not require the reference dataset to have high data quality gruber et al 2016b here we use four sm datasets smap smos gldas and ascat for tc analysis in existing researches gldas sm products have been used as a reference dataset for tc analysis gruber et al 2017 wu et al 2021 therefore we also choose gldas as the reference dataset for tc analysis the sm triplet sample must be at least greater than 100 since the revisit interval of 2 3 days for satellites the number of triplet samples may not meet the requirement to make the tc analysis results more reliable when the number of sm triplet samples involved in the calculation is less than 100 we remove this part of the data for tc analysis the tc method is based on the following assumptions linear correlation between observed and true values zero error intercorrelation between data sets independence of errors in each data set no correlation between errors and true values signal and error smoothness eq 1 is the mathematical expression of the tc method 1 x i α i β i t ε i where i 1 2 3 x 1 x 2 x 3 are three independent sm data sets t represents the true value of sm α i and β i represent the additive and multiplicative deviations of sm respectively ε i represents the zero mean random error by performing the difference operation and covariance estimation on eq 1 the error variance of the three datasets can be calculated eq 2 is the formula for the error variance 2 σ ε 1 2 σ x 1 2 σ x 1 x 2 σ x 1 x 3 σ x 2 x 3 3 σ ε 2 2 σ x 2 2 σ x 2 x 1 σ x 2 x 3 σ x 1 x 3 4 σ ε 3 2 σ x 3 2 σ x 3 x 1 σ x 3 x 2 σ x 1 x 2 where σ ε 1 2 σ ε 2 2 and σ ε 3 2 are the random error variances of datasets x 1 x 2 and x 3 respectively σ x 1 2 σ x 1 2 and σ x 1 2 are the variances of datasets x 1 x 2 and x 3 respectively σ x 1 x 2 σ x 1 x 3 and σ x 2 x 3 are the covariances between datasets x 1 and x 2 datasets x 1 and x 3 and datasets x 2 and x 3 respectively 3 2 evaluation metrics the correlation coefficient rmse ubrmse and bias between in situ and sm products are used to assess the sm data in this paper the correlation coefficient reflects the strength of the relationship between in situ sm and satellite sm ranging from 1 to 1 rmse measures the closeness between in situ sm and satellite sm data a smaller rmse value indicates a smaller absolute difference ubrmse measures the rmse that removes the average deviation between satellite sm and in situ sm bias is the average deviation of satellite sm from in situ sm

result 4 1 product evaluation based on in situ sm since there is a scale difference between in situ measured sm and satellite retrieved sm the heterogeneity of the satellite footprint where the in situ sites are located needs to be evaluated before the validation of sm products based on in situ sm gini simpson index gsi proposed by simpson 1949 and subsequently used in many studies to evaluate satellite footprint heterogeneity chaparro et al 2018 konings et al 2016 ma et al 2019 in this study gsi was introduced to evaluate the heterogeneity of satellite footprints gsi was calculated as eq 9 9 gsi 1 i p i 2 where p i denotes the probability of the pixels belonging to igbp type i as the gsi gets closer to 0 it indicates small heterogeneity in the satellite footprint table 1 shows the latitude longitude igbp type and the gsi of each in situ station table 1 shows the latitude longitude igbp type and the gsi of each in situ station as can be seen in table 1 the satellite footprint of in situ station 53505 has the highest heterogeneity with a gsi of 0 682 indicating more land cover classes and greater variability within this satellite footprint followed by in situ stations 53513 and 53467 with gsi values of 0 539 and 0 513 respectively while the satellite footprint of in situ station 53357 has a lower heterogeneity of 0 009 indicating that there are fewer surface coverage categories and less variability within this satellite footprint however the satellite footprint in which in situ station 53357 is located has a low heterogeneity with a gsi of 0 009 indicating that there are fewer land cover classes and less variation within this satellite footprint fig 2 shows the density scatter plots of gldas smap smos and ascat sm data with in situ sm respectively where the x axis is the measured data and the y axis is the corresponding satellite data the scatter points are the sm observations of the 24 in situ sites with the correspondent sm products four statistical metrics are shown in fig 3 meanwhile fig 3 presents the linear relationship between in situ and satellite sm the correlation between smap and in situ sm is 0 512 slightly higher than the correlation between ascat sm and in situ sm the correlation between ascat and in situ sm is 0 39 gldas sm and in situ sm demonstrate a poor correlation of 0 344 while smos and in situ sm demonstrate a negative correlation of 0 178 smap also has a lower rmse than the other two products at 0 078 m3 m3 furthermore smap has a lower bias of 0 0452 m3 m3 showing a dry deviation gldas has a relatively low ubrmse of 0 059 m3 m3 the rmse bias values between gldas sm and in situ sm are 0 136 m3 m3 and 0 1223 m3 m3 respectively showing a dry bias the rmse bias values between ascat sm and in situ sm are 0 14 m3 m3 and 0 1088 m3 m3 among the four sm products smos performs poorly smos shows a weak correlation with in situ sm as for rmse ubrmse and bias smos sm performance is 0 258 0 192 and 0 1723 m3 m3 respectively the poor performance of smos may be related to the greater impact of rfi in the china region fig 3 demonstrates box plots of the evaluation results based on in situ sites for gldas smap smos and ascat including correlation coefficients rmse ubrmse and bias the statistical analysis in fig 3 provides a more visual representation of the four satellite sm data performance at all in situ sites from the box plot of correlation coefficients the median correlation coefficient of ascat is the highest and the distribution of correlation coefficients is relatively close indicating that ascat performs relatively similarly at all stations the median correlation coefficient of gldas and smap is in the middle level while the median correlation coefficient of smos is the lowest the rmse box plot shows that the median rmse of smap is the lowest the median rmse of gldas is in the middle and the median rmse of smos is the highest the rmse distribution of smap is more concentrated indicating that the rmse performance is more similar at 24 stations the rmse distribution of smos is more dispersed for ubrmse the median ubrmse of gldas is the lowest while the overall distribution is more concentrated ubrmse of smap is in the middle with the median less than 0 05 m3 m3 ubrmse of smos is the highest at around 0 15 m3 m3 and there are more outliers the median bias of smap is close to 0 m3 m3 while the gldas is close to 0 12 m3 m3 the bias of smos is more dispersed with the highest median deviation table 2 shows the specific statistics of the satellite sm at 24 in situ stations and n indicates the number of valid data counted at the in situ stations as shown in table 2 the correlation coefficients of gldas at 24 in situ stations range from 0 142 to 0 798 and the average value of correlation coefficients is 0 566 the gldas shows a poor correlation of 0 142 at the in situ station of 53505 the correlation coefficients of smap at the in situ stations range from 0 404 to 0 827 with a mean value of 0 588 the correlation coefficients of smos at the in situ stations range from 0 694 to 0 408 with a mean value of 0 133 smap shows a better correlation at all in situ stations while smos performs poorly the rmse performance of gldas ranges from 0 067 to 0 207 m3 m3 with an intermediate performance among the four sm products smap performs better in terms of rmse with small absolute differences ranging from 0 037 m3 m3 to 0 124 m3 m3 the rmse of smos ranges from 0 096 to 0 433 m3 m3 which is the worst performance among the four sm data the average rmse values for gldas smap smos and ascat sm products are 0 130 0 070 0 234 and 0 134 m3 m3 respectively for ubrmse performance at each station the mean values for gldas smap smos and ascat are 0 039 0 049 0 147 and 0 070 m3 m3 respectively with gldas performing better the mean values for bias performance at each station for gldas smap smos and ascat are 0 121 m3 m3 0 042 m3 m3 0 160 and 0 108 m3 m3 respectively smap shows a lower bias 4 2 time series performance of sm products fig 4 shows time series plots for in situ sites 50425 50525 50928 and 53357 during the periods of april 1 2018 to september 30 2018 and april 1 2019 to september 30 2019 overall all three sm products capture changes in sm over the time series and have similar variation trends to the observed sm at the in situ station when precipitation occurs there is a significant increase in sm for all three products in particular we can clearly see that smap and gldas are sensitive to in situ sm changes however smos sm has a high deviation from in situ sm which clearly illustrates the difference between smos sm and in situ sm the time series trend of the gldas sm is more consistent with the in situ sm with a wet deviation at the in situ station shown in fig 5 overall the three sm products respond to precipitation and show similar trends to in situ sm smap has a smaller deviation while smos has a larger uncertainty 4 3 the results of triple collocation fig 5 shows the distribution of gldas ascat smap and smos sm error standard deviation results for tc analysis using gldas as the reference dataset fig 5 a c and e show the error standard deviation for gldas smap and ascat sm tc analysis based on gldas smap and ascat respectively fig 5 b d and f show the error standard deviation for gldas smos and ascat sm tc analysis based on gldas smos and ascat the dataset used for the tc analysis covers the period from 2017 to 2020 from april 1 to september 30 of each year the error standard deviation of the northeast part of the study area is blank because when the number of sm triplet samples is less than 100 we prevent this part of data from participating in tc analysis this is due to the coverage capability of smos sm and the use of rfi prob layer for quality control most of the blank area in the northeastern region is covered with forest the western part of the study area is also vacant and most of this area is sandy desert from the comparison between the left and right columns of fig 5 excluding the blank area in the right column of the figure it can be seen that gldas sm has a relatively similar error standard deviation distribution in the left and right columns with a smaller error standard deviation in the central region of the study area ascat sm also has similar error standard deviation distributions in the left and right columns with smaller error standard deviations in most of the central part of the study area and relatively larger error standard deviation in the western part of the study area however the error standard deviation distributions of smos and smap have large differences the error standard deviation of smap is relatively small and only some individual pixels exhibit a large error standard deviation in particular smos sm indicates large error standard deviations in the southern and midwestern parts of the study area while indicates relatively small error standard deviations in the western part of the study area nevertheless smos tc results performed better around 40 n 100e comparing the land cover classification of the study area we found that the area is barren or sparsely vegetated the low vegetation cover may be the reason for the good performance of smos in this area fig 6 a c and e show the histograms of the error standard deviation of gldas smap and ascat sm tc analysis based on gldas smap and ascat respectively fig 6 b d and f show the histograms of the error standard deviation of gldas smos and ascat sm tc analysis based on gldas smos and ascat the left vertical axis shows the probability density calculated by dividing the original number of bins to be displayed by the total number and the width of each bin the right vertical axis shows the cumulative frequency with the final cumulative value of the frequency being 1 pd indicates the probability density and cf indicates the cumulative frequency the maximum minimum and mean values of the error standard deviation are also statistically presented in fig 6 in fig 6 a the maximum error standard deviation of gldas is 0 067 m3 m3 the minimum error standard deviation of gldas is 0 017 m3 m3 and the average error standard deviation of gldas is 0 031 m3 m3 the error standard deviation of the cumulative frequency curve of gldas less than 0 045 m3 m3 is close to 1 while in fig 6 b the maximum error standard deviation of gldas is 0 056 m3 m3 the minimum error standard deviation of gldas is 0 008 m3 m3 as for the statistical results of smap in fig 6 c the maximum minimum and mean error standard deviations of smap are 0 05 0 01 and 0 027 m3 m3 respectively in addition the majority of the smap error standard deviations are less than 0 03 m3 m3 the cumulative frequency curve of smap shows that the error standard deviation of less than 0 04 m3 m3 is close to 1 in fig 6 d the maximum error standard deviation of smos is 0 093 m3 m3 the minimum error standard deviation is 0 015 m3 m3 and the average error standard deviation is 0 05 m3 m3 fig 6 d also reveals that most smos error standard deviations are greater than 0 04 m3 m3 meanwhile from the cumulative frequency curve of smos we can see that the standard deviation of errors less than 0 08 m3 m3 is close to 1 in conclusion the standard deviation of smos errors is relatively large 5 discussions 5 1 impact of land cover on sm satellite retrieved sm is impacted by several factors this section focuses on the impact of different land cover conditions on the error standard deviation fig 7 shows the box plots smap and smos of tc results for different land covers the land cover types are classified based on igbp the horizontal axis in fig 7 represents the modis igbp type and the vertical axis shows the standard error values for the different products the number of pixels with land cover type igbp 3 5 6 7 deciduous needleleaf forest mixed forest closed shrubland open shrubland is small and box plots cannot effectively count such random errors therefore we will not discuss these land cover types here the standard deviations of smos sm are larger under different land covers while the standard deviations of smap sm are relatively small as shown in fig 1 igbp 10 grasslands and igbp 16 barren or sparsely vegetated are the two land cover types that occupy the largest area of the study area smap and smos sm also perform very differently in these two land cover types the median error standard deviation of smap at igbp 16 is lower than the median error standard deviation of igbp 10 indicating that smap performs better at igbp 16 the median standard error of smap sm at igbp 10 is about 0 025 and the standard error of smap is more concentrated the median error standard deviation of smos in igbp 10 is around 0 05 which is worse than smap in the performance of the land cover igbp 16 the median standard deviation of smap sm is about 0 025 while the median deviation of smos is at 0 04 which also performs worse than smap sm in the smap sm retrieval algorithm the effective scattering albedo is based on vegetation type and is considered to be equal to 0 05 in most land cover mohsen et al 2018 however the effective scattering albedo is different for different land cover improving the estimation accuracy of effective scattering albedo will be helpful for improving the estimation accuracy of smap sm at present the smap algorithm uses an empirical model to convert the normalized difference vegetation index into the vegetation water content to calculate the vegetation optical depth however the normalized difference vegetation index is prone to saturation sellers 1985 which also reduces the sensitivity of the vegetation water content the smos sm retrieval algorithm avoids the empirical estimation method of vegetation optical depth and does not depend on the type of land cover 5 2 impact of rfi on remote sensing sm retrieval rfi can affect the accuracy of satellite retrieval of sm fig 8 shows the average probability of rfi in the study area for 2017 2020 calculated by averaging the rfi prob layer data using the smos products for 2017 2020 the darker the blue color in the graph the higher the probability of having rfi we can see clearly that the blue color is darker around 50 n 117 e figs 5 and 8 show that smos sm has higher random errors than smap and gldas sm products in regions with high rfi probability simultaneously the study area near 43 n 119 e also has a higher probability of rfi the random error value of smos in this region is 0 8 m3 m3 which is close to the maximum value of random error while smap is not significantly affected in this region the influence of rfi on remote sensing sm retrieval in the china region has been discussed in many studies burgin et al 2017 chen et al 2018 parinussa et al 2017 the smos team has developed algorithms to detect rfi soldo et al 2017 and thus improve the accuracy of sm estimation smap reduces the impact of rfi by multidomain approach to rfi mitigation piepmeier et al 2014 which is evident from the comparison with smos in brief the smap random error distribution is very different from the average probability of rfi the region with a higher average probability of rfi will also have a higher random error in smos since the accuracy of remotely sensed sm is influenced by factors such as vegetation cover soil texture rfi and surface temperature deng et al 2019 liu et al 2021 the reasons for the high smos random errors need further discussion 6 conclusions using gldas as reference data this paper analyzes the error performance of smap and smos sm data in inner mongolia by using the tc method meanwhile the correlation coefficients rmse ubrmse and bias between in situ data and gldas smap smos and ascat are calculated based on the collected data from 24 in situ stations the validation results based on in situ data indicate that smap data have a better correlation in the inner mongolia region and are sensitive to sm changes for the performance of bias and rmse smap performs best ubrmse of gldas is the lowest in comparison smos has a poor performance in this region with the weakest correlation with in situ data meanwhile the bias rmse and ubrmse are also higher which may be related to the fact that smos is more severely affected by rfi the tc analysis shows consistent results performance with the validation based on in situ data the tc analysis experiments indicate that the overall error of smap is smaller compared with smos in terms of the cumulative frequency of errors most of the random errors in smap are less than 0 04 m3 m3 however the probability of greater than 0 04 in smos sm products was above 80 with a larger deviation in the study area in the random error analysis for different land cover conditions smap performs better in grasslands and barren or sparsely vegetated than gldas and smos and is more suitable for sm monitoring in grassland and low vegetation cover areas like inner mongolia for regions with a higher probability of rfi the smos sm products also have a higher error and show a more consistent correlation the smos team reduces the impact of rfi by preventing rfi affected pixels from retrieving sm although the corresponding rfi detection algorithm has been developed the smos sm product has a high random error in the china region which is more severely affected by rfi smos also shows significant bias and low correlation in in situ data validation further algorithm improvements are needed to suppress the influence of rfi to improve the overall precision of smos sm estimation since the accuracy of sm retrieved by remote sensing is affected by surface roughness soil texture and other related factors this paper only discusses surface cover and rfi in future works we will discuss the impact of other potential factors on the accuracy of remotely sensed sm credit authorship contribution statement fengmin hu conceptualization writing original draft software zushuai wei methodology validation xining yang validation wenjun xie investigation

8037,study region the yangtze river basin china study focus in this study a large scale coupled model of hydrological and hydrodynamic processes was developed via the distributed time variant gain model and the hydrodynamics operation coupled model two scenarios including operated by the three gorges dam tgd and natural condition hypothesis without the reservoir construction were analyzed based on the coupled model to investigate the effects of tgd operation on the streamflow from 1970 to 2018 new hydrological insights results exhibited that the annual average relative deviation of flow operated by the tgd was approximately 24 compared with the natural state at yichang while the value of chenglingji hankou hukou and datong were 8 5 12 8 during water supply period the tgd operation increase the streamflow by 33 at yichang and the streamflow in downstream can gain about 6 17 for impounding process except hukou the others showed a decreasing trend and the reduction ranged from about 7 20 for flood season the dam operation mainly intercepts high flood peaks while the average streamflow changes a little the high flood peaks at yichang can be reduced by 20 and the changes of high flood peaks in downstream reduce to no more than 10 due to the influence of interval inflow the deviations during drawdown period are almost below 10 keywords coupling of hydrologic and hydrodynamic processes three gorges reservoir area mid lower reach of yangtze river flow regime 1 introduction with the intensification of global climate change and the impact of human activities the water safety issues are becoming more diverse and complex the yangtze river basin with a population exceeding 400 million and produces 25 of its gross domestic product needs to be more cautious about water security in a complex environment chen et al 2016 the core of water problems in the yangtze river basin is to understand the water system theory which contains various intricate processes linked by water circulation piao et al 2010 as such it has attracted considerable attention in the literature for example wang et al 2017 2020 wei et al 2014 zhou et al 2014 the purpose of these studies is to clarify the variations in the water circulation under intensive dam building economic development etc through different methods integrated simulation of river basin water system is an important method for the scientific understanding of water circulation and its accompanying processes and it can provide effective support for managers to supervise environmental change the sustainable development of human society and the natural environment etc wang et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 for the river basin modeling hydrological hydrodynamic processes simulation is the basic tool to reveal the characteristics of water circulation from land to water body fleischmann et al 2018 liu et al 2019 distributed hydrological models mainly simulate hydrological processes such as runoff generation water flow and their spatiotemporal distribution in river basin these models are often highly efficient which can quickly respond and calculate the change features of key elements of river basin water circulation cai et al 2014 however in terms of river simulation the hydrological models generally focus on the flow process of the subbasin or the outlet of river basin and cannot provide the hydraulic characteristics at a specific location the river hydrodynamic model is solved by a system of kinetic equations describing the motion laws of the non constant asymptotic water flow and more details such as flow discharge and velocity can be obtained through the model calculation ming et al 2020 nevertheless hydrodynamic models generally have low computational efficiency especially when the simulation range is large and their calculated complexity often increases in multiples li et al 2018 therefore when conducting large scale river basin simulation the advantages of hydrologic and hydrodynamic models should be fully considered for example hydrological model is used in ordinary regions while hydrodynamic simulation in the key areas can effectively realize the needs of computational efficiency and simulation elements zhang et al 2019 typically when both natural watersheds and urban areas are included in the study areas the natural watersheds are calculated by hydrological models generally while the urban areas adopt hydrodynamic models to obtain more accurate information about water depth and inundation range cheng et al 2020 at present a mature approach in hydrological and hydrodynamic modeling is unidirectional coupling which means the runoff generation and confluence are performed using hydrological models on the sub basin and the simulation results are then transmitted to hydrodynamic models for further coupling simulation wu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 many progresses have been made in large scale river basin hydrological hydrodynamic coupling simulations paiva et al 2013 provided a coupled model of amazon river basin which constructed by the mgb iph model with a validation using remotely sensed observations their findings showed that for large scale watershed simulation the input data and estimation of some important model parameters have a significant impact on the accuracy of simulation results hoch et al 2017 proposed a one directionally framework glofrim for integrated hydrological and hydrodynamic modeling within this framework the other hydrological and hydrodynamic models can be added freely to complete the 1d and or 2d calculation requirements patel et al 2017 lopes et al 2018 and munar et al 2018 also proved that large river lagoon systems could be formulated with integrated modeling and the simulation correctly reflected the influence of the wind and interval inflow moreover for the impacts of climate change human activities e g reservoirs operation and land use changes on the river hydrological conditions the hydrological hydrodynamic coupled model can deal with these issues more effectively guse et al 2015 mentzafou et al 2017 when a model has been calibrated with records various hypothetical scenarios which are defined by different model parameters could be set up and simulated the feasibility of considering the relevance of predicted environmental change for eco hydrology hydrodynamics agricultural irrigation demands water resources supply etc has been demonstrated by many investigators with hydrological hydrodynamic integrated simulation schuchert et al 2018 the three gorges dam tgd located in the upstream of the yangtze river in china has the largest installed capacity in the world fang et al 2012 under the dam operation great social and economic benefits of flood control and power generation have been achieved while it does affect the hydrological conditions of the main stream many studies have tried to reveal the changes in hydrological characteristics after the construction of the tgd chen et al 2016 analyzed trend in precipitation and flow of the yangtze river at the monthly time scale from 1955 to 2014 and found that the feature of monthly flow obvious changes which is directly related to the completion of the tgd su et al 2019 added that the streamflow variability is also strongly related to rainfall variability guo et al 2021 used armax garch model to demonstrated that the tgd weakened the joint fluctuations and correlation of the midstream but enhances those of downstream of the yangtze river however the environmental changes in the yangtze river basin are dramatic due to both climate change and human activities zhao et al 2017 although statistical methods can establish the runoff relationship before and after the emplacement of the tgd by probability distribution and the indicators of hydrologic alteration parameters are used to examine runoff regime change wang et al 2017 yang et al 2015 however this approach ignores many details and the uncertainty may increase for a long term scale analysis large scale coupling simulation can set up scenarios according to multifarious demands and is a good complement to statistical methods that is it is necessary to adopt a large scale coupling model to investigate the streamflow changes of the yangtze river under varied tgd operation however according to our literature review the large scale and long distance hydrologic and hydrodynamics coupled modeling in the yangtze river basin is still rarely conducted on the basis of previous studies this paper strives to construct a large scale hydrological hydrodynamic coupled model in the yangtze river basin as an important tool to strengthen the understanding of the hydrological situation changes of the yangtze river basin especially the main stream of the yangtze river the main objectives of this article include 1 constructing a large scale hydrological and hydrodynamic coupled model in the yangtze river basin and analyzing the performances of the coupled model and its applicability 2 clarifying the effects of the tgd operation on the downstream streamflow of the main hydrological stations based on long historical data during 1970 2018 with this coupled model 2 study area and data sets 2 1 study area the yangtze river basin is located between 24 27 35 54 n 90 33 122 19 e and the upper middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river take yichang station and hukou station as the demarcation the whole basin is multi stage stepped terrain with many mountains plateau hills etc in the upper reaches and there are medium and large plains in the middle and lower reaches the elevation gradually decreases from southeast to northwest the annual average temperature of the basin is approximately 12 and has various regional climate characteristics for example the qinghai tibet plateau belongs to the plateau climate but most other areas of the river basin belong to the subtropical monsoon zone affected by atmospheric circulation and underlying surface the precipitation distribution in the basin is uneven and the average annual precipitation is 1120 mm the study area is divided into two parts the main stream area of the yangtze river and others a hydrodynamics operation coupled model is employed in the main stream area of the yangtze river which contains the three gorges reservoir area and the main stream of middle and lower reach the three gorges reservoir area is located at the end of the upper reaches with an area of approximately 68 700 km2 which mainly consists of mountainous region and hill areas the length of main stream in reservoir area is approximately 760 km from zhutuo to the dam site with a total of 14 tributaries for instance jialing river wu river qi river etc the main stream of middle and lower reaches is from yichang to datong with a length of approximately 1080 km the effects of tgd on downstream hydrologic regime can be confirmed by analyzing the data sequences of multiple hydrological stations such as yichang chenglingji hankou hukou and datong etc the hydrological processes in the remaining areas of the yangtze river basin are simulated by the distributed time variant gain model dtvgm the geographic information of the study area and the simulation range of each model can be seen in fig 1 2 2 data sets in this study various data were collected to satisfy the requirements of hydrological and hydrodynamic simulation the following categories were included 1 geographic and natural information of the yangtze river basin including the srtm digital elevation model dem data with a spatial resolution of 90 m the soil type from food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao and the land use type with 1 1 km spatial

beibei xiangtan hukou cuntan etc of yangtze river basin from 2000 to 2018 were collected from the hydrological bureau of the ministry of water resources and the changjiang water resources commission the location and catchment area of each hydrological station are shown in fig 1 and table 1 3 methods 3 1 the framework of the coupled model in this study a large scale coupled model including the dtvgm and the hydrodynamics operation coupled model in the main stream area of the yangtze river from the upper reach at zhutuo station to the lower reach at datong station was established to simulate the hydrological and hydrodynamic processes in the yangtze river basin the coupling simulation firstly calculates the large scale hydrological processes of runoff of the whole yangtze river basin based on the dtvgm such as runoff generation confluence and evaporation etc then the hydrodynamics operation model receives these runoff processes including the main stream tributaries and interval inflow as input boundary conditions to conduct hydrologic regime simulation of the main stream of the yangtze river its own hydrodynamics and operating module more carefully the water level discharge curve at datong station is the lower boundary condition of the whole model 3 2 distributed time variant gain model the dtvgm is a distributed hydrological model which applies the tvgm to the river basin spatial temporal changes simulation based on spatial digital information the model can collect the land use change information of river basin by geographic information system remote sensing and then the nonlinear physical processes such as runoff generation canopy interception evapotranspiration infiltration etc can be simulated on the hydrological response units which are divided according to dem hydrological nonlinear theory and the distributed model framework are well combined in dtvgm and this model can reflect the complex variability of soil type land use cover vegetation etc of river basin the model has been validated in different basins and achieves good simulation results in areas with incomplete hydrological data or uncertain interference cai et al 2014 xia et al 2018a zhao et al 2015 the runoff generation module of dtvgm is based on the principle of water balance and the relevant variables are calculated by newton iteration method dem data and dynamical network theory are employed to the confluence calculation for the establishment of scale free river networks the networks are then divided into slope and river sections to conduct the confluence calculation the process of each node each node represents a runoff generating unit is calculated by the motion wave and then the simulation results are transmitted between the different nodes according to the river network topological relationship the core equations of dtvgm are shown in eq 1 to eq 6 readers are referred to xia et al 2005 2018b for more details about dtvgm 1 p i w i w i 1 r s i e i r s s i

operation module follows the strict operation rules of the tgd and the brief description is as follows generally a hydrological year is divided into four stages namely water supply period drawdown period flood season and impounding period from november to the end of april in the following year the reservoir keeps water level as high as possible to generate maximum electrical power during water supply period however there is a limitation that the streamflow cannot be less than 6000 m3 s to satisfy navigation water utilization and ecological protection drawdown period is from may 1 to june 10 and operating rules require the reservoir water level to be lowered to 145 m during this period extreme flood events mainly occur in flood season from june 11 to september 10 flood control of the tgd is conducted considering the downstream safety and release capacity of hydro turbines when flood season ends the tgd enters impoundment with the water level gradually rising to 175 m possibly no earlier than the end of october 31 readers can refer to qin et al 2020 and huang et al 2019 for more details about the tgd operation respectively currently the operation scenarios include the given water level or flow processes and no dam operation hypotheses etc the hydrodynamics operation coupled model can realized automatic calculation according to these scenarios and output simulation

the yangtze river basin is divided into 1212 subbasins according to the dem then slope land use and soil type help to divide the 23 671 hydrologic response units nash sutcliffe efficiency nse relative error re and coefficient of determination r 2 were used to evaluate the accuracy of the coupling model moriasi et al 2007 the daily flow data from 2000 to 2018 the data of xiangtan shimen waizhou and meigang are from 2000 to 2016 are used to calibrate and verify the applicability of dtvgm in the yangtze river basin the calibration is conducted based on the data from 2000 to 2012 and the rest data is used to model validation some parameters namely g 1 g 2 k aw c a and n in table 2 are adjusted manually and calibrated step by step from upstream to downstream based on the location of the control hydrological station the main stream area of the yangtze river is divided into two sections to confirm the accuracy of the hydrodynamics operation coupled model more easily the first section is 760 km long with 400 cross sections from zhutuo to dam site in reservoir area the second part which is from yichang to datong was divided into 535 computation sections with a length of approximately 1080 km both the inflow of tributaries and the interval inflow of the main stream area is supplied by the simulation results of dtvgm simulated daily flow and water levels are validated against stream station records to test the model applicability the calibration period of the model is from 2012 to 2015 and the data from 2016 to 2018 is used for validating the calibration results of parameters are shown in table 2 3 5 scenarios setting and impacts assessment in this paper the large scale hydrological and hydrodynamics coupled model is employed to clarify the impacts of the tgd operation on the hydrological conditions of midstream and downstream of the yangtze river using the historical data during 1970 2018 two scenarios which are operated by the tgd and natural state hypothesis assuming no tgd construction were simulated for the two scenarios it is the only change that the tgd is emplaced or not in the model thus it can assume that the relative deviation of flow between natural conditions and construction of the tgd is all caused by the dam operation the daily flows are ranked from highest to lowest and the flow events ranked 25 and 75 are selected as high q25 and low q75 flows to assess the impact of the tgd on different flow levels moreover the flow relative deviation rd was employed to quantify the effects of the tgd on the midstream and downstream of the yangtze river as shown in eq 10 when rd is greater than 0 it means that the flow after the tgd operation is greater than that in the natural state and vice versa 10 r d q r q n q n where rd is relative deviation q r is the flow regulated by the tgd m3 s q n is the flow in the natural state m3 s 4 results 4 1 the performance of dtvgm the calibration and validation results of dtvgm are given in fig 2 and table 3 the results show that the simulation accuracy of dtvgm in the yangtze river basin is acceptable with high nse r 2 and low re nses are above 0 8 at most sites during calibration except wulong xiangtan and shimen in the verification period the average nse for all sites reaches 0 75 with maximum of 0 87 in meigang and minimum of 0 63 in wulong respectively the relative error of waizhou reaches to 18 because the peak flow simulation is not ideal but the error is still acceptable according to fig 2 the simulated streamflow can capture the trend of the observed data whether peak or low flow the model yields reliable results in most cases these facts demonstrate the applicability of the dtvgm in the yangtze river basin 4 2 the performance of the hydrodynamics operation coupled model fig 3 and table 4 show the performance of the hydrodynamics operation coupled model as shown in fig 3 a and b a good model performance can be found for the daily flow in three gorges reservoir tgr area the simulated values can reflect the trend of observations correctly for instance the nse of calibration and verification of qingxichang is 0 79 and 0 72 respectively while the re is approximately 10 for both two gauges the simulation errors begin to increase when the peak flow is beyond 50 000 m3 s the complex relationship between water level and streamflow in the tgr area can explain the error fig 3 c to f show the modeling flow matches well with the observations at datong hankou chenglingji and hukou during the calibration and validation period the average nse during calibration and validation period could reach 0 84 0 84 and 0 75 at datong hankou and chenglingji with an r 2 of 0 93 0 94 and 0 88 respectively which means the model could reflect the flow changes accurately for hukou however the nse for daily flow simulation dropped to 0 70 and 0 60 respectively as the connection between the yangtze river and the poyang lake the water exchange relationship at hukou is extremely complicated due to the variation of the interval inflow groundwater storage anthropogenic activities etc gao et al 2014 wang et al 2021 it can be seen that some extreme values with sharp changes e g the flow is less than 0 could not be represented very well and that is the main reason for a decline of hukou evaluation fig 3 d nevertheless the simulated results can still grasp the fluctuation of observed data and perform well in most of the time in general the calculation error of the model itself and or the error transferred from hydrological model may be the main factors affecting the hydrodynamics operation model accuracy but these errors are acceptable according to the results above that is the performance of the coupled model in the main stream area of the yangtze river is good enough for subsequent analysis and calculation 4 3 comparison of flow regime under the tgd operation and natural state the variation of streamflow between the tgd operation and natural state hypothesis assuming no tgd construction during 1970 2018 are listed according to the tgd operation rules a hydrological year could be divided into four stages namely water supply period from november 1 to april 30 p1 drawdown period from may 1 to june 10 p2 flood season from june 11 to september 10 p3 and impounding period from september 11 to october 31 p4 the average flow high flow q25 and low flow q75 are calculated as fig 4 taking yichang fig 4 a as an example the operated flow always maintains a minimum value so that operated flow is greater than natural flow during water supply period p1 the results emphasize that the operation of tgd could enhance the flow discharge to satisfy the requirements of water utilization and shipping during dry season during the drawdown period p2 the flow of yichang operated by the tgd increases to vacate the reservoir in advance for flood control the impounding period p4 is just the opposite the tgd intercepted part of runoff in order to strengthen water supply and power generation resulting in the natural flow is always exceed the flow operated by the tgd the flow process in flood season p3 is even more complex for the low flow and daily average flow the difference between solid and dashed lines is faint meaning that the tgd does not reflect an obvious regulatory effect nevertheless it can easily find the weakening effect of tgd operation on the peak flood from the line of high flow that is the tgd operation will not execute very strict intervention for the flow that does not pose a threat to the midstream and downstream until the flow is beyond the limitation chenglingji hankou hukou and datong follow a similar pattern as yichang which flow growth in water supply and drawdown period but decrease in flood season and impounding period but there are differences in some details at first since these four stations are not controlled by the operation directly the flow process do not present straight line during water supply and flood season furthermore the difference of high flow between two scenarios are weakened due to interval inflow for example the process of high flow of two scenarios in flood season are intertwined and for impounding period the deviation of high flow of other stations is about half of yichang approximately 8 flow duration curves of five stations under natural state and tgd operation are shown in fig 5 as can been seen the flow duration curve after tgd operation differs markedly from the curve of natural state at yichang when exceedance probability is less than 8 the main effect of tgd operation is to decrease the magnitudes of flow it is beneficial to prevent flooding of downstream when exceedance probability is between 8 and 60 the flows regulated by tgd are less than the natural flow while this situation is reversed when exceedance probability is greater than 60 for hankou and datong the change of flow duration curves mainly occurred in exceedance probability of 25 100 and the results are similar to those of yichang under the tgd operation taking 60 as the turning point the natural discharge is larger when exceedance probability is between 25 and 60 while the flow regulated by the tgd is larger when exceedance probability is greater than 60 for chenglingji and hukou flow duration curves under two scenarios are quite similar showing that the dam do not greatly alter the general probability distribution of flows the reason for this phenomenon may be the influence of interval inflow fig 6 shows the correlation between the daily average flow and the absolute value of daily average relative deviation in each year as can be seen the absolute value of daily average relative deviation of the four hydrological stations namely chenglingji hankou hukou and datong gradually decreases as the daily average flow increases the larger daily average flow means more precipitation during this year in view of the vast basin area of the yangtze river as the station is gradually away from the dam site the proportion of interval inflow to total runoff will raise especially in years with sufficient rainfall consequently the scheduling effect of the tgd will be weakened which is the reason for the gradual reduce of the relative deviation the yichang is directly affected by the tgd even if the average daily flow increases from 10 000 to 17 000 m3 s the absolute value of its relative deviation does not change significantly ranging from 16 to 33 however due to the influence of a large amount of interval inflow the relative deviation of chenglingji and hukou decreases and the relative deviation is about 4 14 4 4 effects of the tgd operation for different streamflow magnitudes the relationships between flow and relative deviation at the daily scale from 1970 to 2018 under the tgd operation and natural conditions are investigated the effect of the tgd operation can be illustrated by the range of relative deviation furthermore in order to more clearly distinguish the impacts of the tgd on the flow operation at different stations in various periods the simulation results are also divided into four stages namely water supply period p1 drawdown period p2 flood season p3 and impounding period p4 all the results of the five hydrological stations are listed in fig 7 it can be seen from fig 7 that the simulation results of yichang are obviously more scattered which means that yichang is directly affected by the operation of the tgd and has a larger relative deviation compared with the natural state during the water supply period p1 the tgd operation will supplement too small natural flow until it reaches the prescribed lower limit therefore the relative deviation will be larger if the natural flow is smaller and the maximum deviation can reach more than 100 however the tgd operation does not dramatically obstruct all the flows during flood season for instance the simulation results with relative deviation greater than 0 account for approximately 50 of the total results when the flow rate is beyond 20 000 m3 s while this data is 72 when the flow reaches to 30 000 m3 s in addition its ability to weaken peak flow has also been enhanced and the high flood peaks can be reduced by 20 these results coincide with the analysis of fig 4 a although there are still sporadic data with relative deviation greater than 0 because of the new flood control strategy of the tgd e g opening more flood gates it just lasts a short time and only accounts for 0 9 of the total flood season data the operated flow is lower than that in the natural state in most cases during impounding period and the relative deviation is within 40 5 the simulation results of the three stations namely chenglingji hankou and datong have similar characteristics with yichang for example the dam operation changes flow by 10 25 when daily flow is below 60 quantile of total results during flood season p3 for extreme large flow events 90 however the impact of the tgd on the downstream gradually weakens and approaches zero for the three stations due to reasons such as long distance and interval inflow considering that the tgd operation can manage the flow at yichang practically and the downstream interval inflow is also an important reason for the extreme flow events this result is reasonable for impounding process all three stations show a decreasing trend and the reduction ranged from approximately 7 20 moreover a clear inflection point is also observed for the scatter distribution during the impounding period p4 once the flow exceeds the inflection point the deviation drops down rapidly for hankou and datong this particular flow is approximately 32 000 m3 s and 40 000 m3 s respectively the results indicate that there seems to be a flow range which the tgd operation is more effective within this scope the interval flow will dominate the flow characteristics of the downstream of the yangtze river beyond this flow threshold hukou is significantly different from the other stations during the flood season and impounding period in flood season p3 the relative deviation of simulation results has been even greater most of the results with deviation greater than 50 falls within the range of 1000 m3 s to 1500 m3 s which may be caused by the lower calculation benchmark moreover hukou is the only one of the five stations that the relative deviation of most results is greater than 0 during impounding period p4 the maximum relative deviation is approximately 110 when the flow is 900 m3 s as the flow of the main stream of the yangtze river raises the flow of hukou will dwindle due to the inhibition of backwater effect and even reverse flow occurs in extreme cases e g the flow of hukou is less than 0 and vice versa this is the main reason for the complex water exchange relationship between the yangtze river and hukou the flow of yichang can be regarded as the tgd outflow because the distance between yichang and the dam site is approximately 30 km then if the flow of yichang is compared with the interval inflow of each station in the middle and lower reaches the effect of tgd operation on the flow features for different runoff compositions can be revealed as can been seen in fig 8 in different operation stages of each year the abscissa is the ratio between the average flow of yichang and the interval inflow of control stations the flow relative deviations between the tgd operation and without the reservoir construction hypothesis are list in ordinate the larger the abscissa the higher the proportion of the yichang flow in total runoff and vice versa the ordinate can quantify the influence of the dam operation on the flow characteristics of the control station compared with the natural state fig 8 shows that all stations are roughly divided into four parts according to different operation periods on the whole with the increase of the proportion of the tgd discharge the relative deviation of flow gradually raises during the same operation period obviously the effect of reservoir operation is stronger for a large flow ratio and vice versa the lower left is the drawdown period during this period the average flow ratios of chenglingji hankou hukou and datong are 0 86 0 83 1 12 and 0 51 and the average relative deviations are 2 56 4 64 1 39 and 3 07 respectively the results mean that the yichang flow accounts for a small proportion and the tgd operation influence on mid lower reach of yangtze river is feeble in this period the upper left is water supply period it can be seen that the average impact of the tgd operation increases to 9 78 20 53 11 26 and 18 01 when the flow ratio does not change significantly compared with drawdown period flood season and impounding period are distributed in the lower right and upper right respectively except for hukou the flow ratio of chenglingji hankou and datong in flood season and impounding period are from 0 74 to 3 14 and 0 88 3 57 and the relative deviation vary within 0 85 8 56 and 3 96 22 28 respectively taking flood season and impounding period as examples because the three gorges reservoir is a seasonal operating engineering project the tgd s goal is not to intercept all floods in the reservoir but to reduce extreme peak flow as a primary task thus the average flow in flood season will not change dramatically nevertheless when the impoundment begins the tgd will storage runoff to raise water level resulting in a significant increase in the relative deviation of average flow that is the main reason why the relative deviation of water supply and impounding period are greater than that of flood season and drawdown period for chenglingji the flow partly comes from the main stream of the yangtze river because of the network of dongting lake therefore the scatter points form a graph like a loop curve according to four operation stages for hankou during water supply period the flow ratio did not increase significantly but the relative deviation changes greatly on the contrary in flood season the variation of flow ratio is large while the deviation is relatively stable this trend is caused by the tgd operation and the runoff process of han river an important tributary of the yangtze river according to the operation rules the minimum flow is stipulated in water supply period fig 4 and the flow of han river is also stable during the same time therefore the flow ratio is just fluctuated within a small range the difference between the flow in natural state and the minimum value is the main source of flow deviation in flood season the flow of han river raises the calculation baseline of the flow ratio which further reduces the deviation nevertheless hukou has two different features first its abscissa is much greater than the others with a maximum of 15 2 while the other three are below 4 secondly there is an overlap between flood season and impounding period when the flow ratio is between 4 and 6 and the slope of relative deviation rises up rapidly when the flow ratio is more than 4 these two features can be attributed to the backwater effect of the main stream when the backwater effect occurs the flow of hukou will continually decrease due to the rise of the main stream water level it also exhibits that the effect of dam operation is more directly at hukou when the tgd outflow is far beyond the interval inflow for datong even with the influence of the complex conditions of hukou the flow ratio and relative deviation of datong are the smallest among the four stations because of the long distance from dam site to datong 5 discussion to complete the simulation of the yangtze river basin this paper provides a meaningful large scale hydrological and hydrodynamic coupled model which is developed via the dtvgm and the hydrodynamics operation coupled model the data of each module which are connected in series can be interacted and different modules can reveal the variability of hydrological elements in the main stream in terms of the features of the up middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river that is the applicability of the large scale coupled model of yangtze river basin is demonstrated considering the large study area however the model accuracy needs to be further modified zhang et al 2020b since the model is simulated in series the simulation errors of the previous model will be transmitted to the subsequence which will theoretically enlarge the errors of the final results although the total errors can be controlled by verifying the downstream observed records it is necessary to further improve each model to obtain more accurate intermediate process especially in ungauged areas technical innovations such as deep learning method and high spatial remote sensing oliveira et al 2021 zhi et al 2021 are promising way to assist model developers in error control many studies have also mentioned the feasibility read et al 2019 zhao et al 2015 some researchers have also mentioned that simulation in consecutive coupling may lead to some errors such as the calculation of the backwater effect in the reservoir area ma et al 2015 this defect can be avoided as far as possible by reasonable dividing the calculation range of each model for the main stream of the hydrodynamics operation coupled model in the tgd the modeling range starts from zhutuo the control station of the tgd area which means the effects of backwater in the reservoir area can be accurately calculated for some tributaries however the current model may not express the impact of backwater very well and it requires using more data to optimize model parameters as the largest hydroelectric reservoir in china the tgd plays a dominant role in changing the hydrologic regime of the yangtze river as far as the simulation results the flow of the midstream and downstream of the yangtze river decreased during flood season and impounding period after the regulation which is consistent with the primary functions of the tgd namely flood control and power generation jiang et al 2019 there is a difference that the flood control is more aimed at high flow in flood season while both high flow and low flow were intercepted by the tgd during impounding period chen et al 2016 moreover the increased flow in water supply period and drawdown period can also guarantee water use and navigation in the midstream and downstream fig 4 that is the tgd operation try to reduces the number of high flow occurrence and enlarges the minimum daily streamflow which leads the runoff process more uniform throughout the year and reduces the flow fluctuation guo et al 2021 the researches based on statistical methods illustrated that the flow variation of yichang hankou and datong are similar the flow decreased significantly in september october and november and increased in january and february for example the daily minimum flow at yichang increased from about 4200 m3 s to about 5700 m3 s chen et al 2016 wang et al 2020 which is consistent with the results in this paper however other studies have found that the flow at chenglingji also presents a trend of significant reduction but it is not obvious according to fig 4 b the reason for the difference may be that the interval confluence was assumed to be the same in this study while other studies considered the impacts such as climate change or human activities on the interval confluence wang et al 2020 wei et al 2014 furthermore both statistical and simulation methods show that the flow duration curves at yichang are significantly altered by tgd operation taking approximately 60 as the turning point when the exceedance probability is less than 60 the natural runoff is larger than that after tgd operation and vice versa wang et al 2016 this study presents the difference between the tgd operation and no reservoir construction hypothesis for various flow magnitude on the daily scale fig 7 more details can be revealed such as the envelope of deviation and the specific flow when extreme deviation occurs for main stations these details help managers gain a deeper understanding of the effect of the tgd operation meanwhile daily scale analysis is more suitable for further improvement of operation rules with these measures the reservoir capacity can be used more valid to reduce flood risk when extreme rainfall occurs especially for the yangtze river basin with concentrated rainfall season many researches have mentioned that the effect of the tgd on the mainstream of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river is also obviously related to interval inflow mei et al 2015 zhang et al 2020a without considering the river leakage the effect of tgd operation is quantified under the different proportions of the reservoir outflow and the interval inflow for four operation stages fig 8 in general the influence of the tgd operation is gradually deepened with the increase of the reservoir outflow it should be noted that the effect of the tgd operation is different even for a same flow ratio for example the flow deviation of hukou in 2018 and 1984 are 11 and 37 respectively such a huge gap may be due to the different runoff process and spatial temporal rainfall distribution razmkhah et al 2016 which means more investigations are needed in the further however some typical problems can be discussed based on the data for instance reports demonstrated that tgd operation have increased the lake river water level gradient during september and october which is a main factor for recession in poyang lake if the operation rules can be appropriately adjusted according to the characteristics of the interval confluence it may reduce the impact of the tgd on poyang lake and thus improve the habitat environment of migratory birds on the contrary when upstream and downstream encounter different flood frequencies e g the return period of flood is 100 years for upstream while the downstream flood frequencies is 20 years or vice versa the operation mode that enhances the influence of the tgd can be used to reduce the flood risk in the reservoir area and the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river with this large scale couple model a series of water issues of the yangtze river basin including climate and land use change ecological operation of the tgd et al could be revealed further studies will focus on these topics 6 conclusions in this paper a large scale hydrological and hydrodynamics coupled model which combines the dtvgm and the hydrodynamics operation coupled model was established in the yangtze river basin the effects of tgd operation on the flow regime in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river from 1970 to 2018 are analyzed based on the coupled model the major conclusions were as follows 1 the large scale hydrological and hydrodynamics coupled model can well simulate the water circulation process of the yangtze river basin the nses of most sites are above 0 75 and the res are below 15 during calibration and verification all evidences suggest that the coupled model performance is acceptable 2 the tgd operation mainly intercepts the high flood peak and increase the magnitude of low flow but it varies with the geographical location for yichang the annual average relative deviation of flow operated by the tgd is approximately 24 compared with the natural state while the value of chenglingji hankou hukou and datong is 8 5 12 8 except hukou the other four stations show the characteristics of increasing flow in water supply period and decreasing flow in impounding period 3 the tgd operation and interval inflow will jointly determine the flow characteristics of the mainstream in downstream of the yangtze river during water supply period the streamflow can increase by 6 33 according to the tgd operation but when impounding process starts streamflow shows a decreasing trend except hukou with the reduction ranged from about 7 20 for different stations for flood season the dam operation mainly intercepts high flood peaks while the average streamflow changes a little the high flood peaks at yichang can be reduced by 20 and the changes of high flood peaks in downstream reduce to no more than 10 due to the influence of interval inflow the deviations during drawdown period are almost below 10 when the tgd outflow is far beyond the interval inflow the effects of dam operation are enhanced and the effects are most significant for hukou compared with chenglingji hankou and

8037,study region the yangtze river basin china study focus in this study a large scale coupled model of hydrological and hydrodynamic processes was developed via the distributed time variant gain model and the hydrodynamics operation coupled model two scenarios including operated by the three gorges dam tgd and natural condition hypothesis without the reservoir construction were analyzed based on the coupled model to investigate the effects of tgd operation on the streamflow from 1970 to 2018 new hydrological insights results exhibited that the annual average relative deviation of flow operated by the tgd was approximately 24 compared with the natural state at yichang while the value of chenglingji hankou hukou and datong were 8 5 12 8 during water supply period the tgd operation increase the streamflow by 33 at yichang and the streamflow in downstream can gain about 6 17 for impounding process except hukou the others showed a decreasing trend and the reduction ranged from about 7 20 for flood season the dam operation mainly intercepts high flood peaks while the average streamflow changes a little the high flood peaks at yichang can be reduced by 20 and the changes of high flood peaks in downstream reduce to no more than 10 due to the influence of interval inflow the deviations during drawdown period are almost below 10 keywords coupling of hydrologic and hydrodynamic processes three gorges reservoir area mid lower reach of yangtze river flow regime 1 introduction with the intensification of global climate change and the impact of human activities the water safety issues are becoming more diverse and complex the yangtze river basin with a population exceeding 400 million and produces 25 of its gross domestic product needs to be more cautious about water security in a complex environment chen et al 2016 the core of water problems in the yangtze river basin is to understand the water system theory which contains various intricate processes linked by water circulation piao et al 2010 as such it has attracted considerable attention in the literature for example wang et al 2017 2020 wei et al 2014 zhou et al 2014 the purpose of these studies is to clarify the variations in the water circulation under intensive dam building economic development etc through different methods integrated simulation of river basin water system is an important method for the scientific understanding of water circulation and its accompanying processes and it can provide effective support for managers to supervise environmental change the sustainable development of human society and the natural environment etc wang et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 for the river basin modeling hydrological hydrodynamic processes simulation is the basic tool to reveal the characteristics of water circulation from land to water body fleischmann et al 2018 liu et al 2019 distributed hydrological models mainly simulate hydrological processes such as runoff generation water flow and their spatiotemporal distribution in river basin these models are often highly efficient which can quickly respond and calculate the change features of key elements of river basin water circulation cai et al 2014 however in terms of river simulation the hydrological models generally focus on the flow process of the subbasin or the outlet of river basin and cannot provide the hydraulic characteristics at a specific location the river hydrodynamic model is solved by a system of kinetic equations describing the motion laws of the non constant asymptotic water flow and more details such as flow discharge and velocity can be obtained through the model calculation ming et al 2020 nevertheless hydrodynamic models generally have low computational efficiency especially when the simulation range is large and their calculated complexity often increases in multiples li et al 2018 therefore when conducting large scale river basin simulation the advantages of hydrologic and hydrodynamic models should be fully considered for example hydrological model is used in ordinary regions while hydrodynamic simulation in the key areas can effectively realize the needs of computational efficiency and simulation elements zhang et al 2019 typically when both natural watersheds and urban areas are included in the study areas the natural watersheds are calculated by hydrological models generally while the urban areas adopt hydrodynamic models to obtain more accurate information about water depth and inundation range cheng et al 2020 at present a mature approach in hydrological and hydrodynamic modeling is unidirectional coupling which means the runoff generation and confluence are performed using hydrological models on the sub basin and the simulation results are then transmitted to hydrodynamic models for further coupling simulation wu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 many progresses have been made in large scale river basin hydrological hydrodynamic coupling simulations paiva et al 2013 provided a coupled model of amazon river basin which constructed by the mgb iph model with a validation using remotely sensed observations their findings showed that for large scale watershed simulation the input data and estimation of some important model parameters have a significant impact on the accuracy of simulation results hoch et al 2017 proposed a one directionally framework glofrim for integrated hydrological and hydrodynamic modeling within this framework the other hydrological and hydrodynamic models can be added freely to complete the 1d and or 2d calculation requirements patel et al 2017 lopes et al 2018 and munar et al 2018 also proved that large river lagoon systems could be formulated with integrated modeling and the simulation correctly reflected the influence of the wind and interval inflow moreover for the impacts of climate change human activities e g reservoirs operation and land use changes on the river hydrological conditions the hydrological hydrodynamic coupled model can deal with these issues more effectively guse et al 2015 mentzafou et al 2017 when a model has been calibrated with records various hypothetical scenarios which are defined by different model parameters could be set up and simulated the feasibility of considering the relevance of predicted environmental change for eco hydrology hydrodynamics agricultural irrigation demands water resources supply etc has been demonstrated by many investigators with hydrological hydrodynamic integrated simulation schuchert et al 2018 the three gorges dam tgd located in the upstream of the yangtze river in china has the largest installed capacity in the world fang et al 2012 under the dam operation great social and economic benefits of flood control and power generation have been achieved while it does affect the hydrological conditions of the main stream many studies have tried to reveal the changes in hydrological characteristics after the construction of the tgd chen et al 2016 analyzed trend in precipitation and flow of the yangtze river at the monthly time scale from 1955 to 2014 and found that the feature of monthly flow obvious changes which is directly related to the completion of the tgd su et al 2019 added that the streamflow variability is also strongly related to rainfall variability guo et al 2021 used armax garch model to demonstrated that the tgd weakened the joint fluctuations and correlation of the midstream but enhances those of downstream of the yangtze river however the environmental changes in the yangtze river basin are dramatic due to both climate change and human activities zhao et al 2017 although statistical methods can establish the runoff relationship before and after the emplacement of the tgd by probability distribution and the indicators of hydrologic alteration parameters are used to examine runoff regime change wang et al 2017 yang et al 2015 however this approach ignores many details and the uncertainty may increase for a long term scale analysis large scale coupling simulation can set up scenarios according to multifarious demands and is a good complement to statistical methods that is it is necessary to adopt a large scale coupling model to investigate the streamflow changes of the yangtze river under varied tgd operation however according to our literature review the large scale and long distance hydrologic and hydrodynamics coupled modeling in the yangtze river basin is still rarely conducted on the basis of previous studies this paper strives to construct a large scale hydrological hydrodynamic coupled model in the yangtze river basin as an important tool to strengthen the understanding of the hydrological situation changes of the yangtze river basin especially the main stream of the yangtze river the main objectives of this article include 1 constructing a large scale hydrological and hydrodynamic coupled model in the yangtze river basin and analyzing the performances of the coupled model and its applicability 2 clarifying the effects of the tgd operation on the downstream streamflow of the main hydrological stations based on long historical data during 1970 2018 with this coupled model 2 study area and data sets 2 1 study area the yangtze river basin is located between 24 27 35 54 n 90 33 122 19 e and the upper middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river take yichang station and hukou station as the demarcation the whole basin is multi stage stepped terrain with many mountains plateau hills etc in the upper reaches and there are medium and large plains in the middle and lower reaches the elevation gradually decreases from southeast to northwest the annual average temperature of the basin is approximately 12 and has various regional climate characteristics for example the qinghai tibet plateau belongs to the plateau climate but most other areas of the river basin belong to the subtropical monsoon zone affected by atmospheric circulation and underlying surface the precipitation distribution in the basin is uneven and the average annual precipitation is 1120 mm the study area is divided into two parts the main stream area of the yangtze river and others a hydrodynamics operation coupled model is employed in the main stream area of the yangtze river which contains the three gorges reservoir area and the main stream of middle and lower reach the three gorges reservoir area is located at the end of the upper reaches with an area of approximately 68 700 km2 which mainly consists of mountainous region and hill areas the length of main stream in reservoir area is approximately 760 km from zhutuo to the dam site with a total of 14 tributaries for instance jialing river wu river qi river etc the main stream of middle and lower reaches is from yichang to datong with a length of approximately 1080 km the effects of tgd on downstream hydrologic regime can be confirmed by analyzing the data sequences of multiple hydrological stations such as yichang chenglingji hankou hukou and datong etc the hydrological processes in the remaining areas of the yangtze river basin are simulated by the distributed time variant gain model dtvgm the geographic information of the study area and the simulation range of each model can be seen in fig 1 2 2 data sets in this study various data were collected to satisfy the requirements of hydrological and hydrodynamic simulation the following categories were included 1 geographic and natural information of the yangtze river basin including the srtm digital elevation model dem data with a spatial resolution of 90 m the soil type from food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao and the land use type with 1 1 km spatial resolution of the yangtze river basin from resource and environment science and data center 2 the daily meteorological data of 249 meteorological stations in the yangtze river basin from 1970 to 2018

sections along the main stream of about 1800 km zhutuo to datong section of the yangtze river including shapes and elevations 4 the daily flow dataset of 14 typical hydrological stations e g zhutuo beibei xiangtan hukou cuntan etc of yangtze river basin from 2000 to 2018 were collected from the hydrological bureau of the ministry of water resources and the changjiang water resources commission the location and catchment area of each hydrological station are shown in fig 1 and table 1 3 methods 3 1 the framework of the coupled model in this study a large scale coupled model including the dtvgm and the hydrodynamics operation coupled model in the main stream area of the yangtze river from the upper reach at zhutuo station to the lower reach at datong station was established to simulate the hydrological and hydrodynamic processes in the yangtze river basin the coupling simulation firstly calculates the large scale hydrological processes of runoff of the whole yangtze river basin based on the dtvgm such as runoff generation confluence and evaporation etc then the hydrodynamics operation model receives these runoff processes including the main stream tributaries and interval inflow as input boundary conditions to conduct hydrologic regime simulation of the main stream of the yangtze river its own hydrodynamics and operating module more carefully the water level discharge curve at datong station is the lower boundary condition of the whole model 3 2 distributed time variant gain model the dtvgm is a distributed hydrological model which applies the tvgm to the river basin spatial temporal changes simulation based on spatial digital information the model can collect the land use change information of river basin by geographic information system remote sensing and then the nonlinear physical processes such as runoff generation canopy interception evapotranspiration infiltration etc can be simulated on the hydrological response units which are divided according to dem hydrological nonlinear theory and the distributed model framework are well combined in dtvgm and this model can reflect the complex variability of soil type land use cover vegetation etc of river basin the model has been validated in different basins and achieves good simulation results in areas with incomplete hydrological data or uncertain interference cai et al 2014 xia et al 2018a zhao et al 2015 the runoff generation module of dtvgm is based on the principle of water balance and the relevant variables are calculated by newton iteration method dem data and dynamical network theory are employed to the confluence calculation for the establishment of scale free river networks the networks are then divided into slope and river sections to conduct the confluence calculation the process of each node each node represents a runoff generating unit is calculated by the motion wave and then the simulation results are transmitted between the different nodes according to the river network topological relationship the core equations of dtvgm are shown in eq 1 to eq 6 readers are referred to xia et al 2005 2018b for more details about dtvgm 1 p i w i w i 1 r s i e i r s s i

hydrodynamic model the calculation equations are solved finite difference method for the saint venant equations and the preissmann four point eccentric scheme is used for model discretization the operation module follows the strict operation rules of the tgd and the brief description is as follows generally a hydrological year is divided into four stages namely water supply period drawdown period flood season and impounding period from november to the end of april in the following year the reservoir keeps water level as high as possible to generate maximum electrical power during water supply period however there is a limitation that the streamflow cannot be less than 6000 m3 s to satisfy navigation water utilization and ecological protection drawdown period is from may 1 to june 10 and operating rules require the reservoir water level to be lowered to 145 m during this period extreme flood events mainly occur in flood season from june 11 to september 10 flood control of the tgd is conducted considering the downstream safety and release capacity of hydro turbines when flood season ends the tgd enters impoundment with the water level gradually rising to 175 m possibly no earlier than the end of october 31 readers can refer to qin et al 2020 and huang et al 2019 for more details about the tgd operation respectively currently the operation scenarios include the given water level or flow processes and no dam operation hypotheses etc the hydrodynamics operation coupled model can realized automatic calculation according to these scenarios and output simulation

the yangtze river basin is divided into 1212 subbasins according to the dem then slope land use and soil type help to divide the 23 671 hydrologic response units nash sutcliffe efficiency nse relative error re and coefficient of determination r 2 were used to evaluate the accuracy of the coupling model moriasi et al 2007 the daily flow data from 2000 to 2018 the data of xiangtan shimen waizhou and meigang are from 2000 to 2016 are used to calibrate and verify the applicability of dtvgm in the yangtze river basin the calibration is conducted based on the data from 2000 to 2012 and the rest data is used to model validation some parameters namely g 1 g 2 k aw c a and n in table 2 are adjusted manually and calibrated step by step from upstream to downstream based on the location of the control hydrological station the main stream area of the yangtze river is divided into two sections to confirm the accuracy of the hydrodynamics operation coupled model more easily the first section is 760 km long with 400 cross sections from zhutuo to dam site in reservoir area the second part which is from yichang to datong was divided into 535 computation sections with a length of approximately 1080 km both the inflow of tributaries and the interval inflow of the main stream area is supplied by the simulation results of dtvgm simulated daily flow and water levels are validated against stream station records to test the model applicability the calibration period of the model is from 2012 to 2015 and the data from 2016 to 2018 is used for validating the calibration results of parameters are shown in table 2 3 5 scenarios setting and impacts assessment in this paper the large scale hydrological and hydrodynamics coupled model is employed to clarify the impacts of the tgd operation on the hydrological conditions of midstream and downstream of the yangtze river using the historical data during 1970 2018 two scenarios which are operated by the tgd and natural state hypothesis assuming no tgd construction were simulated for the two scenarios it is the only change that the tgd is emplaced or not in the model thus it can assume that the relative deviation of flow between natural conditions and construction of the tgd is all caused by the dam operation the daily flows are ranked from highest to lowest and the flow events ranked 25 and 75 are selected as high q25 and low q75 flows to assess the impact of the tgd on different flow levels moreover the flow relative deviation rd was employed to quantify the effects of the tgd on the midstream and downstream of the yangtze river as shown in eq 10 when rd is greater than 0 it means that the flow after the tgd operation is greater than that in the natural state and vice versa 10 r d q r q n q n where rd is relative deviation q r is the flow regulated by the tgd m3 s q n is the flow in the natural state m3 s 4 results 4 1 the performance of dtvgm the calibration and validation results of dtvgm are given in fig 2 and table 3 the results show that the simulation accuracy of dtvgm in the yangtze river basin is acceptable with high nse r 2 and low re nses are above 0 8 at most sites during calibration except wulong xiangtan and shimen in the verification period the average nse for all sites reaches 0 75 with maximum of 0 87 in meigang and minimum of 0 63 in wulong respectively the relative error of waizhou reaches to 18 because the peak flow simulation is not ideal but the error is still acceptable according to fig 2 the simulated streamflow can capture the trend of the observed data whether peak or low flow the model yields reliable results in most cases these facts demonstrate the applicability of the dtvgm in the yangtze river basin 4 2 the performance of the hydrodynamics operation coupled model fig 3 and table 4 show the performance of the hydrodynamics operation coupled model as shown in fig 3 a and b a good model performance can be found for the daily flow in three gorges reservoir tgr area the simulated values can reflect the trend of observations correctly for instance the nse of calibration and verification of qingxichang is 0 79 and 0 72 respectively while the re is approximately 10 for both two gauges the simulation errors begin to increase when the peak flow is beyond 50 000 m3 s the complex relationship between water level and streamflow in the tgr area can explain the error fig 3 c to f show the modeling flow matches well with the observations at datong hankou chenglingji and hukou during the calibration and validation period the average nse during calibration and validation period could reach 0 84 0 84 and 0 75 at datong hankou and chenglingji with an r 2 of 0 93 0 94 and 0 88 respectively which means the model could reflect the flow changes accurately for hukou however the nse for daily flow simulation dropped to 0 70 and 0 60 respectively as the connection between the yangtze river and the poyang lake the water exchange relationship at hukou is extremely complicated due to the variation of the interval inflow groundwater storage anthropogenic activities etc gao et al 2014 wang et al 2021 it can be seen that some extreme values with sharp changes e g the flow is less than 0 could not be represented very well and that is the main reason for a decline of hukou evaluation fig 3 d nevertheless the simulated results can still grasp the fluctuation of observed data and perform well in most of the time in general the calculation error of the model itself and or the error transferred from hydrological model may be the main factors affecting the hydrodynamics operation model accuracy but these errors are acceptable according to the results above that is the performance of the coupled model in the main stream area of the yangtze river is good enough for subsequent analysis and calculation 4 3 comparison of flow regime under the tgd operation and natural state the variation of streamflow between the tgd operation and natural state hypothesis assuming no tgd construction during 1970 2018 are listed according to the tgd operation rules a hydrological year could be divided into four stages namely water supply period from november 1 to april 30 p1 drawdown period from may 1 to june 10 p2 flood season from june 11 to september 10 p3 and impounding period from september 11 to october 31 p4 the average flow high flow q25 and low flow q75 are calculated as fig 4 taking yichang fig 4 a as an example the operated flow always maintains a minimum value so that operated flow is greater than natural flow during water supply period p1 the results emphasize that the operation of tgd could enhance the flow discharge to satisfy the requirements of water utilization and shipping during dry season during the drawdown period p2 the flow of yichang operated by the tgd increases to vacate the reservoir in advance for flood control the impounding period p4 is just the opposite the tgd intercepted part of runoff in order to strengthen water supply and power generation resulting in the natural flow is always exceed the flow operated by the tgd the flow process in flood season p3 is even more complex for the low flow and daily average flow the difference between solid and dashed lines is faint meaning that the tgd does not reflect an obvious regulatory effect nevertheless it can easily find the weakening effect of tgd operation on the peak flood from the line of high flow that is the tgd operation will not execute very strict intervention for the flow that does not pose a threat to the midstream and downstream until the flow is beyond the limitation chenglingji hankou hukou and datong follow a similar pattern as yichang which flow growth in water supply and drawdown period but decrease in flood season and impounding period but there are differences in some details at first since these four stations are not controlled by the operation directly the flow process do not present straight line during water supply and flood season furthermore the difference of high flow between two scenarios are weakened due to interval inflow for example the process of high flow of two scenarios in flood season are intertwined and for impounding period the deviation of high flow of other stations is about half of yichang approximately 8 flow duration curves of five stations under natural state and tgd operation are shown in fig 5 as can been seen the flow duration curve after tgd operation differs markedly from the curve of natural state at yichang when exceedance probability is less than 8 the main effect of tgd operation is to decrease the magnitudes of flow it is beneficial to prevent flooding of downstream when exceedance probability is between 8 and 60 the flows regulated by tgd are less than the natural flow while this situation is reversed when exceedance probability is greater than 60 for hankou and datong the change of flow duration curves mainly occurred in exceedance probability of 25 100 and the results are similar to those of yichang under the tgd operation taking 60 as the turning point the natural discharge is larger when exceedance probability is between 25 and 60 while the flow regulated by the tgd is larger when exceedance probability is greater than 60 for chenglingji and hukou flow duration curves under two scenarios are quite similar showing that the dam do not greatly alter the general probability distribution of flows the reason for this phenomenon may be the influence of interval inflow fig 6 shows the correlation between the daily average flow and the absolute value of daily average relative deviation in each year as can be seen the absolute value of daily average relative deviation of the four hydrological stations namely chenglingji hankou hukou and datong gradually decreases as the daily average flow increases the larger daily average flow means more precipitation during this year in view of the vast basin area of the yangtze river as the station is gradually away from the dam site the proportion of interval inflow to total runoff will raise especially in years with sufficient rainfall consequently the scheduling effect of the tgd will be weakened which is the reason for the gradual reduce of the relative deviation the yichang is directly affected by the tgd even if the average daily flow increases from 10 000 to 17 000 m3 s the absolute value of its relative deviation does not change significantly ranging from 16 to 33 however due to the influence of a large amount of interval inflow the relative deviation of chenglingji and hukou decreases and the relative deviation is about 4 14 4 4 effects of the tgd operation for different streamflow magnitudes the relationships between flow and relative deviation at the daily scale from 1970 to 2018 under the tgd operation and natural conditions are investigated the effect of the tgd operation can be illustrated by the range of relative deviation furthermore in order to more clearly distinguish the impacts of the tgd on the flow operation at different stations in various periods the simulation results are also divided into four stages namely water supply period p1 drawdown period p2 flood season p3 and impounding period p4 all the results of the five hydrological stations are listed in fig 7 it can be seen from fig 7 that the simulation results of yichang are obviously more scattered which means that yichang is directly affected by the operation of the tgd and has a larger relative deviation compared with the natural state during the water supply period p1 the tgd operation will supplement too small natural flow until it reaches the prescribed lower limit therefore the relative deviation will be larger if the natural flow is smaller and the maximum deviation can reach more than 100 however the tgd operation does not dramatically obstruct all the flows during flood season for instance the simulation results with relative deviation greater than 0 account for approximately 50 of the total results when the flow rate is beyond 20 000 m3 s while this data is 72 when the flow reaches to 30 000 m3 s in addition its ability to weaken peak flow has also been enhanced and the high flood peaks can be reduced by 20 these results coincide with the analysis of fig 4 a although there are still sporadic data with relative deviation greater than 0 because of the new flood control strategy of the tgd e g opening more flood gates it just lasts a short time and only accounts for 0 9 of the total flood season data the operated flow is lower than that in the natural state in most cases during impounding period and the relative deviation is within 40 5 the simulation results of the three stations namely chenglingji hankou and datong have similar characteristics with yichang for example the dam operation changes flow by 10 25 when daily flow is below 60 quantile of total results during flood season p3 for extreme large flow events 90 however the impact of the tgd on the downstream gradually weakens and approaches zero for the three stations due to reasons such as long distance and interval inflow considering that the tgd operation can manage the flow at yichang practically and the downstream interval inflow is also an important reason for the extreme flow events this result is reasonable for impounding process all three stations show a decreasing trend and the reduction ranged from approximately 7 20 moreover a clear inflection point is also observed for the scatter distribution during the impounding period p4 once the flow exceeds the inflection point the deviation drops down rapidly for hankou and datong this particular flow is approximately 32 000 m3 s and 40 000 m3 s respectively the results indicate that there seems to be a flow range which the tgd operation is more effective within this scope the interval flow will dominate the flow characteristics of the downstream of the yangtze river beyond this flow threshold hukou is significantly different from the other stations during the flood season and impounding period in flood season p3 the relative deviation of simulation results has been even greater most of the results with deviation greater than 50 falls within the range of 1000 m3 s to 1500 m3 s which may be caused by the lower calculation benchmark moreover hukou is the only one of the five stations that the relative deviation of most results is greater than 0 during impounding period p4 the maximum relative deviation is approximately 110 when the flow is 900 m3 s as the flow of the main stream of the yangtze river raises the flow of hukou will dwindle due to the inhibition of backwater effect and even reverse flow occurs in extreme cases e g the flow of hukou is less than 0 and vice versa this is the main reason for the complex water exchange relationship between the yangtze river and hukou the flow of yichang can be regarded as the tgd outflow because the distance between yichang and the dam site is approximately 30 km then if the flow of yichang is compared with the interval inflow of each station in the middle and lower reaches the effect of tgd operation on the flow features for different runoff compositions can be revealed as can been seen in fig 8 in different operation stages of each year the abscissa is the ratio between the average flow of yichang and the interval inflow of control stations the flow relative deviations between the tgd operation and without the reservoir construction hypothesis are list in ordinate the larger the abscissa the higher the proportion of the yichang flow in total runoff and vice versa the ordinate can quantify the influence of the dam operation on the flow characteristics of the control station compared with the natural state fig 8 shows that all stations are roughly divided into four parts according to different operation periods on the whole with the increase of the proportion of the tgd discharge the relative deviation of flow gradually raises during the same operation period obviously the effect of reservoir operation is stronger for a large flow ratio and vice versa the lower left is the drawdown period during this period the average flow ratios of chenglingji hankou hukou and datong are 0 86 0 83 1 12 and 0 51 and the average relative deviations are 2 56 4 64 1 39 and 3 07 respectively the results mean that the yichang flow accounts for a small proportion and the tgd operation influence on mid lower reach of yangtze river is feeble in this period the upper left is water supply period it can be seen that the average impact of the tgd operation increases to 9 78 20 53 11 26 and 18 01 when the flow ratio does not change significantly compared with drawdown period flood season and impounding period are distributed in the lower right and upper right respectively except for hukou the flow ratio of chenglingji hankou and datong in flood season and impounding period are from 0 74 to 3 14 and 0 88 3 57 and the relative deviation vary within 0 85 8 56 and 3 96 22 28 respectively taking flood season and impounding period as examples because the three gorges reservoir is a seasonal operating engineering project the tgd s goal is not to intercept all floods in the reservoir but to reduce extreme peak flow as a primary task thus the average flow in flood season will not change dramatically nevertheless when the impoundment begins the tgd will storage runoff to raise water level resulting in a significant increase in the relative deviation of average flow that is the main reason why the relative deviation of water supply and impounding period are greater than that of flood season and drawdown period for chenglingji the flow partly comes from the main stream of the yangtze river because of the network of dongting lake therefore the scatter points form a graph like a loop curve according to four operation stages for hankou during water supply period the flow ratio did not increase significantly but the relative deviation changes greatly on the contrary in flood season the variation of flow ratio is large while the deviation is relatively stable this trend is caused by the tgd operation and the runoff process of han river an important tributary of the yangtze river according to the operation rules the minimum flow is stipulated in water supply period fig 4 and the flow of han river is also stable during the same time therefore the flow ratio is just fluctuated within a small range the difference between the flow in natural state and the minimum value is the main source of flow deviation in flood season the flow of han river raises the calculation baseline of the flow ratio which further reduces the deviation nevertheless hukou has two different features first its abscissa is much greater than the others with a maximum of 15 2 while the other three are below 4 secondly there is an overlap between flood season and impounding period when the flow ratio is between 4 and 6 and the slope of relative deviation rises up rapidly when the flow ratio is more than 4 these two features can be attributed to the backwater effect of the main stream when the backwater effect occurs the flow of hukou will continually decrease due to the rise of the main stream water level it also exhibits that the effect of dam operation is more directly at hukou when the tgd outflow is far beyond the interval inflow for datong even with the influence of the complex conditions of hukou the flow ratio and relative deviation of datong are the smallest among the four stations because of the long distance from dam site to datong 5 discussion to complete the simulation of the yangtze river basin this paper provides a meaningful large scale hydrological and hydrodynamic coupled model which is developed via the dtvgm and the hydrodynamics operation coupled model the data of each module which are connected in series can be interacted and different modules can reveal the variability of hydrological elements in the main stream in terms of the features of the up middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river that is the applicability of the large scale coupled model of yangtze river basin is demonstrated considering the large study area however the model accuracy needs to be further modified zhang et al 2020b since the model is simulated in series the simulation errors of the previous model will be transmitted to the subsequence which will theoretically enlarge the errors of the final results although the total errors can be controlled by verifying the downstream observed records it is necessary to further improve each model to obtain more accurate intermediate process especially in ungauged areas technical innovations such as deep learning method and high spatial remote sensing oliveira et al 2021 zhi et al 2021 are promising way to assist model developers in error control many studies have also mentioned the feasibility read et al 2019 zhao et al 2015 some researchers have also mentioned that simulation in consecutive coupling may lead to some errors such as the calculation of the backwater effect in the reservoir area ma et al 2015 this defect can be avoided as far as possible by reasonable dividing the calculation range of each model for the main stream of the hydrodynamics operation coupled model in the tgd the modeling range starts from zhutuo the control station of the tgd area which means the effects of backwater in the reservoir area can be accurately calculated for some tributaries however the current model may not express the impact of backwater very well and it requires using more data to optimize model parameters as the largest hydroelectric reservoir in china the tgd plays a dominant role in changing the hydrologic regime of the yangtze river as far as the simulation results the flow of the midstream and downstream of the yangtze river decreased during flood season and impounding period after the regulation which is consistent with the primary functions of the tgd namely flood control and power generation jiang et al 2019 there is a difference that the flood control is more aimed at high flow in flood season while both high flow and low flow were intercepted by the tgd during impounding period chen et al 2016 moreover the increased flow in water supply period and drawdown period can also guarantee water use and navigation in the midstream and downstream fig 4 that is the tgd operation try to reduces the number of high flow occurrence and enlarges the minimum daily streamflow which leads the runoff process more uniform throughout the year and reduces the flow fluctuation guo et al 2021 the researches based on statistical methods illustrated that the flow variation of yichang hankou and datong are similar the flow decreased significantly in september october and november and increased in january and february for example the daily minimum flow at yichang increased from about 4200 m3 s to about 5700 m3 s chen et al 2016 wang et al 2020 which is consistent with the results in this paper however other studies have found that the flow at chenglingji also presents a trend of significant reduction but it is not obvious according to fig 4 b the reason for the difference may be that the interval confluence was assumed to be the same in this study while other studies considered the impacts such as climate change or human activities on the interval confluence wang et al 2020 wei et al 2014 furthermore both statistical and simulation methods show that the flow duration curves at yichang are significantly altered by tgd operation taking approximately 60 as the turning point when the exceedance probability is less than 60 the natural runoff is larger than that after tgd operation and vice versa wang et al 2016 this study presents the difference between the tgd operation and no reservoir construction hypothesis for various flow magnitude on the daily scale fig 7 more details can be revealed such as the envelope of deviation and the specific flow when extreme deviation occurs for main stations these details help managers gain a deeper understanding of the effect of the tgd operation meanwhile daily scale analysis is more suitable for further improvement of operation rules with these measures the reservoir capacity can be used more valid to reduce flood risk when extreme rainfall occurs especially for the yangtze river basin with concentrated rainfall season many researches have mentioned that the effect of the tgd on the mainstream of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river is also obviously related to interval inflow mei et al 2015 zhang et al 2020a without considering the river leakage the effect of tgd operation is quantified under the different proportions of the reservoir outflow and the interval inflow for four operation stages fig 8 in general the influence of the tgd operation is gradually deepened with the increase of the reservoir outflow it should be noted that the effect of the tgd operation is different even for a same flow ratio for example the flow deviation of hukou in 2018 and 1984 are 11 and 37 respectively such a huge gap may be due to the different runoff process and spatial temporal rainfall distribution razmkhah et al 2016 which means more investigations are needed in the further however some typical problems can be discussed based on the data for instance reports demonstrated that tgd operation have increased the lake river water level gradient during september and october which is a main factor for recession in poyang lake if the operation rules can be appropriately adjusted according to the characteristics of the interval confluence it may reduce the impact of the tgd on poyang lake and thus improve the habitat environment of migratory birds on the contrary when upstream and downstream encounter different flood frequencies e g the return period of flood is 100 years for upstream while the downstream flood frequencies is 20 years or vice versa the operation mode that enhances the influence of the tgd can be used to reduce the flood risk in the reservoir area and the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river with this large scale couple model a series of water issues of the yangtze river basin including climate and land use change ecological operation of the tgd et al could be revealed further studies will focus on these topics 6 conclusions in this paper a large scale hydrological and hydrodynamics coupled model which combines the dtvgm and the hydrodynamics operation coupled model was established in the yangtze river basin the effects of tgd operation on the flow regime in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river from 1970 to 2018 are analyzed based on the coupled model the major conclusions were as follows 1 the large scale hydrological and hydrodynamics coupled model can well simulate the water circulation process of the yangtze river basin the nses of most sites are above 0 75 and the res are below 15 during calibration and verification all evidences suggest that the coupled model performance is acceptable 2 the tgd operation mainly intercepts the high flood peak and increase the magnitude of low flow but it varies with the geographical location for yichang the annual average relative deviation of flow operated by the tgd is approximately 24 compared with the natural state while the value of chenglingji hankou hukou and datong is 8 5 12 8 except hukou the other four stations show the characteristics of increasing flow in water supply period and decreasing flow in impounding period 3 the tgd operation and interval inflow will jointly determine the flow characteristics of the mainstream in downstream of the yangtze river during water supply period the streamflow can increase by 6 33 according to the tgd operation but when impounding process starts streamflow shows a decreasing trend except hukou with the reduction ranged from about 7 20 for different stations for flood season the dam operation mainly intercepts high flood peaks while the average streamflow changes a little the high flood peaks at yichang can be reduced by 20 and the changes of high flood peaks in downstream reduce to no more than 10 due to the influence of interval inflow the deviations during drawdown period are almost below 10 when the tgd outflow is far beyond the interval inflow the effects of dam operation are enhanced and the effects are most significant for hukou compared with chenglingji hankou and datong during impounding period credit authorship contribution statement linhan yang conceptualization methodology writing original draft investigation results analysis sidong zeng methodology

8038,study region in the oil sands region of canada hydrology of rivers is strongly influenced by snowmelt and a shifting climate resulting in shortening of snow cover duration and increases in the frequency of rain events study focus to evaluate the importance of rain events to these rivers discharge and water quality sampling was conducted at river sites in this region two approaches were used to collect water quality samples 1 event based automated samplers that triggered repeated sampling in response to 10 increases in surface flow and 2 an intensive program of routine sampling at daily weekly or biweekly intervals from april 2013 to january 2014 new hydrological insights for the region the importance of rain events as contributors to loading of nutrients and priority pollutants differed temporally during fall when baseflow conditions prevailed average daily loads differed when calculated using routine only versus routine rain event data however on an annual basis the inclusion of rain event sampling did not change pollutant loads thus when assessing loads on an annual basis rain event sampling may not provide enough benefit to warrant the additional logistical considerations for this remote region however when monitoring focuses on capturing fall conditions efforts should be expanded to include rain event sampling in order to capture spikes in chemical concentration during this ecologically important time period predictions of a shorter snow season with more precipitation falling as rain rather than snow reinforce the need to adapt monitoring schemes to ensure that the timing and frequency of water chemistry sampling reflects changing climate and hydrological patterns keywords event based monitoring load nutrients priority pollutants oil sands 1 introduction the hydrology of rivers draining cold regions i e regions with snow and ice for much of the year is strongly influenced by the annual cycle of snow accumulation followed by snowmelt in these regions flows of more than 50 of the annual maximum daily flow occur during snowmelt costa and pomeroy 2019 chemical loads also increase during snowmelt a period generally lasting 2 4 weeks between april and june in northern latitudes because melt water has limited potential for infiltration through frozen soils e g rattan et al 2019 analyses of long term historical data are showing however significant changes in climatology of cold regions notably an increase in temperature that is greatest during winter shortening of annual snow cover duration and an increase in the frequency of rain events barnett et al 2005 beltaos and burrell 2003 burn 1994 prowse and beltaos 2002 with a changing climate reported throughout cold regions keenan and riley 2018 there is significant potential to underestimate chemical loads as the short duration yet intense rain events that are now more frequent may deliver more pollutants than previously acknowledged rivers in the oil sands region of northeastern alberta canada experience a climate typical of cold boreal regions notably a long snow cover period rapid seasonal snowmelt and intense localized summer and fall rain events woo et al 2008 monk et al 2011 this distinct seasonality in climate gives rise to a marked seasonal hydrology most 50 of the annual flow volume occurs during spring freshet due to melting snow and ice and is followed with the exception of convective rainstorms that produce 2 3 day spikes in discharge in late summer and early fall by a slow tapering of streamflow to base conditions that last from november when ice cover starts to form and remains until early april bush and lemmen 2019 analysis of long term data 1948 to 2016 for north eastern alberta showed a mean annual increase in temperature of 1 7 3 c driven by winter warming a shift in the timing of precipitation from proportionately less in winter and more in spring when it falls as rain rather than snow and a decrease in snow cover during the snow onset period of october to december bush and lemmen 2019 with warming and changes to precipitation patterns expected to continue or be exacerbated in future ipcc 2007 there is a strong likelihood of changes in the timing and magnitude of contaminant transport in streams traversing canada s oil sands region contaminants in streams draining canada s oil sands are derived from both natural outcrops of bitumen and mining of buried bitumen deposits bitumen is a dense highly viscous petroleum that contains a mixture of particulate organic material hydrocarbons metals and sulfur compounds who 2004 whilst contaminants found in bitumen can make their way to surface water via natural pathways groundwater seeps and erosion of river banks with exposed bitumen deposits oil sands mining operations have the potential to enhance the transfer of these components to surface waters as a result of both surface runoff particularly during the construction phase alexander et al 2017 and atmospheric long range transport during extraction and processing operations kirk et al 2014 kurek et al 2013 both of these methods can also facilitate the transport of pollutants outside the watershed although early studies reported that concentrations of metals e g as cd cu pb ni zn did not differ between river sites downstream of oil sands operations versus those in undeveloped locations conly et al 2007 headley et al 2001 2005 more recent findings show elevated concentrations of 13 priority pollutants kelly et al 2010 the fact that background levels of contaminants can be high due to natural contributions makes it difficult to quantify inputs and has led to conflicting reports about the significance of anthropogenic sources with a changing climate reported for the oil sands region lemmen et al 2004 there may be a greater need than previously recognized to sample water chemistry during and immediately after rain events in addition to during spring snowmelt and baseflow conditions to better understand the effect of these events on concentrations of pollutants in this region the objective of this study was to examine the influence of rain events on the concentration and load of 12 priority pollutants in the athabasca oil sands region antimony sb arsenic as beryllium be cadmium cd chromium cr copper cu lead pb nickel ni selenium se silver ag thallium tl and zinc zn as well as two nutrients nitrogen n phosphorus p for streams draining the athabasca oil sands region of north western alberta canada first we examined the influence of rain events on pollutant concentrations and loads during rain events i e 5 mm within 12 24 daytime period seasonally summer and fall and annually 2013 and 2014 second we put these findings into a spatial context and examined differences in loads only between upper and lower reaches of three watersheds with different types e g open pit vs in situ recovery and areal extent of athabasca oil sands operations lastly we assessed whether collecting event based samples would increase the accuracy of seasonal or annual load estimations for priority pollutants and macronutrients in these watersheds understanding the potential contribution of storm events has important implications for water management and the design of water quality monitoring programs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study design the study area

climate change canada at 6 sites fig 1 two sites upper and lower reach were located along 3 tributaries discharging to the athabasca river steepbank mackay and ells rivers the program included daily or alternate day routine sampling during snowmelt april may followed by weekly june biweekly july august or monthly sampling september november and then occasional under ice sampling 3 times winter for each site this resulted in a total of 35 samples in 2013 9 from summer may 31 august 31 and 3 from fall september 1 october 30 and 41 samples in 2014 10 from summer and 4 from fall summer sampling period captured the declining trend of spring snowmelt fig 2 in addition to routine sampling an intensive event based automated sampling program was undertaken at the same sites though for a shorter time period from september october 2013 and june october 2014 event based automated samplers isco 6712 teledyne ne were triggered for repeated sampling every 3 2014 or 6 2013 hours in response to either a 5 mm in rainwater 9 pin rain gauge attachment isco 6712 as above or b change in water level e g 2 cm change in depth over a defined period e g 30 min measured by pressure transducers hobo onset computer corporation ma once triggered a 250 ml sample of river water was collected and this procedure was repeated every three 2014 or six 2013 hours for a maximum of 8 samples in a 24 h period which were composited into two 1 l sample bottles sampling continued until water depth was below the threshold of the original depth measurement this rate of change program was developed for the three rivers based on average 2 sd fluctuations in water level depth to transducer during the open water sampling period using outlet data collected by the water survey of canada https wateroffice ec gc ca

discharge q see kerr et al 2016 moatar and meybeck 2005 eq 1 as concentrations were not measured every day for the entire study period the standard midpoint interpolation method was used to estimate daily loads between routine water quality sampling dates e g moatar and meybeck 2005 eq 2 seasonal loads for a given temporal period i e for a season or for the duration of a rain event were calculated as the integration of the daily load for a fixed time period δt there were no differences in how load was calculated between grab and autosamples 1 daily load ci qi 2 seasonal load i 1 n δt ci qi δt daily discharge data were obtained from water survey of canada wsc http wateroffice ec gc ca or alberta s regional aquatics monitoring program ramp http www ramp alberta org ramp aspx for each of the three lower reach sites discharge data were not available for upper reach sites and so discharge was estimated using an indirect approach at all six sites a pressure transducer logger hobo onset computer corporation ma was deployed that measured water level and temperature at 30 min intervals atmospheric pressure was also monitored concurrently at each site and these observations were used to correct the pressure readings recorded by the hobo logger resulting in pressure readings for each site that represented water depth a watershed specific correction factor was calculated for each site as the ratio of daily water levels measured at the lower reach gauged versus the upper reach ungauged site for further details see alexander et al 2017 wasiuta et al 2019 in brief these correction factors were determined by scaling discharge data from outlet sites by drainage area and water level at upper reach sites pressure transducers were also directly connected to autosamplers to trigger sampling based on changes in water level described above geographic information systems gis were used to determine catchment size at both upper and lower reach sites base layers were compiled from public sources e g nrcan atlas of canada v6 http atlas nrcan gc ca whereas athabasca oil sands areas agreements leases boundaries mineable area and approval boundaries were compiled from the former energy resource conservation board ercb now the alberta energy regulator aer and were formerly available from alberta energy e g https www energy alberta ca all gis data were analyzed using qgis http www qgis org 2 3 statistical approaches descriptive statistics mean and standard error se were used to compare concentrations of nutrients and priority pollutants across all sites for both routine and event based samples because routine monitoring was conducted more frequently during snowmelt and less frequently weekly to monthly during the remaining open water period we expressed concentrations on three seasonal time scales 1 snowmelt march 1 may 31 2 summer june 1 august 31 and 3 fall september 1 october 31 in both 2013 and 2014 the summer and fall sampling times coincided with deployment of autosamplers for event based sampling both concentrations and loads across all sites were assessed for normality using shapiro wilks test for normality with the shapiro test function in r r core team 2020 the data were found to deviate significantly p 0 05 from normal even after transformation and therefore non parametric analyses were employed for further statistical analyses concentrations were evaluated for correlation with discharge using spearman ranked correlation tests with the cor test function in r r core team 2020 metrics were considered to be correlated with discharge if rho 0 5 and p 0 01 differences in concentration between routine samples collected during summer and fall and event based samples were calculated using kruskal wallis tests computed with the kruskal test function in r r core team 2020 post hoc tests where appropriate were evaluated using the bonferroni adjustment loads were analyzed in two different ways in order to discern the importance of spatial differences reach scale versus seasonal gradients first we assessed the short term significance of rain events by comparing daily loads calculated using routine samples only versus event based samples averaged over the duration of rain events i e 5 mm within 12 24 day period with the data grouped by season summer versus fall year 2013 versus 2014 and spatial position in the watershed upper versus lower reach secondly we assessed the seasonal significance of rain events by comparing average daily loads calculated for an entire season using routine samples versus routine samples supplemented with event based samples with the data again grouped by season summer versus fall versus annual year 2013 versus 2014 and spatial position in the watershed upper vs lower reach we then calculated average daily loads over the entire time scale at each site and compared using kruskal wallis tests the percent error of the estimates calculated for the routine samples compared with routine event based estimates was then calculated to quantify the differences between the methods of measuring loads 3 results 3 1 hydrology all three rivers showed similar hydrological properties during both study years fig 2 discharge was greatest during snowmelt with flow during this period accounting for 62 68 69 75 and 69 71 of annual flow in the ells mackay and steepbank rivers respectively by comparison snowmelt flows in the three watersheds for the last 40 years averaged 55 4 56 3 and 46 3 of total annual flow in the ells 1975 2017 mackay 1971 2015 and steepbank 1972 2015 rivers respectively alexander and chambers 2016 sizable rain events 5 mm occurred after initial snowmelt during spring summer and fall in all three catchments fig 2 rainfall events 5 mm occurred on up to 4 occasions during autosampler deployment in 2013 and up to 17 occasions in 2014 table 1 events averaged 14 95 1 88 mm in fall 2013 8 93 0 49 mm in summer 2014 and 12 23 1 34 mm in fall 2014 for a given stream and season event based sampling captured 17 67 of the 5 mm rain events and 7 74 of the rain volume the number of events captured were greater in 2013 50 67 than 2014 8 57 in 2014 there were higher capture rates for the mackay and steepbank watersheds as compared to the ells table 1 fig 2 3 2 temporal comparisons in concentrations concentrations of 12 priority pollutants and two nutrients varied considerably among seasons snowmelt spring and fall across the two study years table 2 average daily concentrations were often correlated rho 0 5 p 0 05 with discharge all 14 parameters were correlated with discharge during snowmelt and summer for both 2013 and 2014 and a more variable number 2 13 parameters during fall comparison of concentrations with canadian water quality guidelines for protection of aquatic life ccme 2017 showed that as cd cr cu pb se and zn from individual samples exceeded guidelines during both event and routine sampling regimes albeit to varying degrees table 2 routine samples collected during spring snowmelt had the highest number of exceedances 7 of 10 parameters exceeded guidelines with a frequency of 2 46 of samples in contrast routine samples collected during fall had the lowest frequency of exceedances only 2 of 10 parameters exceeded guidelines with a frequency of 3 of samples exceedances occurred more frequently for event based samples than routine samples during fall 3 exceedances with a frequency of 1 24 in event based samples versus 0 exceedances in routine samples during fall 2013 and similarly 5 exceedances with a frequency of 1 2 in event based samples versus 2 exceedances with a frequency of 1 4 in routine samples during fall 2014 there were more exceedances 5 vs 4 with higher frequency 8 31 vs 1 24 in routine samples in the summer than event based table 2 comparison of routine versus event based samples showed that during fall event samples had on average greater concentrations tables 2 and 3 during fall 14 of 14 comparisons in 2013 and 8 of 14 comparisons in 2014 were greater for event based sampling the opposite was true during summer 2014 11 of 14 comparisons were greater for routine sampling whereas none were greater for event based sampling the parameters most likely to show elevated concentrations associated with fall event samples were sb be cd cr pb and zn whereas during summer highest concentrations were observed for tn tp be cd cr cu pb ni se ag and tl from routine samples 3 3 temporal and spatial pattern in loads average daily loads estimated for the duration of rain events differed when calculated using routine only samples versus event based samples from the same time period tables 4a and 5 rain event loads were greater p 0 05 when calculated using event based samples as opposed to routine samples for a total of 48 of 84 comparisons 57 all data combined when examined seasonally daily loads during rain events were greater when calculated using event based samples versus routine samples for 46 of 56 82 fall comparisons 2013 and 2014 data combined but only 2 of 28 7 summer comparisons spatially there was no observable difference between the frequency of greater loads calculated using event based samples as compared to routine samples for upper 24 of 41 57 versus lower 24 of 41 57 reaches certain parameters often had greater loads during rain events when calculated using event based samples for example sb cd cr pb ag tl and zn tables 4a and 5 although inclusion of event based samples resulted in greater estimates of daily loads during fall rain events tables 4a and 5 the influence of event sampling on load estimates was dampened when incorporated into a longer time period thus when daily loads at lower reach sites were expressed for an entire season only 6 of 14 46 comparisons during fall 2013 0 of 14 0 comparisons during summer 2014 and 5 of 14 36 comparisons during fall 2014 were greater with inclusion of event based samples tables 4b and 6 similar results were found for upper reach sites whereby the influence of event based sampling on daily loads was dampened when the time period was extended from days i e an event to an entire season moreover on an annual basis average daily loads exhibited no differences when calculated using samples from routine monitoring versus a combination of routine plus event based sampling 0 of 14 comparisons annually table s1 4 discussion analysis of chemical loads in three rivers draining canada s alberta oil sands region showed that the contribution of rain events to loading of nutrients and priority pollutants differed temporally during fall when baseflow conditions prevailed daily loads averaged over a rain event were significantly greater when event based samples as compared to only routine samples were included in calculations these improved estimates were particularly evident for parameters such as sb cd cr pb ag tl and zn in contrast the inclusion of summer and fall rain event samples did not change annual pollutant loads because of the overwhelming influence of snowmelt on annual loads overall this study supports the prevailing view that in the oil sands region of alberta the contribution from spring snowmelt to annual loads is profound thus if the purpose of water quality sampling is to accurately estimate annual loads then intensive monitoring during freshet followed by intermittent monitoring during other seasons is appropriate given the short lived effect of summer and fall rain events on chemical concentrations however studies investigating seasonal phenomena e g aquatic chemistry during summer or fall guideline exceedance or life history stage of a particular organism likely need to consider the magnitude of spikes in concentrations and loads associated with summer and fall rainstorms previous studies examining temporal variation in metal concentration in water bodies in the oil sands region of alberta have focused on either longer seasonal or annual e g alexander and chambers 2016 headley et al 2005 kurek et al 2013 or very short gerner et al 2017 guéguen et al 2011 lavoie et al 2012 shotyk et al 2017 time scales our results highlight the importance of including precipitation events in estimates of metal loads during periods of lower flow notably our results showed that during fall concentrations of nutrients and priority pollutants were higher for event based samples compared to routine samples as a result daily loads during fall were greater using calculated event based vs routine samples for 0 93 of comparisons however when event based data were incorporated into a longer term annual dataset the seasonal event signal was lost 0 of parameters were significantly higher for event based routine as compared to just routine sampling our analysis focused on 36 individual events and for every event direct comparison was made between loads calculated using routine only versus routine rain event data given that this study was conducted during the latter part of a more than 25 year increase in precipitation in the region we might expect to see even greater import of seasonal contributions in the future due to climate change see alexander et al 2017 http wateroffice ec gc ca the above finding is also consistent with reports from the literature showing that precision differs when calculating loads on a seasonal versus annual basis for example kerr et al 2016 showed that precision in measurements of solute loads for southern ontario streams differed between annual and monthly sampling such that precision was generally lower for seasonal load estimates relative to annual further kerr et al 2016 reported that highly soluble solutes that were positively correlated with discharge during spring flow periods tended to have a positive bias in annual load estimation whereas less soluble compounds were more likely to be underestimated in our study annual loads of many solutes were dominated by spring melt contributions such that seasonal loads would be influenced by baseflow and precipitation events making them inherently more variable similarly headley et al 2005 observed higher concentrations of metals in tributaries of the oil sands region during spring versus fall while these studies did not evaluate the influence of precipitation events droppo et al 2019 also working in canada s oil sands region showed elevated hydrocarbons in runoff following fall rain events such that average daily loads were up to 4 1 fold higher for event based samples as compared to routine sampling in our study significantly greater loads were calculated using routine event based data for the fall sampling period e g sb be pb and zn in both 2013 and 2014 resulting in higher load estimates than would otherwise be observed from routine monitoring in the region our findings and those of others show that over short time scales routine sampling may easily miss substantial contributions of elements or increase variability in solute measures if major rain events are not captured despite previous studies identifying differences in chemical concentrations between upper and lower reach sites along tributaries draining the oil sands region e g headley et al 2005 we did not find a consistent effect of inclusion of rain event samples on loads from upper and lower reach sites observations of average loads calculated from routine vs event based samples showed that differences in measured parameters between the upper and lower reach sites was largest during fall 2014 when more parameters 79 were significantly higher for event based sampling than routine in lower reaches as compared to the upper reach 57 in contrast during both fall 2013 and summer 2014 more parameters had significantly higher routine than event based loads in the upper reaches 100 and 14 respectively as compared to the lower reaches 93 and 0 respectively the lack of a clear spatial pattern could be due to a combination of natural and anthropogenic conditions first the ells and mackay rivers are surface water dominated 45 81 whereas the steepbank river has a sizable groundwater contribution 50 groundwater versus 23 surface water gibson et al 2016 this is consistent with the basic drainage patterns of these watersheds the upper tributaries of the ells and mackay run parallel with the lower catchments suggesting that these rivers overlay pronounced localized faults resulting in rapid changes in catchment grade fig 1 see gordon et al 2004 whereas the steepbank has a more u shaped drainage pattern and is known to deeply incise multiple geological strata of varying soft and hard consistencies prior et al 2019 second the extent of oil sands development differs among the watersheds specifically the percent of developed land relative to total watershed area is 3 79 1 06 and 0 68 for the steepbank ells and mackay respectively with an even greater comparative difference when only the upper catchment area is considered 1 54 0 79 and 0 16 for the steepbank ells and mackay respectively third muskeg type habitats are present in these watersheds particularly in the upper portions of catchments see atlas of alberta lakes 1990 mitchell and prepas 1990 and can confound water storage and drainage patterns complex interactions between the land and surface waters likely contribute to differences in the response of upper catchments to rain events resulting in variable fill and spill responses as the present study was conducted over a limited timescale additional study over multiple years is needed to establish the factors affecting spatial patterns in watershed chemistry in canada s oil sands region fall water quality monitoring was until recently the norm with the focus on sampling during base flow but not during rain events e g culp et al 2021 hatfield consultants partnership 2009 this sampling period was chosen on the assumption that any pollutants lost as a result of mining operations were likely transported by seepage or overland flow pathways and thus would be present in highest concentrations during baseflow effective monitoring of northern river systems requires knowledge not only of optimal sampling locations but also of optimal timing our results highlight the importance of sampling during rain events especially during autumn baseflow periods in order to capture peak concentrations determine frequency of guideline exceedance and investigate the importance of seasonal flux collection of a single base flow measure of water during biological sampling overlooks both longer term periods e g preceding months to entire seasons and fall rain events to which sampled organisms are exposed if rain events are not sampled during periods dominated by baseflow there is a bias toward lower concentrations and loads of nutrient and priority pollutant loads monitoring programs that sample during baseline conditions in order for example to successfully capture aquatic biota would benefit from incorporating the additional chemical variability associated with rain events 5 conclusions the contribution of rain events to chemical daily loads varies temporally during fall when baseflow conditions prevailed average loads were lower when calculated using routine only data versus routine rain event data however on an annual basis the inclusion of rain event sampling did not significantly change estimated pollutant loads largely because of the overwhelming influence of snowmelt on annual load estimates temporal scaling of the influence of rain events on elemental loads has implications for the design of water and ecological quality monitoring programs if a sampling campaign spans only a few days or weeks it is critical that all streams be sampled during similar weather conditions so as to avoid misleading comparisons of chemistry from streams sampled during or following a rain event versus streams sampled under dry or even drought like conditions alexander et al 2020 headley et al 2005 in the cold regions of northern alberta canada our results showed that under the present climatological conditions the contribution of rain events to seasonal or annual element loads is negligible if a sampling campaign spans months or years however if a sampling campaign focuses only on baseflow conditions and neglects rain events e g during fall concentrations and loads for the event and even the entire baseflow period can be seriously under estimated which may have important implications for assessments of the health of aquatic biota evidence presented here showcases this importance with respect to exceedances of water quality guidelines where more parameters showed exceedances and with greater frequency during fall for event based sampling regimes as compared to the more standard routine sampling climate change models predict warmer temperatures by 5 c annually and as much as 8 c in winter a 1 2 week advance in snowmelt an increase in precipitation quantity by 20 overall and by 30 during winter and variability more extreme with more precipitation occurring in fewer days in canada s oil sands region by the end of this century ipcc 2007 jiang et al 2017 the predictions of a shorter snow season with more precipitation falling as rain rather than snow reinforce the need for adaptive management of monitoring programs to ensure that in future the timing of water chemistry sampling is consistent with the changing pattern in frequency and intensity of precipitation credit authorship

frequency of rain events study focus to evaluate the importance of rain events to these rivers discharge and water quality sampling was conducted at river sites in this region two approaches were used to collect water quality samples 1 event based automated samplers that triggered repeated sampling in response to 10 increases in surface flow and 2 an intensive program of routine sampling at daily weekly or biweekly intervals from april 2013 to january 2014 new hydrological insights for the region the importance of rain events as contributors to loading of nutrients and priority pollutants differed temporally during fall when baseflow conditions prevailed average daily loads differed when calculated using routine only versus routine rain event data however on an annual basis the inclusion of rain event sampling did not change pollutant loads thus when assessing loads on an annual basis rain event sampling may not provide enough benefit to warrant the additional logistical considerations for this remote region however when monitoring focuses on capturing fall conditions efforts should be expanded to include rain event sampling in order to capture spikes in chemical concentration during this ecologically important time period predictions of a shorter snow season with more precipitation falling as rain rather than snow reinforce the need to adapt monitoring schemes to ensure that the timing and frequency of water chemistry sampling reflects changing climate and hydrological patterns keywords event based monitoring load nutrients priority pollutants oil sands 1 introduction the hydrology of rivers draining cold regions i e regions with snow and ice for much of the year is strongly influenced by the annual cycle of snow accumulation followed by snowmelt in these regions flows of more than 50 of the annual maximum daily flow occur during snowmelt costa and pomeroy 2019 chemical loads also increase during snowmelt a period generally lasting 2 4 weeks between april and june in northern latitudes because melt water has limited potential for infiltration through frozen soils e g rattan et al 2019 analyses of long term historical data are showing however significant changes in climatology of cold regions notably an increase in temperature that is greatest during winter shortening of annual snow cover duration and an increase in the frequency of rain events barnett et al 2005 beltaos and burrell 2003 burn 1994 prowse and beltaos 2002 with a changing climate reported throughout cold regions keenan and riley 2018 there is significant potential to underestimate chemical loads as the short duration yet intense rain events that are now more frequent may deliver more pollutants than previously acknowledged rivers in the oil sands region of northeastern alberta canada experience a climate typical of cold boreal regions notably a long snow cover period rapid seasonal snowmelt and intense localized summer and fall rain events woo et al 2008 monk et al 2011 this distinct seasonality in climate gives rise to a marked seasonal hydrology most 50 of the annual flow volume occurs during spring freshet due to melting snow and ice and is followed with the exception of convective rainstorms that produce 2 3 day spikes in discharge in late summer and early fall by a slow tapering of streamflow to base conditions that last from november when ice cover starts to form and remains until early april bush and lemmen 2019 analysis of long term data 1948 to 2016 for north eastern alberta showed a mean annual increase in temperature of 1 7 3 c driven by winter warming a shift in the timing of precipitation from proportionately less in winter and more in spring when it falls as rain rather than snow and a decrease in snow cover during the snow onset period of october to december bush and lemmen 2019 with warming and changes to precipitation patterns expected to continue or be exacerbated in future ipcc 2007 there is a strong likelihood of changes in the timing and magnitude of contaminant transport in streams traversing canada s oil sands region contaminants in streams draining canada s oil sands are derived from both natural outcrops of bitumen and mining of buried bitumen deposits bitumen is a dense highly viscous petroleum that contains a mixture of particulate organic material hydrocarbons metals and sulfur compounds who 2004 whilst contaminants found in bitumen can make their way to surface water via natural pathways groundwater seeps and erosion of river banks with exposed bitumen deposits oil sands mining operations have the potential to enhance the transfer of these components to surface waters as a result of both surface runoff particularly during the construction phase alexander et al 2017 and atmospheric long range transport during extraction and processing operations kirk et al 2014 kurek et al 2013 both of these methods can also facilitate the transport of pollutants outside the watershed although early studies reported that concentrations of metals e g as cd cu pb ni zn did not differ between river sites downstream of oil sands operations versus those in undeveloped locations conly et al 2007 headley et al 2001 2005 more recent findings show elevated concentrations of 13 priority pollutants kelly et al 2010 the fact that background levels of contaminants can be high due to natural contributions makes it difficult to quantify inputs and has led to conflicting reports about the significance of anthropogenic sources with a changing climate reported for the oil sands region lemmen et al 2004 there may be a greater need than previously recognized to sample water chemistry during and immediately after rain events in addition to during spring snowmelt and baseflow conditions to better understand the effect of these events on concentrations of pollutants in this region the objective of this study was to examine the influence of rain events on the

pollutant concentrations and loads during rain events i e 5 mm within 12 24 daytime period seasonally summer and fall and annually 2013 and 2014 second we put these findings into a spatial context and examined differences in loads only between upper and lower reaches of three watersheds with different types e g open pit vs in situ recovery and areal extent of athabasca oil sands operations lastly we assessed whether collecting event based samples would increase the accuracy of seasonal or annual load estimations for priority pollutants and macronutrients in these watersheds understanding the

climate change canada at 6 sites fig 1 two sites upper and lower reach were located along 3 tributaries discharging to the athabasca river steepbank mackay and ells rivers the program included daily or alternate day routine sampling during snowmelt april may followed by weekly june biweekly july august or monthly sampling september november and then occasional under ice sampling 3 times winter

period captured the declining trend of spring snowmelt fig 2 in addition to routine sampling an intensive event based automated sampling program was undertaken at the same sites though for a shorter time period from september october 2013 and june october 2014 event based automated samplers isco 6712 teledyne ne were triggered for repeated sampling every 3 2014 or 6 2013 hours in response to

which were composited into two 1 l sample bottles sampling continued until water depth was below the threshold of the original depth measurement this rate of change program was developed for the three

calculated as the integration of the daily load for a fixed time period δt there were no differences in how load was calculated between grab and autosamples 1 daily load ci qi 2 seasonal load i 1 n δt ci qi δt daily discharge data were obtained from water survey of canada wsc http wateroffice ec gc ca or alberta s regional aquatics monitoring program ramp http www ramp alberta org ramp aspx for each of the three lower reach sites discharge data were not available for upper reach sites and so discharge was estimated using an indirect approach at all six sites a pressure transducer logger hobo onset computer corporation ma was deployed that measured water level and temperature at 30 min intervals atmospheric pressure was also monitored concurrently at each site and these observations were used to correct the pressure readings recorded by the hobo logger resulting in pressure readings for each site that represented water depth a watershed specific correction factor was calculated for each site as the ratio of daily water levels measured at the lower reach gauged versus the upper reach ungauged site for further details see alexander et al 2017 wasiuta et al 2019 in brief these correction factors were determined by scaling discharge data from outlet sites by drainage area and water level at upper reach sites pressure transducers were also directly connected to autosamplers to trigger sampling based on changes in water level described above geographic information systems gis were used to determine catchment size at both upper and lower reach sites base layers were compiled from public sources e g nrcan atlas of canada v6 http atlas nrcan gc ca whereas athabasca oil sands areas agreements leases boundaries mineable area and approval boundaries were compiled from the former energy resource conservation board ercb now the alberta energy regulator aer and were formerly available from alberta energy e g https www energy alberta ca all gis data were analyzed using qgis http www qgis org 2 3 statistical approaches descriptive statistics mean and standard error se were used to compare concentrations of nutrients and priority pollutants across all sites for both routine and event based samples because routine monitoring was conducted more frequently during snowmelt and less frequently weekly to monthly during the remaining open water period we expressed concentrations on three seasonal time scales 1 snowmelt march 1 may 31 2 summer june 1 august 31 and 3 fall september 1 october 31 in both 2013 and 2014 the summer and fall sampling times coincided with deployment of autosamplers for event based sampling both concentrations and loads across all sites were assessed for normality using shapiro wilks test for normality with the shapiro test function in r r core team 2020 the data were found to deviate significantly p 0 05 from normal even after transformation and therefore non parametric analyses were employed for further statistical analyses concentrations were evaluated for correlation with discharge using spearman ranked correlation tests with the cor test function in r r core team 2020 metrics were considered to be correlated with discharge if rho 0 5 and p 0 01 differences in concentration between routine samples collected during summer and fall and event based samples were calculated using kruskal wallis tests computed with the kruskal test function in r r core team 2020 post hoc tests where appropriate were evaluated using the bonferroni adjustment loads were analyzed in two different ways in order to discern the importance of spatial differences reach scale versus seasonal gradients first we assessed the short term significance of rain events by comparing daily loads calculated using routine samples only versus event based samples averaged over the duration of rain events i e 5 mm within 12 24 day period with the data grouped by season summer versus fall year 2013 versus 2014 and spatial position in the watershed upper versus lower reach secondly we assessed the seasonal significance of rain events by comparing average daily loads calculated for an entire season using routine samples versus routine samples supplemented with event based samples with the data again grouped by season summer versus fall versus annual year 2013 versus 2014 and spatial position in the watershed upper vs lower reach we then calculated average daily loads over the entire time scale at each site and compared using kruskal wallis tests the percent error of the estimates calculated for the routine samples compared with routine event based estimates was then calculated to quantify the differences between the methods of measuring loads 3 results 3 1 hydrology all three rivers showed similar hydrological properties during both study years fig 2 discharge was greatest during snowmelt with flow during this period accounting for 62 68 69 75 and 69 71 of annual flow in the ells mackay and steepbank rivers respectively by comparison snowmelt flows in the three watersheds for the last 40 years averaged 55 4 56 3 and 46 3 of total annual flow in the ells 1975 2017 mackay 1971 2015 and steepbank 1972 2015 rivers respectively alexander and chambers 2016 sizable rain events 5 mm occurred after initial snowmelt during spring summer and fall in all three catchments fig 2 rainfall events 5 mm occurred on up to 4 occasions during autosampler deployment in 2013 and up to 17 occasions in 2014 table 1 events averaged 14 95 1 88 mm in fall 2013 8 93 0 49 mm in summer 2014 and 12 23 1 34 mm in fall 2014 for a given stream and season event based sampling captured 17 67 of the 5 mm rain events and 7 74 of the rain volume the number of events captured were greater in 2013 50 67 than 2014 8 57 in 2014 there were higher capture rates for the mackay and steepbank watersheds as compared to the ells table 1 fig 2 3 2 temporal comparisons in concentrations concentrations of 12 priority pollutants and two nutrients varied considerably among seasons snowmelt spring and fall across the two study years table 2 average daily concentrations were often correlated rho 0 5 p 0 05 with discharge all 14 parameters were correlated with discharge during snowmelt and summer for both 2013 and 2014 and a more variable number 2 13 parameters during fall comparison of concentrations with canadian water quality guidelines for protection of aquatic life ccme 2017 showed that as cd cr cu pb se and zn from individual samples exceeded guidelines during both event and routine sampling regimes albeit to varying degrees table 2 routine samples collected during spring snowmelt had the highest number of exceedances 7 of 10 parameters exceeded guidelines with a frequency of 2 46 of samples in contrast routine samples collected during fall had the lowest frequency of exceedances only 2 of 10 parameters exceeded guidelines with a frequency of 3 of samples exceedances occurred more frequently for event based samples than routine samples during fall 3 exceedances with a frequency of 1 24 in event based samples versus 0 exceedances in routine samples during fall 2013 and similarly 5 exceedances with a frequency of 1 2 in event based samples versus 2 exceedances with a frequency of 1 4 in routine samples during fall 2014 there were more exceedances 5 vs 4 with higher frequency 8 31 vs 1 24 in routine samples in the summer than event based table 2 comparison of routine versus event based samples showed that during fall event samples had on average greater concentrations tables 2 and 3 during fall 14 of 14 comparisons in 2013 and 8 of 14 comparisons in 2014 were greater for event based sampling the opposite was true during summer 2014 11 of 14 comparisons were greater for routine sampling whereas none were greater for event based sampling the parameters most likely to show elevated concentrations associated with fall event samples were sb be cd cr pb and zn whereas during summer highest concentrations were observed for tn tp be cd cr cu pb ni se ag and tl from routine samples 3 3 temporal and spatial pattern in loads average daily loads estimated for the duration of rain events differed when calculated using routine only samples versus event based samples from the same time period tables 4a and 5 rain event loads were greater p 0 05 when calculated using event based samples as opposed to routine samples for a total of 48 of 84 comparisons 57 all data combined when examined seasonally daily loads during rain events were greater when calculated using event based samples versus routine samples for 46 of 56 82 fall comparisons 2013 and 2014 data combined but only 2 of 28 7 summer comparisons spatially there was no observable difference between the frequency of greater loads calculated using event based samples as compared to routine samples for upper 24 of 41 57 versus lower 24 of 41 57 reaches certain parameters often had greater loads during rain events when calculated using event based samples for example sb cd cr pb ag tl and zn tables 4a and 5 although inclusion of event based samples resulted in greater estimates of daily loads during fall rain events tables 4a and 5 the influence of event sampling on load estimates was dampened when incorporated into a longer time period thus when daily loads at lower reach sites were expressed for an entire season only 6 of 14 46 comparisons during fall 2013 0 of 14 0 comparisons during summer 2014 and 5 of 14 36 comparisons during fall 2014 were greater with inclusion of event based samples tables 4b and 6 similar results were found for upper reach sites whereby the influence of event based sampling on daily loads was dampened when the time period was extended from days i e an event to an entire season moreover on an annual basis average daily loads exhibited no differences when calculated using samples from routine monitoring versus a combination of routine plus event based sampling 0 of 14 comparisons annually table s1 4 discussion analysis of chemical loads in three rivers draining canada s alberta oil sands region showed that the contribution of rain events to loading of nutrients and priority pollutants differed temporally during fall when baseflow conditions prevailed daily loads averaged over a rain event were significantly greater when event based samples as compared to only routine samples were included in calculations these improved estimates were particularly evident for parameters such as sb cd cr pb ag tl and zn in contrast the inclusion of summer and fall rain event samples did not change annual pollutant loads because of the overwhelming influence of snowmelt on annual loads overall this study supports the prevailing view that in the oil sands region of alberta the contribution from spring snowmelt to annual loads is profound thus if the purpose of water quality sampling is to accurately estimate annual loads then intensive monitoring during freshet followed by intermittent monitoring during other seasons is appropriate given the short lived effect of summer and fall rain events on chemical concentrations however studies investigating seasonal phenomena e g aquatic chemistry during summer or fall guideline exceedance or life history stage of a particular organism likely need to consider the magnitude of spikes in concentrations and loads associated with summer and fall rainstorms previous studies examining temporal variation in metal concentration in water bodies in the oil sands region of alberta have focused on either longer seasonal or annual e g alexander and chambers 2016 headley et al 2005 kurek et al 2013 or very short gerner et al 2017 guéguen et al 2011 lavoie et al 2012 shotyk et al 2017 time scales our results highlight the importance of including precipitation events in estimates of metal loads during periods of lower flow notably our results showed that during fall concentrations of nutrients and priority pollutants were higher for event based samples compared to routine samples as a result daily loads during fall were greater using calculated event based vs routine samples for 0 93 of comparisons however when event based data were incorporated into a longer term annual dataset the seasonal event signal was lost 0 of parameters were significantly higher for event based routine as compared to just routine sampling our analysis focused on 36 individual events and for every event direct comparison was made between loads calculated using routine only versus routine rain event data given that this study was conducted during the latter part of a more than 25 year increase in precipitation in the region we might expect to see even greater import of seasonal contributions in the future due to climate change see alexander et al 2017 http wateroffice ec gc ca the above finding is also consistent with reports from the literature showing that precision differs when calculating loads on a seasonal versus annual basis for example kerr et al 2016 showed that precision in measurements of solute loads for southern ontario streams differed between annual and monthly sampling such that precision was generally lower for seasonal load estimates relative to annual further kerr et al 2016 reported that highly soluble solutes that were positively correlated with discharge during spring flow periods tended to have a positive bias in annual load estimation whereas less soluble compounds were more likely to be underestimated in our study annual loads of many solutes were dominated by spring melt contributions such that seasonal loads would be influenced by baseflow and precipitation events making them inherently more variable similarly headley et al 2005 observed higher concentrations of metals in tributaries of the oil sands region during spring versus fall while these studies did not evaluate the influence of precipitation events droppo et al 2019 also working in canada s oil sands region showed elevated hydrocarbons in runoff following fall rain events such that average daily loads were up to 4 1 fold higher for event based samples as compared to routine sampling in our study significantly greater loads were calculated using routine event based data for the fall sampling period e g sb be pb and zn in both 2013 and 2014 resulting in higher load estimates than would otherwise be observed from routine monitoring in the region our findings and those of others show that over short time scales routine sampling may easily miss substantial contributions of elements or increase variability in solute measures if major rain events are not captured despite previous studies identifying differences in chemical concentrations between upper and lower reach sites along tributaries draining the oil sands region e g headley et al 2005 we did not find a consistent effect of inclusion of rain event samples on loads from upper and lower reach sites observations of average loads calculated from routine vs event based samples showed that differences in measured parameters between the upper and lower reach sites was largest during fall 2014 when more parameters 79 were significantly higher for event based sampling than routine in lower reaches as compared to the upper reach 57 in contrast during both fall 2013 and summer 2014 more parameters had significantly higher routine than event based loads in the upper reaches 100 and 14 respectively as compared to the lower reaches 93 and 0 respectively the lack of a clear spatial pattern could be due to a combination of natural and anthropogenic conditions first the ells and mackay rivers are surface water dominated 45 81 whereas the steepbank river has a sizable groundwater contribution 50 groundwater versus 23 surface water gibson et al 2016 this is consistent with the basic drainage patterns of these watersheds the upper tributaries of the ells and mackay run parallel with the lower catchments suggesting that these rivers overlay pronounced localized faults resulting in rapid changes in catchment grade fig 1 see gordon et al 2004 whereas the steepbank has a more u shaped drainage pattern and is known to deeply incise multiple geological strata of varying soft and hard consistencies prior et al 2019 second the extent of oil sands development differs among the watersheds specifically the percent of developed land relative to total watershed area is 3 79 1 06 and 0 68 for the steepbank ells and mackay respectively with an even greater comparative difference when only the upper catchment area is considered 1 54 0 79 and 0 16 for the steepbank ells and mackay respectively third muskeg type habitats are present in these watersheds particularly in the upper portions of catchments see atlas of alberta lakes 1990 mitchell and prepas 1990 and can confound water storage and drainage patterns complex interactions between the land and surface waters likely contribute to differences in the response of upper catchments to rain events resulting in variable fill and spill responses as the present study was conducted over a limited timescale additional study over multiple years is needed to establish the factors affecting spatial patterns in watershed chemistry in canada s oil sands region fall water quality monitoring was until recently the norm with the focus on sampling during base flow but not during rain events e g culp et al 2021 hatfield consultants partnership 2009 this sampling period was chosen on the assumption that any pollutants lost as a result of mining operations were likely transported by seepage or overland flow pathways and thus would be present in highest concentrations during baseflow effective monitoring of northern river systems requires knowledge not only of optimal sampling locations but also of optimal timing our results highlight the importance of sampling during rain events especially during autumn baseflow periods in order to capture peak concentrations determine frequency of guideline exceedance and investigate the importance of seasonal flux collection of a single base flow measure of water during biological sampling overlooks both longer term periods e g preceding months to entire seasons and fall rain events to which sampled organisms are exposed if rain events are not sampled during periods dominated by baseflow there is a bias toward lower concentrations and loads of nutrient and priority pollutant loads monitoring programs that sample during baseline conditions in order for example to successfully capture aquatic biota would benefit from incorporating the additional chemical variability associated with rain events 5 conclusions the contribution of rain events to chemical daily loads varies temporally during fall when baseflow conditions prevailed average loads were lower when calculated using routine only data versus routine rain event data however on an annual basis the inclusion of rain event sampling did not significantly change estimated pollutant loads largely because of the overwhelming influence of snowmelt on annual load estimates temporal scaling of the influence of rain events on elemental loads has implications for the design of water and ecological quality monitoring programs if a sampling campaign spans only a few days or weeks it is critical that all streams be sampled during similar weather conditions so as to avoid misleading comparisons of chemistry from streams sampled during or following a rain event versus streams sampled under dry or even drought like conditions alexander et al 2020 headley et al 2005 in the cold regions of northern alberta canada our results showed that under the present climatological conditions the contribution of rain events to seasonal or annual element loads is negligible if a sampling campaign spans months or years however if a sampling campaign focuses only on baseflow conditions and neglects rain events e g during fall concentrations and loads for the event and even the entire baseflow period can be seriously under estimated which may have important implications for assessments of the health of aquatic biota evidence presented here showcases this importance with respect to exceedances of water quality guidelines where more parameters showed exceedances and with greater frequency during fall for event based sampling regimes as compared to the more standard routine sampling climate change models predict warmer temperatures by 5 c annually and as much as 8 c in winter a 1 2 week advance in snowmelt an increase in precipitation quantity by 20 overall and by 30 during winter and variability more extreme with more precipitation occurring in fewer days in canada s oil sands region by the end of this century ipcc 2007 jiang et al 2017 the predictions of a shorter snow season with more precipitation falling as rain rather than snow reinforce the need for adaptive management of monitoring programs to ensure that in future the timing of water chemistry sampling is consistent with the changing pattern in frequency and intensity of precipitation credit authorship

8039,study region water resource management relies fundamentally on our ability to monitor climate forcing variability especially in tropical mountainous environment where the temporal and spatial variability of rainfall strongly controls the dynamics of the water resource in west java island rainfall temporal and spatial distribution significantly varies in function of regional climatology and volcanoes morphology while accessibility issues and the complexity of climatic phenomena notably are limitations for reliable rainfall ground instrumentation study focus here we assess the ability of climate reanalyses chelsa and terraclimate and satellite products chirps in capturing rainfall high resolution spatial variability the accuracy of rainfall amounts variability and dynamics of each global product is estimated using the three component of kling gupta efficiency score as direct statistical comparison is influenced by resolution issues our approach is completed by a process based one the spatial and orographic rainfall patterns of the global products are analyzed according to known climatic phenomena hydrological insights it appears that terraclimate provides the most accurate and stable estimation for temporal monitoring chirps shows consistent rainfall patterns with atmospheric circulation and volcanoes morphology but overestimates overall rainfall amounts this study presents a methodology for assessing global climatic products over poorly instrumented areas the results demonstrate that high resolution global products are somewhat interesting for water resources management however several temporal and spatial biases still limit their integration for operational purposes keywords water resource volcanic island tropical climate high resolution rainfall product climatic reanalysis remote sensing 1 introduction in volcanic islands water demand for irrigation drinking water industry etc is more and more satisfied by groundwater as surface water may not be available during the dry season and may also be of poor quality charlier et al 2011 lachassagne et al 2014 vittecoq et al 2019 on such geological settings volcanic aquifers are usually considered as highly productive which means that the volcanic rocks have a high hydraulic conductivity that allows a high discharge to be pumped often more than 100 m3 h per borewell charlier et al 2011 lachassagne et al 2014 vittecoq et al 2019 due to its utmost importance such groundwater resource must be sustainably managed which means that the groundwater abstraction should not on average exceed the average recharge rate of the considered aquifer thus groundwater resource sustainability is highly dependent on the variability of climatic forcing in indonesia especially in java island the exponential raise of water demand for agriculture industry and domestic water use gradually increases the stress on the available groundwater resource previous studies demonstrated that aquifer recharge may occur along all the volcano slopes dumont et al 2021 toulier et al 2019 and that aquifer recharge is thus highly dependent on the spatial and temporal patterns of rainfall and evapotranspiration these patterns highly depend on the altitudinal climatic variability which can be very high in such a tropical humid and mountainous setting and can hardly be characterized with sparse ground rain gauges notably for cost and accessibility reasons in indonesia the climate is characterized by a tropical seasonality with a dry season from april to october and a wet period from november to march aldrian and susanto 2003 in addition the climatic variability is impacted by several factors java island is located nearby the equator and surrounded by the indo pacific warm pool ipwp where the hadley cell and the walker circulations converge yielding several specific rainfall regimes over indonesia aldrian and susanto 2003 the first climatic driver is induced by the asian australian monsoon affecting the indonesian climate with circulations originating from the northwest during the wet season december to february while southwest winds occur during the dry season june to july fig 1 aldrian and susanto 2003 as syakur et al 2013 chang et al 2005 the second climatic driver comes from steep topography of young volcanoes which impacts the circulation of the hot and humid air masses generated by the ipwp leading to strong spatial and temporal rainfall variability houze 2012 qian 2008 sobel et al 2011 this orographic influence varies according to the seasons and the evolution of the inversion layer

by el niño southern oscillation enso and the indian ocean dipole iod as syakur et al 2014 lestari et al 2018 qian et al 2010 these two interconnected regional phenomena create high interannual climatic variability over indonesia impacting both monsoon and orographic processes in hydrogeological studies with a perspective of water resource management the characterization of such variability is usually addressed with the help of dense ground rain gauge networks charlier et al 2011 toulier et al 2019 vittecoq et al 2020 however recent andesitic volcanoes are characterized by steep slopes limiting access at medium to high elevation thus rain gauge monitoring is generally concentrated in the valleys between the volcanoes limiting the understanding of orographic effects induced by volcano slopes and dominant wind orientations satgé et al 2019 in order to complete or replace ground rain gauge data global products are targeted to provide spatially and temporally continuous climatic dataset sun et al 2018 these datasets are generally characterized by large grids with sizes ranging from 0 5 to 2 5 such resolutions are not suited to monitor orographic effects on volcano slopes nevertheless recent development of high resolution downscaling methodologies is opening up new opportunities at local scale fick and hijmans 2017 hersbach et al 2020 global products are generally derived from the interpolation of ground rain gauges data becker et al 2013 dee et al 2011 or from the processing of remote sensing data huffman et al 2007 both approaches lead to uncertainties in the estimation of rainfall volumes and variability climatic reanalysis relies on ground data availability and the accuracy of interpolation methods satellite based rainfall products are indirect measurements microwaves or infrared of low earth orbital the rainfall monitoring of short precipitation events is inaccurate due to the sampling rates of the satellites in mountainous settings the presence of warm clouds could create similar signals as rainy clouds hence biasing the satellite estimates satgé et al 2019 in order to assess the validity of global products several methodologies have been developed the first one consists in direct comparisons of ground rain gauge data with global products this approach faces several limits such as the quality of ground monitoring and the difference of resolution the point scale monitoring of rain gauge station may not represent areal precipitation captured by global products tang et al 2018 demonstrated that the smaller the number of stations the more the comparison will underestimate the quality of the overall products this resolution bias can be solved by using ground radar signals that monitor rainfall over large areas in a distributed way satgé et al 2019 nevertheless the estimation of rainfall from ground radar is complex and it is biased in mountainous areas zeng et al 2018 the second approach consists in analyzing the sensitivity of hydrological modelling to global products maggioni and massari 2018 satgé et al 2019 several studies analyzed global products performance over mountainous area in andean plateau elgamal et al 2017 satgé et al 2019 african eastern plateau dinku et al 2008 gebremicael et al 2017 goshime et al 2019 tibetan plateau alazzy et al 2017 shrestha et al 2017 and even recently over tropical islands bathelemy et al in review nevertheless these studies evaluated global products at regional scales from few to dozen earth degrees which does not provide specific guidance for the management of local groundwater resources at a scale from 10 to a few 1000 km2 our study takes part of a multidisciplinary project for groundwater management on headwater catchment of jakarta on java island the studied area of about 4000 km² includes three indonesian stratovolcanoes fig 1 b salak 2200 m a s l gede 2958 m a s l and pangrango 3019 m a s l aligned from north to south a large valley separates the salak from the gede pangrango that are embedded together forming a single more massive edifice these three volcanoes are a portion of the indonesian volcanic arc extending from sumatra to east java and to the eastern chain of islands including bali lombok and flores orographic effects induced by the combination of the volcanic chain and regional winds direction might differ spatially and evolve during the year fig 1 a according to the maps of monthly wind see supplementary material a the climate of the northern slopes should be mainly impacted by atmospheric circulations from asia while the southern part might be more impacted by australian climatic conditions finally climatic conditions in the valley might be largely influenced by local processes induced by topographic irregularities in order to understand rainfall patterns in a such limited area impacted by local climatic phenomenon we compare scarce ground rain gauge data with three global products chelsa a 1 km grid length product from era interim reanalysis downscaling terra a 4 km grid length dataset from worldclim and cru reanalysis downscaling and chirps a 5 km lateral resolution downscaling of tmpa 3b42 remote sensing dataset abatzoglou et al 2018 funk et al 2015 karger et al 2017 the temporal resolution of the global products is relatively coarse up to one month but still interesting for water resource management applications the first objective of this study is to estimate the accuracy of these three global products over tropical mountainous areas using scarce ground rain gauge data given that there is no rainfall amount monitoring derived from ground radar data available and that river discharge monitoring dataset in the sector are too short and incomplete the quantitative evaluation of global product relies only on ground gauge data as such comparison is biased by resolution issue the second objective is to provide a process based analysis of spatial rainfall patterns and orographic effects this analysis relies on the comparison of global and ground rainfall patterns with local spatial trends and orographic effects from previous studies in tropical island finally these results will help to evaluate whether global products are accurate enough to be used for the sustainable management of groundwater resources the combination of quantitative and qualitative analyses will provide an overview of the strengths and limits of ground and global monitoring products to quantify rainfall over tropical volcanoes for operational groundwater resource management 2 material and method 2 1 ground rain gauges in the area the daily monitoring dataset from 34 ground rain gauge was collected a quality check was performed for each station using cumulative and double mass curves the purpose of this procedure is to ensure that each station temporal dynamics is consistent with neighboring gauges as well as with climatological knowledge after this quality check 15 stations from two providers have been conserved 4 stations from bmkg 1 1 badan meteorologi klimatologi dan geofisika www bmkg go id and 11 from pusair 2 2 pusat penelitan dan pengenbangan sumber daya air http www pusair pu go id fig 1 b table 1 in order to compare these data to global products monthly total rainfall have been calculated when less than 10 of the month data is missing these stations are mainly located in the valleys at low elevation between 133 and 1134 m average 510 m in addition the spatial distribution of ground stations is highly heterogeneous with a concentration in the valley between mt salak and mt pangrango as well as in the northern slope of mt salak and southern part of mt gede fig 1 b 2 2 global products in this study we do not intend to provide an exhaustive overview of all available products the objective is to provide a detailed assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the different high resolution global products in such tropical orographic settings the global rainfall products have been selected according to three requirements i a lateral resolution below 10 km to analyze spatial variability ii a time series long enough to analyze temporal variability and iii several reanalysis and remote sensing protocols to discuss the relative merits of each method three global products have been selected

used to correct for chirps in west java is located in a mountainous area 2 3 objective 1 temporal ground global products quantitative evaluation the first objective of the analysis consists of providing a quantitative evaluation of the three global products by means of statistical metrics we compare global products with ground rain gauge data from its corresponding cell fig 2 this analysis aims to assess the differences between ground based and gridded datasets in terms of 1 precipitation amounts 2 seasonal variability and 3 dynamic consistency to do so we present three statistical criteria where ground rain gauge are considered as reference named r and evaluated global products are named e these criteria are components of the kling gupta efficiency kge criterion gupta et al 2009 in order to analyze separately volume variability and dynamic bias rather analyzing an overall score taylor diagrams that use root main square rms criterion are presented in the supplementary material b first mean and standard deviation std ratios named β and α respectively are calculated to quantify differences in terms of volumes and variability between the references and evaluated monthly data μ e 1 n i 1 n e i σ e 1 n 1 i 1 n e i μ e 2 β μ e μ r α σ e σ r with µ the mean and σ the standard deviation of the monthly data calculated over the period n in this case β assesses the volumes bias between the two time series whereas α estimates the variance bias for both criteria the ideal value is then 1 indicating a perfect fit between rain gauge data and global product in terms of mean amounts and standard deviation second the pearson correlation coefficient cc evaluates the error in dynamics and timing between the reference and evaluated time series the ideal value for cc is 1 the cc calculation is combined with an estimation of its p value in order to assess the cc validity cc 1 n 1 i 1 n e i μ e σ e r i μ r σ r these three criteria are first calculated for the three global products over the entire time series n range from 48 to 216 in function of the ground rain gauge then they are averaged for each station giving 15 scores for each global product one for each station this first standard approach aims at providing an overview of the accuracy of global product relative to ground stations nevertheless global product accuracy could vary temporally requiring to work on different temporal scales satgé et al 2019 water management at watershed scale needs accurate monitoring of both seasonal and interannual variability of the rainfall in order to set up short and long term sustainable management in order to evaluate interannual bias statistical criteria are thus calculated for each year only n 12 for this step only complete years of ground rain gauge time series are used table 3 the 15 scores for each station are then presented using a box plot finally a third calculation is made for each month separately i e january february etc n 18 this allows the evaluation of global products ability to capture the seasonality over the entire period all the statistical results are showed in the supplementary material d and e 2 4 objective 2 spatial analysis of the consistency of rainfall products in capturing orographic effects the second objective consists in analyzing the spatial distribution of ground based and global rainfall products in order to examine their relative consistency with regards to orographic effects given the specific context of the three studied tropical volcanoes this investigation is of high interest by evaluating the products ability to describe orographic effects at kilometric scale indeed the variability of orographic phenomena is a function of the type of atmospheric circulation season organization of slopes as well as the altitude of the inversion layer houze 2012 the orographic gradient is regularly used to understand these phenomena and approximate the evolution of rainfall as a function of altitude körner 2007 defined different altitudinal gradients according to the climates defined by the latitude of the area as java island is located around 6 s latitude the gradient should correspond to the equatorial pattern 0 10 latitude characterized by a rainfall decrease as a function of altitude accentuated above 1500 m altitude körner 2007 however toulier et al 2019 rather found a sub tropical pattern like the 10 30 latitude one on the northern slope of the bromo tengger east of java island in their study a network of ground stations showed a rainfall increase with the elevation up to 1000 1400 m a s l above which the annual rainfall decreased up to the 3000 m a s l at the summit finally recent studies showed the strong seasonal variability of this orographic gradient in the indian ocean the influence of the position of the intertropical convergence zone on la réunion island s local climate as well as on atmospheric circulations e g trade winds or cyclones induces a strong temporal variability of the orographic gradients réchou et al 2019 in this study orographic effects were analyzed on homogenous geo climatic areas defined according to volcanoes morphology and monthly wind regional and local atmospheric circulations see supplementary material c as presented by blue and orange arrows in fig 1 a atmospheric circulations are mainly influenced by the asian australian monsoon during the wet season the australian monsoon induces atmospheric circulations from north west to south east over the study site blue arrows dominant winds present inverse directions during the dry season orange arrows with the asian monsoon aldrian and susanto 2003 consequently four geo climatic areas were defined on the studied area fig 3 each areas are defined in order to gather at least 2 ground rain gauges in distinct geomorphological region 1 salak north stations 1 5 directly facing java sea rainfall regimes and orographic effects on this slope are assumed to be directly controlled by northern atmospheric circulations during the australian monsoon 2 salak east stations 8 and 10 oriented towards the east in the valley between salak and pangrango this slope should be affected by both north and south atmospheric circulations as well as local orographic effects 3 pangrango north stations 6 7 and 9 this slope of pangrango is surrounded by the salak volcano at the west and by an old volcano at the north mainly impacted by northern conditions rainfall regimes should also be impacted by local orographic effects 4 pangrango south stations 11 13 15 this slope in the southern part of the study faces the indian ocean rainfall regime in this area is assumed to be directly impsacted by southern climatic conditions in these conditions station number 12 was not attributed to any region two analyses have been carried out for each zone the average rainfall patterns of the three climate reanalyses were compared according to the four main seasons the wet season december to february djf the transition to the dry season march to may mam the dry season june to august jja and the transition to the wet season september to november son then the altitudinal rainfall gradients were analyzed 3 results 3 1 objective 1 temporal ground global products quantitative evaluation in order to examine the overall accuracy of the three global products we conducted a straightforward statistical comparison between global products and ground rainfall data to do so statistical criteria for the three global products are calculated in relation to each station and their distributions are shown in fig 4 since ground rain gauges are distributed across the different geo climatic areas defined previously the variability of statistical scores i e the box height would reflect the relative ability of global products to capture the spatial variability of ground based precipitation amount temporal variability and dynamics in order to understand spatial variability a map of each criterion is presented below in fig 5 this first broad analysis provides an interesting overall evaluation the ratio of means β highlights a good consistency for terra median scores 1 01 while chelsa and chirps generally overestimate rainfall amounts median score 1 37 and 1 21 the distribution of the ratio of means is rather tight for terra and chirps interquartile range 0 98 1 12 and 1 13 1 33 respectively which is consistent with the spatial distribution of β fig 5 in comparison chelsa is characterized by a wider distributions interquartile range 1 04 1 65 fig 4 a the spatial distribution of the ratio of means β demonstrate a rainfall overestimation in the southern part for each global products fig 5 in contrast rainfall amounts estimation is more accurate in the northern and center part the average variability of chelsa and terra product are closed to the ground dataset median α 0 98 and 0 99 while chirps is slightly higher median values of α 1 14 the wider distribution of α ratios highlights the low consistency of chelsa in estimating the spread of ground rain gauge data interquartile range 0 9 1 33 chelsa underestimated the rainfall variability in the northern part of the site while it is overestimated in the south terra and chirps ratio of stds are more consistent interquartile ranges 0 89 1 04 and 1 1 2 respectively fig 4 b their spatial distribution is more homogeneous with a slight std underestimation in the valley and an std overestimation in the northern and southern rain gauges fig 5 the pearson correlation coefficients cc of all global products appear consistent with ground rain gauge with median values between 0 6 and 0 7 fig 4 c for each products the cc variability in both the box plot and maps is relatively tight highlighting that global products accurately caught of the rainfall dynamics as monthly criteria are estimated at this stage over the whole time series this calculation does not allow to analyze the temporal component of the analysis and mixes it with spatial variability in order to evaluate the interannual bias of the products fig 6 presents the scores calculated and averaged over 12 months for each year fig 6 a shows the median annual average rainfall amount in order to evaluate global product in wet years above the median annual rainfall amount 2008 2010 and 2013 2014 and drier ones below the median annual rainfall amount 2006 2007 2011 2012 and 2015 in fig 6 b to d ratio of means stds and cc provide information on rainfall amount bias the seasonality contrast and the product ability to represent the transition between seasons respectively the ratios of means and stds of the chelsa product available up to 2018 are characterized by a wide dispersity highlighting the product limitations to reproduce the spatial variability of rainfall chelsa overestimates rainfall amounts most of the time especially during the last years the median β becomes closer to 1 2008 2010 chelsa rainfall variability varies around 1 until 2013 where it increases until 2018 demonstrating an overestimation of seasonal variability concerning the dynamic the interquartiles of chelsa s cc score are mainly above 0 5 except for years 2003 20148 and 2016 the evolution of chelsa s scores indicated no relationship between bias types nor a relationship with year typology concerning chirps performance the product mainly overestimates annual rainfall amounts particularly in 2014 and 2016 ratio of means above 1 4 median chirps ratios of stds mainly vary between 0 75 and 1 25 while in 2007 and 2011 this criterion stays below 1 5 it exceeds 2 in 2016 concerning the dynamics cc criteria is mainly above 0 6 for chirps except in 2005 2010 2013 and 2014 it decreases even more in 2003 and 2016 terra demonstrates a good consistency all over the period its median ratio of means β is close to 1 except for the years 2007 2016 and 2017 the interquartiles of std ratios are also stable between 0 75 and 1 25 except in 2007 and 2014 while the terra dynamics are mainly consistent with ground rain gauge cc above 0 6 terra scores decrease in 2003 2005 2010 2014 and 2016 as for global calculation chirps and terra obtain overall better scores than chelsa these two global products from satellite data or climate reanalyses respectively share some common biases i errors in the dynamics in 2003 2010 and 2013 2014 ii strong deviations for the three scores in 2016 iii and somewhat comparable correlation coefficients over the entire period while some interannual variability in dynamics is expected the degradation of the three criteria for all products in specific years is surprising finally this interannual analysis highlights the non linearity of global products bias limiting the possibility of debiasing them with ground rain gauge data the interannual analysis of global product does not provide information on their accuracy to reproduce seasonality for this purpose the three criteria are estimated for each month across all years fig 7 it is important to remember that during the dry season low rainfall amounts induce high bias with low volume error on the monthly analysis fig 7a terra stands out as the most accurate product in the estimation of monthly rainfall amounts interquartile range 1 03 1 18 it provide the more accurate rainfall estimation during the whole year despite a slight overestimation in june july and september 1 2 and 1 45 respectively chirps overestimated rainfall amounts by 10 34 25 and 75 quartiles respectively most of the year with a higher bias in august september 75 which is globally consistent with the global results fig 4 chelsa is the most inaccurate product with a large rainfall overestimation interquartile range 1 16 1 42 this seasonal analysis demonstrates that the three global products mainly overestimates rainfall amounts especially during the transition between the dry and the wet season august to november fig 7 regarding the variability ratio of stds fig 7 b the results are more homogeneous terra and chirps obtain fairly consistent results when compared one to the other interquartile range 0 99 1 18 and 0 82 1 15 respectively however an std overestimation is observed on both product during september october from 25 to 50 in november february and marchboth products importantly underestimate the variability chelsa obtains close scores interquartile range 0 81 1 15 chelsa underestimate november february and march std but overestimate january one it is more consistent during the year demonstrating a better capacity to catch rainfall variability during the year this results highlights two elements i annual means may be misleading for water resource management as dry season overestimation can compensate wet season underestimation and ii global product tend to misestimate rainfall amounts variability during both transitions between dry and wet seasons finally concerning the rainfall dynamics cc scores fig 7 c the three products are rather efficient during dry season median range 0 6 0 8 while during the wet and the transition seasons their scores decrease median range 0 2 0 6 these weak scores highlight the difficulty for the three global products to capture the variation at the start end of the wet season from one year to another however the decrease of p value limits the interpretation of cc values in supplementary material e the statistical analysis of cc criterion highlights a low sensitivity during the wet season 3 2 objective 2 spatial analysis of the consistency of rainfall products in capturing orographic effects the statistical analysis identified some strengths and weaknesses of the global products in representing the ground rain gauge data of the study area this analysis focused on seasonal and interannual temporally averaged spatial heterogeneities thus this section first aims to understand how the different data describe the spatial distribution of rainfall according to the morphology of the three volcanoes second the global products spatial trends are evaluated in order to assess if these global products may complement point ground rain gauge data to understand the spatial distribution of rainfall especially in mountainous areas 3 2 1 spatial trend analysis in order to understand seasonal patterns the continuous gridded data from the three global products are shown in fig 8 along with point ground data for each map the average rainfall for each season from 2008 to 2013 is represented for both ground rain gauges and global products in order to ease the comparison a scatter plot comparing seasonal cumulative rainfall of global product with ground rain gauge is shown for each season this period corresponds to the maximum of available ground rain gauge stations before the end of chelsa time series fig 6 b we define the beginning of the hydrological year at the end of the dry season from september to november son fig 8 first row the ground data highlight a regional rainfall gradient ranging from 1200 mm 3months in the north to 600 mm 3months in the south the two eastern stations appear drier than the valley ones conversely chelsa does not highlight any regional gradient but mainly orographic effects of south facing slopes this divergence in estimating regional gradient leads to important discrepancies between the measured rainfall amounts and chelsa estimates chirps satellite data show a regional gradient from northwest to southeast a slight orographic effect is visible on the northern slope of the salak and on the entire gede pangrango edifice a drier zone emerges to the south of the salak volcano which is consistent with a windward side at the north of the volcanoes and a leeward one at the south nevertheless chirps overestimates rainfall on the entire area 50 to 400 mm 3months terra shows mainly a west east gradient with a gradual increase in rainfall as a function of altitude in terms of rainfall amounts terra appears the most accurate product with only slight differences from 30 to 130 mm 3months terra pattern slightly diverges from ground data but this could be due to station scarcity in the eastern and western areas during the wet season from december to february djf fig 8 second row the rainfall spatial distribution of ground data is more heterogeneous the northern and southern parts of salak and gede pangrango volcanoes appear drier than the rest in the valley the rainfall amounts increase with a clear orographic effect in higher ground rain gauge 1400 mm 3months chelsa shows an increase in average rainfall mainly located on the slopes facing west which might be due to orographic effects this major orographic effect appears inconsistent with the ground observations conversely chirps and terra patterns are more consistent with ground data chirps highlights orographic effects concentrated in the highest area where its rainfall amounts are consistent with the few highground rain gauge with limited rain gauges at high altitudes it is not possible to fully validate the chirps orographic pattern in the lowest area chirps slightly overestimates rainfall amounts from 100 mm 3months in the south to 400 mm 3months in the northern part terra is underestimating orographic effects providing a quite homogenous rainfall spatial pattern while rainfall amounts are underestimated in volcano slopes it is overestimated in the valley and lower part from march to may mam fig 8 third row the transition season is slightly drier in the southern part and the valley chelsa rainfall pattern is characterized by orographic effect on southern slopes inconsistent with ground data terra highlights an east west gradient uncorrelated with the western ground station chirps provides more accurate patterns according to ground station with similar regional gradient and a foehn effect in the southern part nevertheless in lowest areas chirps still overestimates rainfall amounts finally during the dry season from june to august jja fig 8 fourth row ground data highlight a north south regional pattern chelsa gridded data are characterized by southeastern influence inconsistent with ground data while terra and even more chirps appear more reliable in both mam and jja periods it is interesting to note that chirps shows a dry area in the southern part of the valley center at 6 90 s 106 75 e this area possibly related to foehn effect appears larger on the ground data but demonstrates the ability of chirps to capture such local effect 3 2 2 rainfall orographic gradient the analysis of rainfall patterns highlighted the local complexity induced by mountainous environments in order to quantify orographic effects altitudinal gradients are determined for the 4 geo climatic sectors in fig 9 the seasons gradient for ground and product dataset are presented by average rainfall amounts for each dry jja and wet djf season between 2008 and 2013 during the wet season an increase in rainfall amounts in function of the elevation is visible while during the dry season rainfall amounts and the altitudinal gradients are low only chelsa highlights a slight gradient on the eastern slope of the salak volcano during transition periods mam and son the altitudinal gradients are in transitional states between the extremes of the dry and wet seasons in pangrango s southern and northern sectors chelsa describes steep gradient between 400 and 800 m a s l 77 and 60 mm 100 m for southern and northern areas respectively it then gradually decreases by around 12 and 13 mm 100 m for southern and northern areas in salak area chelsa gradient is more linear with variation from 13 mm 100 m in the southern part while the western slope gradient is more consistent with pangrango slope with a steep increase around 500 m a s l of 400 mm 100 m chirps describes gradients mostly linear with an increase in orographic effects from north to south over the pangrango it varies from 12 to 8 mm 100 m at southern and northern slopes respectively while over the northern slope of the salak it decreases to 5 mm 100 m the lack of data on the eastern slope of salak does not allow for an accurate gradient estimation terra s data gives estimates of altitudinal gradients close to chirps ones with the same trend along the north south axis on pangrango terra gradients vary from 9 to 7 mm 100 m between southern and northern slopes while they decrease to 3 1 mm 100 m on northern and eastern salak s slopes respectively on salak s southern slope terra data are influenced by the overestimation of the east west gradient which induces large rainfall amounts at low altitude finally the ground stations are represented in order to assess global product orographic effects unfortunately ground rain gauges are mainly located at the base of the volcano slopes fig 9 this does not allow a clear appreciation of the altitudinal gradients in addition these stations give local information that can be influenced by local processes such as station 6 in the center of the valley which measures rainfall amounts above the other data during the wet season fig 2 and fig 8 the ground data are mainly consistent with the chirps and terra data over the four sectors chirps and terra only overestimate rainfall on the pangrango south area during the wet season for chelsa the ground data measure lower gradients on the pangrango while it is consistent with chelsa on the salak these results once again confirm the better correlation of the ground data and chirps and terra datasets compared to chelsa 4 discussion this study aims to assess the interest and reliability of global climate products for water management in ungauged tropical mountainous areas the accuracy of these global products can vary spatially satgé et al 2020 especially in complex areas such as tropical volcanic islands to assess the validity of global products we compared their rainfall estimates with ground rain gauge data by analyzing both temporal and spatial patterns gao and liu 2013 satgé et al 2019 the direct comparison of ground data and global products is known to integrate scales effects underestimating global product scores tang et al 2018 in order to overcome such data limitation we complete the statistical analysis with a process based interpretation to estimate if these products are consistent according to known climatic processes in tropical mountainous contexts and with other climatic studies these two steps provide a more exhaustive view of the strengths and weaknesses of the global products in order to properly identify whether they can be appropriate for the study area as well as their application limits the different results are summarized in table 4 in order to define the range of local applicability of each product for local water management 4 1 temporal statistical analysis our temporal analysis starts with a general overview of global product s performances and their spatial distribution figs 4 5 however both climatic reanalyse and satellite data demonstrate an overestimation of rainfall amounts which is consistent with previous studies in mountaineous area hu et al 2016 hussain et al 2018 zeng et al 2018 in order to assess temporal consistency annual statistical scores are estimated chelsa performance decrease significantly over time especially after 2013 however chirps and terra scores did not show any deteriorated nor improved temporal trends between 2002 and 2018 fig 6 this result is consistent with previous studies in mountainous areas of chirps dataset e g satgé et al 2019 the variation in global product scores does not seem to be influenced by wet dry years furthermore the indonesian climate is strongly influenced by regional climate phenomena enso as syakur et al 2014 during the study period el niño events occurred in 2002 2006 2010 and 2015 in contrast la niña conditions occurred in 2007 2008 and 2011 2012 http www bom gov au climate about australian climate influences shtml bookmark enso the pluriannual analysis did not highlight specific patterns during these specific years at this step global products performance are rather constant over time demonstrating an interannual robustness nevertheless in order to set up annual water management plan we need to correctly catch the seasonality for short term water management it is mandatory to estimate the annual distribution of the recharge mostly during the rainy season and the importance of the drought mostly during the dry season these signals are generally poorly studied but are of primary importance for short term water resource management d arrigo and wilson 2008 our analysis highlights a common annual pattern of global products performance fig 7 during the wet season the global products are efficient to catch rainfall amounts but underestimate the interannual variability and dynamic during the dry season global products tend to overestimate the rainfall while they catch the interannual variability and dynamic their performance decreases for transition periods and more especially between the dry and wet season during this period rainfall amounts and dynamics is controlled by the start of the australian monsoon aldrian and susanto 2003 our study highlights the issue encountered by the global products to represent efficiently this dynamics these limitations during the dry and transition periods limit the efficiency of global products for accurate annual water management 4 2 spatial process based analysis in terms of process analysis fig 9 show the variability of regional patterns and orographic effects as a function of seasonality the ground rain gauge data shows a strong north south regional pattern during the wet season dfj and dry season jja however the distribution of ground rain gauges prevents from highlighting east west ones the chelsa rainfall spatial distribution is mostly controlled by topography while for terra it is driven by a regional east west pattern fig 8 table 4 these two distributions are significantly inconsistent with the ground rain gauge in the first case chelsa uses the elevation and dominant winds as a proxy for rainfall interpolation karger et al 2017 our results demonstrate that the elevation is not the only factor controlling rainfall patterns as regional rainfall patterns have to be take into account in the meantime orographic effects strongly depends on local climate forcing and morphology limiting the accuracy of using a single rainfall elevation relationship in the second case terra s ground data interpolation is mostly controlled by regional rainfall patterns orographic effects are only slightly represented with terra which limits its interest for the estimation of spatial rainfall patterns fig 8 table 4 this bias could come from an insufficient consideration of orographic effects in the interpolation technique finally chirps relies on remote sensing data and despite a general overestimation of rainfall amounts the spatial distribution appears consistent with orographic processes chirps define a north south rainfall pattern consistent with ground data especially with the drier area in the leeward plain at the south of the study area fig 8 table 4 nevertheless according to its spatial resolution it remains impossible to assess whether chirps represents correctly windward leeward rainfall contrast concerning orographic gradients they appear to be low during most of the year over all sectors and increase during the wet season to evaluate their accuracy our results can be compared with two recent studies in tropical mountains first toulier et al 2019 measured an orographic gradient on the northern slope of bromo tenger volcano java island at the bottom of the volcano annual rainfall amounts quickly increase from the shore to 500 600 m a s l with an altitudinal gradient around 290 mm 100 m between 500 and 1100 m a s l the altitudinal gradient decreases nearby 100 mm 100 m above 1100 m a s l the dynamics of the gradient is reversed with an annual rainfall decrease between 140 to 230 mm 100 m second réchou et al 2019 presented a detailed study of orographic effects over la réunion island in tropical area la réunion island climatic regime is not impacted by monsoon phenomena nevertheless the study highlights strong annual altitudinal gradients between the shore and 500 700 m a s l ranging from 300 to 700 mm 100 m above the negative altitudinal gradient induces a significant annual rainfall decrease finally we estimated an increase of the altitudinal gradient in djf season which is consistent with réchou et al 2019 they highlighted an altitudinal gradient increase during the wet season the altitudinal gradients defined by both ground and global products do not match previous studies at la réunion island réchou et al 2019 and at bromo tenger toulier et al 2019 that notably show a decrease of rainfall above a given elevation from 500 to 1100 m above the sea level while ground rain gauges are packed at the bottom of volcano slopes terra and chirps present altitudinal gradients increasing with the elevation table 4 this bias may come from the resolution of these products 5 and 4 km pixel length respectively which is not fine enough to determine rainfall gradients over a 15 to 30 km long volcano thanks to its fine resolution chelsa should be able to catch such orographic effects nevertheless its altitudinal gradients are too strong as they increase until 1200 to 1500 m a s l global products assessment through our statistical and process based analysis we are able to synthesize the strengths and limitations of each of the three products from this qualitative analysis it is then possible to use the different global products according to their characteristics while integrating in part their uncertainties the first product chelsa a very fine spatial resolution product 1 km² gave limited results on both the spatial and temporal evaluation on our study area table 4 at the interannual time scale and even more at seasonal scale chelsa overestimates rainfall amounts and variability from a spatial point of view chelsa is inconsistent with ground data since it relies on overestimated orographic effects our study demonstrates the limited interest of this product in the tropical mountainous context of our study site terra the second product obtains suitable and stable temporal scores table 4 terra tends to overestimate rainfall amounts during the dry season and seasonal variability during the end of the year as this period is the driest the related uncertainties remain acceptable for water balance computation the east west direction is strongly marked in the terra rainfall patterns compared to the ground data and orographic effects are concentrated on the summit areas limiting the interest of terra for spatial analysis as it stands terra should be interesting for temporal rainfall dynamics and could be a solution to coarse estimation of water balance computation however terra is might be too coarse for numbers of operational water resources management applications the third product chirps statistical scores highlights his global overestimation of rainfall while it is mainly consistent in terms of dynamics and variability table 4 this overestimation could be explained by ccd bias defining warm orographic clouds into rainfall clouds gebregiorgis and hossain 2013 however chirps provides interesting results in terms of spatial patterns fig 8 chirps is an interesting dataset to roughly integrate spatial rainfall patterns in water management studies especially when only scarce ground rain gauges are available nevertheless its resolution is too coarse to represent accurately altitudinal rainfall gradients on narrow slopes 15 km chirps thus lacks efficiency for water resources management of small watersheds 1000 km2 5 conclusion our study aims to assess high resolution global products accuracy for local water resources management their recent development opens up new solutions for water management at local scale this integration must be complemented by a significant effort of validation at the watershed scale especially under complex climatic behaviors in order to overcome the limitations of ground based data low density of ground rain gauge lack of river discharge data we combined a quantitative statistical approach with a processes based spatial analysis the former integrates three different temporalities including the analysis of seasonal biases rarely taken into account it allowed to discuss the general strengths and weaknesses of the global products in order to define their range of applicability for regional long term studies the combination with the spatial approach allows to precise the limits of each product by integrating the associated climatic processes orientation of monsoons orographic effect and assess their validity for water resource management over small watersheds on the western part of java it appears difficult to select one product adapted for all the needs indeed terra climatic reanalysis appears accurate and stable in the long term allowing to use it for water balance trends evaluations the products are still too uncertain to effectively monitor seasonal rainfall nevertheless in the absence of data terra reanalysis appears the most reliable product during the whole year for spatial analysis it appears that only chirps remote sensing data enables among the studied products to approach rainfall distribution such analysis should focus only on spatial variations due to chirps overestimation and with some necessary ground calibration the global products can thus be interesting locally nevertheless their use must be conditioned in view of their weaknesses their temporal accuracy is interesting but rainfall amounts bias are still too strong to be integrated in local water resources management tools the recurrent overestimation of rainfall during the dry period hinders the intensity of droughts and the assessment of their consequences this limitation is amplified by the difficulty of global products to capture transition period dynamics particularly the beginning of the wet season spatially satellite data provide interesting information but the bias caused by the higher altitudes and the still coarse resolution do not allow to correctly estimate local altitudinal gradients credit

8039,study region water resource management relies fundamentally on our ability to monitor climate forcing variability especially in tropical mountainous environment where the temporal and spatial variability of rainfall strongly controls the dynamics of the water resource in west java island rainfall temporal and spatial distribution significantly varies in function of regional climatology and volcanoes morphology while accessibility issues and the complexity of climatic phenomena notably are limitations for reliable rainfall ground instrumentation study focus here we assess the ability of climate reanalyses chelsa and terraclimate and satellite products chirps in capturing rainfall high resolution spatial variability the accuracy of rainfall amounts variability and dynamics of each global product is estimated using the three component of kling gupta efficiency score as direct statistical comparison is influenced by resolution issues our approach is completed by a process based one the spatial and orographic rainfall patterns of the global products are analyzed according to known climatic phenomena hydrological insights it appears that terraclimate provides the most accurate and stable estimation for temporal monitoring chirps shows consistent rainfall patterns with atmospheric circulation and volcanoes morphology but overestimates overall rainfall amounts this study presents a methodology for assessing global climatic products over poorly instrumented areas the results demonstrate that high resolution global products are somewhat interesting for water resources management however several temporal and spatial biases still limit their integration for operational purposes keywords water resource volcanic island tropical climate high resolution rainfall product climatic reanalysis remote sensing 1 introduction in volcanic islands water demand for irrigation drinking water industry etc is more and more satisfied by groundwater as surface water may not be available during the dry season and may also be of poor quality charlier et al 2011 lachassagne et al 2014 vittecoq et al 2019 on such geological settings volcanic aquifers are usually considered as highly productive which means that the volcanic rocks have a high hydraulic conductivity that allows a high discharge to be pumped often more than 100 m3 h per borewell charlier et al 2011 lachassagne et al 2014 vittecoq et al 2019 due to its utmost importance such groundwater resource must be sustainably managed which means that the groundwater abstraction should not on average exceed the average recharge rate of the considered aquifer thus groundwater resource sustainability is highly dependent on the variability of climatic forcing in indonesia especially in java island the exponential raise of water demand for agriculture industry and domestic water use gradually increases the stress on the available groundwater resource previous studies demonstrated that aquifer recharge may occur along all the volcano slopes dumont et al 2021 toulier et al 2019 and that aquifer recharge is thus highly dependent on the spatial and temporal patterns of rainfall and evapotranspiration these patterns highly depend on the altitudinal climatic variability which can be very high in such a tropical humid and mountainous setting and can hardly be characterized with sparse ground rain gauges notably for cost and accessibility reasons in indonesia the climate is characterized by a tropical seasonality with a dry season from april to october and a wet period from november to march aldrian and susanto 2003 in addition the climatic variability is impacted by several factors java island is located nearby the equator and surrounded by the indo pacific warm pool ipwp where the hadley cell and the walker circulations converge yielding several specific rainfall regimes over indonesia aldrian and susanto 2003 the first climatic driver is induced by the asian australian monsoon affecting the indonesian climate with circulations originating from the northwest during the wet season december to february while southwest winds occur during the dry season june to july fig 1 aldrian and susanto 2003 as syakur et al 2013 chang et al 2005 the second climatic driver comes from steep topography of young volcanoes which impacts the circulation of the hot and humid air masses generated by the ipwp leading to strong spatial and temporal rainfall variability houze 2012 qian 2008 sobel et al 2011 this orographic influence varies according to the seasons and the evolution of the inversion layer creating strong rainfall heterogeneity between windward leeward and even on the same slope réchou et al 2019 the third climatic driver controlling the climatic variability of java island is composed by el niño southern oscillation enso and the indian ocean dipole iod as syakur et al 2014 lestari et al 2018 qian et al 2010 these two interconnected regional phenomena create high interannual climatic variability over indonesia impacting both monsoon and orographic processes in hydrogeological studies with a perspective of water resource management the characterization of such variability is usually addressed with the help of dense ground rain gauge networks charlier et al 2011 toulier et al 2019 vittecoq et al 2020 however recent andesitic volcanoes are characterized by steep slopes limiting access at medium to high elevation thus rain gauge monitoring is generally concentrated in the valleys between the volcanoes limiting the understanding of orographic effects induced by volcano slopes and dominant wind orientations satgé et al 2019 in order to complete or replace ground rain gauge data global products are targeted to provide spatially and temporally continuous climatic dataset sun et al 2018 these datasets are generally characterized by large grids with sizes ranging from 0 5 to 2 5 such resolutions are not suited to monitor orographic effects on volcano slopes nevertheless recent development of high resolution downscaling methodologies is opening up new opportunities at local scale fick and hijmans 2017 hersbach et al 2020 global products are generally derived from the interpolation of ground rain gauges data becker et al 2013 dee et al 2011 or from the processing of remote sensing data huffman et al 2007 both approaches lead to uncertainties in the estimation of rainfall volumes and variability climatic reanalysis relies on ground data availability and the accuracy of interpolation methods satellite based rainfall products are indirect measurements microwaves or infrared of low earth orbital the rainfall monitoring of short precipitation events is inaccurate due to the sampling rates of the satellites in mountainous settings the presence of warm clouds could create similar signals as rainy clouds hence biasing the satellite estimates satgé et al 2019 in order to assess the validity of global products several methodologies have been developed the first one consists in direct comparisons of ground rain gauge data with global products this approach faces several limits such as the quality of ground monitoring and the difference of resolution the point scale monitoring of rain gauge station may not represent areal precipitation captured by global products tang et al 2018 demonstrated that the smaller the number of stations the more the comparison will underestimate the quality of the overall products this resolution bias can be solved by using ground radar signals that monitor rainfall over large areas in a distributed way satgé et al 2019 nevertheless the estimation of rainfall from ground radar is complex and it is biased in mountainous areas zeng et al 2018 the second approach consists in analyzing the sensitivity of hydrological modelling to global products maggioni and massari 2018 satgé et al 2019 several studies analyzed global products performance over mountainous area in andean plateau elgamal et al 2017 satgé et al 2019 african eastern plateau dinku et al 2008 gebremicael et al 2017 goshime et al 2019 tibetan plateau alazzy et al 2017 shrestha et al 2017 and even recently over tropical islands bathelemy et al in review nevertheless these studies evaluated global products at regional scales from few to dozen earth degrees which does not provide specific guidance for the management of local groundwater resources at a scale from 10 to a few 1000 km2 our study takes part of a multidisciplinary project for groundwater management on headwater catchment of jakarta on java island the studied area of about 4000 km² includes three indonesian stratovolcanoes fig 1 b salak 2200 m a s l gede 2958 m a s l and pangrango 3019 m a s l aligned from north to south a large valley separates the salak from the gede pangrango that are embedded together forming a single more massive edifice these three volcanoes are a portion of the indonesian volcanic arc extending from sumatra to east java and to the eastern chain of islands including bali lombok and flores orographic effects induced by the combination of the volcanic chain and regional winds direction might differ spatially and evolve during the year fig 1 a according to the maps of monthly wind see supplementary material a the climate of the northern slopes should be mainly impacted by atmospheric circulations from asia while the southern part might be more impacted by australian climatic conditions finally climatic conditions in the valley might be largely influenced by local processes induced by topographic irregularities in order to understand rainfall patterns in a such limited area impacted by local climatic phenomenon we compare scarce ground rain gauge data with three global products chelsa a 1 km grid length product from era interim reanalysis downscaling terra a 4 km grid length dataset from worldclim and cru reanalysis downscaling and chirps a 5 km lateral resolution downscaling of tmpa 3b42 remote sensing dataset abatzoglou et al 2018 funk et al 2015 karger et al 2017 the temporal resolution of the global products is relatively coarse up to one month but still interesting for water resource management applications the first objective of this study is to estimate the accuracy of these three global products over tropical mountainous areas using scarce ground rain gauge data given that there is no rainfall amount monitoring derived from ground radar data available and that river discharge monitoring dataset in the sector are too short and incomplete the quantitative evaluation of global product relies only on ground gauge data as such comparison is biased by resolution issue the second objective is to provide a process based analysis of spatial rainfall patterns and orographic effects this analysis relies on the comparison of global and ground rainfall patterns with local spatial trends and orographic effects from previous studies in tropical island finally these results will help to evaluate whether global products are accurate enough to be used for the sustainable management of groundwater resources the combination of quantitative and qualitative analyses will provide an overview of the strengths and limits of ground and global monitoring products to quantify rainfall over tropical volcanoes for operational groundwater resource management 2 material and method 2 1 ground rain gauges in the area the daily monitoring dataset from 34 ground rain gauge was collected a quality check was performed for each station using cumulative and double mass curves the purpose of this procedure is to ensure that each station temporal dynamics is consistent with neighboring gauges as well as with climatological

penelitan dan pengenbangan sumber daya air http www pusair pu go id fig 1 b table 1 in order to compare these data to global products monthly total rainfall have been calculated when less than 10 of the month data is missing these stations are mainly located in the valleys at low elevation between 133 and 1134 m average 510 m in addition the spatial distribution of ground stations is highly heterogeneous with a concentration in the valley between mt salak and mt pangrango as well as in the northern slope of mt salak and southern part of mt gede fig 1 b 2 2 global products in this study we do not intend to provide an exhaustive overview of all available products the objective is to provide a detailed assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the different high resolution global products in such tropical orographic settings the global rainfall products have been selected according to three requirements i a lateral resolution below 10 km to analyze spatial variability ii a time series long enough to analyze temporal variability and iii several reanalysis and remote sensing protocols to discuss the relative merits of each method three global products have been selected

climate normal the third step is the combination of extensive ground gauge datasets and chirp precipitation to compile chirps estimates of monthly precipitation monitoring only one of the six stations used to correct for chirps in west java is located in a mountainous area 2 3 objective 1 temporal ground global products quantitative evaluation the first objective of the analysis consists of providing a quantitative evaluation of the three global products by means of statistical metrics we compare global products with ground rain gauge data from its corresponding cell fig 2 this analysis aims to assess the differences between ground based and gridded datasets in terms of 1 precipitation amounts 2 seasonal variability and 3 dynamic consistency to do so we present three statistical criteria where ground rain gauge are considered as reference named r and evaluated global products are named e these criteria are components of the kling gupta efficiency kge criterion gupta et al 2009 in order to analyze separately volume variability and dynamic bias rather analyzing an overall score taylor diagrams that use root main square rms criterion are presented in the supplementary material b first mean and standard deviation std ratios named β and α respectively are calculated to quantify differences in terms of volumes and variability between the references and evaluated monthly data μ e 1 n i 1 n e i σ e 1 n 1 i 1 n e i μ e 2 β μ e μ r α σ e σ r with µ the mean and σ the standard deviation of the monthly data calculated over the period n in this case β assesses the volumes bias between the two time series whereas α estimates the variance bias for both criteria the ideal value is then 1 indicating a perfect fit between rain gauge data and global product in terms of mean amounts and standard deviation second the pearson correlation coefficient cc evaluates the error in dynamics and timing between the reference and evaluated time series the ideal value for cc is 1 the cc calculation is combined with an estimation of its p value in order to assess the cc validity cc 1 n 1 i 1 n e i μ e σ e r i μ r σ r these three criteria are first calculated for the three global products over the entire time series n range from 48 to 216 in function of the ground rain gauge then they are averaged for each station giving 15 scores for each global product one for each station this first standard approach aims at providing an overview of the accuracy of global product relative to ground stations nevertheless global product accuracy could vary temporally requiring to work on different temporal scales satgé et al 2019 water management at watershed scale needs accurate monitoring of both seasonal and interannual variability of the rainfall in order to set up short and long term sustainable management in order to evaluate interannual bias statistical criteria are thus calculated for each year only n 12 for this step only complete years of ground rain gauge time series are used table 3 the 15 scores for each station are then presented using a box plot finally a third calculation is made for each month separately i e january february etc n 18 this allows the evaluation of global products ability to capture the seasonality over the entire period all the statistical results are showed in the supplementary material d and e 2 4 objective 2 spatial analysis of the consistency of rainfall products in capturing orographic effects the second objective consists in analyzing the spatial distribution of ground based and global rainfall products in order to examine their relative consistency with regards to orographic effects given the specific context of the three studied tropical volcanoes this investigation is of high interest by evaluating the products ability to describe orographic effects at kilometric scale indeed the variability of orographic phenomena is a function of the type of atmospheric circulation season organization of slopes as well as the altitude of the inversion layer houze 2012 the orographic gradient is regularly used to understand these phenomena and approximate the evolution of rainfall as a function of altitude körner 2007 defined different altitudinal gradients according to the climates defined by the latitude of the area as java island is located around 6 s latitude the gradient should correspond to the equatorial pattern 0 10 latitude characterized by a rainfall decrease as a function of altitude accentuated above 1500 m altitude körner 2007 however toulier et al 2019 rather found a sub tropical pattern like the 10 30 latitude one on the northern slope of the bromo tengger east of java island in their study a network of ground stations showed a rainfall increase with the elevation up to 1000 1400 m a s l above which the annual rainfall decreased up to the 3000 m a s l at the summit finally recent studies showed the strong seasonal variability of this orographic gradient in the indian ocean the influence of the position of the intertropical convergence zone on la réunion island s local climate as well as on atmospheric circulations e g trade winds or cyclones induces a strong temporal variability of the orographic gradients réchou et al 2019 in this study orographic effects were analyzed on homogenous geo climatic areas defined according to volcanoes morphology and monthly wind regional and local atmospheric circulations see supplementary material c as presented by blue and orange arrows in fig 1 a atmospheric circulations are mainly influenced by the asian australian monsoon during the wet season the australian monsoon induces atmospheric circulations from north west to south east over the study site blue arrows dominant winds present inverse directions during the dry season orange arrows with the asian monsoon aldrian and susanto 2003 consequently four geo climatic areas were defined on the studied area fig 3 each areas are defined in order to gather at least 2 ground rain gauges in distinct geomorphological region 1 salak north stations 1 5 directly facing java sea rainfall regimes and orographic effects on this slope are assumed to be directly controlled by northern atmospheric circulations during the australian monsoon 2 salak east stations 8 and 10 oriented towards the east in the valley between salak and pangrango this slope should be affected by both north and south atmospheric circulations as well as local orographic effects 3 pangrango north stations 6 7 and 9 this slope of pangrango is surrounded by the salak volcano at the west and by an old volcano at the north mainly impacted by northern conditions rainfall regimes should also be impacted by local orographic effects 4 pangrango south stations 11 13 15 this slope in the southern part of the study faces the indian ocean rainfall regime in this area is assumed to be directly impsacted by southern climatic conditions in these conditions station number 12 was not attributed to any region two analyses have been carried out for each zone the average rainfall patterns of the three climate reanalyses were compared according to the four main seasons the wet season december to february djf the transition to the dry season march to may mam the dry season june to august jja and the transition to the wet season september to november son then the altitudinal rainfall gradients were analyzed 3 results 3 1 objective 1 temporal ground global products quantitative evaluation in order to examine the overall accuracy of the three global products we conducted a straightforward statistical comparison between global products and ground rainfall data to do so statistical criteria for the three global products are calculated in relation to each station and their distributions are shown in fig 4 since ground rain gauges are distributed across the different geo climatic areas defined previously the variability of statistical scores i e the box height would reflect the relative ability of global products to capture the spatial variability of ground based precipitation amount temporal variability and dynamics in order to understand spatial variability a map of each criterion is presented below in fig 5 this first broad analysis provides an interesting overall evaluation the ratio of means β highlights a good consistency for terra median scores 1 01 while chelsa and chirps generally overestimate rainfall amounts median score 1 37 and 1 21 the distribution of the ratio of means is rather tight for terra and chirps interquartile range 0 98 1 12 and 1 13 1 33 respectively which is consistent with the spatial distribution of β fig 5 in comparison chelsa is characterized by a wider distributions interquartile range 1 04 1 65 fig 4 a the spatial distribution of the ratio of means β demonstrate a rainfall overestimation in the southern part for each global products fig 5 in contrast rainfall amounts estimation is more accurate in the northern and center part the average variability of chelsa and terra product are closed to the ground dataset median α 0 98 and 0 99 while chirps is slightly higher median values of α 1 14 the wider distribution of α ratios highlights the low consistency of chelsa in estimating the spread of ground rain gauge data interquartile range 0 9 1 33 chelsa underestimated the rainfall variability in the northern part of the site while it is overestimated in the south terra and chirps ratio of stds are more consistent interquartile ranges 0 89 1 04 and 1 1 2 respectively fig 4 b their spatial distribution is more homogeneous with a slight std underestimation in the valley and an std overestimation in the northern and southern rain gauges fig 5 the pearson correlation coefficients cc of all global products appear consistent with ground rain gauge with median values between 0 6 and 0 7 fig 4 c for each products the cc variability in both the box plot and maps is relatively tight highlighting that global products accurately caught of the rainfall dynamics as monthly criteria are estimated at this stage over the whole time series this calculation does not allow to analyze the temporal component of the analysis and mixes it with spatial variability in order to evaluate the interannual bias of the products fig 6 presents the scores calculated and averaged over 12 months for each year fig 6 a shows the median annual average rainfall amount in order to evaluate global product in wet years above the median annual rainfall amount 2008 2010 and 2013 2014 and drier ones below the median annual rainfall amount 2006 2007 2011 2012 and 2015 in fig 6 b to d ratio of means stds and cc provide information on rainfall amount bias the seasonality contrast and the product ability to represent the transition between seasons respectively the ratios of means and stds of the chelsa product available up to 2018 are characterized by a wide dispersity highlighting the product limitations to reproduce the spatial variability of rainfall chelsa overestimates rainfall amounts most of the time especially during the last years the median β becomes closer to 1 2008 2010 chelsa rainfall variability varies around 1 until 2013 where it increases until 2018 demonstrating an overestimation of seasonal variability concerning the dynamic the interquartiles of chelsa s cc score are mainly above 0 5 except for years 2003 20148 and 2016 the evolution of chelsa s scores indicated no relationship between bias types nor a relationship with year typology concerning chirps performance the product mainly overestimates annual rainfall amounts particularly in 2014 and 2016 ratio of means above 1 4 median chirps ratios of stds mainly vary between 0 75 and 1 25 while in 2007 and 2011 this criterion stays below 1 5 it exceeds 2 in 2016 concerning the dynamics cc criteria is mainly above 0 6 for chirps except in 2005 2010 2013 and 2014 it decreases even more in 2003 and 2016 terra demonstrates a good consistency all over the period its median ratio of means β is close to 1 except for the years 2007 2016 and 2017 the interquartiles of std ratios are also stable between 0 75 and 1 25 except in 2007 and 2014 while the terra dynamics are mainly consistent with ground rain gauge cc above 0 6 terra scores decrease in 2003 2005 2010 2014 and 2016 as for global calculation chirps and terra obtain overall better scores than chelsa these two global products from satellite data or climate reanalyses respectively share some common biases i errors in the dynamics in 2003 2010 and 2013 2014 ii strong deviations for the three scores in 2016 iii and somewhat comparable correlation coefficients over the entire period while some interannual variability in dynamics is expected the degradation of the three criteria for all products in specific years is surprising finally this interannual analysis highlights the non linearity of global products bias limiting the possibility of debiasing them with ground rain gauge data the interannual analysis of global product does not provide information on their accuracy to reproduce seasonality for this purpose the three criteria are estimated for each month across all years fig 7 it is important to remember that during the dry season low rainfall amounts induce high bias with low volume error on the monthly analysis fig 7a terra stands out as the most accurate product in the estimation of monthly rainfall amounts interquartile range 1 03 1 18 it provide the more accurate rainfall estimation during the whole year despite a slight overestimation in june july and september 1 2 and 1 45 respectively chirps overestimated rainfall amounts by 10 34 25 and 75 quartiles respectively most of the year with a higher bias in august september 75 which is globally consistent with the global results fig 4 chelsa is the most inaccurate product with a large rainfall overestimation interquartile range 1 16 1 42 this seasonal analysis demonstrates that the three global products mainly overestimates rainfall amounts especially during the transition between the dry and the wet season august to november fig 7 regarding the variability ratio of stds fig 7 b the results are more homogeneous terra and chirps obtain fairly consistent results when compared one to the other interquartile range 0 99 1 18 and 0 82 1 15 respectively however an std overestimation is observed on both product during september october from 25 to 50 in november february and marchboth products importantly underestimate the variability chelsa obtains close scores interquartile range 0 81 1 15 chelsa underestimate november february and march std but overestimate january one it is more consistent during the year demonstrating a better capacity to catch rainfall variability during the year this results highlights two elements i annual means may be misleading for water resource management as dry season overestimation can compensate wet season underestimation and ii global product tend to misestimate rainfall amounts variability during both transitions between dry and wet seasons finally concerning the rainfall dynamics cc scores fig 7 c the three products are rather efficient during dry season median range 0 6 0 8 while during the wet and the transition seasons their scores decrease median range 0 2 0 6 these weak scores highlight the difficulty for the three global products to capture the variation at the start end of the wet season from one year to another however the decrease of p value limits the interpretation of cc values in supplementary material e the statistical analysis of cc criterion highlights a low sensitivity during the wet season 3 2 objective 2 spatial analysis of the consistency of rainfall products in capturing orographic effects the statistical analysis identified some strengths and weaknesses of the global products in representing the ground rain gauge data of the study area this analysis focused on seasonal and interannual temporally averaged spatial heterogeneities thus this section first aims to understand how the different data describe the spatial distribution of rainfall according to the morphology of the three volcanoes second the global products spatial trends are evaluated in order to assess if these global products may complement point ground rain gauge data to understand the spatial distribution of rainfall especially in mountainous areas 3 2 1 spatial trend analysis in order to understand seasonal patterns the continuous gridded data from the three global products are shown in fig 8 along with point ground data for each map the average rainfall for each season from 2008 to 2013 is represented for both ground rain gauges and global products in order to ease the comparison a scatter plot comparing seasonal cumulative rainfall of global product with ground rain gauge is shown for each season this period corresponds to the maximum of available ground rain gauge stations before the end of chelsa time series fig 6 b we define the beginning of the hydrological year at the end of the dry season from september to november son fig 8 first row the ground data highlight a regional rainfall gradient ranging from 1200 mm 3months in the north to 600 mm 3months in the south the two eastern stations appear drier than the valley ones conversely chelsa does not highlight any regional gradient but mainly orographic effects of south facing slopes this divergence in estimating regional gradient leads to important discrepancies between the measured rainfall amounts and chelsa estimates chirps satellite data show a regional gradient from northwest to southeast a slight orographic effect is visible on the northern slope of the salak and on the entire gede pangrango edifice a drier zone emerges to the south of the salak volcano which is consistent with a windward side at the north of the volcanoes and a leeward one at the south nevertheless chirps overestimates rainfall on the entire area 50 to 400 mm 3months terra shows mainly a west east gradient with a gradual increase in rainfall as a function of altitude in terms of rainfall amounts terra appears the most accurate product with only slight differences from 30 to 130 mm 3months terra pattern slightly diverges from ground data but this could be due to station scarcity in the eastern and western areas during the wet season from december to february djf fig 8 second row the rainfall spatial distribution of ground data is more heterogeneous the northern and southern parts of salak and gede pangrango volcanoes appear drier than the rest in the valley the rainfall amounts increase with a clear orographic effect in higher ground rain gauge 1400 mm 3months chelsa shows an increase in average rainfall mainly located on the slopes facing west which might be due to orographic effects this major orographic effect appears inconsistent with the ground observations conversely chirps and terra patterns are more consistent with ground data chirps highlights orographic effects concentrated in the highest area where its rainfall amounts are consistent with the few highground rain gauge with limited rain gauges at high altitudes it is not possible to fully validate the chirps orographic pattern in the lowest area chirps slightly overestimates rainfall amounts from 100 mm 3months in the south to 400 mm 3months in the northern part terra is underestimating orographic effects providing a quite homogenous rainfall spatial pattern while rainfall amounts are underestimated in volcano slopes it is overestimated in the valley and lower part from march to may mam fig 8 third row the transition season is slightly drier in the southern part and the valley chelsa rainfall pattern is characterized by orographic effect on southern slopes inconsistent with ground data terra highlights an east west gradient uncorrelated with the western ground station chirps provides more accurate patterns according to ground station with similar regional gradient and a foehn effect in the southern part nevertheless in lowest areas chirps still overestimates rainfall amounts finally during the dry season from june to august jja fig 8 fourth row ground data highlight a north south regional pattern chelsa gridded data are characterized by southeastern influence inconsistent with ground data while terra and even more chirps appear more reliable in both mam and jja periods it is interesting to note that chirps shows a dry area in the southern part of the valley center at 6 90 s 106 75 e this area possibly related to foehn effect appears larger on the ground data but demonstrates the ability of chirps to capture such local effect 3 2 2 rainfall orographic gradient the analysis of rainfall patterns highlighted the local complexity induced by mountainous environments in order to quantify orographic effects altitudinal gradients are determined for the 4 geo climatic sectors in fig 9 the seasons gradient for ground and product dataset are presented by average rainfall amounts for each dry jja and wet djf season between 2008 and 2013 during the wet season an increase in rainfall amounts in function of the elevation is visible while during the dry season rainfall amounts and the altitudinal gradients are low only chelsa highlights a slight gradient on the eastern slope of the salak volcano during transition periods mam and son the altitudinal gradients are in transitional states between the extremes of the dry and wet seasons in pangrango s southern and northern sectors chelsa describes steep gradient between 400 and 800 m a s l 77 and 60 mm 100 m for southern and northern areas respectively it then gradually decreases by around 12 and 13 mm 100 m for southern and northern areas in salak area chelsa gradient is more linear with variation from 13 mm 100 m in the southern part while the western slope gradient is more consistent with pangrango slope with a steep increase around 500 m a s l of 400 mm 100 m chirps describes gradients mostly linear with an increase in orographic effects from north to south over the pangrango it varies from 12 to 8 mm 100 m at southern and northern slopes respectively while over the northern slope of the salak it decreases to 5 mm 100 m the lack of data on the eastern slope of salak does not allow for an accurate gradient estimation terra s data gives estimates of altitudinal gradients close to chirps ones with the same trend along the north south axis on pangrango terra gradients vary from 9 to 7 mm 100 m between southern and northern slopes while they decrease to 3 1 mm 100 m on northern and eastern salak s slopes respectively on salak s southern slope terra data are influenced by the overestimation of the east west gradient which induces large rainfall amounts at low altitude finally the ground stations are represented in order to assess global product orographic effects unfortunately ground rain gauges are mainly located at the base of the volcano slopes fig 9 this does not allow a clear appreciation of the altitudinal gradients in addition these stations give local information that can be influenced by local processes such as station 6 in the center of the valley which measures rainfall amounts above the other data during the wet season fig 2 and fig 8 the ground data are mainly consistent with the chirps and terra data over the four sectors chirps and terra only overestimate rainfall on the pangrango south area during the wet season for chelsa the ground data measure lower gradients on the pangrango while it is consistent with chelsa on the salak these results once again confirm the better correlation of the ground data and chirps and terra datasets compared to chelsa 4 discussion this study aims to assess the interest and reliability of global climate products for water management in ungauged tropical mountainous areas the accuracy of these global products can vary spatially satgé et al 2020 especially in complex areas such as tropical volcanic islands to assess the validity of global products we compared their rainfall estimates with ground rain gauge data by analyzing both temporal and spatial patterns gao and liu 2013 satgé et al 2019 the direct comparison of ground data and global products is known to integrate scales effects underestimating global product scores tang et al 2018 in order to overcome such data limitation we complete the statistical analysis with a process based interpretation to estimate if these products are consistent according to known climatic processes in tropical mountainous contexts and with other climatic studies these two steps provide a more exhaustive view of the strengths and weaknesses of the global products in order to properly identify whether they can be appropriate for the study area as well as their application limits the different results are summarized in table 4 in order to define the range of local applicability of each product for local water management 4 1 temporal statistical analysis our temporal analysis starts with a general overview of global product s performances and their spatial distribution figs 4 5 however both climatic reanalyse and satellite data demonstrate an overestimation of rainfall amounts which is consistent with previous studies in mountaineous area hu et al 2016 hussain et al 2018 zeng et al 2018 in order to assess temporal consistency annual statistical scores are estimated chelsa performance decrease significantly over time especially after 2013 however chirps and terra scores did not show any deteriorated nor improved temporal trends between 2002 and 2018 fig 6 this result is consistent with previous studies in mountainous areas of chirps dataset e g satgé et al 2019 the variation in global product scores does not seem to be influenced by wet dry years furthermore the indonesian climate is strongly influenced by regional climate phenomena enso as syakur et al 2014 during the study period el niño events occurred in 2002 2006 2010 and 2015 in contrast la niña conditions occurred in 2007 2008 and 2011 2012 http www bom gov au climate about australian climate influences shtml bookmark enso the pluriannual analysis did not highlight specific patterns during these specific years at this step global products performance are rather constant over time demonstrating an interannual robustness nevertheless in order to set up annual water management plan we need to correctly catch the seasonality for short term water management it is mandatory to estimate the annual distribution of the recharge mostly during the rainy season and the importance of the drought mostly during the dry season these signals are generally poorly studied but are of primary importance for short term water resource management d arrigo and wilson 2008 our analysis highlights a common annual pattern of global products performance fig 7 during the wet season the global products are efficient to catch rainfall amounts but underestimate the interannual variability and dynamic during the dry season global products tend to overestimate the rainfall while they catch the interannual variability and dynamic their performance decreases for transition periods and more especially between the dry and wet season during this period rainfall amounts and dynamics is controlled by the start of the australian monsoon aldrian and susanto 2003 our study highlights the issue encountered by the global products to represent efficiently this dynamics these limitations during the dry and transition periods limit the efficiency of global products for accurate annual water management 4 2 spatial process based analysis in terms of process analysis fig 9 show the variability of regional patterns and orographic effects as a function of seasonality the ground rain gauge data shows a strong north south regional pattern during the wet season dfj and dry season jja however the distribution of ground rain gauges prevents from highlighting east west ones the chelsa rainfall spatial distribution is mostly controlled by topography while for terra it is driven by a regional east west pattern fig 8 table 4 these two distributions are significantly inconsistent with the ground rain gauge in the first case chelsa uses the elevation and dominant winds as a proxy for rainfall interpolation karger et al 2017 our results demonstrate that the elevation is not the only factor controlling rainfall patterns as regional rainfall patterns have to be take into account in the meantime orographic effects strongly depends on local climate forcing and morphology limiting the accuracy of using a single rainfall elevation relationship in the second case terra s ground data interpolation is mostly controlled by regional rainfall patterns orographic effects are only slightly represented with terra which limits its interest for the estimation of spatial rainfall patterns fig 8 table 4 this bias could come from an insufficient consideration of orographic effects in the interpolation technique finally chirps relies on remote sensing data and despite a general overestimation of rainfall amounts the spatial distribution appears consistent with orographic processes chirps define a north south rainfall pattern consistent with ground data especially with the drier area in the leeward plain at the south of the study area fig 8 table 4 nevertheless according to its spatial resolution it remains impossible to assess whether chirps represents correctly windward leeward rainfall contrast concerning orographic gradients they appear to be low during most of the year over all sectors and increase during the wet season to evaluate their accuracy our results can be compared with two recent studies in tropical mountains first toulier et al 2019 measured an orographic gradient on the northern slope of bromo tenger volcano java island at the bottom of the volcano annual rainfall amounts quickly increase from the shore to 500 600 m a s l with an altitudinal gradient around 290 mm 100 m between 500 and 1100 m a s l the altitudinal gradient decreases nearby 100 mm 100 m above 1100 m a s l the dynamics of the gradient is reversed with an annual rainfall decrease between 140 to 230 mm 100 m second réchou et al 2019 presented a detailed study of orographic effects over la réunion island in tropical area la réunion island climatic regime is not impacted by monsoon phenomena nevertheless the study highlights strong annual altitudinal gradients between the shore and 500 700 m a s l ranging from 300 to 700 mm 100 m above the negative altitudinal gradient induces a significant annual rainfall decrease finally we estimated an increase of the altitudinal gradient in djf season which is consistent with réchou et al 2019 they highlighted an altitudinal gradient increase during the wet season the altitudinal gradients defined by both ground and global products do not match previous studies at la réunion island réchou et al 2019 and at bromo tenger toulier et al 2019 that notably show a decrease of rainfall above a given elevation from 500 to 1100 m above the sea level while ground rain gauges are packed at the bottom of volcano slopes terra and chirps present altitudinal gradients increasing with the elevation table 4 this bias may come from the resolution of these products 5 and 4 km pixel length respectively which is not fine enough to determine rainfall gradients over a 15 to 30 km long volcano thanks to its fine resolution chelsa should be able to catch such orographic effects nevertheless its altitudinal gradients are too strong as they increase until 1200 to 1500 m a s l global products assessment through our statistical and process based analysis we are able to synthesize the strengths and limitations of each of the three products from this qualitative analysis it is then possible to use the different global products according to their characteristics while integrating in part their uncertainties the first product chelsa a very fine spatial resolution product 1 km² gave limited results on both the spatial and temporal evaluation on our study area table 4 at the interannual time scale and even more at seasonal scale chelsa overestimates rainfall amounts and variability from a spatial point of view chelsa is inconsistent with ground data since it relies on overestimated orographic effects our study demonstrates the limited interest of this product in the tropical mountainous context of our study site terra the second product obtains suitable and stable temporal scores table 4 terra tends to overestimate rainfall amounts during the dry season and seasonal variability during the end of the year as this period is the driest the related uncertainties remain acceptable for water balance computation the east west direction is strongly marked in the terra rainfall patterns compared to the ground data and orographic effects are concentrated on the summit areas limiting the interest of terra for spatial analysis as it stands terra should be interesting for temporal rainfall dynamics and could be a solution to coarse estimation of water balance computation however terra is might be too coarse for numbers of operational water resources management applications the third product chirps statistical scores highlights his global overestimation of rainfall while it is mainly consistent in terms of dynamics and variability table 4 this overestimation could be explained by ccd bias defining warm orographic clouds into rainfall clouds gebregiorgis and hossain 2013 however chirps provides interesting results in terms of spatial patterns fig 8 chirps is an interesting dataset to roughly integrate spatial rainfall patterns in water management studies especially when only scarce ground rain gauges are available nevertheless its resolution is too coarse to represent accurately altitudinal rainfall gradients on narrow slopes 15 km chirps thus lacks efficiency for water resources management of small watersheds 1000 km2 5 conclusion our study aims to assess high resolution global products accuracy for local water resources management their recent development opens up new solutions for water management at local scale this integration must be complemented by a significant effort of validation at the watershed scale especially under complex climatic behaviors in order to overcome the limitations of ground based data low density of ground rain gauge lack of river discharge data we combined a quantitative statistical approach with a processes based spatial analysis the former integrates three different temporalities including the analysis of seasonal biases rarely taken into account it allowed to discuss the general strengths and weaknesses of the global products in order to define their range of applicability for regional long term studies the combination with the spatial approach allows to precise the limits of each product by integrating the associated climatic processes orientation of monsoons orographic effect and assess their validity for water resource management over small watersheds on the western part of java it appears difficult to select one product adapted for all the needs indeed terra climatic reanalysis appears accurate and stable in the long term allowing to use it for water balance trends evaluations the products are still too uncertain to effectively monitor seasonal rainfall nevertheless in the absence of data terra reanalysis appears the most reliable product during the whole year for spatial analysis it appears that only chirps remote sensing data enables among the studied products to approach rainfall distribution such analysis should focus only on spatial variations due to chirps overestimation and with some necessary ground calibration the global products can thus be interesting locally nevertheless their use must be conditioned in view of their weaknesses their temporal accuracy is interesting but rainfall amounts bias are still too strong to be integrated in local water resources management tools the recurrent overestimation of rainfall during the dry period hinders the intensity of droughts and the assessment of their consequences this limitation is amplified by the difficulty of global products to capture transition period dynamics particularly the beginning of the wet season spatially satellite data provide interesting information but the bias caused by the higher altitudes and the still coarse resolution do not allow to correctly estimate local altitudinal gradients credit
