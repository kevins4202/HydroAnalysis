11235,increasing scarcity of irrigation water calls for enhancing water use efficiency wue of crops and improved planting method is a potential option field experiments were conducted for 3 years to evaluate effects of three planting methods of groundnut viz flat bed ridge and furrow and paired row at four irrigation regimes viz 1 2 3 and 4 irrigations ridge and furrow and paired row methods resulted in an increase in pod yield by 13 and 17 and irrigation water saving by 26 7 and 41 7 respectively compared with flat bed method although highest yield level was similar in ridge and furrow and paired row methods with four irrigations irrigation water was 28 4 less in the latter than the former in the three irrigation x paired row method pod yield reduced by only 3 8 whereas water saving was 26 9 compared to the four irrigations x paired row method better root dry weight greater intercepted photosynthetically active radiation chlorophyll fluorescence fv fm and Ñ„ps ii and rate of leaf photosynthesis contributed to higher yield and nutrient uptake under paired row at higher irrigation regime than traditional flat bed method although evapotranspiration et increased with higher irrigation regimes ridge and furrow and paired row method decreased et by 13 and 21 and increased crop wue by 32 6 and 48 respectively over flat bed the pod yield y et functions were found linear it has been revealed that the crop will achieve maximum pod yield 2109 kg ha 1 with 359 mm et under paired row planting computed elasticity of water production and crop yield response factor could well be used for making irrigation decisions this field study confirmed that paired row planting and furrow irrigation had increased pod yield saved water and enhanced wue of groundnut under hot sub humid conditions keywords groundnut irrigation planting method evapotranspiration water use efficiency yield et functions 1 introduction groundnut arachis hypogaea l also known as peanut is one of the dominant oilseed crops in india it is cultivated in an area of about 4 77 million ha with 7 40 million tonnes of production in the country the average groundnut yield is 1268 kg ha 1 in odisha state in eastern india which is lower than the national average yield 1552 kg ha 1 dac and fw 2016 rainy season coincides with the period between june to september major reason of lower yield is that the crop is mostly grown under rain fed condition only 25 8 of the area is irrigated irrigation is required during dry season especially in the situations of no or little rainfall and no substantial capillary rise further water supply is not adequate to irrigate crops either from reservoir water through canal system or from groundwater sources overexploitation and depletion of groundwater is alarming and it is a cause of concern consequently water stress is a common phenomenon which occurs during crop growth and causes yield reduction hence major challenges are to enhance yield as well as to increase water use efficiency wue of the crop furrow making and efficient planting rather than flat bed method and irrigation through furrows would save water and bring more area under irrigation there is growing need for groundnut irrigation in order to increase its yield especially due to frequent occurrences of drought soil moisture deficit or increased soil temperature prasad et al 2010 on the other hand there has been a rising concern on the availability of water for irrigation because irrigation water withdrawal is under fierce competition from other uses that include industrial purposes generation of electricity and energy and domestic consumption rijsberman 2006 mall et al 2006 therefore freshwater resources should be used for irrigation in the most productive and sustainable manner gleick 2003 gleick and palaniappan 2010 but practical ways and means are not readily available to the growers thus water limited situations call for crop production with increased wue howell 2001 tilman et al 2002 and water saving crop management practices in this regard advancing agronomic management is essential for increasing yield and wue of groundnut previous studies have shown that water stress or drought reduced pod yield and biomass production of groundnut lamb et al 2004 haro et al 2008 songsri et al 2009 vaghasia et al 2010 shinde et al 2010 koolachart et al 2013 dang et al 2013 the underlying reasons of reduced yield were reduced dry weight of roots and wue songsri et al 2009 impaired pegging and pod formation due to increased soil strength by surface drying sadras and milroy 1996 reddy et al 2003 haro et al 2008 affected micro sporogenesis and fertilization due to increased day temperature beyond 35 c prasad et al 2001 reduced conductance of stomata and rate of carbon exchange nautiyal et al 1999 egli and bruening 2001 reduced relative leaf water content and cell membrane stability with concomitant reduction in kernel number per plant shinde et al 2010 dang et al 2013 decreased chlorophyll biosynthesis richardson et al 2002 nigam and aruna 2008 decreased dry matter production and atmospheric n fixation pimratch et al 2008 low yields were also reported due to water logging because groundnut is sensitive to excess soil moisture ibrahim et al 2002 which caused pest and diseases infestation for example leaf miner aproaerema modicella leaf spot disease or commonly called as tikka disease cercospora arachidicola thus previous research findings delved mostly into the basic understanding on water relation in plants and crop physiology it is important that viable and practical agronomic options that increase pod and biomass yield and save irrigation water are developed information is available on irrigation scheduling and critical growth stages of groundnut but irrigation water saving technique is required to growers patel et al 2008 suggested for irrigating the crop at 40 mm cumulative pan evaporation which would give wue of 4 76 kg ha 1 mm 1 in gujarat india chauhan et al 2013 developed a decision support model which enabled irrigation scheduling to commercial groundnut production ratio of irrigation water and cumulative pan evaporation 0 5 to 0 9 was used as criterion for irrigation to summer groundnut in eastern india bandyopadhyay et al 2005 craufurd et al 2006 have found a good relationship between groundnut yield and water use with appropriate sowing date and irrigation selection of water stress tolerant genotypes songsri et al 2009 application of mulches ramakrishna et al 2006 zagade and chavan 2010 withholding irrigation vaghasia et al 2010 drip irrigation zhu et al 2004 and moving sprinkler plaut and ben hur 2005 have been advocated earlier but the aim of increasing yield and wue could not be achieved always moreover mulching and micro irrigation technologies have not been adopted widely by groundnut farmers in india although yield benefits of paired row twin row planting pattern have been researched and published lanier et al 2004 sorensen et al 2007 culbreath et al 2008 ihejirika et al 2008 tubbs et al 2011 this was emphasized mostly to reduce insect pest and disease incidences not on water saving in india limited information is available for planting methods on other crops for example paired row for cotton aujla et al 2005 planting of oilseed rape on ridges and beds receiving irrigation through each or alternate furrows buttar et al 2006 sowing of soybean soybean maize or soybean pigeon pea intercropping on broad bed and furrows in vertisols mandal et al 2013 but no attempts have been made so far for groundnut with the aim to increase yield and wue improved method of planting and water saving technique would be required for eastern indian hot and sub humid condition further it is essential that pod yield and evapotranspiration et production functions are developed to reveal the dynamic relations on pod yield et requirement and wue crop yield response factors ky are important criteria and indices which reveal complex relationships between water use and crop production the estimation of these ky values would be required for this crop to evolve irrigation strategy especially for the growing condition under hot and sub humid climate earlier crop coefficient of groundnut and yield response factors reddy and reddy 1993 kheira 2009 and response function with imposed water stress jain et al 1997 have been developed with the aim of irrigation scheduling therefore attempts were made i to study the influence of irrigation regimes and improved planting methods on pod yield et wue and n uptake by groundnut ii to find out the basis of yield variation using crop growth and physiological parameters viz root dry weight interception of photosynthetically active radiation chlorophyll fluorescence and leaf photosynthesis iii to study the changes in soil temperature and soil organic carbon stock and iv to develop pod yield et production functions to reveal the dynamic relationships of yield et and wue of groundnut under tropical sub humid condition 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of experimental site field experiments were carried out at the research farm of the icar indian institute of water management mendhasal near bhubaneswar odisha india 20 18 n 85 41 e and 97 m msl climate is hot i e tropical and sub humid weather data and information were recorded from the weather station which is situated at 1 24 km away from the experiment site average annual rainfall is about 1490 mm out of this about 81 occur during monsoon season i e june to september when rice is the predominant crop whereas post rainy season period i e winter and summer months receive either no or very little rainfall the season for growing summer groundnut was from the month of january to may rainfall was 49 1 mm in 2008 and 22 4 mm in 2010 and no rainfall was received in 2009 during the crop growing period i e mid january to 1st week of may average pan evaporation ep was 4 1 4 2 and 4 2 mm d 1 in 2008 2009 and 2010 respectively the maximum ep was 5 8 6 5 mm d 1 and the minimum was 2 5 2 7 mm d 1 over three years the cumulative ep was 465 6 464 9 and 475 7 mm in three years during the cropping period winter season december to february is short and mild air temperature starts increasing in summer months average

occurrence of terminal heat stress in the region during the period which coincides with summer groundnut growing season however year wise variation was minimum in three years of experimentation the textural class of the experimental soil was sandy clay loam with 65 sand 14 silt and 21 clay relative sand fractions declined with the increase in soil depth and clay contents increased in 60 90 cm particle size distribution was 62 sand 12 silt and 26 clay soil was slightly acidic with ph 5 6 soil water ratio 1 2 5 but non saline electrical conductivity 0 31 ds m 1 initial soil organic carbon soc 4 4 g kg 1 was low available p 5 96 mg kg 1 and k 87 mg kg 1 were also low bulk density was 1 43 mg m 3 available water ranged from 0 156 to 0 172 m3 m 3 page et al 1982 klute 1986 nelson and sommers 1996 soil moisture regime was typic ustic and temperature regime hyperthermic 2 2 treatments experimental design and crop management field experiments were conducted over three consecutive years 2008 2010 the experiment was laid out in a split plot design with three replications treatments consisted of four irrigation regimes in the main plots one i1 in flowering stage two i2 in flowering and pod development three i3 in vegetative flowering and pod development and four i4 in vegetative flowering pod initiation and pod development and three planting methods in sub plots as flat bed sfb ridge and furrow srf and paired row method spr irrigations were scheduled in critical growth stages physiological and phenological aspects were duly considered as there was no or little rainfall and no substantial capillary rise of water it was decided scheduling irrigation during physiologically important stages for planting methods in sfb spacing was 30 cm row to row and 10 cm plant to plant in srf planting on ridges separated by furrows with same spacing as in sfb and in spr method distance between two rows paired row on the narrow bed was 15 cm and plant to plant 15 cm fig 1 spacing in different methods was designed in such a way that each treatment had uniform density of 30 33 plants per m2 irrigation was applied by flood method in sfb and furrow irrigation in srf single rows on ridge separated by furrows and spr paired row on narrow beds separated by furrows land preparation manure and fertilizer application planting etc were done as per the standard management practices for this crop organic manure i e farmyard manure was applied at 4 5 tonnes per ha and incorporated before final ploughing and preparing the land by a tractor drawn plough the rate of fertilizer n p2o5 and k2o was 20 40 and 40 kg ha 1 respectively sources were urea diammonium phosphate and muriate of potash one pre sowing irrigation of 65 mm was applied before land preparation for proper germination of seeds and uniform establishment of the crop seeds of groundnut var tag 24 was sown on 10 15 january every year as per the treatments ridge and furrow srf and narrow bed was made in spr plots other crop management practices were taken up as recommended for this crop viz weeding hoeing before onset of flowering measures against infestation by plant diseases and or insect pests during the entire crop period the crop was harvested manually from 2 to 6 may every year pod yield was calculated from net plot area 3 5 m x 4 m and reported at 15 moisture the duration of the crop was 110 114 days 2 3 measurement methods and calculation procedures 2 3 1 root dry weight chlorophyll fluorescence and leaf photosynthesis three plants having average growth were selected from each plot for root sampling root samples were collected through the monolith method with each sampler centered over the plant heeraman and juma 1993 serraj et al 2004 samples were washed carefully in a bucket of water separating all roots by straining roots were dried in an oven at 70 c for 72 h till the constant weight was obtained then root dry weight was recorded three fully matured leaves from the same plant were used to measure chlorophyll fluorescence with a fluorescence monitoring system model fms 2 hansatech instruments ltd norfolk u k the parameters measured were dark adapted maximum photochemical efficiency fv fm and quantum yield of ps ii Ñ„ps ii at flowering and pod development stages of the crop from each plot prior to each set of fv fm measurement leaves were dark adapted for a period of 30 min using leaf clips souza et al 2004 the same leaves were also used to measure rate of leaf photosynthesis using a portable photosynthesis system model ciras 2 pp systems u k these measurements were done and recorded during flowering and pod development stages on clear sunny days solar radiation 1200 Î¼mol m2 s 1 between 10 30 and 11 00 h 2 3 2 photosynthetically active radiation photosynthetically active radiation was measured by a portable line quantum sensor model ems 7 sw ws burrage uk measurements were made in five places from each plot on different julian days coinciding with critical stages of crop growth incident i0 and transmitted i1 radiation was recorded at about 11 00 12 30 h 1 h on sunny days gallo and daughtry 1986 kiniry et al 2005 i0 was measured at the top of the canopy and i1 at the below by placing the sensor across crop rows the fraction of intercepted par i e fipar was calculated as 1 fipar i0 i1 i0 2 3 3 soil parameters and soil temperature soil particles i e sand silt and clay fractions were determined using the hydrometer method and soil texture was determined using the usda classification system the ph and ec was measured by the digital meters soil bulk density by core sampling method field capacity of soil and wilting point using a pressure plate apparatus eijkelkamp agrisearch equipment the netherlands soil temperature was measured by manual thermometers aic agro instruments pvt ltd kolkata india thermometers were made of mercury in glass in a rigid brass stem with pointed end for smooth entry into soil having fuse bulbs for quick response to temperature changes measurements were carried out up to 30 cm soil depth during the day time between 8 00 and 17 00 h with 30 min intervals soil organic carbon content was determined by walkley black method nelson and sommers 1982 the soc stock mg ha 1 was then calculated by using soc content g g 1 bulk density mg m 3 and thickness of soil layer m as the following 2 soc stock soc content bd soil depth nitrogen content in kernel and haulm was analyzed by kjeldahl method horneck and miller 1998 and n uptake was calculated using biomass and n concentration 2 3 4 irrigation water soil moisture and estimation of evapotranspiration irrigation was measured by rbc flume eijkelkamp model 13 17 02 in each event of application recorded sill heights mm were used to determine flow rate soil moisture was determined by thermo gravimetric method before sowing about 15 days interval during crop growing period and after harvesting evapotranspiration et was calculated using the water balance method as was used earlier also mandal et al 2006 3 et p i cp dp rf Î´s where p rainfall mm i irrigation mm cp capillary contribution dp deep percolation rf surface runoff and Î´s the change in soil moisture storage mm in the profile 0 90 cm calculated from soil moisture data on the date of sowing and at harvest cp was assumed to be negligible as the groundwater depth was low 4 m as there was no change in moisture storage beyond 90 cm depth dp was also considered negligible irrigation in each event was not sufficient to saturate entire profile and to cause deep percolation no runoff occurred because little or no rainfall was received during the cropping period thus et mm was calculated using p i and Î´s crop water use efficiency wue was computed as pod yield y divided by et y in kg ha 1 hence expressed as kg ha 1 mm 1 and irrigation water use efficiency iwue was computed as pod yield y divided by cumulative irrigation water mm 2 3 5 pod yield evapotranspiration relationship pod yield and evapotranspiration relationships were developed the dataset of pod yield and cumulative et obtained from three years experiment were used for developing these relationships regression technique was used separately for three planting methods it was linear function of the form y a b et where a is the intercept b the slope or the coefficient y et is the wue y et is the slope b or the marginal water use efficiency wuem and y y et et i e the rate of change of pod yield with respect to the rate of change of et is the elasticity of water production ewp the expressions haxem and heady 1978 liu et al 2002 are 4 w u e m b 5 e w p b e t a b e t when et is maximum etm ym being the maximum yield the crop yield response factor ky of doorenbos and kassam 1979 is 6 k y 1 y y m 1 e t e t m 2 4 statistical analyses data were analyzed statistically following analyses of variance anova technique as outlined for split plot design gomez and gomez 1984 significance testing was carried out by f test at 5 probability level p 0 05 for all parameters then mean differences were compared with computed least significant difference lsd duncan s range test was used for ranking of both main plot treatments sub plot treatments and interactions means at p 0 05 regression models of pod yield and evapotranspiration relationships were developed using data analysis software of ms excel coefficients of determination r2 were computed and tested statistically 3 results and discussion 3 1 root dry weight root dry weight rdw increased with the increase in crop growth over the period of study i e 30 90 days after planting dap variation was recorded in different irrigation regimes and planting methods in both the seasons fig 2 though the differences were similar initially at 30 dap rdw varied significantly p 0 05 afterwards with imposition of irrigation treatments the interaction between irrigation regime and planting method was not significant on rdw maximum rdw was attained with 1 40 1 43 1 58 and 1 73 g plant 1 in i1 i2 i3 and i4 respectively up to 60 dap i3 and i4 had similar water regime hence there was no difference in rdw and then i4 showed significantly p 0 05 higher values than i3 further between i1 and i2 the difference was not significant throughout crop growth planting methods showed considerable differences also maximum rdw was 1 48 1 55 and 1 58 g plant 1 in sfb srf and spr respectively in the 2008 growing season 2008 among planting methods though srf and spr showed no significant differences they were significantly higher than sfb at p 0 05 this trend was similar in the 2009 growing season hence results were consistent our results indicated that root growth was favored by the optimum irrigation regime as in i3 and i4 in general large root system supports crop to mine water from soil puangbut et al 2009 we have found that soil drying and drought condition hindered root growth as a result of reductions in water supply in i1 and i2 however i1 had similar rdw to i2 where water stress was more in the former than the latter it implied that crop adaptation was more with root growth up to certain extent of decrease in soil moisture similar results were also reported songsri et al 2009 where drought reduced rdw of groundnut hence reduced root dry weight might have affected pod yield in lower irrigation regimes and in flat bed planting koolachart et al 2013 also found adverse impact of soil surface desiccation on root growth and pod yield 3 2 photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by groundnut crop canopy irrigation regimes and planting methods influenced the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fipar intercepted by groundnut crop canopy fig 3 it was measured in two crop growing seasons jan may 2008 and 2009 out of three years of field experiment the fipar was at the minimum at initial stage of the crop and no significant difference was observed among treatments afterwards significant differences were noted till the last observation on julian day jd 116 or jd 113 the maximum fipar was 60 in i1 64 in i2 68 in i3 and 71 in i4 and 61 in sfb 71 in srf and 74 in spr in first crop growing season in 2008 the maximum interception occurred during 60 75 days after sowing i e at jd 76 90 this growing period coincided with maximum foliage cover by the crop canopy with regard to treatments fipar was higher in i3 and i4 compared with i1 and i2 underlying reason was that the adequate irrigation at i3 as well as i4 favored better crop growth and canopy expansion which intercepted more par than the canopy which was grown with inadequate irrigation i1 and i2 haro et al 2008 also found variation in light capture by groundnut canopy with the direct effect of water stress water stress affected crop growth hence reduced intercepted par the fipar differed significantly among planting methods at p 0 05 it was the highest in spr which was statistically similar with sfb range of calculated fipar was 36 61 41 71 and 45 74 in sfb srf and spr respectively in the first season jan may 2008 41 64 42 70 and 45 72 in corresponding treatments in the second season jan may 2009 the paired row or the ridge and furrow technique facilitated better crop growing environment than the flat method tubbs et al 2011 also demonstrated that paired rows had outperformed single rows in the plant stands and canopy expansion in paired row cropping groundnut might have intercepted more of the incoming radiation by horizontal leaf distribution due to higher extinction coefficient kiniry et al 2005 awal et al 2006 moreover there was close link of incident par with the canopy cover and development due to irrigation and planting methods in groundnut 3 3 chlorophyll fluorescence fv fm Ñ„ps ii and rate of leaf photosynthesis pn chlorophyll fluorescence fv fm Ñ„ps ii and the rate of leaf photosynthesis differed significantly with irrigation regimes and planting methods at p 0 05 the maximum fv fm Ñ„ps ii and pn was obtained in i4 indicating better physiological functioning of plants with adequate water supply through four irrigation table 1 however with the reduction in water supply as in i1 and i2 ability of plants might have reduced to metabolize only normally moreover imbalance might have occurred between the absorption of light energy by chlorophyll and the use of energy in photosynthesis maxwell and johnson 2000 murchie and lawson 2013 a strong and positive relationship was also reported between chlorophyll and photosynthetically active light transmittance characteristics of leaves richardson et al 2002 and water use by plants sheshshayee et al 2006 higher values of fv fm Ñ„ps ii and pn were obtained in spr compared with sfb and srf however fv fm was statistically similar in srf and spr in pod development stage and pn was similar in these two treatments both in flowering and pod development stage better plant growth in spr and srf might have managed not to cause photoinhibition long et al 1994 or sustained quenching demmig adams and adams 2006 compared to flat bed method sfb consequently there was marginally higher fv fm Ñ„ps ii and rate of photosynthesis in plant leaves in plots with srf and spr than those in sfb 3 4 effect of irrigation on soil temperature mean values showed that the temperature was higher in dry as compared to irrigated plots i4 because of less soil moisture in dry condition i1 fig 4 the temperature in the surface soil increased at faster rate than those in other depths maximum soil temperature was recorded as 43 6 c in 0 5 cm soil at around 11 30 h on the day under dry condition whereas in irrigated i4 plots we observed gradual increase in soil temperature and the maximum was 35 8 c around 11 30 h to 13 30 h then there was decrease in temperature after 13 30 h onwards in the soil just beneath the surface maximum temperature was recorded as 37 8 c in dry and 33 6 c in irrigated conditions temperature variations in lower soil depths i e 10 20 cm 20 30 cm were lesser than surface soil fig 4 regulation of thermal environment was primarily due to better soil moisture regime upon imposed irrigation ramakrishna et al 2006 because of high heat capacity of water different irrigation regimes would likely lead to different soil temperature conditions as was evident in our study elevated soil temperature in the pod zone might have detrimental effect to the crop davidson et al 1991 sorensen and wright 2002 golombek and johansen 1997 reported that the greatest number of pods was formed at mean soil temperatures between 23 and 29 c and 17 and 35 c were sub and supra optimal respectively this variation in soil temperature caused differential thermal environment in plots receiving different irrigation regimes this would form the basis for interpretation of yield differences due to irrigation treatments in present investigation 3 5 effect of irrigation and planting methods on pod haulm yield across years pod haulm yield increased with increase in irrigation regimes highest pod yield was obtained in i4 1979 kg ha 1 and the lowest in i1 1335 kg ha 1 the increase in pod yield was 20 37 and 48 in i2 i3 and i4 respectively over i1 positive response of the crop was obtained to the applied irrigation as there was no rainfall in 2009 and only 27 9 and 21 5 mm in 2008 and 2010 growing seasons respectively hence maximum pod yield was observed with highest irrigation regime similarly highest pod yield was recorded in spr which was 17 higher than sfb with regard to planting treatments it was 13 higher in srf than sfb the interaction effect between irrigation regimes and planting methods was found significant table 2 across all combination of irrigation regimes and planting methods pod yield ranged from 1194 to 2056 kg ha 1 being the highest in i4 x spr and the lowest in i1 x sfb of course srf and spr showed similar as well as the highest when in combination with i4 the next best combination was i3 x spr where pod yield was only 3 8 less than that in i4 x spr but with reduction in amount of applied water by 28 4 and 43 1 compared with i4 x spr and i4 x srf respectively this results show that paired row or ridge and furrow planting with furrow irrigation has led to 13 17 higher pod yield compared to the flat bed method paired row planting saved irrigation water by 41 7 compared to flat bed method although interaction was not significant haulm yields varied significantly p 0 05 due to irrigation regimes and planting methods table 3 haulm yield increased in i2 26 i3 39 and i4 45 over i1 and 18 and 23 in srf and spr over sfb number of pods per plant increased to the highest in i4 which was statistically at par with i3 similarly it was significantly p 0 05 higher in spr than other planting methods table 3 the yield increase both pod and haulm in paired row method with furrow irrigation might be attributed to greater interception of par maximum fluorescence efficiency fv fm and Ñ„ps ii and net leaf photosynthesis as presented and discussed earlier higher irrigation regimes ensured adequate soil moisture in the pod elongation zone which was actually critical for peg penetration and formation of pods reddy et al 2003 there was a good relation between pod yield and water use by groundnut craufurd et al 2006 water stress in i1 and also in i2 i e with inadequate water supply affected crop growth and yield yield reduction due to soil water deficit has been reported earlier lamb et al 2004 haro et al 2008 songsri et al 2009 shinde et al 2010 ratnakumar et al 2009 also found that water uptake was critical for pod yield in flat beds successive cohorts of pegs might have exposed to desiccated soil surface conditions and evaporative demand which might have impacted adversely on final pod set the reasons for better yield in paired row technique might be credited to plant stands shortened time to full ground cover and improved light interception sorensen et al 2007 tubbs et al 2011 previous researchers also reported yield advantages in paired rows than single row of groundnut culbreath et al 2008 lanier et al 2004 nuti et al 2008 sorensen et al 2004 3 6 irrigation water evapotranspiration et and water use efficiency wue the irrigation volume in terms of depth increased significantly with the increase in irrigation regimes at p 0 05 cumulative volume was 60 6 114 9 159 1 and 225 8 mm in i1 i2 i3 and i4 respectively it increased due to increase in number of total irrigation water applied in different treatments conversely irrigation water decreased in srf 133 0 mm and spr 105 8 mm over sfb 181 5 mm results clearly indicated that there was a significant reduction in irrigation water by 26 7 in srf and 41 7 in spr when compared to sfb the interaction between irrigation and planting methods was also significant largest depth 291 4 mm was obtained in i4 x sfb combination table 2 the trend showed that the depth was more in every combination of irrigation level with sfb and decreased comparatively in combinations with srf and the smallest in spr evapotranspiration increased with higher irrigation regimes due to more water supplies the trend of interaction between irrigation and planting methods showed similar pattern as in depth of irrigation across irrigation regimes estimated et decreased by 13 in srf 288 3 mm and 21 in spr 263 2 mm over sfb 331 2 mm both the calculated parameters i e crop wue and irrigation wue decreased with the increase in irrigation regimes tables 2 and 3 ridge and furrow paired row technique saved substantial amount of irrigation water due to having furrow irrigation and consequently increased both crop wue and iwue while maintaining similar or more pod yield highest wue of 7 03 kg ha 1 mm 1 was obtained in spr which was 48 higher than the value obtained at sfb similarly iwue was about 105 higher in spr than sfb in srf also wue and iwue was 33 and 62 higher than sfb in previous studies with flat bed method reported et ranged from 356 to 434 mm for summer groundnut in eastern india bandyopadhyay et al 2005 consumptive water use of 795 8 mm with wue of 4 76 kg ha 1 mm 1 in gujarat western india patel et al 2008 our results indicated higher wue than the earlier reports thus our findings demonstrated that substantial increase of wue could be possible by paired row method of planting 3 7 pod yield crop evapotranspiration relationship regression based water production functions have been developed three year pod yield y and cumulative et x data were used for developing y et relationship for groundnut under three planting treatments fig 5 all functions were best fitted in a linear pattern with quite high and significant coefficient of determination r2 at p 0 05 the intercepts varied among planting treatments it was the highest with spr and the lowest in sfb the slope or the coefficients were found positive those increased gradually from sfb through spr kheira 2009 also found linear relationship between groundnut yields and seasonal cumulative et these models would help interpret pod yield et and wue of groundnut crop by marginal analysis of water production functions as the functions were found linear the changing trend of wue with et was directly affected by the intercept as the intercepts were much higher than zero wue decreased with increasing et in every planting method from these relationships it can be quantified that the crop will achieve maximum pod yield of 1902 2112 and 2109 kg ha 1 if the et requirement etm of 467 402 and 359 mm is met under sfb srf and spr treatments respectively wuem were the same as the slopes i e 2 79 3 14 and 3 41 in corresponding planting methods table 4 it implied that the change in pod yield with respect to change in cumulative et remained constant in any of the three planting methods it gave a warranty that obtained pod yields would match planting methods the ratio of relative yield decrease to relative evapotranspiration deficit was the crop yield response factor ky the ewp values were found very close to ky it indicated that cumulative crop et was near to etm the ky values obtained in our study were very close to the value of 0 70 as was standardized and published in the milestone publication of fao irrigation and drainage paper no 33 by doorenbos and kassam 1979 for every planting method ky was less than 1 which means groundnut crop was tolerant to water deficit and recovered partially from water stress according to yield response factor guidelines moreover the crop exhibited less than proportional reductions in pod yield with reduced irrigation steduto et al 2012 our results are in conformity with findings of reddy and reddy 1993 who reported that for relative seasonal et of 0 76 to 0 84 groundnut yield varied from 0 74 to 0 86 whereas by using soil water balance equation to estimate crop et kheira 2009 reported an average ky of 2 9 for groundnut which was higher than the 0 7 being maximum seasonal et 488 mm in his experiment with full irrigation treatment the ewp value is analytic to characteristic changes of yield and wue with varying et this parameter indicates the scope of any possible improvement on the pod yield or wue due to imposed treatment as per the criterion yield will increase with increasing et if ewp 0 conversely yield will decrease if ewp 0 if ewp is equal to 1 both yield and wue will reach to the maximum level in this study the ewp values were greater than zero and less than 1 in every planting methods it reveals that still there is a scope to increase pod yield of groundnut and it s wue the scope was found greater with paired row planting method where ewp was 0 76 compared with flat bed ewp 0 87 and ridge and furrow method ewp 0 86 the later values were more close to one this study is similar to and in agreement with our previous findings on water yield relationship of wheat for central indian condition mandal et al 2005 therefore marginal analysis and ky which are based on y et relationships would imply strategic irrigation to meet the et requirement to increase pod yield and wue of this crop more so under limited water availability in a hot and sub humid condition earlier jain et al 1997 also developed water stress response function for groundnut and suggested for use of the same for water saving 3 8 soil organic carbon stock kernel haulm nitrogen uptake soil organic carbon stock in 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil depth did not vary significantly p 0 05 due to imposition of irrigation and planting treatments table 5 whereas uptake of nitrogen n varied significantly p 0 05 however it reveals that the soc stock was more in upper soil layer 0 15 cm than the lower 15 30 cm with regard to total soc stock it ranged from 20 53 to 21 04 in irrigation treatments and 20 89 to 21 86 mg ha 1 in planting methods in our earlier studies similar results on soc stock were reported for rice groundnut cropping from the same location mandal et al 2012 it has indicated that the soil environment in terms of maintenance of soil organic carbon status has not been deteriorated due to groundnut cropping over three years nitrogen content in kernels and above ground biomass i e haulms of groundnut did not vary significantly p 0 05 due to different irrigation and planting treatments kernel n content ranged from 2 79 to 3 51 and haulm n from 1 71 to 2 52 however n uptake by kernel and haulms varied significantly at p 0 05 table 5 the kernel n uptake was significantly the highest in i4 whereas haulm n uptake was the highest and similar in i3 and i4 with regard to planting treatments both kernel n and haulm n was significantly the highest in spr at p 0 05 the underlying reason for variation was the kernel and haulm yield level as the yield was higher in four irrigation and in paired row method even with similar n content n uptake was higher accordingly our results and reasons are in conformity with an earlier report rami reddy et al 1982 that a combination of higher irrigation regime and soil n application had higher uptake due to optimum available moisture and nitrogen to groundnut crop 4 conclusions in this field study the effect of improved planting methods of groundnut viz ridge and furrow at 30 x 10 cm spacing and paired row at 45 x 15 cm spacing was evaluated and compared with traditional flat bed method with 30 x 10 cm spacing at different irrigation regimes improved methods were furrow irrigated there was no such technique available to the growers earlier for increasing yield saving of irrigation water and increasing wue of groundnut our results clearly demonstrated that the improved methods viz ridge and furrow and paired row would increase yield by 13 and 17 and irrigation water saving by 27 and 42 respectively when compared with flat bed method we achieved enhanced wue in improved planting methods the variation in yield of this crops has been explained in terms of changes in root dry weight intercepted par chlorophyll fluorescence efficiency leaf photosynthesis as well as mitigation of high day time soil temperature through irrigation thus our research findings would help growers to adopt improved planting method and saving of irrigation water the marginal analyses on the developed y et regression relationships have revealed the dynamic relationship of y et and wue for this crop the computed parameters viz wuem ewp and ky would help in making interpretation of yield variation in different water regimes we have obtained ky values those are less than one which implied that groundnut crop showed signs of reduction in pod yield with lower irrigation regimes the ewp values are greater than zero and less than one which reveals that there exists further scope of increasing pod yield and wue of the crop the results of our study would help in predicting yield of groundnut with respect to availability of water the yield and wue of the crop with respect to different irrigation regimes could be used as guidelines for irrigation formulation of strategies the functional relationships would help substantially for management decisions on irrigation application it has also indicated what would be the achievable pod yield with respect to the maximum et the improved method has been demonstrated to a large number of farmers through lecture video film etc moreover farmers in the canal irrigated areas would get benefit out of this improved planting method there is a huge scope of up scaling of this technology for increasing yield and wue of this crop the study could be an important reference for water saving of groundnut production in a hot sub humid climate acknowledgments authors duly acknowledge the help rendered by dr h chakraborty scientist deceased in

11235,increasing scarcity of irrigation water calls for enhancing water use efficiency wue of crops and improved planting method is a potential option field experiments were conducted for 3 years to evaluate effects of three planting methods of groundnut viz flat bed ridge and furrow and paired row at four irrigation regimes viz 1 2 3 and 4 irrigations ridge and furrow and paired row methods resulted in an increase in pod yield by 13 and 17 and irrigation water saving by 26 7 and 41 7 respectively compared with flat bed method although highest yield level was similar in ridge and furrow and paired row methods with four irrigations irrigation water was 28 4 less in the latter than the former in the three irrigation x paired row method pod yield reduced by only 3 8 whereas water saving was 26 9 compared to the four irrigations x paired row method better root dry weight greater intercepted photosynthetically active radiation chlorophyll fluorescence fv fm and Ñ„ps ii and rate of leaf photosynthesis contributed to higher yield and nutrient uptake under paired row at higher irrigation regime than traditional flat bed method although evapotranspiration et increased with higher irrigation regimes ridge and furrow and paired row method decreased et by 13 and 21 and increased crop wue by 32 6 and 48 respectively over flat bed the pod yield y et functions were found linear it has been revealed that the crop will achieve maximum pod yield 2109 kg ha 1 with 359 mm et under paired row planting computed elasticity of water production and crop yield response factor could well be used for making irrigation decisions this field study confirmed that paired row planting and furrow irrigation had increased pod yield saved water and enhanced wue of groundnut under hot sub humid conditions keywords groundnut irrigation planting method evapotranspiration water use efficiency yield et functions 1 introduction groundnut arachis hypogaea l also known as peanut is one of the dominant oilseed crops in india it is cultivated in an area of about 4 77 million ha with 7 40 million tonnes of production in the country the average groundnut yield is 1268 kg ha 1 in odisha state in eastern india which is lower than the national average yield 1552 kg ha 1 dac and fw 2016 rainy season coincides with the period between june to september major reason of lower yield is that the crop is mostly grown under rain fed condition only 25 8 of the area is irrigated irrigation is required during dry season especially in the situations of no or little rainfall and no substantial capillary rise further water supply is not adequate to irrigate crops either from reservoir water through canal system or from groundwater sources overexploitation and depletion of groundwater is alarming and it is a cause of concern consequently water stress is a common phenomenon which occurs during crop growth and causes yield reduction hence major challenges are to enhance yield as well as to increase water use efficiency wue of the crop furrow making and efficient planting rather than flat bed method and irrigation through furrows would save water and bring more area under irrigation there is growing need for groundnut irrigation in order to increase its yield especially due to frequent occurrences of drought soil moisture deficit or increased soil temperature prasad et al 2010 on the other hand there has been a rising concern on the availability of water for irrigation because irrigation water withdrawal is under fierce competition from other uses that include industrial purposes generation of electricity and energy and domestic consumption rijsberman 2006 mall et al 2006 therefore freshwater resources should be used for irrigation in the most productive and sustainable manner gleick 2003 gleick and palaniappan 2010 but practical ways and means are not readily available to the growers thus water limited situations call for crop production with increased wue howell 2001 tilman et al 2002 and water saving crop management practices in this regard advancing agronomic management is essential for increasing yield and wue of groundnut previous studies have shown that water stress or drought reduced pod yield and biomass production of groundnut lamb et al 2004 haro et al 2008 songsri et al 2009 vaghasia et al 2010 shinde et al 2010 koolachart et al 2013 dang et al 2013 the underlying reasons of reduced yield were reduced dry weight of roots and wue songsri et al 2009 impaired pegging and pod formation due to increased soil strength by surface drying sadras and milroy 1996 reddy et al 2003 haro et al 2008 affected micro sporogenesis and fertilization due to increased day temperature beyond 35 c prasad et al 2001 reduced conductance of stomata and rate of carbon exchange nautiyal et al 1999 egli and bruening 2001 reduced relative leaf water content and cell membrane stability with concomitant reduction in kernel number per plant shinde et al 2010 dang et al 2013 decreased chlorophyll biosynthesis richardson et al 2002 nigam and aruna 2008 decreased dry matter production and atmospheric n fixation pimratch et al 2008 low yields were also reported due to water logging because groundnut is sensitive to excess soil moisture ibrahim et al 2002 which caused pest and diseases infestation for example leaf miner aproaerema modicella leaf spot disease or commonly called as tikka disease cercospora arachidicola thus previous research findings delved mostly into the basic understanding on water relation in plants and crop physiology it is important that viable and practical agronomic options that increase pod and biomass yield and save irrigation water are developed information is available on irrigation scheduling and critical growth stages of groundnut but irrigation water saving technique is required to growers patel et al 2008 suggested for irrigating the crop at 40 mm cumulative pan evaporation which would give wue of 4 76 kg ha 1 mm 1 in gujarat india chauhan et al 2013 developed a decision support model which enabled irrigation scheduling to commercial groundnut production ratio of irrigation water and cumulative pan evaporation 0 5 to 0 9 was used as criterion for irrigation to summer groundnut in eastern india bandyopadhyay et al 2005 craufurd et al 2006 have found a good relationship between groundnut yield and water use with appropriate sowing date and irrigation selection of water stress tolerant genotypes songsri et al 2009 application of mulches ramakrishna et al 2006 zagade and chavan 2010 withholding irrigation vaghasia et al 2010 drip irrigation zhu et al 2004 and moving sprinkler plaut and ben hur 2005 have been advocated earlier but the aim of increasing yield and wue could not be achieved always moreover mulching and micro irrigation technologies have not been adopted widely by groundnut farmers in india although yield benefits of paired row twin row planting pattern have been researched and published lanier et al 2004 sorensen et al 2007 culbreath et al 2008 ihejirika et al 2008 tubbs et al 2011 this was emphasized mostly to reduce insect pest and disease incidences not on water saving in india limited information is available for planting methods on other crops for example paired row for cotton aujla et al 2005 planting of oilseed rape on ridges and beds receiving irrigation through each or alternate furrows buttar et al 2006 sowing of soybean soybean maize or soybean pigeon pea intercropping on broad bed and furrows in vertisols mandal et al 2013 but no attempts have been made so far for groundnut with the aim to increase yield and wue improved method of planting and water saving technique would be required for eastern indian hot and sub humid condition further it is essential that pod yield and evapotranspiration et production functions are developed to reveal the dynamic relations on pod yield et requirement and wue crop yield response factors ky are important criteria and indices which reveal complex relationships between water use and crop production the estimation of these ky values would be required for this crop to evolve irrigation strategy especially for the growing condition under hot and sub humid climate earlier crop coefficient of groundnut and yield response factors reddy and reddy 1993 kheira 2009 and response function with imposed water stress jain et al 1997 have been developed with the aim of irrigation scheduling therefore attempts were made i to study the influence of irrigation regimes and improved planting methods on pod yield et wue and n uptake by groundnut ii to find out the basis of yield variation using crop growth and physiological parameters viz root dry weight interception of photosynthetically active radiation chlorophyll fluorescence and leaf photosynthesis iii to study the changes in soil temperature and soil organic carbon stock and iv to develop pod yield et production functions to reveal the dynamic relationships of yield et and wue of groundnut under tropical sub humid condition 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of experimental site field

sub humid weather data and information were recorded from the weather station which is situated at 1 24 km away from the experiment site average annual rainfall is about 1490 mm out of this about 81 occur during monsoon season i e june to september when rice is the predominant crop whereas post rainy season period i e winter and summer months receive either no or very little rainfall the season for growing summer groundnut was from the month of january to may rainfall was 49 1 mm in 2008 and 22 4 mm in 2010 and no rainfall was received in 2009 during the crop growing period i e mid january

occurrence of terminal heat stress in the region during the period which coincides with summer groundnut growing season however year wise variation was minimum in three years of experimentation the textural class of the experimental soil was sandy clay loam with 65 sand 14 silt and 21 clay relative sand fractions declined with the increase in soil depth and clay contents increased in 60 90 cm

sommers 1996 soil moisture regime was typic ustic and temperature regime hyperthermic 2 2 treatments experimental design and crop management field experiments were conducted over three consecutive years 2008 2010 the experiment was laid out in a split plot design with three replications treatments consisted of four irrigation regimes in the main plots one i1 in flowering stage two i2 in flowering and pod development three i3 in vegetative flowering and pod development and four i4 in vegetative flowering pod initiation and pod development and three planting methods in sub plots as flat bed sfb ridge and furrow srf and paired row method spr irrigations were scheduled in critical growth stages physiological and phenological aspects were duly considered as there was no or little rainfall and no substantial capillary rise of water it was decided scheduling irrigation during physiologically important stages for planting methods in sfb spacing was 30 cm row to row and 10 cm plant to plant in srf planting on ridges separated by furrows with same spacing as in sfb and in spr method distance between two rows paired row on the narrow bed was 15 cm and plant to plant 15 cm fig 1 spacing in different methods was designed in such a way that each treatment had uniform density of 30 33 plants per m2 irrigation was applied by flood method in sfb and furrow irrigation in srf single rows on ridge separated by furrows and spr paired row on narrow beds separated by furrows land preparation manure and fertilizer application planting etc were done as per the standard management practices for this crop organic manure i e farmyard manure was applied at 4 5 tonnes per ha and incorporated before final ploughing and preparing the land by a tractor drawn plough the rate of fertilizer n p2o5 and k2o was 20 40 and 40 kg ha 1 respectively sources were urea diammonium phosphate and muriate of potash one pre sowing irrigation of 65 mm was applied before land preparation for proper germination of seeds and uniform establishment of the crop seeds of groundnut var tag 24 was sown on 10 15 january every year as per the treatments ridge and furrow srf and narrow bed was made in spr plots other crop management practices were taken up as recommended for this crop viz weeding hoeing before onset of flowering measures against infestation by plant diseases and or insect pests during the entire crop period the crop was harvested manually from 2 to 6 may every year pod yield was calculated from net plot area 3 5 m x 4 m and reported at 15 moisture the duration of the crop was 110 114 days 2 3 measurement methods and calculation procedures 2 3 1 root dry weight chlorophyll fluorescence and leaf photosynthesis three plants having average growth were selected from each plot for root sampling root samples were collected through the monolith method with each sampler centered over the plant heeraman and juma 1993 serraj et al 2004 samples were washed carefully in a bucket of water separating all roots by straining roots were dried in an oven at 70 c for 72 h till the constant weight was obtained then root dry weight was recorded three fully matured leaves from the same plant were used to measure chlorophyll fluorescence with a fluorescence monitoring system model fms 2 hansatech instruments ltd norfolk u k the parameters measured were dark adapted maximum photochemical efficiency fv fm and quantum yield of ps ii Ñ„ps ii at flowering and pod development stages of the crop from each plot prior to each set of fv fm measurement leaves were dark adapted for a period of 30 min using leaf clips souza et al 2004 the same leaves were also used to measure rate of leaf photosynthesis using a portable photosynthesis system model ciras 2 pp systems u k these measurements were done and recorded during flowering and pod development stages on clear sunny days solar radiation 1200 Î¼mol m2 s 1 between 10 30 and 11 00 h 2 3 2 photosynthetically active radiation photosynthetically active radiation was measured by a portable line quantum sensor model ems 7 sw ws burrage uk measurements were made in five places from each plot on different julian days coinciding with critical stages of crop growth incident i0 and transmitted i1 radiation was recorded at about 11 00 12 30 h 1 h on sunny days gallo and daughtry 1986 kiniry et al 2005 i0 was measured at the top of the canopy and i1 at the below by placing the sensor across crop rows the fraction of intercepted par i e fipar was calculated as 1 fipar i0 i1 i0 2 3 3 soil parameters and soil temperature soil particles i e sand silt and clay fractions were determined using the hydrometer method and soil texture was determined using the usda classification system the ph and ec was measured by the digital meters soil bulk density by core sampling method field capacity of soil and wilting point using a pressure plate apparatus eijkelkamp agrisearch equipment the netherlands soil temperature was measured by manual thermometers aic agro instruments pvt ltd kolkata india thermometers were made of mercury in glass in a rigid brass stem with pointed end for smooth entry into soil having fuse bulbs for quick response to temperature changes measurements were carried out up to 30 cm soil depth during the day time between 8 00 and 17 00 h with 30 min intervals soil organic carbon content was determined by walkley black method nelson and sommers 1982 the soc stock mg ha 1 was then calculated by using soc content g g 1 bulk density mg m 3 and thickness of soil layer m as the following 2 soc stock soc content bd soil depth nitrogen content in kernel and haulm was analyzed by kjeldahl method horneck and miller 1998 and n uptake was calculated using biomass and n concentration 2 3 4 irrigation water soil moisture and estimation of evapotranspiration irrigation was measured by rbc flume eijkelkamp model 13 17 02 in each event of application recorded sill heights mm were used to determine flow rate soil moisture was determined by thermo gravimetric method before sowing about 15 days interval during crop growing period and after harvesting evapotranspiration et was calculated using the water balance method as was used earlier also mandal et al 2006 3 et p i cp dp rf Î´s where p rainfall mm i irrigation mm cp capillary contribution dp deep percolation rf surface runoff and Î´s the change in soil moisture storage mm in the profile 0 90 cm calculated from soil moisture data on the date of sowing and at harvest cp was assumed to be negligible as the groundwater depth was low 4 m as there was no change in moisture storage beyond 90 cm depth dp was also considered negligible irrigation in each event was not sufficient to saturate entire profile and to cause deep percolation no runoff occurred because little or no rainfall was received during the cropping period thus et mm was calculated using p i and Î´s crop water use efficiency wue was computed as pod yield y divided by et y in kg ha 1 hence expressed as kg ha 1 mm 1 and irrigation water use efficiency iwue was computed as pod yield y divided by cumulative irrigation water mm 2 3 5 pod yield evapotranspiration relationship pod yield and evapotranspiration relationships were developed the dataset of pod yield and cumulative et obtained from three years experiment were used for developing these relationships regression technique was used separately for three planting methods it was linear function of the form y a b et where a is the intercept b the slope or the coefficient y et is the wue y et is the slope b or the marginal water use efficiency wuem and y y et et i e the rate of change of pod yield with respect to the rate of change of et is the elasticity of water production ewp the expressions haxem and heady 1978 liu et al 2002 are 4 w u e m b 5 e w p b e t a b e t when et is maximum etm ym being the maximum yield the crop yield response

design gomez and gomez 1984 significance testing was carried out by f test at 5 probability level p 0 05 for all parameters then mean differences were compared with computed least significant difference lsd duncan s range test was used for ranking of both main plot treatments sub plot treatments and interactions means at p 0 05 regression models of pod yield and evapotranspiration relationships were developed using data analysis software of ms excel coefficients of determination r2 were computed and tested statistically 3 results and discussion 3 1 root dry weight root dry weight rdw increased with the increase in crop growth over the period of study i e 30 90 days after planting dap variation was recorded in different irrigation regimes and planting methods in both the seasons fig 2 though the differences were similar initially at 30 dap rdw varied significantly p 0 05 afterwards with imposition of irrigation treatments the interaction between irrigation regime and planting method was not significant on rdw maximum rdw was attained with 1 40 1 43 1 58 and 1 73 g plant 1 in i1 i2 i3 and i4 respectively up to 60 dap i3 and i4 had similar water regime hence there was no difference in rdw and then i4 showed significantly p 0 05 higher values than i3 further between i1 and i2 the difference was not significant throughout crop growth planting methods showed considerable differences also maximum rdw was 1 48 1 55 and 1 58 g plant 1 in sfb srf and spr respectively in the 2008 growing season 2008 among planting methods though srf and spr showed no significant differences they were significantly higher than sfb at p 0 05 this trend was similar in the 2009 growing season hence results were consistent our results indicated that root growth was favored by the optimum irrigation regime as in i3 and i4 in general large root system supports crop to mine water from soil puangbut et al 2009 we have found that soil drying and drought condition hindered root growth as a result of reductions in water supply in i1 and i2 however i1 had similar rdw to i2 where water stress was more in the former than the latter it implied that crop adaptation was more with root growth up to certain extent of decrease in soil moisture similar results were also reported songsri et al 2009 where drought reduced rdw of groundnut hence reduced root dry weight might have affected pod yield in lower irrigation regimes and in flat bed planting koolachart et al 2013 also found adverse impact of soil surface desiccation on root growth and pod yield 3 2 photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by groundnut crop canopy irrigation regimes and planting methods influenced the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fipar intercepted by groundnut crop canopy fig 3 it was measured in two crop growing seasons jan may 2008 and 2009 out of three years of field experiment the fipar was at the minimum at initial stage of the crop and no significant difference was observed among treatments afterwards significant differences were noted till the last observation on julian day jd 116 or jd 113 the maximum fipar was 60 in i1 64 in i2 68 in i3 and 71 in i4 and 61 in sfb 71 in srf and 74 in spr in first crop growing season in 2008 the maximum interception occurred during 60 75 days after sowing i e at jd 76 90 this growing period coincided with maximum foliage cover by the crop canopy with regard to treatments fipar was higher in i3 and i4 compared with i1 and i2 underlying reason was that the adequate irrigation at i3 as well as i4 favored better crop growth and canopy expansion which intercepted more par than the canopy which was grown with inadequate irrigation i1 and i2 haro et al 2008 also found variation in light capture by groundnut canopy with the direct effect of water stress water stress affected crop growth hence reduced intercepted par the fipar differed significantly among planting methods at p 0 05 it was the highest in spr which was statistically similar with sfb range of calculated fipar was 36 61 41 71 and 45 74 in sfb srf and spr respectively in the first season jan may 2008 41 64 42 70 and 45 72 in corresponding treatments in the second season jan may 2009 the paired row or the ridge and furrow technique facilitated better crop growing environment than the flat method tubbs et al 2011 also demonstrated that paired rows had outperformed single rows in the plant stands and canopy expansion in paired row cropping groundnut might have intercepted more of the incoming radiation by horizontal leaf distribution due to higher extinction coefficient kiniry et al 2005 awal et al 2006 moreover there was close link of incident par with the canopy cover and development due to irrigation and planting methods in groundnut 3 3 chlorophyll fluorescence fv fm Ñ„ps ii and rate of leaf photosynthesis pn chlorophyll fluorescence fv fm Ñ„ps ii and the rate of leaf photosynthesis differed significantly with irrigation regimes and planting methods at p 0 05 the maximum fv fm Ñ„ps ii and pn was obtained in i4 indicating better physiological functioning of plants with adequate water supply through four irrigation table 1 however with the reduction in water supply as in i1 and i2 ability of plants might have reduced to metabolize only normally moreover imbalance might have occurred between the absorption of light energy by chlorophyll and the use of energy in photosynthesis maxwell and johnson 2000 murchie and lawson 2013 a strong and positive relationship was also reported between chlorophyll and photosynthetically active light transmittance characteristics of leaves richardson et al 2002 and water use by plants sheshshayee et al 2006 higher values of fv fm Ñ„ps ii and pn were obtained in spr compared with sfb and srf however fv fm was statistically similar in srf and spr in pod development stage and pn was similar in these two treatments both in flowering and pod development stage better plant growth in spr and srf might have managed not to cause photoinhibition long et al 1994 or sustained quenching demmig adams and adams 2006 compared to flat bed method sfb consequently there was marginally higher fv fm Ñ„ps ii and rate of photosynthesis in plant leaves in plots with srf and spr than those in sfb 3 4 effect of irrigation on soil temperature mean values showed that the temperature was higher in dry as compared to irrigated plots i4 because of less soil moisture in dry condition i1 fig 4 the temperature in the surface soil increased at faster rate than those in other depths maximum soil temperature was recorded as 43 6 c in 0 5 cm soil at around 11 30 h on the day under dry condition whereas in irrigated i4 plots we observed gradual increase in soil temperature and the maximum was 35 8 c around 11 30 h to 13 30 h then there was decrease in temperature after 13 30 h onwards in the soil just beneath the surface maximum temperature was recorded as 37 8 c in dry and 33 6 c in irrigated conditions temperature variations in lower soil depths i e 10 20 cm 20 30 cm were lesser than surface soil fig 4 regulation of thermal environment was primarily due to better soil moisture regime upon imposed irrigation ramakrishna et al 2006 because of high heat capacity of water different irrigation regimes would likely lead to different soil temperature conditions as was evident in our study elevated soil temperature in the pod zone might have detrimental effect to the crop davidson et al 1991 sorensen and wright 2002 golombek and johansen 1997 reported that the greatest number of pods was formed at mean soil temperatures between 23 and 29 c and 17 and 35 c were sub and supra optimal respectively this variation in soil temperature caused differential thermal environment in plots receiving different irrigation regimes this would form the basis for interpretation of yield differences due to irrigation treatments in present investigation 3 5 effect of irrigation and planting methods on pod haulm yield across years pod haulm yield increased with increase in irrigation regimes highest pod yield was obtained in i4 1979 kg ha 1 and the lowest in i1 1335 kg ha 1 the increase in pod yield was 20 37 and 48 in i2 i3 and i4 respectively over i1 positive response of the crop was obtained to the applied irrigation as there was no rainfall in 2009 and only 27 9 and 21 5 mm in 2008 and 2010 growing seasons respectively hence maximum pod yield was observed with highest irrigation regime similarly highest pod yield was recorded in spr which was 17 higher than sfb with regard to planting treatments it was 13 higher in srf than sfb the interaction effect between irrigation regimes and planting methods was found significant table 2 across all combination of irrigation regimes and planting methods pod yield ranged from 1194 to 2056 kg ha 1 being the highest in i4 x spr and the lowest in i1 x sfb of course srf and spr showed similar as well as the highest when in combination with i4 the next best combination was i3 x spr where pod yield was only 3 8 less than that in i4 x spr but with reduction in amount of applied water by 28 4 and 43 1 compared with i4 x spr and i4 x srf respectively this results show that paired row or ridge and furrow planting with furrow irrigation has led to 13 17 higher pod yield compared to the flat bed method paired row planting saved irrigation water by 41 7 compared to flat bed method although interaction was not significant haulm yields varied significantly p 0 05 due to irrigation regimes and planting methods table 3 haulm yield increased in i2 26 i3 39 and i4 45 over i1 and 18 and 23 in srf and spr over sfb number of pods per plant increased to the highest in i4 which was statistically at par with i3 similarly it was significantly p 0 05 higher in spr than other planting methods table 3 the yield increase both pod and haulm in paired row method with furrow irrigation might be attributed to greater interception of par maximum fluorescence efficiency fv fm and Ñ„ps ii and net leaf photosynthesis as presented and discussed earlier higher irrigation regimes ensured adequate soil moisture in the pod elongation zone which was actually critical for peg penetration and formation of pods reddy et al 2003 there was a good relation between pod yield and water use by groundnut craufurd et al 2006 water stress in i1 and also in i2 i e with inadequate water supply affected crop growth and yield yield reduction due to soil water deficit has been reported earlier lamb et al 2004 haro et al 2008 songsri et al 2009 shinde et al 2010 ratnakumar et al 2009 also found that water uptake was critical for pod yield in flat beds successive cohorts of pegs might have exposed to desiccated soil surface conditions and evaporative demand which might have impacted adversely on final pod set the reasons for better yield in paired row technique might be credited to plant stands shortened time to full ground cover and improved light interception sorensen et al 2007 tubbs et al 2011 previous researchers also reported yield advantages in paired rows than single row of groundnut culbreath et al 2008 lanier et al 2004 nuti et al 2008 sorensen et al 2004 3 6 irrigation water evapotranspiration et and water use efficiency wue the irrigation volume in terms of depth increased significantly with the increase in irrigation regimes at p 0 05 cumulative volume was 60 6 114 9 159 1 and 225 8 mm in i1 i2 i3 and i4 respectively it increased due to increase in number of total irrigation water applied in different treatments conversely irrigation water decreased in srf 133 0 mm and spr 105 8 mm over sfb 181 5 mm results clearly indicated that there was a significant reduction in irrigation water by 26 7 in srf and 41 7 in spr when compared to sfb the interaction between irrigation and planting methods was also significant largest depth 291 4 mm was obtained in i4 x sfb combination table 2 the trend showed that the depth was more in every combination of irrigation level with sfb and decreased comparatively in combinations with srf and the smallest in spr evapotranspiration increased with higher irrigation regimes due to more water supplies the trend of interaction between irrigation and planting methods showed similar pattern as in depth of irrigation across irrigation regimes estimated et decreased by 13 in srf 288 3 mm and 21 in spr 263 2 mm over sfb 331 2 mm both the calculated parameters i e crop wue and irrigation wue decreased with the increase in irrigation regimes tables 2 and 3 ridge and furrow paired row technique saved substantial amount of irrigation water due to having furrow irrigation and consequently increased both crop wue and iwue while maintaining similar or more pod yield highest wue of 7 03 kg ha 1 mm 1 was obtained in spr which was 48 higher than the value obtained at sfb similarly iwue was about 105 higher in spr than sfb in srf also wue and iwue was 33 and 62 higher than sfb in previous studies with flat bed method reported et ranged from 356 to 434 mm for summer groundnut in eastern india bandyopadhyay et al 2005 consumptive water use of 795 8 mm with wue of 4 76 kg ha 1 mm 1 in gujarat western india patel et al 2008 our results indicated higher wue than the earlier reports thus our findings demonstrated that substantial increase of wue could be possible by paired row method of planting 3 7 pod yield crop evapotranspiration relationship regression based water production functions have been developed three year pod yield y and cumulative et x data were used for developing y et relationship for groundnut under three planting treatments fig 5 all functions were best fitted in a linear pattern with quite high and significant coefficient of determination r2 at p 0 05 the intercepts varied among planting treatments it was the highest with spr and the lowest in sfb the slope or the coefficients were found positive those increased gradually from sfb through spr kheira 2009 also found linear relationship between groundnut yields and seasonal cumulative et these models would help interpret pod yield et and wue of groundnut crop by marginal analysis of water production functions as the functions were found linear the changing trend of wue with et was directly affected by the intercept as the intercepts were much higher than zero wue decreased with increasing et in every planting method from these relationships it can be quantified that the crop will achieve maximum pod yield of 1902 2112 and 2109 kg ha 1 if the et requirement etm of 467 402 and 359 mm is met under sfb srf and spr treatments respectively wuem were the same as the slopes i e 2 79 3 14 and 3 41 in corresponding planting methods table 4 it implied that the change in pod yield with respect to change in cumulative et remained constant in any of the three planting methods it gave a warranty that obtained pod yields would match planting methods the ratio of relative yield decrease to relative evapotranspiration deficit was the crop yield response factor ky the ewp values were found very close to ky it indicated that cumulative crop et was near to etm the ky values obtained in our study were very close to the value of 0 70 as was standardized and published in the milestone publication of fao irrigation and drainage paper no 33 by doorenbos and kassam 1979 for every planting method ky was less than 1 which means groundnut crop was tolerant to water deficit and recovered partially from water stress according to yield response factor guidelines moreover the crop exhibited less than proportional reductions in pod yield with reduced irrigation steduto et al 2012 our results are in conformity with findings of reddy and reddy 1993 who reported that for relative seasonal et of 0 76 to 0 84 groundnut yield varied from 0 74 to 0 86 whereas by using soil water balance equation to estimate crop et kheira 2009 reported an average ky of 2 9 for groundnut which was higher than the 0 7 being maximum seasonal et 488 mm in his experiment with full irrigation treatment the ewp value is analytic to characteristic changes of yield and wue with varying et this parameter indicates the scope of any possible improvement on the pod yield or wue due to imposed treatment as per the criterion yield will increase with increasing et if ewp 0 conversely yield will decrease if ewp 0 if ewp is equal to 1 both yield and wue will reach to the maximum level in this study the ewp values were greater than zero and less than 1 in every planting methods it reveals that still there is a scope to increase pod yield of groundnut and it s wue the scope was found greater with paired row planting method where ewp was 0 76 compared with flat bed ewp 0 87 and ridge and furrow method ewp 0 86 the later values were more close to one this study is similar to and in agreement with our previous findings on water yield relationship of wheat for central indian condition mandal et al 2005 therefore marginal analysis and ky which are based on y et relationships would imply strategic irrigation to meet the et requirement to increase pod yield and wue of this crop more so under limited water availability in a hot and sub humid condition earlier jain et al 1997 also developed water stress response function for groundnut and suggested for use of the same for water saving 3 8 soil organic carbon stock kernel haulm nitrogen uptake soil organic carbon stock in 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil depth did not vary significantly p 0 05 due to imposition of irrigation and planting treatments table 5 whereas uptake of nitrogen n varied significantly p 0 05 however it reveals that the soc stock was more in upper soil layer 0 15 cm than the lower 15 30 cm with regard to total soc stock it ranged from 20 53 to 21 04 in irrigation treatments and 20 89 to 21 86 mg ha 1 in planting methods in our earlier studies similar results on soc stock were reported for rice groundnut cropping from the same location mandal et al 2012 it has indicated that the soil environment in terms of maintenance of soil organic carbon status has not been deteriorated due to groundnut cropping over three years nitrogen content in kernels and above ground biomass i e haulms of groundnut did not vary significantly p 0 05 due to different irrigation and planting treatments kernel n content ranged from 2 79 to 3 51 and haulm n from 1 71 to 2 52 however n uptake by kernel and haulms varied significantly at p 0 05 table 5 the kernel n uptake was significantly the highest in i4 whereas haulm n uptake was the highest and similar in i3 and i4 with regard to planting treatments both kernel n and haulm n was significantly the highest in spr at p 0 05 the underlying reason for variation was the kernel and haulm yield level as the yield was higher in four irrigation and in paired row method even with similar n content n uptake was higher accordingly our results and reasons are in conformity with an earlier report rami reddy et al 1982 that a combination of higher irrigation regime and soil n application had higher uptake due to optimum available moisture and nitrogen to groundnut crop 4 conclusions in this field study the effect of improved planting methods of groundnut viz ridge and furrow at 30 x 10 cm spacing and paired row at 45 x 15 cm spacing was evaluated and compared with traditional flat bed method with 30 x 10 cm spacing at different irrigation regimes improved methods were furrow irrigated there was no such technique available to the growers earlier for increasing yield saving of irrigation water and increasing wue of groundnut our results clearly demonstrated that the improved methods viz ridge and furrow and paired row would increase yield by 13 and 17 and irrigation water saving by 27 and 42 respectively when compared with flat bed method we achieved enhanced wue in improved planting methods the variation in yield of this crops has been explained in terms of changes in root dry weight intercepted par chlorophyll fluorescence efficiency leaf photosynthesis as well as mitigation of high day time soil temperature through irrigation thus our research findings would help growers to adopt improved planting method and saving of irrigation water the marginal analyses on the developed y et regression relationships have revealed the dynamic relationship of y et and wue for this crop the computed parameters viz wuem ewp and ky would help in making interpretation of yield variation in different water regimes we have obtained ky values those are less than one which implied that groundnut crop showed signs of reduction in pod yield with lower irrigation regimes the ewp values are greater than zero and less than one which reveals that there exists further scope of increasing pod yield and wue of the crop the results of our study would help in predicting yield of groundnut with respect to availability of water the yield and wue of the crop with respect to different irrigation regimes could be used as guidelines for irrigation formulation of strategies the functional relationships would help substantially for management decisions on irrigation application it has also indicated what would be the achievable pod yield with respect to the maximum et the improved method has been demonstrated to a large number of farmers through lecture video film etc moreover farmers in the canal irrigated areas would get benefit out of this improved planting method there is a huge scope of up scaling of this technology for increasing yield and wue of this crop the study could be an important reference for water saving of groundnut production in a hot sub humid climate acknowledgments authors duly acknowledge the help rendered by dr h chakraborty scientist deceased in

11236,the number of cattle in turkey increased from 10 5 to 14 0 million and similar increases were observed in sheep and goat population since 2001 to date tuiÌ‡k 2016 therefore increasing the need for the forage crops such as vetch which can easily be fitted to a double cropping farming in 2016 turkey produced about 4 5 million ton of vetch as animal feed which ranked third in the world tuik 2016 therefore is an important animal feed in the country herewith a study was conducted to determine the effect of varying supplemental irrigation rates on vetch vicia villosa l cv selcuk 98 plant vegetative and generative characteristics under semi arid climatic condition of harran plain sanlÄ±urfa turkey a drip irrigation system with 4 l h 1 was utilized for irrigation treatments included 0 25 50 75 125 of full irrigation 100 of which was scheduled based on soil moisture measurements full irrigated treatment received 294 and 263 mm in 2008 and 2009 respectively in general with elevated irrigation amounts vetch plants vegetative and generative characteristics resulted in statistical difference irrigation increased both number of branches and pod per plant values however 1000 seed weight values were not statistical affected showing the fact that plants vegetative growth did not lead to more rather less but similar size seeds on the other hand both seed yield and above soil biomass values were significantly p 0 05 increased with elevated irrigation amounts but analysis of data indicated no advantage of excessive irrigation keywords vetch supplemental irrigation semi arid climatic conditions 1 introduction in 1995 the harran plain was opened to irrigation as a part of social agricultural integrated project southeastern anatolian project sap which covers about 1 8 million hectare of cultivated area the main irrigation practice is inefficient surface irrigation even though industrial crops such as cotton and corn are projected to be the main crops in the plain there is a need for diverse crop pattern to ensure a sustainable farming in addition to increased need for feed forage production because of increasing population and constantly increasing consumption rate of animal products in last two decades tuiÌ‡k 2016 projected cotton farming percentage has already overpassed due mainly to elevated cotton prices resulting in both higher irrigation water use and limiting cultivation of other crops which causes farmers at the lower side of the plain suffer from drought one of the key limiting causes of lower vetch forage is water stress occurring both in fall and late spring when plant growth is faster in most of the world water scarcity is major reason for lowering agricultural production with slowing crop physiological developments gong et al 2005 sinaki et al 2007 sankar et al 2008 even though most of the field crops are more sensitive to water stress during flowering and seed filling stages richards and thurling 1978 el hafid et al 1998 costa and shanmugathasan 2002 karam et al 2005 it is important to determine the sensitive stages of feed crops such as vetch for not only seed but also biomass production researchers indicated that depending of the environmental conditions supplemental irrigation is needed to insure optimum cop production taylor et al 1991 kar et al 2007 abuelos et al 2002 claimed that most of irrigation studies are planed with fertilizer treatments cheema et al 2001 svecnjak and rengel 2006 and hence there is need for only irrigation studies ozel et al 2016 conducted a study under sub humid climatic condition where annual rain fall is slightly over 600 mm and most of which is received in fall and spring mouths the study included different levels of irrigation 100 75 50 and 25 of field capacity to evaluated the effect on above and below soil surface biomass production of vetch they concluded that irrigations statistically increased plant height above soil biomass and under soil biomass of vetch researchers also concluded that under given conditions bringing the soil moisture to 75 was the better choice for vetch production similar drought stress effect on plant height and biomass results were also reported by sadeghipour 2009 who conducted a study under north west of iran climatic conditions in order to achieve higher crop water use efficiency values accurate irrigation scheduling is required therefore local crop coefficients needs to be determined kipkorir et al 2002 kar et al 2007 the potential effect of water stress on vetch physiological and generative features is rare in existing literature and requires to be further assessed under different local climatic conditions hence the goal of the study was to determine the effect drought stress on vetch biomass yield and yield components with resulting irrigation water use efficiency under semi arid climatic conditions 2 materials and methods the current study was conducted at agricultural engineering research field 37 08 n 38 46 e with altitude of 465 m of harran university sanliurfa turkey weather at the study area is characterized as semi arid with low precipitation in the spring crop material used in the current study was selcuk 98 l vetch cultivar since this cultivar was previously tested to be the better choice for the current environmental conditions and one of the most common varieties in the study region vetch crop active root depth was assumed as 60 cm and irrigation water amounts were calculated accordingly irrigation water was classified as c2s1 ussl 1954 with a ph 7 ec 0 31 and sar 0 25 field capacity of the study area was about 32 along with 22 of wilting point therefore soil available water for 60 cm of soil depth was calculated to be 77 3 mm table 1 average temperatures during vetch growth period for first and second seasons were 14 6 and 14 1 c with relative humidity of 52 1 and 54 5 respectively received precipitation amounts for the same seasons were 187 and 266 mm most of the rain accrued during december and january table 2 for the seed bed preparation cultivations were completed before vetch seed sawing 6 0 1 8 m2 trial plots consisted 6 rows with 1 3 cm on row and 30 cm between row spacing ending about 250 seed per m 2 vetch seeds were hand sown on 23 11 2007 and 14 11 2008 and received 20 kg ha 1 of nitrogen and phosphorus on 15 02 2008 and 10 02 2009 only one application of herbicide was performed for narrow leave weeds since both biomass and seed yield was evaluated hand harvesting was carried out on 23 05 2008 and 28 05 2009 in the first and the second study years when seed were ripened side rows were considered as side effected and therefore only middle four rows were considered for vegetative and generative evaluations the irrigation treatments of the current study included 0 i0 dry land conditions 25 i25 50 i50 75 i75 100 i100 full irrigation and 125 i125 percent application of available soil moisture of full irrigated treatment with a drip irrigation system the purpose of using 125 irrigation trial was to determine the optimum level of water application plant vegetative and generative characteristics irrigations were scheduled based on soil moisture deficit of full irrigated treatment plots which was gravimetrically determined twice a week when the soil moisture dropped 50 5 of available water irrigations were initiated drip irrigation system used in this study included a drip irrigation lateral of 4 l h 1 emitter flow rate with 20 cm emitter spacing to each row of vetch plants 25 mm irrigation water was applied to all irrigation treatment plots in both of the years right after sawing in order to ensure a good germination and plant stand in both of the study years total of 4 irrigations were performed starting from april to plant harvest crop water use during the irrigation period was calculated with the method outlined by doorenbos and pruitt 1992 et i p dr rf Î´s where et is evapotranspiration i is irrigation water p is effective rainfall plus capillary rise dr is drainage rf is runoff and Î´s is change in the soil moisture content all in mm unit since the system used to deliver irrigation water to crop active root depth was a drip irrigation system there assumed to be no excess water therefore no runoff in both of the years for the i100 trial therefore rf and dr were assumed zero reducing the equation to et i p Î´s plant height cm 1000 kernel weight gr number of branch per plant number of pod per plant yield kg ha 1 and biomass kg ha 1 were determined and subsequent irrigation water use efficiencies iwue kg ha 1 mm 1 were calculated the irrigation water use efficiency iwue kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated with the following equation iwue bmt bm0 i where bmt is biomass value from each of irrigation treatments kg ha 1 bm0 is biomass value from non irrigated treatment kg ha 1 i is seasonal applied irrigation water amount to each of the trials mm the current field experiment was arranged based on complete randomized design with 3 replications differences among irrigation treatments were tested utilizing anova and regression analysis methods results of both statistical tests were considered significant at p 0 05 level irrigation amounts were regressed against each of the measured parameters and curve regression was considered using spss 2002 statistical program coefficient of determination r2 and significance p were considered for the regression validation 3 results in both of the crop growing seasons 25 mm of irrigation water was applied to all irrigation trials to insure a good plant stand total of 294 and 263 mm irrigation water iw with 4 irrigation practices were performed in both of the study years respectively seasonal vetch crop water use etc including soil water deficit Î´s in addition to applied irrigation water iw of full irrigation treatments were calculated to be 386 mm and 395 mm in 2008 and 2009 crop growing seasons respectively in the current study total applied irrigation amount in 2008 was a little higher than 2009 season due to slightly severe climatic conditions average of 7 months temperature in first and second seasons turned out to be 12 4 and 11 9 c table 2 plants reached to maturity about 7 days earlier in the first year of the study however in second year of the study vetch plants flowering were about 10 days earlier as compared to first year in general harvest date of the plants from stressed trials i0 25 50 were 5 7 days earlier as compared to full irrigated treatment i100 in both of the study years vetch plant heights varied from 22 7 cm i0 to 48 0 cm i125 in 2008 and from 24 7 cm to i0 and 49 3 i125 in 2009 ozel et al 2016 reported higher plant heights about 100 cm under mediterranean climatic conditions which was probably because of extended crop growing period with milder temperatures resulting taller plants on the other hand similar to the current study result some researcher reported that water stress significantly lowered plant height gallorda et al 2004 liu and stÃ¼tzel 2004 ozel et al 2016 statistical analysis of the data indicated no significant p 0 05 difference between years but irrigation treatments p 0 05 in general there seemed to be no significantly p 0 05 different effect between low irrigation treatments i0 25 50 nevertheless there was significant differences among other treatments at p 0 05 level at large it certainly could be concluded that as irrigation amount increased plant height corresponded well and improved table 3 regression analysis of plant heights indicated a polynomial relationship between irrigation and plant height with ph2008 8e 05x2 0 1081x 20 468 and r2 0 998 for the 2008 and ph2009 0 0002x2 0 0004x 29 093 and r2 0 800 for the 2009 and both of the equations were significant at p 0 05 level fig 1 in average for every 1 cm differences in plant height about 10 mm of irrigation water was required table 1 under similar climatic conditions vetch producers may consider plant height as an indicator of biomass and therefore target a certain amount in advance with the amount of irrigation water they have access to or make their plans based on availability of irrigation water amount the irrigation treatments effect on kernel weight ranged from 53 5 to 59 1 g in 2008 and from 59 7 to 62 0 g in 2009 cropping seasons statistical analysis of the data indicated no difference between years except i0 and i50 irrigation treatments however there was no significant difference p 0 05 among treatments within both of the study years indicating that irrigation was not a factor determining kernel weights table 3 the relationship between irrigation treatments and kernel weights in first and second seasons turned out to be kw2009 4e 05x2 0 0215x 58 92 r2 0 896 and kw2008 4e 06x2 0 0193x 53 769 r2 0 925 respectively fig 2 and both of the equations were statistically representing the kernel weights therefore could be used to for simulation purposes it seems that when irrigation amounts were reduced plant tends to lower the number of kernels but not considerable change in kernel weighs even tough graphical analysis of the data indicated slight change with increased amount of irrigations fig 2 number of branches per plant varied from 3 7 to 5 3 in both of the study years and there was no significant change among three low irrigation treatments i0 25 50 and high irrigation i75 100 125 treatments on the other hand high irrigation treatments i75 100 125 significantly p 0 05 produced more number of branch per plant than low irrigation treatments i75 100 125 in both of the years table 3 the highest number of branch in both of the years was obtained from i125 trial indicating that with increase irrigation vetch plants kept producing more branches regression analysis of the data indicated a polynomial relationship between irrigation amounts and number plant branch and equations in 2008 and 2009 turned out to be were nb2008 1e 05x2 0 0097x 3 4612 r2 0 986 and nb2009 3e 05x2 0 0173x 3 15 r2 0 939 respectively fig 3 number of branch per plant data indicated more number of branches from irrigated trials since this crop is indeterminate number of pods per plant in the first year of the study was higher than in second year ranging from 10 3 to 16 3 in 2008 and 6 3 to 13 3 in 2009 statistical analysis of the first year indicated no significant difference among first three low irrigation treatments and similarly among last three high irrigation treatments however in the second year of the study the non irrigated treatment i0 produced the lowest number of pods 6 3 as compared to other treatments other three fallowing irrigation treatments i25 50 75 produced lesser number of pods then two high irrigation treatments i100 125 at p 0 05 level regression analysis indicated polynomial relationships in 2008 and 2009 as np2008 2e 05x2 0 0268x 9 4288 r2 0 970 and np2009 8e 05x2 0 0049x 8 1531 r2 0 75 both of the equations statistically p 0 05 could be used to determine the number of pods per plant for a given condition using irrigation amounts similar to number of branches pod numbers also increased with elevated irrigation and therefore resulting in higher both seed yield and biomass as compared to stressed plants fig 4 seed yield in 2008 varied from 1154 i0 to 2112 kg ha 1 i100 whereas in 2009 yields from the same irrigation treatments ranged from 1090 to 2747 kg ha 1 statistical analysis results of seed yield were quite similar to number of pods per plant and analysis of the data indicated no significant difference between years however significant difference p 0 05 between low irrigated i0 25 50 and high irrigated i75 100 125 treatments was determined table 3 data indicated that increased irrigation amounts elevated yield up to full irrigation and then tendsinclined to decrease with over irrigation as expected this was even more obvious in 2009 fig 5 regression analysis in both of the current study years also indicated a strong significant relationship as yield2008 0 0055x2 5 3119x 1028 8 r2 0 99 and yield2009 0 0464x2 19 593x 737 18 r2 0 97 in 2008 and 2009 respectively regression analysis of the data indicates that equations could be used p 0 05 to determine vetch seed yield with applied irrigation amounts the reason for similarity between seed yield and pod numbers could be attributed to the fact that seeds are obtained from pods therefore could easily be used as an indicator for the seed yield as it is true for other cops vetch plant also were affected by irrigation above ground vetch biomass values from 2008 and 2009 seasons ranged from 4929 i0 to 6740 kg ha 1 i100 and from 2979 i0 to 6826 kg ha 1 i100 respectively in general the lowest biomass values in both of the years were obtained from i0 trials and this was expected however the highest biomass was from full irrigated treatment i100 it seems that higher branch and pod values from over irrigated treatment i125 did not resulted in higher biomass similar to seed yield results analysis of the data indicated significant p 0 05 difference among treatments ozel et al 2016 reported similar results and indicated that irrigation improved biomass 9 fold as compared to non irrigated treatments regression analysis showed significant p 0 05 relationships between biomass and irrigation amounts and equations turned out to be biomass2008 0 0119x2 8 8517x 5080 9 r2 0 884 and biomass2009 0 1202x2 50 175x 1900 1 r2 0 970 fig 6 the probable reason of lower yield from elevated irrigation trials than full irrigated treatments could be high temperatures at the end of the may that resulted early maturation of the i125 with other treatments under mild weather conditions plant development period might be elongated resulting higher values may be reached on the other hand we could not explain the difference in biomass data which differed especially in lower irrigated treatments irrigation water use efficiencies iwue from first year of the current study were lower as compared to second year and ranged from 6 0 i125 to 14 5 i0 on the other hand the same values from 2009 reached from 13 2 i125 to 35 2 i50 the high difference between years occurred mainly due to high biomass value from non irrigated treatment of first year which was higher due probably to precipitation events that occurred in may lessening the effect of draught stress therefore increasing biomass of non irrigated treatment but having no or limited effect on seed yield fig 7 4 discussions and conclusions the current study was conducted to evaluate the possible effect of different irrigation rates on vetch vegetative and seed yields under semi arid conditions in 2008 and 2009 cropping seasons the irrigation treatments included the application of 125 100 75 50 25 and 0 of full irrigated treatment which was determined with soil moisture measurements evaluated crop parameters in the current study were crop height kernel weight number of branches number of pod per plant seed yield and above ground biomass furthermore irrigation water use efficiency values of each year and trials were calculated vetch plant heights were significantly p 0 05 increased with elevated irrigation amounts and the highest values were obtained from over irrigated i125 trials in both of the study years indicating a strong relationship between irrigation and plant height these results could be expected since the vetch is an indeterminate plant therefore responses well to available water on the other hand in both years kernel weights seemed not to be affected by irrigation amounts indicating that plants produced less number of seeds and tried to keep the 1000 seed weights at around 60 g on the other hand number of branch per plant indicated significant difference among irrigation treatments and the highest values were obtained from full irrigated from both full and over irrigated plots with average of 5 3 in both of the years clearly demonstrating that increased irrigation amounts improved the number of branches that is an indication of both seed and biomass similarly number of pod per plant is a good indicator of seed yield and in the current study depending on applied irrigation amount it increased to about 16 in 2008 and 13 in 2009 when water stress was imposed on plants numbers of pods were decreased vetch is mainly grown for seed and or biomass therefore high values of both of the parameters are desired for an economical point of view one of the main factors determining plant growth assuring seed yield is irrigation in the current study also both seed and biomass yields were mainly determined by irrigation in both of the years full irrigated trials produced highest seed yield as 2112 and 2747 kg ha 1 and biomass as 6740 and 6826 kg ha 1 in 2008 and 2009 respectively over irrigations did not significantly differ both of the parameters in both of the study years on the contrary this application resulted in lower values resulting iwue values as expected were higher in stressed treatments as it is the case for most of the agronomic crops this study results showed that 1 m3 of irrigation produced about 3 kg of biomass irrigations of vetch therefore during plant growth stages substantially affects biomass and seed yields and this effect during dry years will be more pronounced therefore if available irrigation insures economical vetch production 
11236,the number of cattle in turkey increased from 10 5 to 14 0 million and similar increases were observed in sheep and goat population since 2001 to date tuiÌ‡k 2016 therefore increasing the need for the forage crops such as vetch which can easily be fitted to a double cropping farming in 2016 turkey produced about 4 5 million ton of vetch as animal feed which ranked third in the world tuik 2016 therefore is an important animal feed in the country herewith a study was conducted to determine the effect of varying supplemental irrigation rates on vetch vicia villosa l cv selcuk 98 plant vegetative and generative characteristics under semi arid climatic condition of harran plain sanlÄ±urfa turkey a drip irrigation system with 4 l h 1 was utilized for irrigation treatments included 0 25 50 75 125 of full irrigation 100 of which was scheduled based on soil moisture measurements full irrigated treatment received 294 and 263 mm in 2008 and 2009 respectively in general with elevated irrigation amounts vetch plants vegetative and generative characteristics resulted in statistical difference irrigation increased both number of branches and pod per plant values however 1000 seed weight values were not statistical affected showing the fact that plants vegetative growth did not lead to more rather less but similar size seeds on the other hand both seed yield and above soil biomass values were significantly p 0 05 increased with elevated irrigation amounts but analysis of data indicated no advantage of excessive irrigation keywords vetch supplemental irrigation semi arid climatic conditions 1 introduction in 1995 the harran plain was opened to irrigation as a part of social agricultural integrated project southeastern anatolian project sap which covers about 1 8 million hectare of cultivated area the main irrigation practice is inefficient surface irrigation even though industrial crops such as cotton and corn are projected to be the main crops in the plain there is a need for diverse crop pattern to ensure a sustainable farming in addition to increased need for feed forage production because of increasing population and constantly increasing consumption rate of animal products in last two decades tuiÌ‡k 2016 projected cotton farming percentage has already overpassed due mainly to elevated cotton prices resulting in both higher irrigation water use and limiting cultivation of other crops which causes farmers at the lower side of the plain suffer from drought one of the key limiting causes of lower vetch forage is water stress occurring both in fall and late spring when plant growth is faster in most of the world water scarcity is major reason for lowering agricultural production with slowing crop physiological developments gong et al 2005 sinaki et al 2007 sankar et al 2008 even though most of the field crops are more sensitive to water stress during flowering and seed filling stages richards and thurling 1978 el hafid et al 1998 costa and shanmugathasan 2002 karam et al 2005 it is important to determine the sensitive stages of feed crops such as vetch for not only seed but also biomass production researchers indicated that depending of the environmental conditions supplemental irrigation is needed to insure optimum cop production taylor et al 1991 kar et al 2007 abuelos et al 2002 claimed that most of irrigation studies are planed with fertilizer treatments cheema et al 2001 svecnjak and rengel 2006 and hence there is need for only irrigation studies ozel et al 2016 conducted a study under sub humid climatic condition where annual rain fall is slightly over 600 mm and most of which is received in fall and spring mouths the study included different levels of irrigation 100 75 50 and 25 of field capacity to evaluated the effect on above and below soil surface biomass production of vetch they concluded that irrigations statistically increased plant height above soil biomass and under soil biomass of vetch researchers also concluded that under given conditions bringing the soil moisture to 75 was the better choice for vetch production similar drought stress effect on plant height and biomass results were also reported by sadeghipour 2009 who conducted a study under north west of iran climatic conditions in order to achieve higher crop water use efficiency values accurate irrigation scheduling is required therefore local crop coefficients needs to be determined kipkorir et al 2002 kar et al 2007 the potential effect of water stress on vetch physiological and generative features is rare in existing literature and requires to be further assessed under different local climatic conditions hence the goal of the study was to determine the effect drought stress on vetch biomass yield and yield components with resulting irrigation water use efficiency under semi arid climatic conditions 2 materials and methods the current study was conducted at agricultural engineering research field 37 08 n 38 46 e with altitude of 465 m of harran university sanliurfa turkey weather at the study area is characterized as semi arid with low precipitation in the spring crop material used in the current study was selcuk 98 l vetch cultivar since this cultivar was previously tested to be the better choice for the current environmental conditions and one of the most common varieties in the study region vetch crop active root depth was assumed as 60 cm and irrigation water amounts were calculated accordingly irrigation water was classified as c2s1 ussl 1954 with a ph 7 ec 0 31 and sar 0 25 field capacity of the study area was about 32 along with 22 of wilting point therefore soil available water for 60 cm of soil depth was calculated to be 77 3 mm table 1 average temperatures during vetch growth period for first and second seasons were 14 6 and 14 1 c with relative humidity of 52 1 and 54 5 respectively received precipitation amounts for the same seasons were 187 and 266 mm most of the rain accrued during december and january table 2 for the seed bed preparation cultivations were completed before vetch seed sawing 6 0 1 8 m2 trial plots consisted 6 rows with 1 3 cm on row and 30 cm between row spacing ending about 250 seed per m 2 vetch seeds were hand sown on 23 11 2007 and 14 11 2008 and received 20 kg ha 1 of nitrogen and phosphorus on 15 02 2008 and 10 02 2009 only one application of herbicide was performed for narrow leave weeds since both biomass and seed yield was evaluated hand harvesting was carried out on 23 05 2008 and 28 05 2009 in the first and the second study years when seed were ripened side rows were considered as side effected and therefore only middle four rows were considered for vegetative and generative evaluations the irrigation treatments of the current study included 0 i0 dry land conditions 25 i25 50 i50 75 i75 100 i100 full irrigation and 125 i125 percent application of available soil moisture of full irrigated treatment with a drip irrigation system the purpose of using 125 irrigation trial was to determine the optimum level of water application plant vegetative and generative characteristics irrigations were scheduled based on soil moisture deficit of full irrigated treatment plots which was gravimetrically determined twice a week when the soil moisture dropped 50 5 of available water irrigations were initiated drip irrigation system used in this study included a drip irrigation lateral of 4 l h 1 emitter flow rate with 20 cm emitter spacing to each row of vetch plants 25 mm irrigation water was applied to all irrigation treatment plots in both of the years right after sawing in order to ensure a good germination and plant stand in both of the study years total of 4 irrigations were performed starting from april to plant harvest crop water use during the irrigation period was calculated with the method outlined by doorenbos and pruitt 1992 et i p dr rf Î´s where et is evapotranspiration i is irrigation water p is effective rainfall plus capillary rise dr is drainage rf is runoff and Î´s is change in the soil moisture content all in mm unit since the system used to deliver irrigation water to crop active root depth was a drip irrigation system there assumed to be no excess water therefore no runoff in both of the years for the i100 trial therefore rf and dr were assumed zero reducing the equation to et i p Î´s plant height cm 1000 kernel weight gr number of branch per plant number of pod per plant yield kg ha 1 and biomass kg ha 1 were determined and subsequent irrigation water use efficiencies iwue kg ha 1 mm 1 were calculated the irrigation water use efficiency iwue kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated with the following equation iwue bmt bm0 i where bmt is biomass value from each of irrigation treatments kg ha 1 bm0 is biomass value from non irrigated treatment kg ha 1 i is seasonal applied irrigation water amount to each of the trials mm the current field experiment was arranged based on complete randomized design with 3 replications differences among irrigation treatments were tested utilizing anova and regression analysis methods results of both statistical tests were considered significant at p 0 05 level irrigation amounts were regressed against each of the measured parameters and curve regression was considered using spss 2002 statistical program coefficient of determination r2 and significance p were considered for the regression validation 3 results in both of the crop growing seasons 25 mm of irrigation water was applied to all irrigation trials to insure a good plant stand total of 294 and 263 mm irrigation water iw with 4 irrigation practices were performed in both of the study years respectively seasonal vetch crop water use etc including soil water deficit Î´s in addition to applied irrigation water iw of full irrigation treatments were calculated to be 386 mm and 395 mm in 2008 and 2009 crop growing seasons respectively in the current study total applied irrigation amount in 2008 was a little higher than 2009 season due to slightly severe climatic conditions average of 7 months temperature in first and second seasons turned out to be 12 4 and 11 9 c table 2 plants reached to maturity about 7 days earlier in the first year of the study however in second year of the study vetch plants flowering were about 10 days earlier as compared to first year in general harvest date of the plants from stressed trials i0 25 50 were 5 7 days earlier as compared to full irrigated treatment i100 in both of the study years vetch plant heights varied from 22 7 cm i0 to 48 0 cm i125 in 2008 and from 24 7 cm to i0 and 49 3 i125 in 2009 ozel et al 2016 reported higher plant heights about 100 cm under mediterranean climatic conditions which was probably because of extended crop growing period with milder temperatures resulting taller plants on the other hand similar to the current study result some researcher reported that water stress significantly lowered plant height gallorda et al 2004 liu and stÃ¼tzel 2004 ozel et al 2016 statistical analysis of the data indicated no significant p 0 05 difference between years but irrigation treatments p 0 05 in general there seemed to be no significantly p 0 05 different effect between low irrigation treatments i0 25 50 nevertheless there was significant differences among other treatments at p 0 05 level at large it certainly could be concluded that as irrigation amount increased plant height corresponded well and improved table 3 regression analysis of plant heights indicated a polynomial relationship between irrigation and plant height with ph2008 8e 05x2 0 1081x 20 468 and r2 0 998 for the 2008 and ph2009 0 0002x2 0 0004x 29 093 and r2 0 800 for the 2009 and both of the equations were significant at p 0 05 level fig 1 in average for every 1 cm differences in plant height about 10 mm of irrigation water was required table 1 under similar climatic conditions vetch producers may consider plant height as an indicator of biomass and therefore target a certain amount in advance with the amount of irrigation water they have access to or make their plans based on availability of irrigation water amount the irrigation treatments effect on kernel weight ranged from 53 5 to 59 1 g in 2008 and from 59 7 to 62 0 g in 2009 cropping seasons statistical analysis of the data indicated no difference between years except i0 and i50 irrigation treatments however there was no significant difference p 0 05 among treatments within both of the study years indicating that irrigation was not a factor determining kernel weights table 3 the relationship between irrigation treatments and kernel weights in first and second seasons turned out to be kw2009 4e 05x2 0 0215x 58 92 r2 0 896 and kw2008 4e 06x2 0 0193x 53 769 r2 0 925 respectively fig 2 and both of the equations were statistically representing the kernel weights therefore could be used to for simulation purposes it seems that when irrigation amounts were reduced plant tends to lower the number of kernels but not considerable change in kernel weighs even tough graphical analysis of the data indicated slight change with increased amount of irrigations fig 2 number of branches per plant varied from 3 7 to 5 3 in both of the study years and there was no significant change among three low irrigation treatments i0 25 50 and high irrigation i75 100 125 treatments on the other hand high irrigation treatments i75 100 125 significantly p 0 05 produced more number of branch per plant than low irrigation treatments i75 100 125 in both of the years table 3 the highest number of branch in both of the years was obtained from i125 trial indicating that with increase irrigation vetch plants kept producing more branches regression analysis of the data indicated a polynomial relationship between irrigation amounts and number plant branch and equations in 2008 and 2009 turned out to be were nb2008 1e 05x2 0 0097x 3 4612 r2 0 986 and nb2009 3e 05x2 0 0173x 3 15 r2 0 939 respectively fig 3 number of branch per plant data indicated more number of branches from irrigated trials since this crop is indeterminate number of pods per plant in the first year of the study was higher than in second year ranging from 10 3 to 16 3 in 2008 and 6 3 to 13 3 in 2009 statistical analysis of the first year indicated no significant difference among first three low irrigation treatments and similarly among last three high irrigation treatments however in the second year of the study the non irrigated treatment i0 produced the lowest number of pods 6 3 as compared to other treatments other three fallowing irrigation treatments i25 50 75 produced lesser number of pods then two high irrigation treatments i100 125 at p 0 05 level regression analysis indicated polynomial relationships in 2008 and 2009 as np2008 2e 05x2 0 0268x 9 4288 r2 0 970 and np2009 8e 05x2 0 0049x 8 1531 r2 0 75 both of the equations statistically p 0 05 could be used to determine the number of pods per plant for a given condition using irrigation amounts similar to number of branches pod numbers also increased with elevated irrigation and therefore resulting in higher both seed yield and biomass as compared to stressed plants fig 4 seed yield in 2008 varied from 1154 i0 to 2112 kg ha 1 i100 whereas in 2009 yields from the same irrigation treatments ranged from 1090 to 2747 kg ha 1 statistical analysis results of seed yield were quite similar to number of pods per plant and analysis of the data indicated no significant difference between years however significant difference p 0 05 between low irrigated i0 25 50 and high irrigated i75 100 125 treatments was determined table 3 data indicated that increased irrigation amounts elevated yield up to full irrigation and then tendsinclined to decrease with over irrigation as expected this was even more obvious in 2009 fig 5 regression analysis in both of the current study years also indicated a strong significant relationship as yield2008 0 0055x2 5 3119x 1028 8 r2 0 99 and yield2009 0 0464x2 19 593x 737 18 r2 0 97 in 2008 and 2009 respectively regression analysis of the data indicates that equations could be used p 0 05 to determine vetch seed yield with applied irrigation amounts the reason for similarity between seed yield and pod numbers could be attributed to the fact that seeds are obtained from pods therefore could easily be used as an indicator for the seed yield as it is true for other cops vetch plant also were affected by irrigation above ground vetch biomass values from 2008 and 2009 seasons ranged from 4929 i0 to 6740 kg ha 1 i100 and from 2979 i0 to 6826 kg ha 1 i100 respectively in general the lowest biomass values in both of the years were obtained from i0 trials and this was expected however the highest biomass was from full irrigated treatment i100 it seems that higher branch and pod values from over irrigated treatment i125 did not resulted in higher biomass similar to seed yield results analysis of the data indicated significant p 0 05 difference among treatments ozel et al 2016 reported similar results and indicated that irrigation improved biomass 9 fold as compared to non irrigated treatments regression analysis showed significant p 0 05 relationships between biomass and irrigation amounts and equations turned out to be biomass2008 0 0119x2 8 8517x 5080 9 r2 0 884 and biomass2009 0 1202x2 50 175x 1900 1 r2 0 970 fig 6 the probable reason of lower yield from elevated irrigation trials than full irrigated treatments could be high temperatures at the end of the may that resulted early maturation of the i125 with other treatments under mild weather conditions plant development period might be elongated resulting higher values may be reached on the other hand we could not explain the difference in biomass data which differed especially in lower irrigated treatments irrigation water use efficiencies iwue from first year of the current study were lower as compared to second year and ranged from 6 0 i125 to 14 5 i0 on the other hand the same values from 2009 reached from 13 2 i125 to 35 2 i50 the high difference between years occurred mainly due to high biomass value from non irrigated treatment of first year which was higher due probably to precipitation events that occurred in may lessening the effect of draught stress therefore increasing biomass of non irrigated treatment but having no or limited effect on seed yield fig 7 4 discussions and conclusions the current study was conducted to evaluate the possible effect of different irrigation rates on vetch vegetative and seed yields under semi arid conditions in 2008 and 2009 cropping seasons the irrigation treatments included the application of 125 100 75 50 25 and 0 of full irrigated treatment which was determined with soil moisture measurements evaluated crop parameters in the current study were crop height kernel weight number of branches number of pod per plant seed yield and above ground biomass furthermore irrigation water use efficiency values of each year and trials were calculated vetch plant heights were significantly p 0 05 increased with elevated irrigation amounts and the highest values were obtained from over irrigated i125 trials in both of the study years indicating a strong relationship between irrigation and plant height these results could be expected since the vetch is an indeterminate plant therefore responses well to available water on the other hand in both years kernel weights seemed not to be affected by irrigation amounts indicating that plants produced less number of seeds and tried to keep the 1000 seed weights at around 60 g on the other hand number of branch per plant indicated significant difference among irrigation treatments and the highest values were obtained from full irrigated from both full and over irrigated plots with average of 5 3 in both of the years clearly demonstrating that increased irrigation amounts improved the number of branches that is an indication of both seed and biomass similarly number of pod per plant is a good indicator of seed yield and in the current study depending on applied irrigation amount it increased to about 16 in 2008 and 13 in 2009 when water stress was imposed on plants numbers of pods were decreased vetch is mainly grown for seed and or biomass therefore high values of both of the parameters are desired for an economical point of view one of the main factors determining plant growth assuring seed yield is irrigation in the current study also both seed and biomass yields were mainly determined by irrigation in both of the years full irrigated trials produced highest seed yield as 2112 and 2747 kg ha 1 and biomass as 6740 and 6826 kg ha 1 in 2008 and 2009 respectively over irrigations did not significantly differ both of the parameters in both of the study years on the contrary this application resulted in lower values resulting iwue values as expected were higher in stressed treatments as it is the case for most of the agronomic crops this study results showed that 1 m3 of irrigation produced about 3 kg of biomass irrigations of vetch therefore during plant growth stages substantially affects biomass and seed yields and this effect during dry years will be more pronounced therefore if available irrigation insures economical vetch production 
11237,in the semi arid regions of the world irrigation and fertilization are essential for cereals growth and production because of water shortages and unfertile soils however inappropriate water and fertilizer management always causes unstable grain weight and yield this study aims to explore the responses of grain filling characteristics grain weight and productivity of winter wheat to varying water and fertilizer supplies a three year 2014 2017 experiment was conducted on winter wheat triticum aestivum l xinong 979 under drip fertigation with three irrigation rates and three fertilization rates the temporal dynamics of grain weight was simulated using determinate growth equation the appearance time of maximum filling rate t m and growth termination time t e increased as fertilization rate increased whereas the maximum and average filling rate increased and then had a slight decrease the t m and t e decreased with the increase of water deficit the mild water deficit obtained higher grain filling rate the grain weight percentage of spike weight gps and spike moisture content smc had extremely significant correlations with grain weight gps tended to decrease one week before maturity and declined with the increase in water stress smc decreased in a parabolic form and exhibited a dramatic decline about one week before maturity with the increase of water or fertilizer supply the grain weight firstly increased and then decreased where the mild water deficit and appropriate fertilization improve grain filling and productivity of winter wheat keywords determinate growth equation water deficit grain weight spike moisture content yield components drip fertigation 1 introduction winter wheat triticum aestivum l is one of the most important food crops in china and around the world the grain yield of winter wheat has to be enhanced for coping with the increasing population and decreasing area of agricultural lands through either breeding or improved agronomic management grain weight grain number per spike and effective spike number per m2 are the major components that cause the instability and high yield of cereals in current agricultural production lizana et al 2010 the grain filling stage is the final growth stage in cereals when fertilized ovaries develop into caryopses zhang et al 2012 it determines the grain weight and thus improving grain filling is important for high grain weight and yield chen et al 2013 nass and reiser 1975 yang and zhang 2010 grain filling in wheat is supported by current photosynthesis as well as the translocation of stored reserves accumulated before anthesis grain weight is the last yield component to be formed and the final grain weight is largely dependent on the rate and duration of the grain filling process darroch and baker 1990 takai et al 2005 which is affected by crop variety shi et al 2017 yang et al 2001b yin et al 2009 plant density paponov et al 2005 air temperature shah and paulsen 2003 shi et al 2017 thapa et al 2018 precipitation yadav and ellis 2017 soil moisture status shah and paulsen 2003 sofield et al 1977 yang et al 2006 fertilization blacklow and incoll 1981 and many other factors thus reasonable field management of water and fertilizer also plays an important role in the grain filling process grain weight and productivity of winter wheat water availability is a major constraint for wheat production in many semi arid regions around the world including the guanzhong plain of china kang et al 2002 zheng et al 2018a b which experiences small amount of precipitation and serious shortage of irrigation water resources soil moisture has significant effects on the grain filling and grain yield formation of winter wheat previous research have revealed that drought is the most important environmental factor causing substantial yield loss in winter wheat kobata et al 1992 thapa et al 2018 van sanford and mackown 1987 water stress occurring at the early grain development stage curtails the grain sink potential by reducing the number of endosperm cells and amyloplasts formed abid et al 2017 iqbal and ashraf 2013 yang et al 2001a some studies have shown that moderate soil drying stress at the grain filling stage could efficiently improve the grain filling and grain yield yang and zhang 2010 yang et al 2004 zhang et al 2017c the timing and severity of water deficit influenced the final grain yield sadras and rebetzke 2013 however most studies mainly concentrated on the effects of water deficit on grain filling at a single growing stage of winter wheat i e jointing pre anthesis or post anthesis abid et al 2017 liang et al 2017 zhang et al 2012 few studies have evaluated the effects of soil water regulation during the whole growth period on the dynamic process of grain filling of winter wheat fertilizer is also essential for wheat growth and production in this region because of the unfertile soils in many semi arid regions of the world the effect of nitrogen n on the grain weight of cereals is complex n plays a key role in crop productivity and significantly affects the grain weight of cereals evans 1989 jiang et al 2016 palta et al 2005 however different studies reported various effects of nitrogen on the crop growth excess n fertilizer application inhibited the sink strength and grain filling rate of inferior grain of wheat liang et al 2017 yang et al 2001a whereas in others high levels of n fertilizer had no significant effect on grain weight or even decreased the grain weight of cereals jiang et al 2016 phosphorus p fertilizer can improve the root growth and grain filling efficiency during drought to improve osmotic adjustment in crops jeong et al 2017 both nitrogen and phosphorus nutrition can increase crop yields ma et al 2018 besides sufficient potassium k supply corrects the drought induced reduction in photosynthesis in grain legumes and potassium foliage application significantly promoted the grain filling rates of inferior grains and increased the grain weight under well watered conditions lv et al 2017 npk can improve the remobilization of nutrition from vegetative organs to grains and thus increase grain yield therefore an appropriate nitrogen phosphorus and potassium application will not only help ensure crop production but also avoid wasting fertilizer however there is very little information on the selection of appropriate amounts of npk that is conducive to the grain filling process and yield performance of winter wheat additionally all fertilizers are broadcast at an early growth stage of crops in conventional fertilizer management a large dose of n at this stage can result in significant n losses through nitrate leaching or immobilization with low n utilization efficiency haynes 1988 with the development of new water saving technologies in agriculture drip fertigation has been verified as an advanced technology for increasing crop yields saving fertilizer inputs and reducing water usage by directly delivering water and nutrients to crop roots wolff et al 2017 fan et al 2017 drip fertigation enables adequate application of water and nutrients in multiple applications during the whole growing season zhang et al 2017b zhou et al 2018 therefore it is necessary to determine the suitable fertigation rates in order to obtain relatively stable grain weight and high yield besides different water and fertilizer supplies lead to fluctuant crop water status and biomass distribution crop water status is an important parameter for plant growth and yield performance zhang et al 2018a 2018b especially the spike moisture content for the grain growth of wheat nowadays there are too many methods to estimate crop water status and biomass such as the satellite remote sensing remote sensing aerial vehicle and canopy reflectance spectrums elvanidi et al 2017 luquet et al 2003 zhang et al 2018a 2018b however it is hard to estimate grain weight depending on crop water status and biomass before maturity therefore it is necessary to investigate the correlation of grain weight with the grain weight percentage of spike weight spike moisture content during grain filling process under precision drip fertigation which can provide a theoretical guidance for the estimation of grain weight in this study we hypothesized that suitable water and fertilizer management will not only obtain appropriate spike moisture content but also increase the grain weight percentage of spike weight during grain filling process and then improve the grain filling and productivity of winter wheat the objectives of the present study are to 1 examine the effects of different soil water stresses and fertilizer application rates during the whole growth period on the grain weight percentage of spike weight spike moisture content grain filling process characteristic yield and it components of winter wheat 2 explore the correlation of grain weight with the grain weight percentage of spike weight spike moisture content grain duration and rate of winter wheat under different fertigation schemes 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description a three year

angstrom angstrom 1924 fan et al 2018a 2018b 2 3 2 sampling of grain filling according to the method of jongkaewwattana et al 1993 plants heading and anthesis on the same date were selected and marked as single stems with similar growth three hundred single stems 100 stems for each of the first to third rows starting from the drip tape were marked per plot to ensure uniformity the single plants were sampled during the period from anthesis to harvest and thirty random tagged spikes were collected between 09 00 and 11 00 h in the morning every 5 7 days all spikes were removed by scissors from the connection between spike and stem and put in a marked plastic zipper bag the bags were then put in the foam box with ice immediately to prevent moisture loss after collection all samples were brought back to the laboratory and the fresh weight of spikes was weighed with an electronic balance me 104 mettler toledo group switzerland 0 0001 g after that all samples were put in a marked paper

grain filling process the following sigmoid growth function yin et al 2003 was used to fit the temporal dynamics of grain weight gw and the basic parameters of the tested winter wheat with different

2015 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 respectively from anthesis to harvest the t max and t min of 32 8 and 5 6 in 2015 2016 were lower than those in 2014 2015 34 and 6 and in 2016 2017 34 9 and 6 7

21 1 mj m 2 d 1 due to the rainfall events at the late grain filling stage the rhmean of 66 4 in 2015 and 65 7 in 2016 were higher than 60 6 in 2017 respectively 3 2 grain filling 3 2 1 grain weight dynamic curve the cumulative grain filling dry matter accumulation process of winter wheat shows a sigmoid pattern curve fig 3 the eq 4 has the largest change in the parameter tm with a coefficient of variation cv of 37 94 compared with this of the other grain filling characteristic parameters therefore the irrigation and fertilizer regimes mainly affect t m an accurate fitting of grain filling for different water and fertilizer supplies under drip fertigation was provided by eq 4 the coefficient of determination r 2 varied from 0 96 to 0 996 p 0 01 table 3 therefore the fitting parameters could be used to further calculate the characteristic parameters and then analyze the effects of different levels of water and fertilizer on grain filling characteristics 3 2 2 characteristics of grain filling duration and rate at the w1 level the values of t m and t e increased as the fertilization rate increased table 3 at the w2 and w3 levels t m and t e sometimes increased and then decreased slightly the tm and t e increased as the fertilization rate increased table 4 both of tm and t e decreased with the increase of irrigation amount table 4 the latest tm and t e were obtained at the w1 level averaged at 16 5 35 8 days during three seasons respectively only fertilizer treatments had extremely significant effects on tm p 0 01 the te were affected by fertilizer and year significantly p 0 05 as the fertilization rate increased gfrmax and agfr increased or increased and then had a slight decrease at the f1 level table 3 however gfrmax at the w1 level during 2015 2016 and agfr at the w1 and w3 levels during 2014 2015 showed a decreasing trend as the fertilization rate increased as the irrigation rate increased gfrmax and agfr also increased or increased and then had a slight decrease at the w1 level table 3 agfr at the f3 level during 2014 2015 and at the f1 level during 2016 2017 decreased as the irrigation rate increased during 2016 2017 both the w2 and f2 levels had the largest gfrmax and agfr table 4 gfrmax and agfr in 2015 2016 were significantly larger than those in 2014 2015 and 2016 2017 p 0 05 the largest final thousand grain weight ftgw averaged 49 77 g during three seasons was obtained at the w2 level and the smallest ftgw averaged 44 59 g during three seasons was obtained at the nf level followed by f3 treatment table 4 among different fertilizer treatments the largest ftgw averaged 50 38 g during three seasons was obtained at the f2 level followed by f1 and f3 treatments table 4 fertilizer and year exerted extremely significant effects on ftgw p 0 01 from the above results the duration of grain filling decreased with the increase of water stress the grain filling rate increased first and then decreased with the increase of water stress the mild water deficit was more conducive to grain weight the duration of grain filling increased with the increase of fertilization rate f1 and f2 levels had no significant effects on tm and t e but highest gfrmax and agfr averaged 2 10 mg d 1 and 1 40 mg d 1 during the three seasons respectively was obtained at the f2 level and the largest grain weight was obtained at the f2 level therefore the w2f2 treatment is considered as appropriate for irrigation and fertilization management to improve the grain filling efficiency and increase the grain weight 3 2 3 correlation of final thousand grain weight with parameters of grain filling characteristics of winter wheat under the different levels of water and fertilizer the t m was positively p 0 01 correlated with the t e fig 4 a y 0 352x 30 098 r 2 0 798 similarly the gfrmax positively p 0 01 was correlated with the agfr fig 4b y 0 663x 0 002 r 2 0 795 therefore the final thousand grain weight with maximum grain filling rate and time under the different levels of water and fertilizer during all three seasons of 2014 2017 were plotted in fig 5 final thousand grain weight was found to be significantly positively p 0 05 associated with the maximum grain filling rate at the w1 r 2 0 75 w2 r 2 0 63 f1 r 2 0 63 f2 r 2 0 45 levels except for w3 and f3 however the final thousand grain weight was found to be not significantly associated with the appearance time of maximum grain filling rate under different levels of water and fertilizer 3 3 dynamics of grain weight percentage of spike weight from anthesis to harvest the grain weight percentage of spike weight gps dry weight basis increased progressively over time in a rising parabolic form and the variability among replicates was high during 2014 2015 fig 6 the gps generally had a declining tendency at 35 days after anthesis during 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 while there was no downward trend during 2016 2017 especially there was a slight downward trend at 25 days after anthesis at the w1 level during 2014 2015 at harvest the gps ranged from 70 7 w1nf to 80 6 w1f2 during 2014 2015 from 75 2 w3f3 to 80 3 w3f2 during 2015 2016 and from 74 2 w1f3 to 80 0 w2f2 during 2016 2017 respectively the highest gps was obtained at the f2 level less variation of gps was found during 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 compared with that during 2014 2015 based on the measured data of gps the quadratic polynomial function with a upward parabola opening could be used to fit the relationship between days after anthesis and the gps fig s1 at a significant level with r 2 0 913 and p 0 01 the results show that the maximum gps of winter wheat were obtained about 32 days after anthesis during all three seasons of 2014 2017 respectively 3 4 dynamics of spike moisture content from anthesis to harvest spike moisture content smc wet weight basis decreased gradually over time in a parabolic form with a downward opening fig 7 the smc generally had a dramatic decline one week before maturity for all treatments during all three seasons of 2014 2017 except for w1nf which decreased dramatically two weeks before maturity the difference in smc between w1nf and the other fertilization treatments increased over time at the w1 level during all three seasons of 2014 2017 at the w2 and w3 levels the difference in smc among different fertilizer levels was small in particular the dynamic smc curves of the three fertilization levels almost overlapped during 2014 2015 at harvest fertilizer supply had significant effects on the smc at the w1 level at the w2 and w3 level the smc of the f2 fertilizer level was higher than that of the f1 and f3 levels during all three seasons of 2014 2017 based on the measured data of smc the quadratic polynomial function with a downward parabolic opening can be used to fit the relationship between days after anthesis and the smc fig s2 at a significant level with r 2 0 942 and p 0 01 the results show that the maximum smc of winter wheat were obtained about 5 10 and 12 days after anthesis during all three seasons of 2014 2017 respectively 3 5 correlation of grain weight gw with spike moisture content smc and grain weight percentage of spike dry weight gps under different levels of water and fertilizer at the grain filling stage the grain weight percentage of spike dry weight and grain weight gradually increased while the spike moisture content gradually decreased based on the measured data of smc gps and gw the quadratic polynomial function with a downward parabolic opening can be used to fit the relationship between the spike moisture content and the grain weight percentage of spike dry weight and grain weight fig 8 a and b at a significant level p 0 01 with the r 2 values of 0 81 and 0 91 respectively however the relationship between the grain weight percentage of spike dry weight and the grain weight can be fitted by the quadratic polynomial function with a upward parabolic opening fig 8c at a significant level p 0 01 with the r 2 value of 0 88 3 6 grain yield and yield components table 5 shows the grain yield and its components under different levels of water and fertilizers at the w1 level fertilizer significantly influenced the final crop production p 0 05 yield increased with the increasing fertilizer level during the three seasons of 2014 2017 in the order of w1f1 w1f2 w1f3 w1nf yield components including the effective spike number per m2 grain number per spike and grain number per m2 showed the same tendency at the w2 level the yield and its components increased firstly and then decreased with the increase in fertilizer level during the three seasons the yield of the w2f2 treatment were 8720 8211 7530 kg ha 1 during the three seasons respectively which were significantly higher than those of the w2f3 treatment during all three seasons p 0 05 simultaneously no significant difference was found between the yield and its components in the w1f1 w1f2 w2f1 and w2f2 treatments for all three seasons of 2014 2017 p 0 05 at the w3 level there was no significant effect between the yield and its components in the w3f1 and w3f2 treatments for all three seasons of 2014 2017 p 0 05 however the yield and its components of w3f3 were significantly lower than those of w3f1 and w3f2 for all three seasons 2014 2017 p 0 05 except for the effective spike number per m2 and grain number per m2 in 2014 2015 yield and grain number per spike in 2016 2017 at the f1 and f2 levels there was no significant effect between the yield and its components at the w1 and w2 levels for all three seasons of 2014 2017 p 0 05 except for the yield during 2014 2015 and the effective spike number per m2 during 2016 2017 at the f1 level p 0 05 and the yield and its components were significantly higher than those at the w3 level p 0 05 at the f3 level the yield and its components under both normal irrigation and deficit irrigation were relatively low the analysis of variance showed irrigation fertilizer year and the integrated effects of irrigation and fertilizer had extremely significant effects on yield and it components p 0 01 except for the grain number per spike under the influence of particularly year and effective spike number per m2 under the influence of irrigation fertilizer interaction p 0 05 table 5 the interaction of fertilization and year was significant p 0 05 table 5 on the yield and grain number per spike in a word no significant difference was found between the yield and its components under normal w1 or mild deficit w2 water and conventional f1 or moderate f2 fertilization supply which were significantly higher than those of more severe deficit water w3 and inadequate f3 fertilization supply table 5 therefore the w2f2 treatment was generally more beneficial for winter wheat production with higher effective spike number per m2 grain number per spike and grain number per m2 it was also the optimal treatment conducive to the development of water and fertilizer saving agriculture 4 discussion as shown in previous studies drought stress reduced the grain yield by 20 80 which was mainly attributed to a decreased rate and duration of grain filling abid et al 2017 iqbal and ashraf 2013 yang et al 2006 others also revealed that sufficient soil moisture tended to alleviate the stress effects of heat waves and drought events which had little effect on growth and yield mitchell et al 2013 rashid et al 2018 however the present experiment showed that under the normal irrigation or more severe water stress supply w3 during the growth period was detrimental to accumulate grain weight while it was better under the mild water deficit under the normal water supply larger canopy structure led to poor aeration and then decreased the soil oxygen concentration and the root activity which further reduced the translocation of photosynthates to grains more severe water stress caused excessive nutrients transferred to the grains faster spike moisture loss fig 7d f decreased gps fig 6d f and destroyed coordination of source sink relationship thereby leading to incomplete grain filling of inferior grains and thus influenced final grain weight liang et al 2017 yang et al 2006 on the contrary under more severe deficit plants maintained higher cytokinins auxins gibberellins and lower abscisic acid contents to regulate the osmotic pressure lower the water potential and maintain high osmotic pressure as indicated by borrell et al 2014 and yang et al 2006 these can ensure the normal physiological function of cells so as to guarantee the increasing output of non structural carbohydrate in stem and sheath improve grain filling efficiently and increase grain yield abid et al 2017 chen et al 2013 which was consistent with the previous studies yang et al 2006 yang and zhang 2010 zhang et al 2017c in modern crop production systems n has complex effects on the grain weight and grain filling of cereals however different studies report different results excess n fertilizer significantly inhibited the sink strength and grain filling rate of inferior grains of winter wheat but it had no significant effect on that of superior grains liang et al 2017 while jiang et al 2016 found that high levels of panicle n fertilizer had no significant effect on grain weight or even decreased the grain weight of cereals suitable nitrogen n fertilizer application notably promoted the sink strength and grain filling rate of inferior grains liang et al 2017 sylvesterbradley and kindred 2009 the present experiment showed that fertilizer had very significant effects on the appearance time of maximum filling rate and final thousand grain weight of winter wheat table 4 with the increase in level of fertilizer the tm and t e increased as fertilization rate increased whereas the gfrmax and agfr increased and then had a slight decrease an appropriate fertilization rate like f2 seems more beneficial for promoting the final grain weight which was consistent with previous studies liang et al 2017 yang et al 2001b previous studies have showed that irrigation did not significantly influence the grain filling duration and rate of winter wheat p 0 05 instead fertilizer had extremely significant effects on the appearance time of maximum filling rate and final thousand grain weight p 0 01 table 4 the main affecting factors of grain filling characteristic of winter wheat were fertilizer and year in the guanzhong plain of northwest china under drip fertigation excessive fertilization could easily affect the grain filling and reduced the yield of winter wheat with extended growth and delayed maturity which was consistent with previous studies jiang et al 2016 liang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017b in addition the guanzhong plain has a winter wheat summer maize rotation system kang et al 2003 zhang et al 2018a 2018b if the growth period of winter wheat is too long it is unfavorable to sow summer maize early zheng et al 2017 therefore the appropriate water and fertilizer management is an effective agronomic measure to regulate the grain filling duration of winter wheat the greater grain weight percentage of spike weight indicated that more nutrients in glume and rachis were transferred to grains at maturity resulting in increasing grain weight table 5 our results show that the maximum gps was about 80 ensuring more assimilate translocation to grains under moderate water and fertilizer conditions the minimum gps was about 70 under the normal irrigation and no fertilizer conditions during all three seasons fig 6 it did not make enough nutrients in glume and rachis transfer to grains under adequate water and fertilizer supplies and fertilizer shortage caused premature senility and it was also detrimental to transport nutrients kohl et al 2015 sylvesterbradley and kindred 2009 yang et al 2001a besides the gps tended to decrease in the first week before maturity and more obvious decline occurred with the increase in water stress the reason may be that the enzyme activity in endosperm cells decreased and the grain gradually entered the dehydration and drying stage and the maintenance respiration of the grains will consume part of the carbohydrates leading to a slight decrease in the dry matter accumulation of the grain bonnett and incoll 1993 sofield et al 1977 smc wet weight not only has a direct association with various biochemical and physiological changes but also provides a direct and precise method for estimating spike moisture at physiological maturity brooking 1990 kano et al 2008 xie et al 2015 previous studies have shown that the spike moisture content decreased progressively over time in a parabolic form and had a dramatic decline about one week before maturity moreover the grain water absorption and loss rates were also positively associated with final grain weight xie et al 2015 the present study also confirmed that the spike moisture content had a significant relationship with grain weight fig 8b in addition brookinget al 1990 found that ear moisture of maize at physiological maturity was also influenced by maize genotype however the present experiment did not involve the other winter wheat genotypes which thus needs further study in the future in the present study the w1f1 and w2f2 treatments produced grain yields of about 7530 9326 kg ha 1 during all three growing seasons of 2014 2017 which were higher than that of the other treatments however no significant difference was found between the w1f1 and w2f2 treatments p 0 05 table 5 and grain weight of w2f2 treatment was more stable than that of the w1f1 treatment in different years meanwhile the yield components including the effective spike number per m2 grain number per spike and grain number per m2 in the w2f2 treatment were more suitable for a higher yield formation jiang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017b compared with the w1f1 w1f2 and w2f1 treatment the w2f2 treatment had less investment in water or fertilizer which indicated that the w2f2 treatment was optimal for water and fertilizer management of drip fertigated winter wheat in this region 5 conclusions in the present study the maximum and average filling rates increased first and then decreased with the increase of water deficit the duration of grain filling increased with the increase of fertilization rate the grain weight of winter wheat increased and then decreased with the increase water or fertilizer levels the mild water deficit and appropriate fertilization improved the grain filling and increased the grain weight the maximum grain weight percentage of spike weight was about 80 under the moderate water and fertilizer supply conditions it tended to decrease in the first week before maturity and more obvious decline occurred with the increasing water stress the spike moisture content decreased gradually over time in a parabolic form and had a dramatic decline about one week before maturity the grain weight percentage of spike weight and spike moisture content had a significant relationship with grain weight fertilizer significantly influenced the appearance time of maximum filling rate and growth termination time particularly year significantly influenced the growth termination time the w2f2 treatment was more beneficial for winter wheat yield in general with higher effective spike number per m2 grain number per spike and grain number per m2 during all three seasons of 2014 2017 under drip fertigation this study can provide guidance for the selection of water and fertilizer management strategies of winter wheat under drip fertigation further studies may focus on investigating the sink source relationship grain nutrients dynamic transport process the

11237,in the semi arid regions of the world irrigation and fertilization are essential for cereals growth and production because of water shortages and unfertile soils however inappropriate water and fertilizer management always causes unstable grain weight and yield this study aims to explore the responses of grain filling characteristics grain weight and productivity of winter wheat to varying water and fertilizer supplies a three year 2014 2017 experiment was conducted on winter wheat triticum aestivum l xinong 979 under drip fertigation with three irrigation rates and three fertilization rates the temporal dynamics of grain weight was simulated using determinate growth equation the appearance time of maximum filling rate t m and growth termination time t e increased as fertilization rate increased whereas the maximum and average filling rate increased and then had a slight decrease the t m and t e decreased with the increase of water deficit the mild water deficit obtained higher grain filling rate the grain weight percentage of spike weight gps and spike moisture content smc had extremely significant correlations with grain weight gps tended to decrease one week before maturity and declined with the increase in water stress smc decreased in a parabolic form and exhibited a dramatic decline about one week before maturity with the increase of water or fertilizer supply the grain weight firstly increased and then decreased where the mild water deficit and appropriate fertilization improve grain filling and productivity of winter wheat keywords determinate growth equation water deficit grain weight spike moisture content yield components drip fertigation 1 introduction winter wheat triticum aestivum l is one of the most important food crops in china and around the world the grain yield of winter wheat has to be enhanced for coping with the increasing population and decreasing area of agricultural lands through either breeding or improved agronomic management grain weight grain number per spike and effective spike number per m2 are the major components that cause the instability and high yield of cereals in current agricultural production lizana et al 2010 the grain filling stage is the final growth stage in cereals when fertilized ovaries develop into caryopses zhang et al 2012 it determines the grain weight and thus improving grain filling is important for high grain weight and yield chen et al 2013 nass and reiser 1975 yang and zhang 2010 grain filling in wheat is supported by current photosynthesis as well as the translocation of stored reserves accumulated before anthesis grain weight is the last yield component to be formed and the final grain weight is largely dependent on the rate and duration of the grain filling process darroch and baker 1990 takai et al 2005 which is affected by crop variety shi et al 2017 yang et al 2001b yin et al 2009 plant density paponov et al 2005 air temperature shah and paulsen 2003 shi et al 2017 thapa et al 2018 precipitation yadav and ellis 2017 soil moisture status shah and paulsen 2003 sofield et al 1977 yang et al 2006 fertilization blacklow and incoll 1981 and many other factors thus reasonable field management of water and fertilizer also plays an important role in the grain filling process grain weight and productivity of winter wheat water availability is a major constraint for wheat production in many semi arid regions around the world including the guanzhong plain of china kang et al 2002 zheng et al 2018a b which experiences small amount of precipitation and serious shortage of irrigation water resources soil moisture has significant effects on the grain filling and grain yield formation of winter wheat previous research have revealed that drought is the most important environmental factor causing substantial yield loss in winter wheat kobata et al 1992 thapa et al 2018 van sanford and mackown 1987 water stress occurring at the early grain development stage curtails the grain sink potential by reducing the number of endosperm cells and amyloplasts formed abid et al 2017 iqbal and ashraf 2013 yang et al 2001a some studies have shown that moderate soil drying stress at the grain filling stage could efficiently improve the grain filling and grain yield yang and zhang 2010 yang et al 2004 zhang et al 2017c the timing and severity of water deficit influenced the final grain yield sadras and rebetzke 2013 however most studies mainly concentrated on the effects of water deficit on grain filling at a single growing stage of winter wheat i e jointing pre anthesis or post anthesis abid et al 2017 liang et al 2017 zhang et al 2012 few studies have evaluated the effects of soil water regulation during the whole growth period on the dynamic process of grain filling of winter wheat fertilizer is also essential for wheat growth and production in this region because of the unfertile soils in many semi arid regions of the world the effect of nitrogen n on the grain weight of cereals is complex n plays a key role in crop productivity and significantly affects the grain weight of cereals evans 1989 jiang et al 2016 palta et al 2005 however different studies reported various effects of nitrogen on the crop growth excess n fertilizer application inhibited the sink strength and grain filling rate of inferior grain of wheat liang et al 2017 yang et al 2001a whereas in others high levels of n fertilizer had no significant effect on grain weight or even decreased the grain weight of cereals jiang et al 2016 phosphorus p fertilizer can improve the root growth and grain filling efficiency during drought to improve osmotic adjustment in crops jeong et al 2017 both nitrogen and phosphorus nutrition can increase crop yields ma et al 2018 besides sufficient potassium k supply corrects the drought induced reduction in photosynthesis in grain legumes and potassium foliage application significantly promoted the grain filling rates of inferior grains and increased the grain weight under well watered conditions lv et al 2017 npk can improve the remobilization of nutrition from vegetative organs to grains and thus increase grain yield therefore an appropriate nitrogen phosphorus and potassium application will not only help ensure crop production but also avoid wasting fertilizer however there is very little information on the selection of appropriate amounts of npk that is conducive to the grain filling process and yield performance of winter wheat additionally all fertilizers are broadcast at an early growth stage of crops in conventional fertilizer management a large dose of n at this stage can result in significant n losses through nitrate leaching or immobilization with low n utilization efficiency haynes 1988 with the development of new water saving technologies in agriculture drip fertigation has been verified as an advanced technology for increasing crop yields saving fertilizer inputs and reducing water usage by directly delivering water and nutrients to crop roots wolff et al 2017 fan et al 2017 drip fertigation enables adequate application of water and nutrients in multiple applications during the whole growing season zhang et al 2017b zhou et al 2018 therefore it is necessary to determine the suitable fertigation rates in order to obtain relatively stable grain weight and high yield besides different water and fertilizer supplies lead to fluctuant crop water status and biomass distribution crop water status is an important parameter for plant growth and yield performance zhang et al 2018a 2018b especially the spike moisture content for the grain growth of wheat nowadays there are too many methods to estimate crop water status and biomass such as the satellite remote sensing remote sensing aerial vehicle and canopy reflectance spectrums elvanidi et al 2017 luquet et al 2003 zhang et al 2018a 2018b however it is hard to estimate grain weight depending on crop water status and biomass before maturity therefore it is necessary to investigate the correlation of grain weight with the grain weight percentage of spike weight spike moisture content during grain filling process under precision drip fertigation which can provide a theoretical guidance for the estimation of grain weight in this study we hypothesized that suitable water and fertilizer management will not only obtain appropriate spike moisture content but also increase the grain weight percentage of spike weight during grain filling process and then improve the grain filling and productivity of winter wheat the objectives of the present study are to 1 examine the effects of different soil water stresses and fertilizer application rates during the whole growth period on the grain weight percentage of spike weight spike moisture content grain filling process characteristic yield and it components of winter wheat 2 explore the correlation of grain weight with the grain weight percentage of spike weight spike moisture content grain duration and rate of winter wheat under different fertigation schemes 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description a three year

as single stems with similar growth three hundred single stems 100 stems for each of the first to third rows starting from the drip tape were marked per plot to ensure uniformity the single plants were sampled during the period from anthesis to harvest and thirty random tagged spikes were collected between 09 00 and 11 00 h in the morning every 5 7 days all spikes were removed by scissors from the connection between spike and stem and put in a marked plastic zipper bag the bags were then put in the foam box with ice immediately to prevent moisture loss after collection all samples were

grain filling process the following sigmoid growth function yin et al 2003 was used to fit the temporal dynamics of grain weight gw and the basic parameters of the tested winter wheat with different

2015 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 respectively from anthesis to harvest the t max and t min of 32 8 and 5 6 in 2015 2016 were lower than those in 2014 2015 34 and 6 and in 2016 2017 34 9 and 6 7

21 1 mj m 2 d 1 due to the rainfall events at the late grain filling stage the rhmean of 66 4 in 2015 and 65 7 in 2016 were higher than 60 6 in 2017 respectively 3 2 grain filling 3 2 1 grain weight dynamic curve the cumulative grain filling dry matter accumulation process of winter wheat shows a sigmoid pattern curve fig 3 the eq 4 has the largest change in the parameter tm with a coefficient of variation cv of 37 94 compared with this of the other grain filling characteristic parameters therefore the irrigation and fertilizer regimes mainly affect t m an accurate fitting of grain filling for different water and fertilizer supplies under drip fertigation was provided by eq 4 the coefficient of determination r 2 varied from 0 96 to 0 996 p 0 01 table 3 therefore the fitting parameters could be used to further calculate the characteristic parameters and then analyze the effects of different levels of water and fertilizer on grain filling characteristics 3 2 2 characteristics of grain filling duration and rate at the w1 level the values of t m and t e increased as the fertilization rate increased table 3 at the w2 and w3 levels t m and t e sometimes increased and then decreased slightly the tm and t e increased as the fertilization rate increased table 4 both of tm and t e decreased with the increase of irrigation amount table 4 the latest tm and t e were obtained at the w1 level averaged at 16 5 35 8 days during three seasons respectively only fertilizer treatments had extremely significant effects on tm p 0 01 the te were affected by fertilizer and year significantly p 0 05 as the fertilization rate increased gfrmax and agfr increased or increased and then had a slight decrease at the f1 level table 3 however gfrmax at the w1 level during 2015 2016 and agfr at the w1 and w3 levels during 2014 2015 showed a decreasing trend as the fertilization rate increased as the irrigation rate increased gfrmax and agfr also increased or increased and then had a slight decrease at the w1 level table 3 agfr at the f3 level during 2014 2015 and at the f1 level during 2016 2017 decreased as the irrigation rate increased during 2016 2017 both the w2 and f2 levels had the largest gfrmax and agfr table 4 gfrmax and agfr in 2015 2016 were significantly larger than those in 2014 2015 and 2016 2017 p 0 05 the largest final thousand grain weight ftgw averaged 49 77 g during three seasons was obtained at the w2 level and the smallest ftgw averaged 44 59 g during three seasons was obtained at the nf level followed by f3 treatment table 4 among different fertilizer treatments the largest ftgw averaged 50 38 g during three seasons was obtained at the f2 level followed by f1 and f3 treatments table 4 fertilizer and year exerted extremely significant effects on ftgw p 0 01 from the above results the duration of grain filling decreased with the increase of water stress the grain filling rate increased first and then decreased with the increase of water stress the mild water deficit was more conducive to grain weight the duration of grain filling increased with the increase of fertilization rate f1 and f2 levels had no significant effects on tm and t e but highest gfrmax and agfr averaged 2 10 mg d 1 and 1 40 mg d 1 during the three seasons respectively was obtained at the f2 level and the largest grain weight was obtained at the f2 level therefore the w2f2 treatment is considered as appropriate for irrigation and fertilization management to improve the grain filling efficiency and increase the grain weight 3 2 3 correlation of final thousand grain weight with parameters of grain filling characteristics of winter wheat under the different levels of water and fertilizer the t m was positively p 0 01 correlated with the t e fig 4 a y 0 352x 30 098 r 2 0 798 similarly the gfrmax positively p 0 01 was correlated with the agfr fig 4b y 0 663x 0 002 r 2 0 795 therefore the final thousand grain weight with maximum grain filling rate and time under the different levels of water and fertilizer during all three seasons of 2014 2017 were plotted in fig 5 final thousand grain weight was found to be significantly positively p 0 05 associated with the maximum grain filling rate at the w1 r 2 0 75 w2 r 2 0 63 f1 r 2 0 63 f2 r 2 0 45 levels except for w3 and f3 however the final thousand grain weight was found to be not significantly associated with the appearance time of maximum grain filling rate under different levels of water and fertilizer 3 3 dynamics of grain weight percentage of spike weight from anthesis to harvest the grain weight percentage of spike weight gps dry weight basis increased progressively over time in a rising parabolic form and the variability among replicates was high during 2014 2015 fig 6 the gps generally had a declining tendency at 35 days after anthesis during 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 while there was no downward trend during 2016 2017 especially there was a slight downward trend at 25 days after anthesis at the w1 level during 2014 2015 at harvest the gps ranged from 70 7 w1nf to 80 6 w1f2 during 2014 2015 from 75 2 w3f3 to 80 3 w3f2 during 2015 2016 and from 74 2 w1f3 to 80 0 w2f2 during 2016 2017 respectively the highest gps was obtained at the f2 level less variation of gps was found during 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 compared with that during 2014 2015 based on the measured data of gps the quadratic polynomial function with a upward parabola opening could be used to fit the relationship between days after anthesis and the gps fig s1 at a significant level with r 2 0 913 and p 0 01 the results show that the maximum gps of winter wheat were obtained about 32 days after anthesis during all three seasons of 2014 2017 respectively 3 4 dynamics of spike moisture content from anthesis to harvest spike moisture content smc wet weight basis decreased gradually over time in a parabolic form with a downward opening fig 7 the smc generally had a dramatic decline one week before maturity for all treatments during all three seasons of 2014 2017 except for w1nf which decreased dramatically two weeks before maturity the difference in smc between w1nf and the other fertilization treatments increased over time at the w1 level during all three seasons of 2014 2017 at the w2 and w3 levels the difference in smc among different fertilizer levels was small in particular the dynamic smc curves of the three fertilization levels almost overlapped during 2014 2015 at harvest fertilizer supply had significant effects on the smc at the w1 level at the w2 and w3 level the smc of the f2 fertilizer level was higher than that of the f1 and f3 levels during all three seasons of 2014 2017 based on the measured data of smc the quadratic polynomial function with a downward parabolic opening can be used to fit the relationship between days after anthesis and the smc fig s2 at a significant level with r 2 0 942 and p 0 01 the results show that the maximum smc of winter wheat were obtained about 5 10 and 12 days after anthesis during all three seasons of 2014 2017 respectively 3 5 correlation of grain weight gw with spike moisture content smc and grain weight percentage of spike dry weight gps under different levels of water and fertilizer at the grain filling stage the grain weight percentage of spike dry weight and grain weight gradually increased while the spike moisture content gradually decreased based on the measured data of smc gps and gw the quadratic polynomial function with a downward parabolic opening can be used to fit the relationship between the spike moisture content and the grain weight percentage of spike dry weight and grain weight fig 8 a and b at a significant level p 0 01 with the r 2 values of 0 81 and 0 91 respectively however the relationship between the grain weight percentage of spike dry weight and the grain weight can be fitted by the quadratic polynomial function with a upward parabolic opening fig 8c at a significant level p 0 01 with the r 2 value of 0 88 3 6 grain yield and yield components table 5 shows the grain yield and its components under different levels of water and fertilizers at the w1 level fertilizer significantly influenced the final crop production p 0 05 yield increased with the increasing fertilizer level during the three seasons of 2014 2017 in the order of w1f1 w1f2 w1f3 w1nf yield components including the effective spike number per m2 grain number per spike and grain number per m2 showed the same tendency at the w2 level the yield and its components increased firstly and then decreased with the increase in fertilizer level during the three seasons the yield of the w2f2 treatment were 8720 8211 7530 kg ha 1 during the three seasons respectively which were significantly higher than those of the w2f3 treatment during all three seasons p 0 05 simultaneously no significant difference was found between the yield and its components in the w1f1 w1f2 w2f1 and w2f2 treatments for all three seasons of 2014 2017 p 0 05 at the w3 level there was no significant effect between the yield and its components in the w3f1 and w3f2 treatments for all three seasons of 2014 2017 p 0 05 however the yield and its components of w3f3 were significantly lower than those of w3f1 and w3f2 for all three seasons 2014 2017 p 0 05 except for the effective spike number per m2 and grain number per m2 in 2014 2015 yield and grain number per spike in 2016 2017 at the f1 and f2 levels there was no significant effect between the yield and its components at the w1 and w2 levels for all three seasons of 2014 2017 p 0 05 except for the yield during 2014 2015 and the effective spike number per m2 during 2016 2017 at the f1 level p 0 05 and the yield and its components were significantly higher than those at the w3 level p 0 05 at the f3 level the yield and its components under both normal irrigation and deficit irrigation were relatively low the analysis of variance showed irrigation fertilizer year and the integrated effects of irrigation and fertilizer had extremely significant effects on yield and it components p 0 01 except for the grain number per spike under the influence of particularly year and effective spike number per m2 under the influence of irrigation fertilizer interaction p 0 05 table 5 the interaction of fertilization and year was significant p 0 05 table 5 on the yield and grain number per spike in a word no significant difference was found between the yield and its components under normal w1 or mild deficit w2 water and conventional f1 or moderate f2 fertilization supply which were significantly higher than those of more severe deficit water w3 and inadequate f3 fertilization supply table 5 therefore the w2f2 treatment was generally more beneficial for winter wheat production with higher effective spike number per m2 grain number per spike and grain number per m2 it was also the optimal treatment conducive to the development of water and fertilizer saving agriculture 4 discussion as shown in previous studies drought stress reduced the grain yield by 20 80 which was mainly attributed to a decreased rate and duration of grain filling abid et al 2017 iqbal and ashraf 2013 yang et al 2006 others also revealed that sufficient soil moisture tended to alleviate the stress effects of heat waves and drought events which had little effect on growth and yield mitchell et al 2013 rashid et al 2018 however the present experiment showed that under the normal irrigation or more severe water stress supply w3 during the growth period was detrimental to accumulate grain weight while it was better under the mild water deficit under the normal water supply larger canopy structure led to poor aeration and then decreased the soil oxygen concentration and the root activity which further reduced the translocation of photosynthates to grains more severe water stress caused excessive nutrients transferred to the grains faster spike moisture loss fig 7d f decreased gps fig 6d f and destroyed coordination of source sink relationship thereby leading to incomplete grain filling of inferior grains and thus influenced final grain weight liang et al 2017 yang et al 2006 on the contrary under more severe deficit plants maintained higher cytokinins auxins gibberellins and lower abscisic acid contents to regulate the osmotic pressure lower the water potential and maintain high osmotic pressure as indicated by borrell et al 2014 and yang et al 2006 these can ensure the normal physiological function of cells so as to guarantee the increasing output of non structural carbohydrate in stem and sheath improve grain filling efficiently and increase grain yield abid et al 2017 chen et al 2013 which was consistent with the previous studies yang et al 2006 yang and zhang 2010 zhang et al 2017c in modern crop production systems n has complex effects on the grain weight and grain filling of cereals however different studies report different results excess n fertilizer significantly inhibited the sink strength and grain filling rate of inferior grains of winter wheat but it had no significant effect on that of superior grains liang et al 2017 while jiang et al 2016 found that high levels of panicle n fertilizer had no significant effect on grain weight or even decreased the grain weight of cereals suitable nitrogen n fertilizer application notably promoted the sink strength and grain filling rate of inferior grains liang et al 2017 sylvesterbradley and kindred 2009 the present experiment showed that fertilizer had very significant effects on the appearance time of maximum filling rate and final thousand grain weight of winter wheat table 4 with the increase in level of fertilizer the tm and t e increased as fertilization rate increased whereas the gfrmax and agfr increased and then had a slight decrease an appropriate fertilization rate like f2 seems more beneficial for promoting the final grain weight which was consistent with previous studies liang et al 2017 yang et al 2001b previous studies have showed that irrigation did not significantly influence the grain filling duration and rate of winter wheat p 0 05 instead fertilizer had extremely significant effects on the appearance time of maximum filling rate and final thousand grain weight p 0 01 table 4 the main affecting factors of grain filling characteristic of winter wheat were fertilizer and year in the guanzhong plain of northwest china under drip fertigation excessive fertilization could easily affect the grain filling and reduced the yield of winter wheat with extended growth and delayed maturity which was consistent with previous studies jiang et al 2016 liang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017b in addition the guanzhong plain has a winter wheat summer maize rotation system kang et al 2003 zhang et al 2018a 2018b if the growth period of winter wheat is too long it is unfavorable to sow summer maize early zheng et al 2017 therefore the appropriate water and fertilizer management is an effective agronomic measure to regulate the grain filling duration of winter wheat the greater grain weight percentage of spike weight indicated that more nutrients in glume and rachis were transferred to grains at maturity resulting in increasing grain weight table 5 our results show that the maximum gps was about 80 ensuring more assimilate translocation to grains under moderate water and fertilizer conditions the minimum gps was about 70 under the normal irrigation and no fertilizer conditions during all three seasons fig 6 it did not make enough nutrients in glume and rachis transfer to grains under adequate water and fertilizer supplies and fertilizer shortage caused premature senility and it was also detrimental to transport nutrients kohl et al 2015 sylvesterbradley and kindred 2009 yang et al 2001a besides the gps tended to decrease in the first week before maturity and more obvious decline occurred with the increase in water stress the reason may be that the enzyme activity in endosperm cells decreased and the grain gradually entered the dehydration and drying stage and the maintenance respiration of the grains will consume part of the carbohydrates leading to a slight decrease in the dry matter accumulation of the grain bonnett and incoll 1993 sofield et al 1977 smc wet weight not only has a direct association with various biochemical and physiological changes but also provides a direct and precise method for estimating spike moisture at physiological maturity brooking 1990 kano et al 2008 xie et al 2015 previous studies have shown that the spike moisture content decreased progressively over time in a parabolic form and had a dramatic decline about one week before maturity moreover the grain water absorption and loss rates were also positively associated with final grain weight xie et al 2015 the present study also confirmed that the spike moisture content had a significant relationship with grain weight fig 8b in addition brookinget al 1990 found that ear moisture of maize at physiological maturity was also influenced by maize genotype however the present experiment did not involve the other winter wheat genotypes which thus needs further study in the future in the present study the w1f1 and w2f2 treatments produced grain yields of about 7530 9326 kg ha 1 during all three growing seasons of 2014 2017 which were higher than that of the other treatments however no significant difference was found between the w1f1 and w2f2 treatments p 0 05 table 5 and grain weight of w2f2 treatment was more stable than that of the w1f1 treatment in different years meanwhile the yield components including the effective spike number per m2 grain number per spike and grain number per m2 in the w2f2 treatment were more suitable for a higher yield formation jiang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017b compared with the w1f1 w1f2 and w2f1 treatment the w2f2 treatment had less investment in water or fertilizer which indicated that the w2f2 treatment was optimal for water and fertilizer management of drip fertigated winter wheat in this region 5 conclusions in the present study the maximum and average filling rates increased first and then decreased with the increase of water deficit the duration of grain filling increased with the increase of fertilization rate the grain weight of winter wheat increased and then decreased with the increase water or fertilizer levels the mild water deficit and appropriate fertilization improved the grain filling and increased the grain weight the maximum grain weight percentage of spike weight was about 80 under the moderate water and fertilizer supply conditions it tended to decrease in the first week before maturity and more obvious decline occurred with the increasing water stress the spike moisture content decreased gradually over time in a parabolic form and had a dramatic decline about one week before maturity the grain weight percentage of spike weight and spike moisture content had a significant relationship with grain weight fertilizer significantly influenced the appearance time of maximum filling rate and growth termination time particularly year significantly influenced the growth termination time the w2f2 treatment was more beneficial for winter wheat yield in general with higher effective spike number per m2 grain number per spike and grain number per m2 during all three seasons of 2014 2017 under drip fertigation this study can provide guidance for the selection of water and fertilizer management strategies of winter wheat under drip fertigation further studies may focus on investigating the sink source relationship grain nutrients dynamic transport process the

zd958 and wuke 2 wk2 and three n application rates of 86 172 and 258 kg n ha 1 with one control treatment in yangling on the loess plateau of china grain yield nitrate n residue nitrogen and rainwater use efficiency were evaluated in the 2013 2014 and 2015 maize growing seasons the results showed that the increasing application of n rate increased the soil nr but no difference in soil nr was observed between the two maize genotypes at harvest the linear plus plateau model could describe the relationship between n rates and gy the mean values of optimal n rate and maximum gy were 149 1 vs 107 7 kg ha 1 and 7061 3 vs 6449 8 kg ha 1 in zd958 and wk2 respectively nitrogen application can significantly improve wue compared to wk2 zd958 had higher wue with mean values of 25 5 and 23 2 kg ha 1 mm 1 in zd958 and wk2 respectively nitrogen use efficiency and crop n recovery efficiency decreased sharply as the n rate increased the mean values of nue were 9 7 and 8 3 kg kg 1 in zd958 and wk2 respectively further analysis shows that the green leaf area index and leaf n concentration were greater in zd958 compared with those of wk2 the findings suggest that the combination of n application

increased by 168 5 over the past four decades fao 2018 many factors have contributed to this achievement such as crop variety improvement fertilizer and irrigation application chen et al 2015 fan et al 2017 yang et al 2017 of these maize variety and nitrogen application are the main measures that have been widely used in rain fed agricultural systems nitrogen n is the most limiting nutrient for maize production its use is often considered essential to keep pace with the demand for food and to increase grain yield gy wang et al 2008 in order to achieve higher grain yield higher n rates than that the crop actually requires have been widely applied in fact gy does not always increase with increasing n application rates when the applied n rate exceeds an optimal rate gy is not increased with increase in n application rates chen et al 2015 excessive n application not only limits the increase in crop production but also decreases the n use efficiency nue dai et al 2015 yang et al 2017 the average nue across crops in china has decreased sharply from approximately 60 to 70 in the 1960s to approximately 20 to 30 in the 2010s zhang et al 2015a in addition to low nue excessive n application has led to the accumulation of excessive nitrate in the soil profile dai et al 2015 residual soil nitrate build up and the resulting leaching of nitrate into the ground water are two key negative consequences cui et al 2010 dai et al 2015 dai et al 2015 reported that the nitrate n residue nr values increased quadratically as the n rate increased with the average nr of 35 1 54 5 94 5 186 5 and 222 0 kg n ha 1 in 0 100 cm soil profile corresponding to the n application rates of 0 80 160 240 and 320 kg n ha 1 respectively thus determining the optimal n application rate is essential for maintaining a relatively higher gy and nue compared with excessive or insufficient n application along with a lower soil nr in addition to n availability the maize genotype is also a key factor determining the growth rates and grain yields of crops morphological and physiological indices of plant roots and leaves are two factors affecting gy and nue a n efficient genotype may have desirable traits such as high root length density mass and root surface areas worku et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 additionally the maintenance of green leaves is another important indicator of improved gy and nue

a pity that there has been limited research on the interaction effects of n rates and maize genotypes on rainwater use efficiency wue rainfall is the only source of water for agricultural production but the rainfall is often insufficient to meet the crop water requirements due to low rainwater use efficiency by crops in this region badr et al 2016 zheng et al 2018b therefore improving the rainwater use efficiency is highly desirable n application has been proved to be an effective way to improve wue in addition to understanding the responses of wue to stay green maize genotypes and the interaction effects of n rates and maize genotype on wue thus determining the optimal n rate along with an appropriate maize genotype can achieve the goal of increasing gy wue and nue under rain fed conditions the objectives of this study were thus to i quantify the soil nr at harvest in response to different n application rates and maize genotypes and to ii determine the interactive effects of n application rates and maize genotypes on gy nue and wue this study is supposed to provide useful guideline for increasing gy and resources use efficiency wue and nue on the loess plateau of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description field experiments were initiated in june 2013 and ended in october 2015 at the northwest a f university in yangling shaanxi province china latitude 34 18 n longitude 108 24 e 521 m altitude the site experiences a semi humid but drought prone climate with a mean annual rainfall of 550 mm the experimental soil is an alluvial soil fluvisols with ph 8 15 16

1 available k content meteorological data were collected from an automatic weather station located in the experimental field daily average maximum temperature minimum temperature and rainfall during the three growing seasons are presented in fig 1 seasonal rainfall was 211 0 mm 392 3 mm and 279 9 mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively severe summer droughts occurred approximately 45 d after sowing in the 2014 and 2015 seasons and the drought was more severe in 2014 than that in 2015 the amount of rainfall was low in 2013 but it was relatively evenly distributed throughout the growing season which was relatively favorable for the summer maize growth 2 2 experimental design the experiment was laid out in a split plot design with three replicates over the three growing seasons four n application rates were 0 86 172 and 258 kg n ha 1 designated as n0 n86 n172 and n258 and two maize genotypes were used maize was sown on june 14 june 18 and june 14 in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively and the planting density was 6000 plants ha 1 all experimental plots were 21 m2 and received 140 kg p2o5 ha 1 as diammonium phosphate and 90 kg k2o ha 1 as potassium chloride the n fertilizer was applied before sowing 30 and at the jointing stage 70 two maize genotypes of zhengdan 958 zd958 and wuke 2 wk2 were used in the experiment zd958 was developed by the henan academy of agricultural science henan province china in 1996 and it is a stay green genotype throughout the whole growing season chen et al 2015 wk2 was developed by the wuwei academy of agricultural science gansu province china in 2004 the plots were kept free of weeds insects and disease using chemicals based on local practices 2 3 sampling and measurements at the silking and maturity stages three plants from each plot were cut from the soil surface to determine the aboveground dry matter dm the plants were placed in a forced draft drying oven at 75 until constant weight and the final weight was recorded plant samples were then ground to pass through a 1 mm screen in a sample mill and mineralized using h2so4 h2o2 after which the plant n concentration was determined using the kjeldahl method horowitz 1970 soil samples were collected at 20 cm intervals until 1 m depth from each plot before planting and after harvest by using an auger each fresh soil sample was subdivided into two parts with one part for measuring soil water content and another for testing nitrate nitrogen no3 n water content of the soil samples was determined gravimetrically by measuring the weight followed by oven drying at 105 c for 12 h a total of 5 g soil was extracted using 50 ml of 1 mol l 1 kcl after shaking for 1 h li et al 2012 and was analyzed through the micro flow autoanalyzer3 aa3 seal company germany to determine soil no3 n for the la index three plants were tagged in each plot and la was measured at the seeding jointing silking filling and maturity stages the green la index glai was calculated as the total green la gla of the plants which was calculated by using the formula gla leaf length maximum leaf width 0 75 divided by the area occupied by those plants montgomery 1911 at maturity the grain yield of summer maize was determined through manual harvest of 6 plant samples in the center of the individual plots and grain yield was standardized to 14 moisture crop n recovery efficiency ren from n fertilizer was calculated using the following equation 1 ren 100 nf nc n where nf is the n uptake from the fertilized plot kg ha 1 nc is the n uptake from the control plot kg ha 1 nitrogen use

the total amount of n applied kg ha 1 rainwater use efficiency wue was calculated with eq 3 3 wue y et where y is the grain yield kg ha 1 et is the evapotranspiration during the whole growing season mm and was calculated by the soil water balance equation fan et al 2016 rathore et al 2017 2 4 statistical analysis all data were compiled and analyzed in excel 2010 the significance of differences in grain yield rainwater and n use efficiency nitrates n and other parameters among different genotype and nitrogen treatments were tested by anova spss inc chicago usa and the means were compared by least significant difference lsd tests at p 0 05 the relationship between n application rate and gy was simulated using the linear plus plateau model in the sas program sas institute 1993 3 results 3 1 grain yield gy fig 2 shows the gy of summer maize responding to different n application treatments the mean gy was 8619 7 4040 7 and 6164 0 kg ha 1 in the 2013 2014 and 2015 maize growing seasons respectively although the amount of rainfall was the lowest in 2013 its seasonal distribution was favorable to the maize growth which produced the greatest gy over the three seasons the lowest gy was observed in 2014 which can be attributed to the severe drought that occurred during the planting to jointing stage even though heavy rain occurred at the filling stage fig 1 the linear plus plateau model can well describe the relationship between n rate and gys during the three seasons the optimal n application rate required to achieve the maximum gy was 141 2 204 4 and 101 7 kg ha 1 for zd958 and 119 2 127 4 and 76 5 kg ha 1 for wk2 respectively the n application rate required for maximum gy was higher for zd958 149 1 kg n ha 1 than that for wk2 107 7 kg n ha 1 averaged across the years and n application rates zd958 had the higher gy compared with wk2 with values of 6483 0 and 6066 6 kg ha 1 respectively the genotype n and genotype year interactions were not significant for gy during any growing season which implies that the higher gy for zd958 was independent on the amount of n applied and year conditions table 1 3 2 change in soil water swc and evapotranspiration et the change in soil water and evapotranspiration during the grow season were significantly affected by the year and n rate table 1 increasing n application rates lowered swc and et but no significant difference was observed between the two maize genotypes the values of swc over the three growing seasons followed the order 2014 2015 2013 this difference was largely attributed to the heavy rainfall occurred in 2014 and 2015 the effects of genotype n and genotype year on et were significant suggesting that et was susceptible to environmental variations 3 3 rainwater use efficiency wue maize genotype year n application rate and all these two factor interactions affected wue table 1 excessive applied n did not increase the wue as expected zd958 exhibited greater wue values compared with wk2 having values of 25 2 kg ha 1 mm 1 v s 23 7 kg ha 1 mm 1 for wk2 the value of wue was highest in 2013 followed by 2015 and 2014 with values of 32 7 13 0 and 27 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively the effects of genotype n and genotype year on wue were also significant suggesting that the effect of maize genotype on wue varied significantly with year and n application rate 3 4 nitrogen use efficiency nue and crop n recovery efficiency ren the utilization of applied n by summer maize was evaluated in terms of nue and ren table 2 nue was significantly affected by the n rate genotype year and all these two and three factor interactions both nue and ren showed a decreasing trend as the n application rate increased with the mean values being 12 5 8 6 and 5 9 kg kg 1 in nue and being 24 9 24 2 and 20 4 in ren at 86 172 and 256 kg n ha 1 rates respectively compared to wk2 8 3 kg kg 1 zd958 9 7 kg kg 1 had higher nue while no significant difference was found in ren between the two genotypes averaged across the n application rates and years the mean nue value was 14 4 3 8 and 8 7 kg kg 1 in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively while the mean ren value was 14 5 3 8 and 8 7 respectively 3 5 n uptake n uptake at both the silking and maturity stages were significantly affected by the maize genotype n rate year and genotype year interaction table 2 the amount of n uptake in zd958 was significantly higher than that in wk2 at both the silking and maturity stages with mean values of 68 9 and 62 9 kg ha 1 at the silking stage and 102 5 and 92 7 kg ha 1 at the maturity stage respectively the genotype year interaction significantly affected the n uptake at the silking and maturity stages indicating that the effect of genotype on n uptake varied among different years increasing n rates increased the amount of n uptake with mean values of 51 1 61 2 71 9 and 79 3 kg ha 1 at the silking stage and 68 8 90 2 110 2 and 121 3 kg ha 1 at the maturity stage at 0 86 172 and 256 kg n ha 1 rates respectively the highest n uptake was obtained in 2013 followed by 2014 and 2015 the mean n uptake value at the silking stage was 75 5 73 9 and 48 3 kg ha 1 in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively while the corresponding value at the maturity stage was 122 3 107 3 and 63 3 kg ha 1 respectively 3 6 soil nitrate n residue nr at harvest averaged between the two maize genotypes the soil nr in the 0 100 cm soil layer at harvest increased with increasing n application rates in 2013 2014 and 2015 fig 3 a no difference in the soil nr was found between 2013 and 2014 but it increased sharply in 2015 compared with that in 2013 and 2014 there are two possible reasons for this phenomenon firstly this was a stationary field experiment so the nr increased as the number of planting years increased secondly heavy rainfall occurred in the early september of 2014 which may have resulted in greater nr leaching and less nr was left in the soil however in 2015 the rainfall amount was normal in the late season but a heavy summer drought occurred at the earlier stages thus n uptake was limited and no obvious nr leaching took place which resulted in a sharp increase in the soil nr during the 2015 maize growing season averaged over n application rates no difference in soil nr was observed between zd958 and wk2 in the three experiment years fig 3b indicating that nr was not affected by the experimental year n rate or maize genotype 3 7 green leaf area index glai there were two types of changes in the glai during the three growing stages fig 4 in the 2013 and 2015 maize growing seasons the changes in glai followed the single peak trend while they fitted the linear plus plateau model in 2014 this can be due to that the plants reached physiological maturity in 2013 and 2015 but not in 2014 the difference also existed between the two maize genotypes with zd958 having a greater glai than wk2 and the difference mainly occurred after the silking stage 3 8 leaf n concentration the year n rate and maize genotype significantly affected the maize leaf n concentration at harvest fig 5 the mean leaf n concentration was 12 0 24 8 and 11 3 g kg 1 in the 2013 2014 and 2015 growing seasons respectively this can be due to that the maize experienced a severe summer drought at earlier growth stages and heavy rainfall occurred at later growth stages in 2014 which thus resulted in the immaturity of maize and a high leaf n concentration at harvest averaged among n rates and years the mean value of the leaf n concentration was greater for zd958 16 4 g kg 1 than that for wk2 15 7 g kg 1 the leaf n concentration increased as the n rate increased and the mean value averaged among years and genotypes was 13 3 14 9 17 2 and 18 8 g kg 1 corresponding to 0 86 172 and 258 n application rates respectively 4 discussion stay green maize genotypes generally contribute to the increases in gy pommel et al 2006 echarte et al 2008 chen et al 2015 stay green maize genotypes often have higher glai and chlorophyll contents in leaves compared with senescent genotypes the genotypes used in the present study also revealed these characteristics with zd958 having a greater glai than wk2 during most growing season and the genotypes differed mainly from the silking to maturity stages fig 4 a greater glai means a greater chlorophyll content and a greater leaf n concentration chen et al 2014 2015 in the present study zd958 had a greater leaf n concentration than wk2 at harvest with values of 16 4 g kg 1 and 15 7 g kg 1 for zd958 and wk2 respectively n application significantly increased the glai and leaf n concentrations in all three years figs 4 and 5 and the leaf n concentration was lower in 2013 and 2015 compared with that in 2014 probably because the rainfall amount was significant lower at the early stages and higher at the later stages in 2014 resulting in immature maize differences in n uptake may explain the differences in glai and leaf n concentrations n uptake is greater in stay green maize genotypes compared with senescent genotypes particularly during the post silking period pommel et al 2006 echarte et al 2008 this is consistent with the present study in which the mean annual n uptake of zd958 was 102 5 kg ha 1 and that was 92 7 kg ha 1 for wk2 table 2 quemada and gabriel 2016 have reported that crop water deficits diminished n uptakes consistent with the previous study large differences existed in n uptake over the three experimental years in our study the amount of n applied in excess of plant uptake is prone to be lost either by leaching or gaseous emission and this phenomenon intensifies as the n rate increases dai et al 2015 in our study even though the total amount of n uptake by zd958 was greater than that of wk2 no difference in the soil nitrate at harvest was found between the two genotypes which is likely the result of the great variability in soil conditions n applications in excess of crop demand resulted in large amounts of nitrate cui et al 2010 dai et al 2015 as in previous studies the nr in the 0 100 cm soil layer increased with the increasing n application rate indicating that the optimal n application rate is necessary chen et al 2014 reported that n application increased the net photosynthetic rate and stay green genotypes had higher net photosynthetic rates compared with senescent genotypes a higher net photosynthetic rate means a greater dry matter accumulation as well as greater gy in our study the mean annual gy of zd958 was 6483 0 kg ha 1 while that was 6066 6 kg ha 1 for wk2 table 1 the genotype year and genotype n effect on gy were not significant indicating the higher gy capability of zd958 was independent of planting year and n application rate n application can significantly increase crop production yan et al 2014 yang et al 2017 here the model linear plus plateau well described the relationship between n rate and gy and the optimal n rate for the maximum gy varied among the three years with values of 130 2 165 9 and 89 1 kg ha 1 in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively this can be due to the fact that rain fed agriculture is more easily affected by drought and n stimulation effects change significantly under various rainfall conditions and lowers the optimal n rate huang et al 2003 in addition to gy increasing wue and nue values is another goal of rain fed agriculture previous studies have showed that the evapotranspiration levels with low n treatments were lower than those under high n treatments and that wue increased as the n rate increased hunsaker et al 2000 fan et al 2005 wang et al 2018 however the increasing n rate lowered the swc and et in this study the n treatment were fixed in the same plot during the three years in this study high nitrogen treatment of the previous crop resulted in lower soil moisture content before planting of summer maize meanwhile heavy rainfall occurred at the late grain filling stages resulted in no obvious difference of soil moisture content among different n treatments in 2014 and 2015 fig 1 therefore the swc was lower at 172 and 256 kg n ha 1 rates than that at 0 and 86 kg n ha 1 rates in this study no significant difference was observed in the swc between zd958 and wk2 while the wue was higher for zd958 over wk2 this can be largely attributed to the higher gy obtained for zd958 excessive n application can significantly decrease the nue dai et al 2015 yang et al 2017 in the present study both nue and ren decreased as the n application rate increased table 2 therefore higher nitrogen utilization efficiency can be obtained based on the appropriate n application rate under the maximum gy additionally the analysis of variance indicated that the maize genotype zd958 had a higher n use capability compared with the genotype wk2 zd958 had higher glai and leaf n concentrations so more dry matter can be accumulated and more nitrogen can be absorbed from the soil ma and dwyer 1998 echarte et al 2008 in summary choosing a stay green maize genotype zd958 can obtain the greatest gy and improve the wue and nue in comparison with senescent genotype wk2 5 conclusion applying n increased n uptake and leaf n concentration at harvest and the maize genotype zd958 had a higher n uptake capability and leaf n concentration compared with the maize genotype wk2 soil nitrate increased with the increasing n application rate and the number of planting years but no significant difference was found between the two maize genotypes at harvest greater gy was achieved for zd958 compared with wk2 with mean values of 6483 0 and 6066 6 kg ha 1 respectively the obtained optimal n application rate was 149 1 and 107 7 kg ha 1 for zd958 and wk2 respectively n fertilization increased the wue but lowered the nue and ren with maize genotype zd958 having greater nue and wue values compared with wk2 overall choosing the maize genotype of zd958 resulted in greater gy wue and nue values indeed choosing genotypes with high glai and leaf n concentration is useful to achieve higher maize yield and increase the wue and nue the results will help researchers and policy makers to develop strategies for optimizing crop production n and water use efficiency in rain fed areas acknowledgments we are grateful for the financial support from the national natural science foundation of

interaction effects of n rates and maize genotype on wue thus determining the optimal n rate along with an appropriate maize genotype can achieve the goal of increasing gy wue and nue under rain fed conditions the objectives of this study were thus to i quantify the soil nr at harvest in response to different n application rates and maize genotypes and to ii determine the interactive effects of n application rates and maize genotypes on gy nue and wue this study is supposed to provide useful guideline for increasing gy and resources use efficiency wue and nue on the loess plateau of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description field experiments were initiated in june 2013 and ended in october 2015 at the northwest a f university in yangling shaanxi province china latitude 34 18 n longitude 108 24 e 521 m altitude the site experiences a semi humid but drought prone climate with a mean annual rainfall of 550 mm the experimental soil is an alluvial soil fluvisols with ph 8 15 16 9 g kg 1 organic matter content 0 98 g kg 1 total n content 0 76 g kg 1 total p content 14 9 g kg 1 total k content 69 8 mg kg 1 available n content 10 07 mg kg 1 available p content and 163 30 mg kg 1 available k content meteorological data were collected from an automatic weather station located in the experimental field daily average maximum temperature minimum temperature and rainfall during the three growing seasons are presented in fig 1 seasonal rainfall was 211 0 mm 392 3 mm and 279 9 mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively severe summer droughts occurred approximately 45 d after sowing in the 2014 and 2015 seasons and the drought was more severe in 2014 than that in 2015 the amount of rainfall was low in 2013 but it was relatively evenly distributed throughout the growing season which was relatively favorable for the summer maize growth 2 2 experimental design the experiment was laid out in a split plot design with three replicates over the three growing seasons four n application rates were 0 86 172 and 258 kg n ha 1 designated as n0 n86 n172 and n258 and two maize genotypes were used maize was sown on june 14 june 18 and june 14 in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively and the planting density was 6000 plants ha 1 all experimental plots were 21 m2 and received 140 kg p2o5 ha 1 as diammonium phosphate and 90 kg k2o ha 1 as potassium chloride the n fertilizer was applied before sowing 30 and at the jointing stage 70 two maize genotypes of zhengdan 958 zd958 and wuke 2 wk2 were used in the experiment zd958 was developed by the henan academy of agricultural science henan province china in 1996 and it is a stay green genotype throughout the whole growing season chen et al 2015 wk2 was developed by the wuwei academy of agricultural science gansu province china in 2004 the plots were kept free of weeds insects and disease using chemicals based on local practices 2 3 sampling and measurements at the silking and maturity stages three plants from each plot were cut from the soil surface to determine the aboveground dry matter dm the plants were placed in a forced draft drying oven at 75 until constant weight and the final weight was recorded plant samples were then ground to pass through a 1 mm screen in a sample mill and mineralized using h2so4 h2o2 after which the plant n concentration was determined using the kjeldahl method horowitz 1970 soil samples were collected at 20 cm intervals until 1 m depth from each plot before planting and after harvest by using an auger each fresh soil sample was subdivided into two parts with one part for measuring soil water content and another for testing nitrate nitrogen no3 n water content of the soil samples was determined gravimetrically by measuring the weight followed by oven drying at 105 c for 12 h a total of 5 g soil was extracted using 50 ml of 1 mol l 1 kcl after shaking for 1 h li et al 2012 and was analyzed through the micro flow autoanalyzer3 aa3 seal company germany to determine soil no3 n for the la index three plants were tagged in each plot and la was measured at the seeding jointing silking filling and maturity stages the green la index glai was calculated as the total green la gla of the plants which was calculated by using the formula gla leaf length maximum leaf width 0 75 divided by the area occupied by those plants montgomery 1911 at maturity the grain yield of summer maize was determined through manual harvest of 6 plant samples in the center of the individual plots and grain yield was standardized to 14 moisture crop n recovery efficiency ren from n fertilizer was calculated using the following equation 1 ren 100 nf nc n where nf is the n uptake from the fertilized plot kg ha 1 nc is the n uptake from the control plot kg ha 1 nitrogen use efficiency nue was calculated using the following equation badr et al 2016 2 nue yt y0 n where yt is the total yield in the fertilized plot kg ha 1 y0 is the total yield in the control plot and n is the total amount of n applied kg ha 1 rainwater use efficiency wue was calculated with eq 3 3 wue y et where y is the grain yield kg ha 1 et is the evapotranspiration during the whole growing season mm and was calculated by the soil water balance equation fan et al 2016 rathore et al 2017 2 4 statistical analysis all data were compiled and analyzed in excel 2010 the significance of differences in grain yield rainwater and n use efficiency nitrates n and other parameters among different genotype and nitrogen treatments were tested by anova spss inc chicago usa and the means were compared by least significant difference lsd tests at p 0 05 the relationship between n application rate and gy was simulated using the linear plus plateau model in the sas program sas institute 1993 3 results 3 1 grain yield gy fig 2 shows the gy of summer maize responding to different n application treatments the mean gy was 8619 7 4040 7 and 6164 0 kg ha 1 in the 2013 2014 and 2015 maize growing seasons respectively although the amount of rainfall was the lowest in 2013 its seasonal distribution was favorable to the maize growth which produced the greatest gy over the three seasons the lowest gy was observed in 2014 which can be attributed to the severe drought that occurred during the planting to jointing stage even though heavy rain occurred at the filling stage fig 1 the linear plus plateau model can well describe the relationship between n rate and gys during the three seasons the optimal n application rate required to achieve the maximum gy was 141 2 204 4 and 101 7 kg ha 1 for zd958 and 119 2 127 4 and 76 5 kg ha 1 for wk2 respectively the n application rate required for maximum gy was higher for zd958 149 1 kg n ha 1 than that for wk2 107 7 kg n ha 1 averaged across the years and n application rates zd958 had the higher gy compared with wk2 with values of 6483 0 and 6066 6 kg ha 1 respectively the genotype n and genotype year interactions were not significant for gy during any growing season which implies that the higher gy for zd958 was independent on the amount of n applied and year conditions table 1 3 2 change in soil water swc and evapotranspiration et the change in soil water and evapotranspiration during the grow season were significantly affected by the year and n rate table 1 increasing n application rates lowered swc and et but no significant difference was observed between the two maize genotypes the values of swc over the three growing seasons followed the order 2014 2015 2013 this difference was largely attributed to the heavy rainfall occurred in 2014 and 2015 the effects of genotype n and genotype year on et were significant suggesting that et was susceptible to environmental variations 3 3 rainwater use efficiency wue maize genotype year n application rate and all these two factor interactions affected wue table 1 excessive applied n did not increase the wue as expected zd958 exhibited greater wue values compared with wk2 having values of 25 2 kg ha 1 mm 1 v s 23 7 kg ha 1 mm 1 for wk2 the value of wue was highest in 2013 followed by 2015 and 2014 with values of 32 7 13 0 and 27 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively the effects of genotype n and genotype year on wue were also significant suggesting that the effect of maize genotype on wue varied significantly with year and n application rate 3 4 nitrogen use efficiency nue and crop n recovery efficiency ren the utilization of applied n by summer maize was evaluated in terms of nue and ren table 2 nue was significantly affected by the n rate genotype year and all these two and three factor interactions both nue and ren showed a decreasing trend as the n application rate increased with the mean values being 12 5 8 6 and 5 9 kg kg 1 in nue and being 24 9 24 2 and 20 4 in ren at 86 172 and 256 kg n ha 1 rates respectively compared to wk2 8 3 kg kg 1 zd958 9 7 kg kg 1 had higher nue while no significant difference was found in ren between the two genotypes averaged across the n application rates and years the mean nue value was 14 4 3 8 and 8 7 kg kg 1 in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively while the mean ren value was 14 5 3 8 and 8 7 respectively 3 5 n uptake n uptake at both the silking and maturity stages were significantly affected by the maize genotype n rate year and genotype year interaction table 2 the amount of n uptake in zd958 was significantly higher than that in wk2 at both the silking and maturity stages with mean values of 68 9 and 62 9 kg ha 1 at the silking stage and 102 5 and 92 7 kg ha 1 at the maturity stage respectively the genotype year interaction significantly affected the n uptake at the silking and maturity stages indicating that the effect of genotype on n uptake varied among different years increasing n rates increased the amount of n uptake with mean values of 51 1 61 2 71 9 and 79 3 kg ha 1 at the silking stage and 68 8 90 2 110 2 and 121 3 kg ha 1 at the maturity stage at 0 86 172 and 256 kg n ha 1 rates respectively the highest n uptake was obtained in 2013 followed by 2014 and 2015 the mean n uptake value at the silking stage was 75 5 73 9 and 48 3 kg ha 1 in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively while the corresponding value at the maturity stage was 122 3 107 3 and 63 3 kg ha 1 respectively 3 6 soil nitrate n residue nr at harvest averaged between the two maize genotypes the soil nr in the 0 100 cm soil layer at harvest increased with increasing n application rates in 2013 2014 and 2015 fig 3 a no difference in the soil nr was found between 2013 and 2014 but it increased sharply in 2015 compared with that in 2013 and 2014 there are two possible reasons for this phenomenon firstly this was a stationary field experiment so the nr increased as the number of planting years increased secondly heavy rainfall occurred in the early september of 2014 which may have resulted in greater nr leaching and less nr was left in the soil however in 2015 the rainfall amount was normal in the late season but a heavy summer drought occurred at the earlier stages thus n uptake was limited and no obvious nr leaching took place which resulted in a sharp increase in the soil nr during the 2015 maize growing season averaged over n application rates no difference in soil nr was observed between zd958 and wk2 in the three experiment years fig 3b indicating that nr was not affected by the experimental year n rate or maize genotype 3 7 green leaf area index glai there were two types of changes in the glai during the three growing stages fig 4 in the 2013 and 2015 maize growing seasons the changes in glai followed the single peak trend while they fitted the linear plus plateau model in 2014 this can be due to that the plants reached physiological maturity in 2013 and 2015 but not in 2014 the difference also existed between the two maize genotypes with zd958 having a greater glai than wk2 and the difference mainly occurred after the silking stage 3 8 leaf n concentration the year n rate and maize genotype significantly affected the maize leaf n concentration at harvest fig 5 the mean leaf n concentration was 12 0 24 8 and 11 3 g kg 1 in the 2013 2014 and 2015 growing seasons respectively this can be due to that the maize experienced a severe summer drought at earlier growth stages and heavy rainfall occurred at later growth stages in 2014 which thus resulted in the immaturity of maize and a high leaf n concentration at harvest averaged among n rates and years the mean value of the leaf n concentration was greater for zd958 16 4 g kg 1 than that for wk2 15 7 g kg 1 the leaf n concentration increased as the n rate increased and the mean value averaged among years and genotypes was 13 3 14 9 17 2 and 18 8 g kg 1 corresponding to 0 86 172 and 258 n application rates respectively 4 discussion stay green maize genotypes generally contribute to the increases in gy pommel et al 2006 echarte et al 2008 chen et al 2015 stay green maize genotypes often have higher glai and chlorophyll contents in leaves compared with senescent genotypes the genotypes used in the present study also revealed these characteristics with zd958 having a greater glai than wk2 during most growing season and the genotypes differed mainly from the silking to maturity stages fig 4 a greater glai means a greater chlorophyll content and a greater leaf n concentration chen et al 2014 2015 in the present study zd958 had a greater leaf n concentration than wk2 at harvest with values of 16 4 g kg 1 and 15 7 g kg 1 for zd958 and wk2 respectively n application significantly increased the glai and leaf n concentrations in all three years figs 4 and 5 and the leaf n concentration was lower in 2013 and 2015 compared with that in 2014 probably because the rainfall amount was significant lower at the early stages and higher at the later stages in 2014 resulting in immature maize differences in n uptake may explain the differences in glai and leaf n concentrations n uptake is greater in stay green maize genotypes compared with senescent genotypes particularly during the post silking period pommel et al 2006 echarte et al 2008 this is consistent with the present study in which the mean annual n uptake of zd958 was 102 5 kg ha 1 and that was 92 7 kg ha 1 for wk2 table 2 quemada and gabriel 2016 have reported that crop water deficits diminished n uptakes consistent with the previous study large differences existed in n uptake over the three experimental years in our study the amount of n applied in excess of plant uptake is prone to be lost either by leaching or gaseous emission and this phenomenon intensifies as the n rate increases dai et al 2015 in our study even though the total amount of n uptake by zd958 was greater than that of wk2 no difference in the soil nitrate at harvest was found between the two genotypes which is likely the result of the great variability in soil conditions n applications in excess of crop demand resulted in large amounts of nitrate cui et al 2010 dai et al 2015 as in previous studies the nr in the 0 100 cm soil layer increased with the increasing n application rate indicating that the optimal n application rate is necessary chen et al 2014 reported that n application increased the net photosynthetic rate and stay green genotypes had higher net photosynthetic rates compared with senescent genotypes a higher net photosynthetic rate means a greater dry matter accumulation as well as greater gy in our study the mean annual gy of zd958 was 6483 0 kg ha 1 while that was 6066 6 kg ha 1 for wk2 table 1 the genotype year and genotype n effect on gy were not significant indicating the higher gy capability of zd958 was independent of planting year and n application rate n application can significantly increase crop production yan et al 2014 yang et al 2017 here the model linear plus plateau well described the relationship between n rate and gy and the optimal n rate for the maximum gy varied among the three years with values of 130 2 165 9 and 89 1 kg ha 1 in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively this can be due to the fact that rain fed agriculture is more easily affected by drought and n stimulation effects change significantly under various rainfall conditions and lowers the optimal n rate huang et al 2003 in addition to gy increasing wue and nue values is another goal of rain fed agriculture previous studies have showed that the evapotranspiration levels with low n treatments were lower than those under high n treatments and that wue increased as the n rate increased hunsaker et al 2000 fan et al 2005 wang et al 2018 however the increasing n rate lowered the swc and et in this study the n treatment were fixed in the same plot during the three years in this study high nitrogen treatment of the previous crop resulted in lower soil moisture content before planting of summer maize meanwhile heavy rainfall occurred at the late grain filling stages resulted in no obvious difference of soil moisture content among different n treatments in 2014 and 2015 fig 1 therefore the swc was lower at 172 and 256 kg n ha 1 rates than that at 0 and 86 kg n ha 1 rates in this study no significant difference was observed in the swc between zd958 and wk2 while the wue was higher for zd958 over wk2 this can be largely attributed to the higher gy obtained for zd958 excessive n application can significantly decrease the nue dai et al 2015 yang et al 2017 in the present study both nue and ren decreased as the n application rate increased table 2 therefore higher nitrogen utilization efficiency can be obtained based on the appropriate n application rate under the maximum gy additionally the analysis of variance indicated that the maize genotype zd958 had a higher n use capability compared with the genotype wk2 zd958 had higher glai and leaf n concentrations so more dry matter can be accumulated and more nitrogen can be absorbed from the soil ma and dwyer 1998 echarte et al 2008 in summary choosing a stay green maize genotype zd958 can obtain the greatest gy and improve the wue and nue in comparison with senescent genotype wk2 5 conclusion applying n increased n uptake and leaf n concentration at harvest and the maize genotype zd958 had a higher n uptake capability and leaf n concentration compared with the maize genotype wk2 soil nitrate increased with the increasing n application rate and the number of planting years but no significant difference was found between the two maize genotypes at harvest greater gy was achieved for zd958 compared with wk2 with mean values of 6483 0 and 6066 6 kg ha 1 respectively the obtained optimal n application rate was 149 1 and 107 7 kg ha 1 for zd958 and wk2 respectively n fertilization increased the wue but lowered the nue and ren with maize genotype zd958 having greater nue and wue values compared with wk2 overall choosing the maize genotype of zd958 resulted in greater gy wue and nue values indeed choosing genotypes with high glai and leaf n concentration is useful to achieve higher maize yield and increase the wue and nue the results will help researchers and policy makers to develop strategies for optimizing crop production n and water use efficiency in rain fed areas acknowledgments we are grateful for the financial support from the national natural science foundation of

11239,the awareness of sediment and nutrient loss from non point sources are of increasing environmental concern as measures to reduce point source inputs to surface waters have been introduced mitigation efforts to reduce loss of particles and nutrients from agriculture in norway and other countries have mainly focused on surface runoff whereas sub surface drainage has received little attention however research has shown that the sub surface field drains are transporting both sediment and nutrients rapidly to the watercourses despite these established facts there has been little development of measures to reduce these losses this article describes how lightweight aggregates lwa leca can mitigate some of the environmental challenges connected to sub surface field drains a field experimental project was performed to assess the effects on drainage water quality hydrological performance and functionality of drainage systems based on lightweight aggregates compared to traditional pipe drains registrations of the performance of the systems were done in two separate periods 1992 1993 and 1999 2000 after 2000 no measurement programme has run the functionality of the drainage systems was registered in connection to ordinary farming activity in 1999 2000 lwa drains showed particularly good performance with regard to reducing the content of phosphorus 40 90 reduction in total p the drainage water from the lwa drains contained less than half the amount of suspended solids compared to traditional pipe drains the results from 1993 showed no significant difference between lwa drains and pipe drains with respect to nitrogen the results from 1999 2000 showed higher loss of nitrogen through pipe drains with no envelope compared to all other systems lwa drains may be particularly useful in reducing particles and nutrient loads from cultivated flat drained areas adjacent to environmentally sensitive and ecologically important water ecosystems further investigations are recommended to optimise the design of lwa drains keywords field drainage sediment loss phosphorus loss non point source preferential flow 1 introduction transport of soil particles and dissolved nutrients from agricultural fields to surface water is one of the most important factors affecting the water quality in scandinavian water systems gustavsson et al 1992 rekolainen et al 1996 other studies are also showing that agriculture is a major contributor to the load of nutrients in rivers and other water bodies in industrialised countries carpenter et al 1998 fisher et al 2000 lenat and crawford 1994 ulÃ©n and folster 2007 an overenrichment of nutrients in a water body leads to eutrophication phosphorus is an essential input in all bio productions and is generally the limiting element for biological growth in fresh water systems shindler 1977 sharpley et al 1994 sundareshwar et al 2003 in addition to increased growth of aquatic weeds and algae that when decomposed can consume most of the available oxygen in the water leading to suffocation of e g fish eutrophication can also lead to production of toxic compounds e g h2s and growth of toxic algae e g cyanobacteria that kills other life in the water carpenter et al 1969 gray 1992 kotak et al 1993 eutrophication produces an undesirable water quality and makes the water unsuitable for use in industry and agriculture and for other humane use including recreation and consumption climate change is expected to lead to increased annual precipitation it is also expected an increase in the number of rain incidents with high intensity in scandinavia and other northern european countries alfnes and fÃ¸rlan 2006 hanssen bauer et al 2017 ipcc 2014 higher average temperature may lead to an increased number of freezing and thawing cycles during winter these changes may cause increased runoff and erosion causing increased loss of soil and phosphorus these changes may require further measures to reduce these losses mitigation efforts to reduce loss of particles and nutrients from agriculture in norway and other countries have mainly focused on surface runoff the most common methods have been reduced tillage vegetation filter strips grass covered overland flow courses for water and detention ponds eg schoumans et al 2014 reduced use of phosphorus fertiliser have also been recommended however despite these efforts the national norwegian environmental monitoring show no clear improvement of water quality in agricultural catchments over the last years beckmann et al 2017 despite similar efforts within the eu the situation is very much the same regarding water quality eea 2017 in norway approximately 60 about 600 000 ha of the agricultural land is artificially drained bjerkholt 2002 in north western european countries typically between 30 and 90 of the agricultural land is artificially drained brown and van beinum 2009 several norwegian studies have shown that considerable amounts of particles phosphorous and nitrogen are lost through subsurface drainage systems kvÃ¦rner 1991 lundekvam 1993 Ã¸ygarden et al 1996 1997 studies in other countries has also shown the significance of subsurface drains as conveyers of sediments and nutrients from the field to the watercourse chapman et al 2001 2005 foster et al 2003 grant et al 1996 hooda et al 1999 kronvang1997

long term field experiments in norway and reported that 50 90 of the total runoff from a field is directed through the drainpipes the loss of ss through the drainpipes was in the range of 30 4000 kg ha yr representing 5 95 of the total loss the loss of phosphorus was in the range of 0 2 5 kg ha yr representing 10 90 of the total loss the loss of nitrogen through the drainpipes was in the range of 17 48 kg ha yr representing 70 90 of the total loss of nitrogen all losses depending on soil type land levelling type of crop precipitation intensity management practice and other factors the increasing awareness of the importance of nutrient loss in drainage outflow has brought the need to reduce nutrient via drainage into focus in scandinavia ulÃ©n and folster 2007 and ulÃ©n et al 2010 has shown that there is a potential for reducing p losses from agricultural fields by focusing more on the function and design of the artificial drainage system especially for clay and silt soils with a risk of high p loss and in recent experiments use of a ash material as drain backfill mcdowell et al 2008 and fe coated sand enveloping pipe drain groenenberg et al 2013 have been tested as a mean of reducing p loss from drainage water based on the idea that new types of agricultural drainage filters might reduce p losses from agricultural tiles several recent laboratory studies have looked at hydrophysical and p retention processes and properties of potential new filter materials including leca e g canga et al 2016a 2016b replacing the traditional drainpipe and filter system with leca as a conveying and filtering material has been given little attention previous laboratory experiments have shown that lightweight aggregates lwa leca a lightweight expanded clay aggregate with a silicate matrix produced from pure clay have a good ability to remove phosphorus from water and also perform well as a filtering material holding back fine soil particles adam et al 2007 jenssen et al 1991 the laboratory results also indicated an acceptable hydraulic conductivity for drainage purpose based on the results from the laboratory tests and the need to reduce the losses of particles and nutrients through agricultural drainage systems a full scale field experimental project was initiated to assess the effects on drainage water quality and hydrological performance of drainage systems based on lwa in comparison to traditional drainpipes systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 general description of the research drainage field a field experiment was established in 1991 at grimsrud farm in souteastern norway 43 km se of oslo latitude 59 36Ê¹50Êº n longitude 11 59Ê¹56Êº e the criteria for selection of the site were i the soil and climate should be typical for the region and ii previous artificially drains that might influence drainage outflow should not occur annual mean temperature in the area is 5 7 c table 1 average annual precipitation is 829 mm table 2 average potential evapotranspiration in different months for the period 1993 1995 calculated by penman s formula with metrological data from norwegian university of life sciences faculty of science and technology at Ã¥s 12 km nw of grimsrud was january 0 09 mm day february 0 18 mm day march 0 68 mm day april 1 70 mm day may 2 81 mm day june 3 37 mm d july 3 34 mm d august 2 52 mm day september 1 35 mm day october 0 46 mm day november 0 17 mm day december 0 08 mm day the hydrological regime has a seasonal cycle with discharge minimums in summer and winter and maximums during spring due to snowmelt runoff and autumn due to reduced evapotranspiration the field has a gentle slope towards northwest and are separated from the surroundings by cut off ditches the field is situated in an area with marine clays deposited after the last ice age and is located 115 m above mean sea level the soil at the experimental field was surveyed in 1993 by jordregisterinstituttet today nibio as a soil type with silty clay loam in the plough layer increasing clay content with depth and classified as an epistagnic albeluvisol in the wrb soil classification system wrb 2014 the hydraulic conductivity of the soil was measured in situ with a constant head infiltrometer double ring with a mariotte tube after the drainage systems were installed the measurements were carried out half way between the drainage pipe lwa for the topsoil 0 0 3 m and for the subsoil 0 3 0 6 m the hydraulic conductivity k values were on average 0 27 m d in the top layer and 0 026 m d in the subsoil for both soil layers there were a 20 fold variation from the smallest to the largest value this shows that there is a considerable system of macropores that can contribute to both vertical and horizontal transport of the drainage water towards the subsurface drainage system to further characterise the soil x ray computed tomography ct scan was used the scannings were done on a siemens somaton 2 on soil monoliths from the topsoil between and above the drains by the method of jenssen and heyerdahl 1988 in addition to these monoliths from the subsoil were taken out along a drain with approximately halve the monolith with undisturbed subsoil and the rest with backfill material fig 1 the diameter of the soil monoliths were 20 25 cm the pixel size for the ct scans was 1 mm 1 mm and the slice thickness was 4 mm the variation of grey tone in the ct scans tomograms is a direct expression of density variations the variation in ct values in the dotted lines through the tomograms are shown as graphs solid white lines the lighter the colour in the tomograms the denser the material the variation in density is also shown as a graph on the photo solid white line the darker areas with low ct values represents zones with pores within tomogram pixels the pores could contain water or air which have ct values of 0 and 1000 respectively the scan tomograms of the topsoil show that there was a mixture of high and low density zones corresponding to an open porous structure of the soil the undisturbed subsoil was characterised by a dense matrix with higher ct values than in the top layer in the drainage ditch backfill the density values were higher than in the plough layer but lower than in the undisturbed subsoil localised zones with low ct values representing macropore zones were also present the field had previously been forest mainly spruce the timber was logged and the land cleared a few years before the start up of the experiment oats were grown on the field from 1992 the first year of cropping until 1998 using standard methods of tillage deep ploughing and harrowing before sowing from 1999 2005 grass for hay production was grown on the field from 2006 on various types of small grain have been grown in a crop rotation system as for the rest of the farm 2 2 description of the drainage system the field drainage system consists of two main types the lwa system and pipe drain system in fig 2 the layout of the system is shown each of the five drain types has a total length of 200 m draining a field area of 0 12 ha that is also assumed to represent the catchment of the drain type the field drainage base is 80 cm and the spacing is 6 m the lwa systems comprised of three slightly different types figs 3 5 the cross section of the lwa layer was constructed to give a pore volume that gave approximately the same transport capacity as the system with the drainage pipe all three systems were basically 80 cm deep ditches filled at the bottom with a 40 cm thick layer of lwa and backfilled with the local soil on top type a was the main construction types b and c are modifications of type a in type b a synthetic fabric composition 100 polypropylene non woven weight 135 0 g m2 thickness 1 0 mm characteristic opening size 100 0 Î¼m was placed on top of the lwa before backfilling this to prevent smaller particles from entering the lwa for type c the ditch was enlarged the last 2 5 m towards the outlet with a basin 60 cm by 80 cm that was filled with lwa the idÃ©e of making this basin was to create anaerobic conditions that could encourage denitrification before installation samples of the lwa were taken and the particle size distribution was analysed using a nested column of sieves with wire mesh the size of the lwa particles were less than 4 mm 20 was smaller than 1 mm and less than 5 percent of the particles was smaller than 0 2 mm kvÃ¦rner et al 1993 the hydraulic conductivity of the lwa has been determined to 1200 m day and p adsorption to 4 7 kg p m3 dry material jenssen et al 1991 the initial ph of the lwa material is high 11 4 jensen et al 1991 the water left the lwa ditches through a 2 5 m long 70 0 mm diameter perforated pipe and was transported to a hut were the instruments were kept and where samples was taken to prevent water from shortcutting the system bentonite was used to seal of the end of the ditch where the non perforated collector pipe was entering there were two types of pipe drains installed at the same drainage base and with the same spacing as the lwa systems the first pipe drain system installed was a standard pipe drain system using a 50 0 mm i d corrugated polyethylene pe pipe with an envelope of wood shavings the other pipe drain system installed was the same type of pipe as the first but without an envelope the main purpose for installing the pipe drain system was to enable a comparison of the lwa systems to a standard drainage system the pipe drain without envelope made it possible to observe the effects an envelope had on the retention of soil particles in standard pipe drain systems the systems were all installed using a backdigger the dominating method at the time the costs of installation and materials were almost similar for the different systems 2 3 instrumentation and parameters measured the water from each drainage type was lead in separate collector pipes non perforated to an instrument hut in the hut run off was measured and water sampled for quality analysis run off was measured continuously by tipping buckets with magnetic impulse counters and the registrations were logged using a delta logger dl2e mechanical counters were also installed as back ups for the electronic the water quality samples were collected by means of a volume proportional sampling technique every time the buckets tipped a small portion of the water was lead to sampling tanks the water from these tanks was regularly taken to the laboratory for analysis of suspended solids ss total p po4 p total n no3 n nh4 n ph selected samples were also withdrawn directly from each outlet for analysis of instantaneous values in the 1999 2000 season analysis for po4 p no3 n nh4 n and ph were carried out only for selected samples the ss concentration was determined by filtering an exact sample volume through a preweighed whatman gf c filter the filter was dried at 105 c and the amount of suspended solids on the filter was weighed water samples were filtered 0 45 Î¼m after sampling and analysed for dissolved reactive po4 p unfiltered samples were used to determine the total p concentration by digestion with k2s2o8 the p concentration in all samples was analysed spectrophotometrically 700 nm by the ammonium molybdate method of murphy and riley 1962 with ascorbic acid as a reducing agent nh4 n were determined spectrophotometrically 584 nm with a flow injection analyzer nitrate is the sum of nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 and the content was determined spectrophotometrically 540 nm with the same flow injection analyzer after reduction of no3 to no2 with a cu catalyst no2 in water was not measured because the concentration is usually very low olsen and andersen 1994 total n concentration was analysed by k2s2o8 digestion followed by spectrophotometrically determination of concentration with the same method as for nitrate ph was measured with a ph meter using a glass probe following the norwegian standard ns 4720 1979 for ph analyses precipitation data were gathered from a metrological station run by the norwegian meteorological institute 4 km away from the field ambient temperature and temperature inside the hut were measured this particularly to be aware of periods of sub zero temperatures 3 results and discussion contents of suspended solids ss total p po4 p total n no3 n nh4 n ph in water samples from the different drain types are shown in tables 3 and 4 the components are discussed separately in the following due to traffic by heavy machinery close to the instrumental hut in the beginning of february 2000 the collector pipe for lwa drain type a was damaged this caused water to enter the system directly without filtering causing high values of ss and total p 3 1 drainage volume the drainage volumes were measured continuously during the periods of observation in fig 6 the drainage volumes from the different drain types are presented due to different duration of the periods of measurement the data are normalised to the drainage volume of the standard drainage method pipe drain with an envelope of wood shavings in both periods discharge was largest from the pipe drain without envelope in the 1993 measurement period drainage volume were slightly higher from lwa drain type b compared to the other lwa drain types in the 1999 2000 measurement period there were no differences in drainage volume between the lwa drains this shows that there is no effect of the synthetic fabric separating the lwa material from the backfill on the long term the annual drainage volume of the lwa drains is about 75 compared to pipe drain with an envelope of wood shavings this lower capacity increases the time needed for the saturated soil to dry up after rain with one day compared to pipe drains and there are reasons to believe that this is reducing the proportion of drainage volume that leaves the field through the sub surface drainage system observations done in 1992 showed that the water level in the lwa drains was rising above the level of the lwa in the entire length during periods of long enduring rain this may indicates that the exit pipe represents a bottleneck in the system to increase the capacity to transfer water from the lwa drains to the collector pipes the exit pipe must have a larger area of perforation however in addition to this it might also be necessary to increase the cross section of the lwa layer to increase the pore volume which will increase the transport capacity of the lwa drains for future drainage systems in fig 7 two examples of hydrographs generated during two different rainfall episodes are shown the hydrographs clearly shows the differences in performance of the two drainage materials the lwa drains reaches its maximum later and it is not as high as for the pipe drains it also takes longer time before the discharge is back to minimum again for the lwa drains compared to pipe drains the timing and shape of the discharge hydrograph from lwa drains could contribute to reduction of flood problems in catchment areas dominated by agriculture as the peek discharge into the receiving streams is less and comes later in time 3 2 suspended solids the total content of suspended solids ss in the drainage water in 1993 of the different drainage types is shown in fig 8 as concentrations in periods were below the limit of detection the results are presented as maximum and minimum values the results clearly show less loss of particles through the lwa drains compared to the pipe drains as expected most particles are lost through pipe drain without envelope more than twofold the loss through the pipe drain with an envelope and more than threefold the loss through the lwa drains the loss of particles from the soil surface through erosion was not measured in this project the differences in annual drainage volume between the various drainage types might indicate a higher surface run off from areas where the lwa drains are installed this might influence the total loss of particles from areas with different drain types however there are several measures developed to deal with particles in surface runoff optimising the design of the lwa systems will most probably reduce the problem of an increased surface runoff that seems to be the case in this first experimental setup the concentration of suspended solids in the drainage water from september 1999 to january 2000 is shown in fig 9 the concentration of ss was significantly less in the drainage water from lwa drains compared to water from the pipe drains there are small differences in maximum and minimum values between the different lwa drain types the results however show a large potential for losses of particles through pipe drains without envelope compared to pipe drains with an envelope both pipe drain types have peak concentration of ss in the 7 january 2000 sample representing the rainfall and following run off of december 1999 the rainfall in december 1999 was 134 2 mm clearly above the normal of 59 mm in addition to the total rainfall for december 1999 being more than twofold the normal for that period it was dominated by a 49 1 mm rainfall on 25 december followed by 13 mm the day after this extreme rainfall event is probably the main explanation for the high concentrations of ss found in the drainage water from the pipe drains the content of ss in the drainage water is strongly connected to the precipitation particularly for the pipe drains during dry periods the content of ss in the drainage water is low it is well documented that both particles and nutrients find their way to the drainage pipes through the soil macropore system so called preferential flow e g stamm et al 1998 simard et al 2000 vidon and cuadra 2011 Ã¸ygarden et al 1997 less water means lower flow velocity through the soil and thereby less pore erosion less water in the pipe results in a lower flow velocity and an increased sedimentation of the particles present during periods of heavy rain the sedimented solids are resuspended and flushed out of the system the total amount of solids per hectare flushed out with the drainage water for a single rain episode in october november 1992 and the whole of december 1999 is shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively the results presented in figs 10 and 11 are calculated from the measured drainage volume and ss concentration this clearly shows the effect of an envelope and the capacity of the lwa drains to hold back particles 3 3 phosphorus the content of phosphorus p in the drainage water was varying over the year more from the pipe drains than the lwa drains the consentration of phosphorus in the drainage water in 1993 is shown in fig 12 in 1993 large variations in the total p consentration were observed in the pipe drains outflow these variations were closely connected to the variations in drainage volume and the content of solids when precipitation was high there was a flush of soil particles also flushing out phosphorus fixed to the particles the relatively short time span since the conversion of the field from woodland to farmland can probably explain most of the variation in 1999 2000 the content of total p in the drainage water was less from the lwa drains than from the pipe drains throughout the whole period fig 13 the variation in total p concentration in the drainage water over time was also less for the lwa drains than for the pipe drains there are several mechanisms in the lwa drains for fixation of phosphorus first the large surface area makes it possible for phosphorus to be fixed directly to the particles second a lot of calcium is available and at a ph around 7 the phosphorus will be fixed as calcium phosphates brady and weil 1996 the analysis from 1993 shows a relatively higher concentration of po4 3 in the drainage water from the lwa drains 80 100 of total p compared to pipe drains 30 50 of total p this difference cannot be found in the 1999 2000 measurements where on average 40 of the phosphorus in the drainage water was on the form of po4 3 regardless of drain type if we compare the content of total p in the drainage water from lwa drains to the pipe drains in the 1999 2000 measurements we find the content to be reduced with between 40 and 90 with an average of 60 this is up to twofold the phosphorus removal capacity normally to be found for detention pond systems braskerud 1997 the retention of phosphorus in agricultural drainage water is of major importance to improve water quality in agricultural watersheds since phosphorus normally is the limiting nutrient most responsible for the accelerated freshwater eutrophication 3 4 nitrogen the content of nitrogen n in the drainage water is varying over the year fig 14 in 1993 there were only small differences in values of total n between the different drainage types except during the growing season where pipe drain with an envelope of wood shavings shows a substantially lower content than the other drainage types from april to august the total n content in the drainage water from this drain type is considerably lower than all other drain types during this period the drainage volume was low and the water was flowing slowly through the systems the wood shavings in the envelope were probably acting as a carbon source for a microbial denitrification process the lwa drain type c that was constructed to create conditions that encouraged denitrification does not show similar effects lack of carbon is probably the main reason for the insignificant denitrification in the lwa drain type c the content of nitrogen in the drainage water in 1999 2000 shown in fig 15 was considerably less than that of 1993 the high values in 1993 may be explained by poor growing conditions due to drought during the growing season of both 1992 and 1993 and thereby giving a lot of residual nitrogen in the soil that could be washed out during the autumn another important factor contributing to the reduced nitrogen content was the change from growing cereals to growing grass in 1993 most of the nitrogen between 85 and 95 was in the form of nitrate no3 for the last period of measurements 1999 2000 full chemical analysis were carried out only for one rainfall episode between 7 and 16 february 2000 so the results are limited and therefor are only used indicatively however the measurements from this short period shows that less than 50 of the nitrogen was in the form of nitrate this regardless of drain type the content of ammonium nh4 in the drainage water was less for lwa drains than pipe drains in both periods the reason for this reduced ammonium content could be that the water was flowing slower in the lwa drains giving more time for the nitrification process to occur also the fact that the ph is more ideal in the lwa drains ph 6 8 than in the pipe drains ph 5 7 for the nitrification process to take place uhlen and svensson 1990 is probably contributing to the reduced content of ammonium 3 5 the drainage water ph the ph of the drainage water in 1993 and 1999 2000 is shown in fig 16 the ph was about one unit higher for the lwa drains compared to the pipe drains in both periods of observation average ph values 1993 pipes 6 7 lwa 7 8 1999 2000 pipes 5 7 lwa 6 9 the ph of the topsoil in 1992 was 6 0 and had been reduced to 5 6 in 1999 this is an expected development when a field is converted from woodland to farmland the residue material from the wood is incorporated in the soil releasing a lot of acids when decomposed no lime had been applied to the field in this period the reason for the higher ph level of the lwa drains is that the lwa are made of alkali material rich in calcium and magnesium when the slightly acidic drainage water is getting into contact with the lwa hydroxide ions are realised into the water causing the ph to rise 3 6 functionality and other results there has not been undertaken any measurements of water quality parameters in the period after 2000 however the field has been farmed all years since established in 1992 sowing and other field operations has been carried out at the same time as the surrounding fields indicating still fully functioning drainage systems since there is no notable change in hydraulic capacity over the years one expect that the ability to remove nutrients and solids also still is at an acceptable level the farmer has not noted any differences in yield and plant health compared to the rest of the farm this indicates that the expected lifetime of the lwa systems can compare to a standard drainage system 3 7 lwa drains an answer to current and future challenges of water quality in agricultural catchments so far efforts to reduce loss of nutrients and particles from agriculture land have focused on surface runoff the most common methods used to reduce the loss of nutrients from agricultural fields have been reduced tillage zones of vegetation filter strips along watercourses grass zones covering overland flow courses and detention ponds e g refsgaard and bechmann 2016 schoumans et al 2014 ulÃ©n and jakobsson 2005 ulÃ©n et al 2010 in addition to this there has also been changes in recommended fertiliser application strategies and management especially of phosphorus despite these efforts environmental monitoring programmes shows no clear improvement of water quality within agricultural catchments over the last years bechmann et al 2017 eea 2017 other mitigation methods seems to be necessary in susceptible catchments to achieve the water quality standards required by the european water framework directive a negative effect of some of the standard methods used to reduce nutrient loss from agriculture is increased use of pesticides due to increased growth of weeds berger et al 1989 braskerud 1997 some of the methods also affect field operations by making them more complicated and more time consuming as considerable amounts of particles phosphorous and nitrogen are lost through subsurface drainage systems chapman et al 2001 chapman et al 2005 foster et al 2003 grant et al 1996 hooda et al 1999 kronvang et al 1997 kvÃ¦rnÃ¸ and bechmann 2010 lundekvam 1993 ulÃ©n and persson 1999 wesstrÃ¶m et al 2001 Ã¸ygarden et al 1996 Ã¸ygarden et al 1997 the limited improvement of water quality in agricultural watersheds may be explained by the overlooking of nutrients lost via drainage in environmental planning as lwa drains reduce the load of phosphorous and particles from agricultural drainage they complement the frequently used mitigation methods against surface erosion and runoff plant roots may also take up the nutrients that a lwa system hold back however these mechanisms are not investigated in this project lwa drains may be particularly useful at flat artificially drained areas adjacent to vulnerable water and wetland ecosystems as estuaries lakes and rivers such areas are often environmentally sensitive and ecologically important on flat areas the traditional mitigation attempts that target surface runoff might have little effect due to importance of water transport through subsurface drainage systems at such areas however further investigation is recommended to optimise the design of lwa based drainage systems particularly to balance water conveyance and storage to both environmental and agricultural benefits 4 conclusions in this experiment the annual drainage volume for the lwa drains were about 75 compared to pipe drain with an envelope of wood shavings in addition to conveying the water the lwa drains also acted as a treatment system for the drainage water removing nutrients and particles and increasing the ph of the drainage water between 1 1 5 units the measurements in 1999 and 2000 showed that lwa drains removed between 40 and 90 of the phosphorus in drainage water compared to standard pipe drains the removal of suspended solids was of the same order as the phosphorus removal the lwa drains and pipe drain with an envelope of wood shavings have the same capacity to remove nitrogen from the drainage water as lwa drains reduce the load of particles and phosphorous in agricultural drainage lwa drainage systems complement the traditional mitigation methods reducing particle and nutrient transport in surface runoff drainage systems that improve drainage water quality like the lwa systems might be particularly useful on flat artificially drained areas adjacent to sensitive waters and wetland ecosystems further investigations are recommended to optimise the design of the lwa drains particularly to balance water conveyance and storage to both environmental and

11239,the awareness of sediment and nutrient loss from non point sources are of increasing environmental concern as measures to reduce point source inputs to surface waters have been introduced mitigation efforts to reduce loss of particles and nutrients from agriculture in norway and other countries have mainly focused on surface runoff whereas sub surface drainage has received little attention however research has shown that the sub surface field drains are transporting both sediment and nutrients rapidly to the watercourses despite these established facts there has been little development of measures to reduce these losses this article describes how lightweight aggregates lwa leca can mitigate some of the environmental challenges connected to sub surface field drains a field experimental project was performed to assess the effects on drainage water quality hydrological performance and functionality of drainage systems based on lightweight aggregates compared to traditional pipe drains registrations of the performance of the systems were done in two separate periods 1992 1993 and 1999 2000 after 2000 no measurement programme has run the functionality of the drainage systems was registered in connection to ordinary farming activity in 1999 2000 lwa drains showed particularly good performance with regard to reducing the content of phosphorus 40 90 reduction in total p the drainage water from the lwa drains contained less than half the amount of suspended solids compared to traditional pipe drains the results from 1993 showed no significant difference between lwa drains and pipe drains with respect to nitrogen the results from 1999 2000 showed higher loss of nitrogen through pipe drains with no envelope compared to all other systems lwa drains may be particularly useful in reducing particles and nutrient loads from cultivated flat drained areas adjacent to environmentally sensitive and ecologically important water ecosystems further investigations are recommended to optimise the design of lwa drains keywords field drainage sediment loss phosphorus loss non point source preferential flow 1 introduction transport of soil particles and dissolved nutrients from agricultural fields to surface water is one of the most important factors affecting the water quality in scandinavian water systems gustavsson et al 1992 rekolainen et al 1996 other studies are also showing that agriculture is a major contributor to the load of nutrients in rivers and other water bodies in industrialised countries carpenter et al 1998 fisher et al 2000 lenat and crawford 1994 ulÃ©n and folster 2007 an overenrichment of nutrients in a water body leads to eutrophication phosphorus is an essential input in all bio productions and is generally the limiting element for biological growth in fresh water systems shindler 1977 sharpley et al 1994 sundareshwar et al 2003 in addition to increased growth of aquatic weeds and algae that when decomposed can consume most of the available oxygen in the water leading to suffocation of e g fish eutrophication can also lead to production of toxic compounds e g h2s and growth of toxic algae e g cyanobacteria that kills other life in the water carpenter et al 1969 gray 1992 kotak et al 1993 eutrophication produces an undesirable water quality and makes the water unsuitable for use in industry and agriculture and for other humane use including recreation and consumption climate change is expected to lead to increased annual precipitation it is also expected an increase in the number of rain incidents with high intensity in scandinavia and other northern european countries alfnes and fÃ¸rlan 2006 hanssen bauer et al 2017 ipcc 2014 higher average temperature may lead to an increased number of freezing and thawing cycles during winter these changes may cause increased runoff and erosion causing increased loss of soil and phosphorus these changes may require further measures to reduce these losses mitigation efforts to reduce loss of particles and nutrients from agriculture in norway and other countries have mainly focused on surface runoff the most common methods have been reduced tillage vegetation filter strips grass covered overland flow courses for water and detention ponds eg schoumans et al 2014 reduced use of phosphorus fertiliser have also been recommended however despite these efforts the national norwegian environmental monitoring show no clear improvement of water quality in agricultural catchments over the last years beckmann et al 2017 despite similar efforts within the eu the situation is very much the same regarding water quality eea 2017 in norway approximately 60 about 600 000 ha of the agricultural land is artificially drained bjerkholt 2002 in north western european countries typically between 30 and 90 of the agricultural land is artificially drained brown and van beinum 2009 several norwegian studies have shown that considerable amounts of particles phosphorous and nitrogen are lost through subsurface drainage systems kvÃ¦rner 1991 lundekvam 1993 Ã¸ygarden et al 1996 1997 studies in other countries has also shown the significance of subsurface drains as conveyers of sediments and nutrients from the field to the watercourse chapman et al 2001 2005 foster et al 2003 grant et al 1996 hooda et al 1999 kronvang1997

long term field experiments in norway and reported that 50 90 of the total runoff from a field is directed through the drainpipes the loss of ss through the drainpipes was in the range of 30 4000 kg

17 48 kg ha yr representing 70 90 of the total loss of nitrogen all losses depending on soil type land levelling type of crop precipitation intensity management practice and other factors the increasing awareness of the importance of nutrient loss in drainage outflow has brought the need to reduce nutrient via drainage into focus in scandinavia ulÃ©n and folster 2007 and ulÃ©n et al 2010 has shown that there is a potential for reducing p losses from agricultural fields by focusing more on the function and design of the artificial drainage system especially for clay and silt soils with a risk of high p loss and in recent experiments use of a ash material as drain backfill mcdowell et al 2008 and fe coated sand enveloping pipe drain groenenberg et al 2013 have been tested as a mean of reducing p loss from drainage water based on the idea that new types of agricultural drainage filters might reduce p losses from agricultural tiles several recent laboratory studies have looked at hydrophysical and p retention processes and properties of potential new filter materials including leca e g canga et al 2016a 2016b replacing the traditional drainpipe and filter system with leca as a conveying and filtering material has been given little attention previous laboratory experiments have shown that lightweight aggregates lwa leca a lightweight expanded clay aggregate with a silicate matrix produced from pure clay have a good ability to remove phosphorus from water and also perform well as a filtering material holding back fine soil particles adam et al 2007 jenssen et al 1991 the laboratory results also indicated an acceptable hydraulic conductivity for drainage purpose based on the results from the laboratory tests and the need to reduce the losses of particles and nutrients through agricultural drainage systems a full scale field experimental project was initiated to assess the effects on drainage water quality and hydrological performance of drainage systems based on lwa in comparison to traditional drainpipes systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 general description of the research drainage field a field experiment was established in 1991 at grimsrud farm in souteastern norway 43 km se of oslo latitude 59 36Ê¹50Êº n longitude 11 59Ê¹56Êº e the criteria for selection of the site were i the soil and climate should be typical for the region and ii previous artificially drains that might influence drainage outflow should not occur annual mean temperature in the area is 5 7 c table 1 average annual precipitation is 829 mm table 2 average potential evapotranspiration in different months for the period 1993 1995 calculated by penman s formula with metrological data from norwegian university of life sciences faculty of science and technology at Ã¥s 12 km nw of grimsrud was january 0 09 mm day february 0 18 mm day march 0 68 mm day april 1 70 mm day may 2 81 mm day june 3 37 mm d july 3 34 mm d august 2 52 mm day september 1 35 mm day october 0 46 mm day november 0 17 mm day december 0 08 mm day the hydrological regime has a seasonal cycle with discharge minimums in summer and winter and maximums during spring due to snowmelt runoff and autumn due to reduced evapotranspiration the field has a gentle slope towards northwest and are separated from the surroundings by cut off ditches the field is situated in an area with marine clays deposited after the last ice age and is located 115 m above mean sea level the soil at the experimental field was surveyed in 1993 by jordregisterinstituttet today nibio as a soil type with silty clay loam in the plough layer increasing clay content with depth and classified as an epistagnic albeluvisol in the wrb soil classification system wrb 2014 the hydraulic conductivity of the soil was measured in situ with a constant head infiltrometer double ring with a mariotte tube after the drainage systems were installed the measurements were carried out half way between the drainage pipe lwa for the topsoil 0 0 3 m and for the subsoil 0 3 0 6 m the hydraulic conductivity k values were on average 0 27 m d in the top layer and 0 026 m d in the subsoil for both soil layers there were a 20 fold variation from the smallest to the largest value this shows that there is a considerable system of macropores that can contribute to both vertical and horizontal transport of the drainage water towards the subsurface drainage system to further characterise the soil x ray computed tomography ct scan was used the scannings were done on a siemens somaton 2 on soil monoliths from the topsoil between and above the drains by the method of jenssen and heyerdahl 1988 in addition to these monoliths from the subsoil were taken out along a drain with approximately halve the monolith with undisturbed subsoil and the rest with backfill material fig 1 the diameter of the soil monoliths were 20 25 cm the pixel size for the ct scans was 1 mm 1 mm and the slice thickness was 4 mm the variation of grey tone in the ct scans tomograms is a direct expression of density variations the variation in ct values in the dotted lines through the tomograms are shown as graphs solid white lines the lighter the colour in the tomograms the denser the material the variation in density is also shown as a graph on the photo solid white line the darker areas with low ct values represents zones with pores within tomogram pixels the pores could contain water or air which have ct values of 0 and 1000 respectively the scan tomograms of the topsoil show that there was a mixture of high and low density zones corresponding to an open porous structure of the soil the undisturbed subsoil was characterised by a dense matrix with higher ct values than in the top layer in the drainage ditch backfill the density values were higher than in the plough layer but lower than in the undisturbed subsoil localised zones with low ct values representing macropore zones were also present the field had previously been forest mainly spruce the timber was logged and the land cleared a few years before the start up of the experiment oats were grown on the field from 1992 the first year of cropping until 1998 using standard methods of tillage deep ploughing and harrowing before sowing from 1999 2005 grass for hay production was grown on the field from 2006 on various types of small grain have been grown in a crop rotation system as for the rest of the farm 2 2 description of the drainage system the field drainage system consists of two main types the lwa system and pipe drain system in fig 2 the layout of the system is shown each of the five drain types has a total length of 200 m draining a field area of 0 12 ha that is also assumed to represent the catchment of the drain type the field drainage base is 80 cm and the spacing is 6 m the lwa systems comprised of three slightly different types figs 3 5 the cross section of the lwa layer was constructed to give a pore volume that gave approximately the same transport capacity as the system with the drainage pipe all three systems were basically 80 cm deep ditches filled at the bottom with a 40 cm thick layer of lwa and backfilled with the local soil on top type a was the main construction types b and c are modifications of type a in type b a synthetic fabric composition 100 polypropylene non woven weight 135 0 g m2 thickness 1 0 mm characteristic opening size 100 0 Î¼m was placed on top of the lwa before backfilling this to prevent smaller particles from entering the lwa for type c the ditch was enlarged the last 2 5 m towards the outlet with a basin 60 cm by 80 cm that was filled with lwa the idÃ©e of making this basin was to create anaerobic conditions that could encourage denitrification before installation samples of the lwa were taken and the particle size distribution was analysed using a nested column of sieves with wire mesh the size of the lwa particles were less than 4 mm 20 was smaller than 1 mm and less than 5 percent of the particles was smaller than 0 2 mm kvÃ¦rner et al 1993 the hydraulic conductivity of the lwa has been determined to 1200 m day and p adsorption to 4 7 kg p m3 dry material jenssen et al 1991 the initial ph of the lwa material is high 11 4 jensen et al 1991 the water left the lwa ditches through a 2 5 m long 70 0 mm diameter perforated pipe and was transported to a hut were the instruments were kept and where samples was taken to prevent water from shortcutting the system bentonite was used to seal of the end of the ditch where the non perforated collector pipe was entering there were two types of pipe drains installed at the same drainage base and with the same spacing as the lwa systems the first pipe drain system installed was a standard pipe drain system using a 50 0 mm i d corrugated polyethylene pe pipe with an envelope of wood shavings the other pipe drain system installed was the same type of pipe as the first but without an envelope the main purpose for installing the pipe drain system was to enable a comparison of the lwa systems to a standard drainage system the pipe drain without envelope made it possible to observe the effects an envelope had on the retention of soil particles in standard pipe drain systems the systems were all installed using a backdigger the dominating method at the time the costs of installation and materials were almost similar for the different systems 2 3 instrumentation and parameters measured the water from each drainage type was lead in separate collector pipes non perforated to an instrument hut in the hut run off was measured and water sampled for quality analysis run off was measured continuously by tipping buckets with magnetic impulse counters and the registrations were logged using a delta logger dl2e mechanical counters were also installed as back ups for the electronic the water quality samples were collected by means of a volume proportional sampling technique every time the buckets tipped a small portion of the water was lead to sampling tanks the water from these tanks was regularly taken to the laboratory for analysis of suspended solids ss total p po4 p total n no3 n nh4 n ph selected samples were also withdrawn directly from each outlet for analysis of instantaneous values in the 1999 2000 season analysis for po4 p no3 n nh4 n and ph were carried out only for selected samples the ss concentration was determined by filtering an exact sample volume through a preweighed whatman gf c filter the filter was dried at 105 c and the amount of suspended solids on the filter was weighed water samples were filtered 0 45 Î¼m after sampling and analysed for dissolved reactive po4 p unfiltered samples were used to determine the total p concentration by digestion with k2s2o8 the p concentration in all samples was analysed spectrophotometrically 700 nm by the ammonium molybdate method of murphy and riley 1962 with ascorbic acid as a reducing agent nh4 n were determined spectrophotometrically 584 nm with a flow injection analyzer nitrate is the sum of nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 and the content was determined spectrophotometrically 540 nm with the same flow injection analyzer after reduction of no3 to no2 with a cu catalyst no2 in water was not measured because the concentration is usually very low olsen and andersen 1994 total n concentration was analysed by k2s2o8 digestion followed by spectrophotometrically determination of concentration with the same method as for nitrate ph was measured with a ph meter using a glass probe following the norwegian standard ns 4720 1979 for ph analyses precipitation data were gathered from a metrological station run by the norwegian meteorological institute 4 km away from the field ambient temperature and temperature inside the hut were measured this particularly to be aware of periods of sub zero temperatures 3 results and discussion contents of suspended solids ss total p po4 p total n no3 n nh4 n ph in water samples from the different drain types are shown in tables 3 and 4 the components are discussed separately in the following due to traffic by heavy machinery close to the instrumental hut in the beginning of february 2000 the collector pipe for lwa drain type a was damaged this caused water to enter the system directly without filtering causing high values of ss and total p 3 1 drainage volume the drainage volumes were measured continuously during the periods of observation in fig 6 the drainage volumes from the different drain types are presented due to different duration of the periods of measurement the data are normalised to the drainage volume of the standard drainage method pipe drain with an envelope of wood shavings in both periods discharge was largest from the pipe drain without envelope in the 1993 measurement period drainage volume were slightly higher from lwa drain type b compared to the other lwa drain types in the 1999 2000 measurement period there were no differences in drainage volume between the lwa drains this shows that there is no effect of the synthetic fabric separating the lwa material from the backfill on the long term the annual drainage volume of the lwa drains is about 75 compared to pipe drain with an envelope of wood shavings this lower capacity increases the time needed for the saturated soil to dry up after rain with one day compared to pipe drains and there are reasons to believe that this is reducing the proportion of drainage volume that leaves the field through the sub surface drainage system observations done in 1992 showed that the water level in the lwa drains was rising above the level of the lwa in the entire length during periods of long enduring rain this may indicates that the exit pipe represents a bottleneck in the system to increase the capacity to transfer water from the lwa drains to the collector pipes the exit pipe must have a larger area of perforation however in addition to this it might also be necessary to increase the cross section of the lwa layer to increase the pore volume which will increase the transport capacity of the lwa drains for future drainage systems in fig 7 two examples of hydrographs generated during two different rainfall episodes are shown the hydrographs clearly shows the differences in performance of the two drainage materials the lwa drains reaches its maximum later and it is not as high as for the pipe drains it also takes longer time before the discharge is back to minimum again for the lwa drains compared to pipe drains the timing and shape of the discharge hydrograph from lwa drains could contribute to reduction of flood problems in catchment areas dominated by agriculture as the peek discharge into the receiving streams is less and comes later in time 3 2 suspended solids the total content of suspended solids ss in the drainage water in 1993 of the different drainage types is shown in fig 8 as concentrations in periods were below the limit of detection the results are presented as maximum and minimum values the results clearly show less loss of particles through the lwa drains compared to the pipe drains as expected most particles are lost through pipe drain without envelope more than twofold the loss through the pipe drain with an envelope and more than threefold the loss through the lwa drains the loss of particles from the soil surface through erosion was not measured in this project the differences in annual drainage volume between the various drainage types might indicate a higher surface run off from areas where the lwa drains are installed this might influence the total loss of particles from areas with different drain types however there are several measures developed to deal with particles in surface runoff optimising the design of the lwa systems will most probably reduce the problem of an increased surface runoff that seems to be the case in this first experimental setup the concentration of suspended solids in the drainage water from september 1999 to january 2000 is shown in fig 9 the concentration of ss was significantly less in the drainage water from lwa drains compared to water from the pipe drains there are small differences in maximum and minimum values between the different lwa drain types the results however show a large potential for losses of particles through pipe drains without envelope compared to pipe drains with an envelope both pipe drain types have peak concentration of ss in the 7 january 2000 sample representing the rainfall and following run off of december 1999 the rainfall in december 1999 was 134 2 mm clearly above the normal of 59 mm in addition to the total rainfall for december 1999 being more than twofold the normal for that period it was dominated by a 49 1 mm rainfall on 25 december followed by 13 mm the day after this extreme rainfall event is probably the main explanation for the high concentrations of ss found in the drainage water from the pipe drains the content of ss in the drainage water is strongly connected to the precipitation particularly for the pipe drains during dry periods the content of ss in the drainage water is low it is well documented that both particles and nutrients find their way to the drainage pipes through the soil macropore system so called preferential flow e g stamm et al 1998 simard et al 2000 vidon and cuadra 2011 Ã¸ygarden et al 1997 less water means lower flow velocity through the soil and thereby less pore erosion less water in the pipe results in a lower flow velocity and an increased sedimentation of the particles present during periods of heavy rain the sedimented solids are resuspended and flushed out of the system the total amount of solids per hectare flushed out with the drainage water for a single rain episode in october november 1992 and the whole of december 1999 is shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively the results presented in figs 10 and 11 are calculated from the measured drainage volume and ss concentration this clearly shows the effect of an envelope and the capacity of the lwa drains to hold back particles 3 3 phosphorus the content of phosphorus p in the drainage water was varying over the year more from the pipe drains than the lwa drains the consentration of phosphorus in the drainage water in 1993 is shown in fig 12 in 1993 large variations in the total p consentration were observed in the pipe drains outflow these variations were closely connected to the variations in drainage volume and the content of solids when precipitation was high there was a flush of soil particles also flushing out phosphorus fixed to the particles the relatively short time span since the conversion of the field from woodland to farmland can probably explain most of the variation in 1999 2000 the content of total p in the drainage water was less from the lwa drains than from the pipe drains throughout the whole period fig 13 the variation in total p concentration in the drainage water over time was also less for the lwa drains than for the pipe drains there are several mechanisms in the lwa drains for fixation of phosphorus first the large surface area makes it possible for phosphorus to be fixed directly to the particles second a lot of calcium is available and at a ph around 7 the phosphorus will be fixed as calcium phosphates brady and weil 1996 the analysis from 1993 shows a relatively higher concentration of po4 3 in the drainage water from the lwa drains 80 100 of total p compared to pipe drains 30 50 of total p this difference cannot be found in the 1999 2000 measurements where on average 40 of the phosphorus in the drainage water was on the form of po4 3 regardless of drain type if we compare the content of total p in the drainage water from lwa drains to the pipe drains in the 1999 2000 measurements we find the content to be reduced with between 40 and 90 with an average of 60 this is up to twofold the phosphorus removal capacity normally to be found for detention pond systems braskerud 1997 the retention of phosphorus in agricultural drainage water is of major importance to improve water quality in agricultural watersheds since phosphorus normally is the limiting nutrient most responsible for the accelerated freshwater eutrophication 3 4 nitrogen the content of nitrogen n in the drainage water is varying over the year fig 14 in 1993 there were only small differences in values of total n between the different drainage types except during the growing season where pipe drain with an envelope of wood shavings shows a substantially lower content than the other drainage types from april to august the total n content in the drainage water from this drain type is considerably lower than all other drain types during this period the drainage volume was low and the water was flowing slowly through the systems the wood shavings in the envelope were probably acting as a carbon source for a microbial denitrification process the lwa drain type c that was constructed to create conditions that encouraged denitrification does not show similar effects lack of carbon is probably the main reason for the insignificant denitrification in the lwa drain type c the content of nitrogen in the drainage water in 1999 2000 shown in fig 15 was considerably less than that of 1993 the high values in 1993 may be explained by poor growing conditions due to drought during the growing season of both 1992 and 1993 and thereby giving a lot of residual nitrogen in the soil that could be washed out during the autumn another important factor contributing to the reduced nitrogen content was the change from growing cereals to growing grass in 1993 most of the nitrogen between 85 and 95 was in the form of nitrate no3 for the last period of measurements 1999 2000 full chemical analysis were carried out only for one rainfall episode between 7 and 16 february 2000 so the results are limited and therefor are only used indicatively however the measurements from this short period shows that less than 50 of the nitrogen was in the form of nitrate this regardless of drain type the content of ammonium nh4 in the drainage water was less for lwa drains than pipe drains in both periods the reason for this reduced ammonium content could be that the water was flowing slower in the lwa drains giving more time for the nitrification process to occur also the fact that the ph is more ideal in the lwa drains ph 6 8 than in the pipe drains ph 5 7 for the nitrification process to take place uhlen and svensson 1990 is probably contributing to the reduced content of ammonium 3 5 the drainage water ph the ph of the drainage water in 1993 and 1999 2000 is shown in fig 16 the ph was about one unit higher for the lwa drains compared to the pipe drains in both periods of observation average ph values 1993 pipes 6 7 lwa 7 8 1999 2000 pipes 5 7 lwa 6 9 the ph of the topsoil in 1992 was 6 0 and had been reduced to 5 6 in 1999 this is an expected development when a field is converted from woodland to farmland the residue material from the wood is incorporated in the soil releasing a lot of acids when decomposed no lime had been applied to the field in this period the reason for the higher ph level of the lwa drains is that the lwa are made of alkali material rich in calcium and magnesium when the slightly acidic drainage water is getting into contact with the lwa hydroxide ions are realised into the water causing the ph to rise 3 6 functionality and other results there has not been undertaken any measurements of water quality parameters in the period after 2000 however the field has been farmed all years since established in 1992 sowing and other field operations has been carried out at the same time as the surrounding fields indicating still fully functioning drainage systems since there is no notable change in hydraulic capacity over the years one expect that the ability to remove nutrients and solids also still is at an acceptable level the farmer has not noted any differences in yield and plant health compared to the rest of the farm this indicates that the expected lifetime of the lwa systems can compare to a standard drainage system 3 7 lwa drains an answer to current and future challenges of water quality in agricultural catchments so far efforts to reduce loss of nutrients and particles from agriculture land have focused on surface runoff the most common methods used to reduce the loss of nutrients from agricultural fields have been reduced tillage zones of vegetation filter strips along watercourses grass zones covering overland flow courses and detention ponds e g refsgaard and bechmann 2016 schoumans et al 2014 ulÃ©n and jakobsson 2005 ulÃ©n et al 2010 in addition to this there has also been changes in recommended fertiliser application strategies and management especially of phosphorus despite these efforts environmental monitoring programmes shows no clear improvement of water quality within agricultural catchments over the last years bechmann et al 2017 eea 2017 other mitigation methods seems to be necessary in susceptible catchments to achieve the water quality standards required by the european water framework directive a negative effect of some of the standard methods used to reduce nutrient loss from agriculture is increased use of pesticides due to increased growth of weeds berger et al 1989 braskerud 1997 some of the methods also affect field operations by making them more complicated and more time consuming as considerable amounts of particles phosphorous and nitrogen are lost through subsurface drainage systems chapman et al 2001 chapman et al 2005 foster et al 2003 grant et al 1996 hooda et al 1999 kronvang et al 1997 kvÃ¦rnÃ¸ and bechmann 2010 lundekvam 1993 ulÃ©n and persson 1999 wesstrÃ¶m et al 2001 Ã¸ygarden et al 1996 Ã¸ygarden et al 1997 the limited improvement of water quality in agricultural watersheds may be explained by the overlooking of nutrients lost via drainage in environmental planning as lwa drains reduce the load of phosphorous and particles from agricultural drainage they complement the frequently used mitigation methods against surface erosion and runoff plant roots may also take up the nutrients that a lwa system hold back however these mechanisms are not investigated in this project lwa drains may be particularly useful at flat artificially drained areas adjacent to vulnerable water and wetland ecosystems as estuaries lakes and rivers such areas are often environmentally sensitive and ecologically important on flat areas the traditional mitigation attempts that target surface runoff might have little effect due to importance of water transport through subsurface drainage systems at such areas however further investigation is recommended to optimise the design of lwa based drainage systems particularly to balance water conveyance and storage to both environmental and agricultural benefits 4 conclusions in this experiment the annual drainage volume for the lwa drains were about 75 compared to pipe drain with an envelope of wood shavings in addition to conveying the water the lwa drains also acted as a treatment system for the drainage water removing nutrients and particles and increasing the ph of the drainage water between 1 1 5 units the measurements in 1999 and 2000 showed that lwa drains removed between 40 and 90 of the phosphorus in drainage water compared to standard pipe drains the removal of suspended solids was of the same order as the phosphorus removal the lwa drains and pipe drain with an envelope of wood shavings have the same capacity to remove nitrogen from the drainage water as lwa drains reduce the load of particles and phosphorous in agricultural drainage lwa drainage systems complement the traditional mitigation methods reducing particle and nutrient transport in surface runoff drainage systems that improve drainage water quality like the lwa systems might be particularly useful on flat artificially drained areas adjacent to sensitive waters and wetland ecosystems further investigations are recommended to optimise the design of the lwa drains particularly to balance water conveyance and storage to both environmental and
