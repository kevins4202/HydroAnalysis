22870,pack ice besetting events are defined as incidents in which a typical ice class vessel encounters dynamic sea ice conditions which are beyond the ship s icebreaking and maneuverability capacities and the vessel becomes stuck in the pack ice until such conditions subside besetting events can cause severe disruption to a vessel s transit schedule leading to increased operational downtime and ship crew and fuel costs hence predicting the probability of occurrence of these events can help vessel operators plan in advance accordingly possibly rerouting the vessel and saving operational costs in this paper two pack ice besetting events experienced by the umiak i an icebreaking bulk carrier owned and operated by fednav limited which runs nickel ore from the mine at voisey s bay labrador to québec city are analyzed in terms of the wind surface ocean current and sea ice conditions which caused them the particular metocean and pack ice conditions associated with the occurrence of these events are used to develop a framework for a model to predict the future occurrence of such events for the umiak i and quantify probabilities of besetting event occurrence linked to specific sets of coincident metocean and ice conditions the model will serve as a tool for predicting besetting event probabilities during umiak i navigations as well as in hindcast shipping feasibility studies to determine the likelihood of besetting for vessels with umiak i capabilities in regions of new operations the factors considered in this study are the vessel distance to the nearest coastline regional wind and surface current speed direction relative to the nearest coastline divergence and vorticity the ice factors considered are the total concentration mean thickness and floe size this represents a mean floe diameter the datasets analyzed in this paper suggest the primary causes of the two besetting events experienced by the umiak i in 2012 and 2013 were the relatively large ice floes encountered by the vessel the majority of the floes during the besetting events were greater than 6 km in diameter in combination with a convergent regional wind field and onshore winds and currents keywords ships in ice vessel besetting pack ice pressure pack ice convergence probabilistic prediction 1 introduction an ice class vessel can become beset in drifting pack ice when the local ice field converges leading to pressures on the hull for which the vessel does not possess sufficient engine power to navigate through the pressured ice further away from coastlines e g tens of km vessel besetting events in pack ice can occur when the local wind and surface ocean current fields cause the ice to converge on itself toward a central point near a coastline pack ice convergence can occur when the local wind and current fields push the ice against the shoreline besetting events can cause major disruptions to ship transits which lead to increased operational costs as shipments are delayed fuel consumption rises and crew is forced to work longer on voyages than originally planned developing an understanding of the causes behind pack ice besetting events is critical to the future planning of operations in ice prone waters and in particular development of predictive models to forecast the possible occurrence of these events this will help vessel operators avoid regions where besetting events are prone to occur and help to mitigate operational costs and disruptions to vessel route scheduling the umiak i is an icebreaking vessel owned and operated by fednav limited headquartered in montréal québec canada since the vessel was launched in november 2005 it has been contracted to ship nickel ore from the voisey s bay mine at edward s cove near nain labrador to québec city the umiak i typically makes the voyage during march april every year and encounters extensive pack ice along its route fig 1 shows a photograph of the umiak i transiting though heavy pack ice conditions along the labrador coast a and a typical québec city edward s cove route during march april 2016 b ship navigational data were obtained for the umiak i from the automatic identification system ais for a six year period spanning 2010 2016 ship log data from march 05 april 16 2012 march 27 april 07 2013 march 25 april 02 2014 and march 28 30 2016 were available to supersede the ais data for these specific periods all of the ais and ship log navigational data are from the vessel s regular québec city edward s cove route the umiak i experienced two pack ice besetting events during this six year period both just to the east of edward s cove labrador see fig 1b the first event occurred during march 31 04 00 april 07 20 00 universal time coordinated utc 2012 184 h or 7 7 days duration see fig 1b and the second occurred over april 02 01 00 07 00 utc 2013 6 h duration see fig 1b ice and environmental factors experienced by the umiak i during the two besetting events are compared against the full range of available ice and environmental data for the 2010 2016 navigational record in this fashion a probabilistic model for prediction of besetting events for the umiak i is proposed it is important to note that the work presented here applies specifically to the umiak i and the specific route taken by the vessel between québec city and edward s cove this paper presents a framework for a probabilistic model which could potentially be used to provide probabilistic forecasts of besetting events for the umiak i in real time during transit operations by observing ice wind and ocean current conditions along the umiak i route as well as weather and ocean model forecast data the probabilistic model can provide umiak i crew members with a guide to characterize the risk of getting beset in ice on their way to edward s cove or québec city the use of the model may therefore inform decisions concerning slight deviations from the planned route or altering planned steaming speeds through particular legs of the journey in order to avoid areas at high risk of besetting events besetting events are not only caused by ice and environmental factors external to the vessel but rather the interplay between these external factors and the internal maneuverability and power capabilities of the vessel itself since the work shown here is based solely on historical navigational data and besetting events experienced by the umiak i the model proposed here can only apply to this specific vessel however the methodology used to develop the model for the umiak i may be also used to develop similar models for other ice class vessels with different maneuvering and power capabilities the format of this paper is as follows in section 1 1 previous studies of vessel performance in pack ice analyses of besetting events and their causes and prior models of vessel besetting events are reviewed in section 2 the data sources used in the present work are given in section 3 methodologies for data analysis and development of a probabilistic prediction model for pack ice besetting events for the umiak i are provided section 4 explores two pack ice besetting events experienced by the umiak i during 2012 and 2013 and compares them with the background metocean and ice conditions experienced by the vessel in section 5 the probabilistic model is presented and finally in section 6 conclusions and possible future work are discussed 1 1 previous studies of vessel performance in pack ice besetting events and models previous studies have

et al 2016 kotovirta et al 2009 introduce a prototype system for optimizing ship routes in ice covered waters the system combines ice and ship route modeling and was validated onboard merchant vessels transiting the baltic sea it was also examined using a statistical analysis of data from the automatic identification system ais which is used to record various ship navigational parameters such as latitude longitude position speed etc the system proposed by kotovirta et al 2009 achieved mean relative errors of estimated versus actual vessel transit times through sea ice covered waters of less than 0 2 s per second ss 1 for routes up to 650 km two studies by kubat et al 2010 and sayed and kubat 2011 examine model simulation results of ships transiting through pressured pack ice they found that the magnitudes of the model forces on ship hulls are consistent with measurements from the hull of the canadian coast guard ship ccgs louis st laurent the study also found that ship velocity had the greatest impact on hull ice forces with ice concentration and thickness having significant secondary effects in su et al 2010 the authors introduce a numerical method to simulate ship maneuvers in ice the study employs a coupled model between ice and ship motion and the model is validated with data from the icebreaker ahts ib tor viking ii lubbad and løset 2011 introduce a model for real time

conditions they study hindcasts of ice dynamics conditions that led to the besetting of two vessels in the gulf of st lawrence in march 2005 the paper additionally analyzes potentially significant variables such as ice pressure ridge thickness and strain rates they find the presence of ice ridges to be a significant factor in the causes of the ship besetting events in particular ridge thickness concentration and distance from the coastline the strength of the onshore wind speed was also found to be a significant factor in causing besetting events a paper by suominen and kujala 2012 presents results of ice tank tests performed on ships in compressive ice the authors used load and pressure sensors on the model ship hulls in the tank to measure ice loads and pressures on the bow shoulder and parallel mid ship areas they tested different ice thicknesses compression rates and closing channel widths the authors concluded that static compression in the ice field does not increase the ice loads however dynamic compression during closing channel tests significantly increased the ice loads in terms of both frequency and magnitude kim et al 2013 explore the resistance performance of an icebreaking cargo ship in pack ice using a finite element fe model and synthetic ice in a towing tank they used three ice concentration regimes of 6 10ths 8 10ths and 9 10ths the authors also used refrigerated ice in the experiments to test the utility of the synthetic ice and all results were compared a study by kubat et al 2013 analyzes the development of pressured ice conditions in frobisher bay near iqaluit nunavut during the 2012 summer shipping season the paper examines ice and metocean conditions surrounding 10 besetting events involving four vessels during this period including ice concentration thickness ridge sail heights wind and surface current conditions distance from the coastline and ice pressure severity the authors find that the besetting events were associated with ice concentrations of 0 95 1 00 and ridge sail heights of 1 2 m with widespread rafting külaots et al 2013 model the effect of a compressive ice channel on a cargo ship based on findings from a model scale test in an ice tank they discuss the effects of a newly discovered mechanism for adding ice resistance forces to the vessel hull due to the collection of ice rubble below the surface ice sheet along the sides of the channel a study by montewka et al 2013 models ship performance in ice using a bayesian network approach the authors use a case study of an ice strengthened bulk carrier in finnish waters and consider the joint effects of ship speed ice compression and the concentrations and thicknesses of level ridged and rafted ice they develop an empirical probabilistic model using field data which predicts ship speed in various ice conditions and the likelihood of besetting events kubat et al 2014 present an overview of ice and environmental forcing conditions which led to ship besetting events in the gulf of st lawrence and strait of belle isle during the winter of 2013 2014 they use an ice dynamics model to study the ice drift deformation ridge thickness convergence and internal ice stress gradient conditions in the vicinity of the besetting events they additionally offer analysis of ice compression development over the gulf of st lawrence and strait of belle isle as well as specific regions which are prone to ship besetting events due to proximity to the coast and prevailing wind directions seong yeob et al 2014 develop a semi empirical model to assess ship performance in level ice and calculate resistance forces they use lindqvist s formulas to calculate the ice crushing and submersion forces they find about a 4 6 difference between their model scale

diefenbaker a paper by hu and zhou 2015 studies the resistance forces on an icebreaking vessel using both a numerical model and experiments in an ice tank they compare the results of the model simulations with those from the ice tank experiments the ice tank experiments involved a ship going at low speeds through level ice montewka et al 2015 introduce probabilistic models for predicting ship speeds in ice and the likelihood of besetting events to develop the models they employ ship navigation ais data and ice data generated by the finnish meteorological institute s helmi numerical ice model the authors factored ship speed reductions due to operational reasons such as pilot boarding or icebreaker escort into their model so that only speed reductions due to ice conditions are considered in their model in particular they use data from the following parameters ice concentration and thickness ridged and rafted ice and ice compression the authors find that the ship speed level of compression in the ice and ice concentration represent the three most important variables which cause besetting events the models predict ship speed in ice to an accuracy level of 80 in specified bins and 90 for prediction of cases of besetting fu et al 2016 develop a probabilistic model for predicting ship besetting in ice in the northeast passage of the russian and norwegian arctic using bayesian belief networks bnns the model considers the following variables ship speed and engine power as a percent of total wind speed air temperature visibility sea surface temperature sst level ice concentration and thickness and wave height kubat et al 2016 expand on their earlier work to discuss the risks of besetting for vessels in canadian arctic and sub arctic waters they employ an ice dynamics model to hindcast ice drift ridge development and pressure to assess the risks of vessel besetting events they additionally examine a case study involving strong ice compression encountered by the mv kalvik in the southern beaufort sea in november 1985 a study by goerlandt et al 2017 analyzes ship escort and convoy operations in ice covered waters jeong et al 2017 analyze ship resistance in level ice using an empirical approach and subsequently offer a predictive model their model is validated using data from the united states coast guard uscg icebreaker healy the icebreaker araon and the icebreaker kv svalbard the model results showed an average deviation from measurements taken on the icebreakers araon and healy of between 3 1 and 5 5 respectively methods for estimating ship resistance due to sea ice ridge keels and predicting ship performance in ridged ice conditions were also explored by kuuliala et al 2017 mussells et al 2017 examine ship logs of wintertime transits through the hudson strait to the raglan nickel mine at deception bay québec in the canadian sub arctic from this analysis the authors found that a ship doing this voyage is beset in ice for an average of about 42 of the time they examine satellite imagery in order to understand the correlation between ship besetting events and the density of ridging in the husdon strait shipping corridor the results of their work were intended to be used as a basis for improving observation and prediction of hazardous ice conditions conducive to ship besetting 2 data sources the ship data on the umiak i used in the present work were obtained from two sources the ais and the handwritten ship logs from the navigation bridge crew the ais data for the umiak i were obtained from march 16 2010 to may 22 2016 this dataset provides ship time latitude longitude position true course direction in azimuthal degrees speed in knots kts draught in meters m and the voyage destination for a given voyage the temporal resolution of this dataset is not constant with times between successive data points ranging from less than 1 h to up to about two days the ship log data were obtained from march 5 2012 to march 30 2016 and offer more detailed information than the ais data along the voyage route fig 2 shows a photograph of the page containing the umiak i log for april 6 2012 in which data were recorded on ship time position true course wind direction and speed kts sea state or total ice concentration visibility in nautical miles nmi barometric pressure mbar air temperature c as well as navigational notes such as when the vessel was beset in pack ice the wind direction was recorded in the logbook as one of the 16 cardinal directions e g n nne ne etc in the present study these directions were assumed to correspond to their quantitative equivalents e g 0 22 5 45 etc the standard temporal resolution of the ship logs is 1 h as per the format of the log tables however in reality the vessel crew occasionally recorded voyage data 2 h apart and sometimes minutes to half an hour apart during times of increased activity on the bridge hence like the ais data there was no fixed time interval between data records in the umiak i ship logs for the present work the ais and ship log data were combined and chronologically sorted resulting in a more complete data set any duplicate temporal data found between the ais and log data resulted in the ais data being discarded for that time on the assumption that the crew s log records would be more accurate there is no overlap in time between the 2012 and 2014 ais records and the ship logs from the umiak i the 2012 ais records cover january 17 20 and may 17 20 whereas the ship logs cover the period march 06 to april 17 in 2014 the ais records cover january 16 18 march 01 to the end of march 25 and april 18 to may 30 whereas the ship logs cover the period march 26 to april 02 during march 28 09 00 11 00 utc 2013 the ais records and ship logs overlap with corresponding ship positions nearly identical between the two records differences in latitude and longitude positions are within 0 001 about 100 m between the two datasets for this 2 h period which consists of five ship log position records and four ais records however during march 25 27 2016 10 ais and ship log position overlapping records indicated that the vessel was consistently to the southwest of the corresponding ais position record by up to one degree in latitude and longitude the cause of this discrepancy is unknown however the ship log positions were used exclusively for this period of analysis the discrepancy may be due to a delay in reporting or transmission from the ship to the ais satellites although wind speed and direction at the umiak i location were directly measured onboard the vessel and recorded in the logbooks the present study requires knowledge of regional wind speed and direction around the ship in addition the ais data do not provide any information on winds wind speed and direction from the area surrounding the umiak i during 2010 2016 were obtained from the north american regional reanalysis narr 2018 which provides three hourly 10 m winds from 1979 present at a spatial resolution of about 0 3 about 33 km the surface ocean current and sea ice velocity data in the vicinity of the umiak i for 2010 2016 were obtained from the operational mercator global ocean analysis and forecast system copernicus 2018 this dataset has a 1 12 spatial resolution approximately 0 08 or 9 km a one hourly temporal resolution for surface currents and a daily mean temporal resolution for sea ice in this dataset the currents are initially derived from the nucleus for european models of the ocean nemo 3 1 and the sea ice velocity is derived from the louvain la neuve sea ice model lim2 the wind data were linearly interpolated in space to the 1 12 resolution of the current and ice velocity data and the wind current and ice data were subsequently all linearly interpolated in time to the times recorded in the combined umiak i ais and ship log dataset the sea ice total concentration thickness and floe size data were obtained from the canadian ice service cis daily digital ice chart archive cis 2018 for regions surrounding the umiak i s voyages during 2010 2016 in the present work daily mean sea ice thickness and floe size both parameters in meters at the ais and ship log recorded locations were computed as weighted averages of the thicknesses and floe sizes for each partial concentration of ice type ice types in the cis data files are given as thin first year fy ice medium fy ice thick fy ice etc each of which corresponds to a most likely thickness range of 30 70 cm 70 120 cm and 120 cm respectively for each ice type given in the ice charts it was assumed the thickness was the average of the range for thin and medium fy ice e g 50 cm and 95 cm respectively and the thickness was assumed to be 120 cm for thick fy ice readers are encouraged to consult the cis documentation on reading ice chart data for more information e g see environment and climate change canada 2018 fig 3 shows an example of two snapshots of the regional wind surface current and sea ice velocity and total concentration surrounding the umiak i from times recorded in the ship logs during the pack ice besetting events in 2012 a and 2013 b respectively the red and gray white regions represent areas of 8 9 10ths total concentration of drifting pack ice and 10 10ths concentration land fast ice respectively 3 methodologies for data analysis and development of a probabilistic pack ice besetting event prediction model to assess which ice and metocean conditions are expected to occur during besetting events an initial set of parameters that likely contributed to the occurrence of the pack ice besetting events experienced by the umiak i during 2012 and 2013 were identified as is discussed below first the total ice concentration and weighted average ice thickness and floe size see section 2 at the recorded positions of the umiak i for the 2010 2016 ais and vessel log data time record were extracted from the cis daily ice charts next the wind surface current and pack ice velocity data were extracted for each time in the ais ship log record for a 1 1 latitude longitude area around each umiak i position with the vessel position at the center of this box see fig 3 over the québec city to edward s cove route which the umiak i takes the zonal length of this region is about 62 76 km and its meridional length is approximately 111 km the size of the 1 1 latitude longitude box surrounding the umiak i was chosen based on the 0 3 spatial resolution of the narr wind dataset in order to ensure that the analysis of average metocean conditions surrounding the vessel encompassed an area sufficiently large to contain greater than only a single wind grid data point on any given side of the vessel twelve major factors were determined to potentially affect the occurrence of pack ice besetting events for the umiak i the total ice concentration average thickness based on cis daily ice chart ice types and floe size at the vessel location the vessel s distance to the nearest coastline the regional average wind and surface current directions relative to the nearest coastline and their speeds and the regional wind and surface current divergence and vorticity the divergence of a vector field describes the extent to which the field acts as a source or sink relative to its center with positive negative divergence values corresponding to overall outward inward flux the vorticity of a vector field quantifies the rotation of the field with overall counter clockwise clockwise motion corresponding to positive negative vorticity the connections between two of the above mentioned factors and besetting events merit further explanation the roles of floe size and wind and surface current direction relative to the nearest coastline while large floe sizes themselves cannot cause besetting events they can become a major factor when wind and ocean current conditions surrounding the vessel are favorable for besetting fig 4 shows an illustration of how larger ice floes surrounding a vessel collect the wind and ocean current forcing over a larger area than smaller floes and transfer a larger net force vector over the floe in a single direction in fig 4 the black and purple arrows represent net wind and surface current force vectors over individual ice floes larger floes collect greater momentum from the winds and currents than smaller floes and since the net force over the floe is directed in a single direction this can translate into stronger pressures against a ship hull than would be possible from smaller floes fig 5 illustrates the definition of wind and surface current direction relative to the nearest coastline in fig 5 the vessel is located nearest to a point along the québec coast to the north rather than to a point along the anticosti island coast to the south in the black 1 1 latitude longitude box surrounding the vessel the average wind or current vector is depicted with the purple arrow a vector is drawn from the vessel to the nearest point along the coast blue arrow and difference between the regional net wind or current and the vessel coast vectors can be determined green arc if this difference is between 90 and 90 then the regional winds or currents would act to push ice against the nearest coastline possibly leading to the vessel becoming beset if the vessel is close enough to the coast and the compression forces acting on the ice from winds or currents are sufficient for a discrete vector field e g defined only at fixed grid points the divergence of the wind and current fields were computed for each umiak i recorded position as follows 1 v i j u i j 1 u i j δ x v i 1 j v i j δ y where v represents the wind or current velocity vector field ms 1 u and v are the zonal and meridional components of the velocity respectively i and j are the row and column indices of the discrete vector field respectively and δ x and δ y are the zonal and meridional distances between adjacent grid points in the field m similarly the vorticity of the discrete vector fields was calculated as 2 v i j v i j 1 v i j δ x u i 1 j u i j δ y for each recorded umiak i position from the full 2010 2016 record the 12 aforementioned ice and metocean parameters most likely to contribute to the occurrence of pack ice besetting events were extracted from the datasets next the minimum ice concentration average thickness and floe size observed at the umiak i positions during the 2012 and 2013 besetting events were extracted from the cis daily ice charts in order for a vessel to become beset in pack ice there must be a sufficient mass of ice present surrounding the ship which would necessarily correspond with a minimum necessary ice concentration thickness and potentially floe size for the regional mean winds and currents during the besetting events the frequency with which the winds and currents were directed toward the nearest coastline e g within 90 relative to the coastal point determined to be closest to the vessel and the minimum average regional speed during the times of onshore winds or currents were determined a major physical mechanism for besetting of ships in ice is ice converging against a fixed boundary such as a coastline which would be caused by onshore winds and or currents of a certain minimum intensity the total divergences of the wind and current fields could be linked to the occurrence of besetting events because negative divergence convergence in one or both of these fields would force the local pack ice regime inward toward the field s central point increasing the probability of significant pressure building and therefore also increasing the probability of a vessel becoming beset the vorticities of the wind and current fields can also be linked to pack ice besetting events due to the interaction of the direct drag forcing on the pack ice dynamics from the winds and currents and the coriolis forcing for example in the northern hemisphere a clockwise rotation negative vorticity of the wind or current field could lead to convergence of the local ice regime as the coriolis forcing deflects the clockwise rotating ice regime rightward and inward upon itself likewise positive divergences and vorticities in the wind and current fields would tend to push the ice regime radially outward and decrease the chances of significant pack pressure and vessel besetting therefore the ranges of the regional wind and current field divergences and vorticities surrounding the umiak i were extracted from the time ranges over which the besetting events occurred during 2012 and 2013 it is noted that for practical reasons a besetting event is defined here as having a duration greater than 4 h as identified from the ship logs to aid in the development of a set of criteria corresponding to such events the data for all of the besetting events must be analyzed to determine values such that the probability of the ice metocean conditions c j being within the specified criteria range given that a besetting event b has occurred equals one as given by 3 p c j b n b c j n b 1 here n b c j is the number of ship log time records which occurred during the besetting events and simultaneous ice metocean condition records in the entire data record and n b is the total number of ship log time records which occurred during the besetting events this approach is an iterative process where the criteria can be successively narrowed as much as possible without violating equation 3 this will produce a set of criteria for prescribed ice metocean conditions which correspond to the observed besetting events since it is of interest to understand how the expected accuracy of the besetting event probabilities change as function of model criteria used the index j is used here to denote one specific set of criteria this allows the analyst to evaluate different criteria sets to explore potential ways to simplify or otherwise improve the model to estimate the probability of a besetting event presently or forecasting for future first requires estimating the probability of a besetting event given that a specified subset of ice metocean conditions occurs the probability of a besetting event b given conditions c j may also be termed as the besetting event occurrence rate r b j which may be defined as 4 r b j p b c j n b c j n c j where p b c j is the is the probability of occurrence of a besetting event the term n c j is the total number of individual ice metocean condition events in the entire navigational record here the index j refers to a criteria set number which is associated with a specified subset of selection criteria discussed more in section 5 to apply this model in a forecasting context we may estimate the probability of a besetting event p b i j at future time t based on the chosen jth criteria as 5 p b t j r b j p c j t where p c j t is the probability that conditions ice metocean conditions c j t occur at future time t which can be modelled using conventional ice and metocean forecasting techniques to implement this approach the ice and metocean conditions throughout the navigational record and corresponding identified besetting events were next considered as described in section 4 below 4 ice and metocean conditions experienced by the umiak i during the 2012 2013 besetting events and entire 2010 2016 navigational record in this section the metocean and ice conditions associated with the two pack ice besetting events experienced by the umiak i during 2012 and 2013 are examined and compared with the background of metocean and ice conditions experienced by the vessel across the entire navigational records during 2010 2016 the first besetting event began on march 31 04 00 2012 according to the records kept in the umiak i ship log the vessel first got beset east of edward s cove outside the shear zone at about 50 28 n 60 04 w see fig 1b for approximate location the vessel began drifting in thick first year ice under pressure while attempting to reach the land fast ice the ship log reported that surrounding ice floes were very wide deformed and mobile and traces of multi year my sea ice or glacial ice were observed with no open leads in the pack after two days the vessel was able to make progress and enter the shear zone where it got beset again the shear zone was dynamic and ice pressed against the hull after several days the besetting event ended by april 07 20 00 and the vessel was able to reach the port by altering its originally planned route table 1 summarizes the individual periods reported in the ship logs during which the vessel was beset specifically due to dynamic pressure ice in total vessel transit disruption due to pressured drifting pack ice was reported to have occurred for a total of about 157 h 6 5 days during march 31 april 07 2012 during the 2012 besetting event the vessel was not always stationary and was at times drifting with the prevailing local pack ice drift direction the second besetting event recorded on the umiak i was not as severe as the first and lasted approximately 6 h this event occurred during april 02 01 00 07 00 2013 as the vessel became beset in heavily ridged and rubbled ice in the shear zone east of edward s cove at approximately 58 18 n 60 25 5 w see fig 1b for approximate location marked by green arrow fig 6 shows the mean regional wind a and surface current b speeds and directions surrounding the umiak i during the 2012 and 2013 besetting events during the besetting events the wind directions were more variable than the current directions and were primarily directed toward the sse the strongest winds of up to 8 ms 1 were directed toward the south to sse approximately parallel to the nw se oriented labrador coastline relatively weaker wind speeds were predominantly directed toward the se to east the ocean currents were directed mainly toward the sse to se approximately parallel to the labrador coast the strongest ocean currents of up to 0 4 ms 1 were directed toward the coastline to the sse fig 7 shows the mean regional sea ice drift speeds and directions surrounding the umiak i during the two besetting events the direction of the ice drift was mainly toward the south to se during the besetting events with the drift most heavily toward the sse and strongest in this direction up to 0 4 ms 1 and toward the coastline fig 8 shows the time series of the regional wind divergence and vorticity a surrounding the umiak i during the 2012 besetting event march 31 april 07 as well as the time series for the regional surface ocean current and ice divergence and vorticity b during this event the wind divergence around the umiak i was primarily negative during the 2012 event while the regional wind vorticity around the vessel was primarily positive the regional surface ocean current divergence throughout the 2012 event was mainly positive while the ice drift divergence tracked near the current divergence was slightly below mostly hovering near zero throughout the 2012 event the current vorticity however was mainly negative during the 2012 event and the ice vorticity again closely tracked the current field clockwise rotation during april 05 06 the current field vorticity dropped to its strongest negative value during the event which was correlated with a dip in the ice vorticity an order of magnitude less than the current vorticity on april 07 just prior to the end of the 2012 event the current and ice vorticities spiked to their maximum positive values it is therefore likely that the clockwise rotating current field played a significant role in forcing the clockwise regional ice field rotation which led to compression of the dynamic ice to the east of the shear zone against the edge of the land fast ice and hence the besetting event experienced by the umiak i fig 9 shows the time series of the regional wind divergence and vorticity a surrounding the umiak i during the 2013 besetting event april 07 01 00 07 00 as well as the time series for the regional surface ocean current and ice divergence and vorticity b during this event the wind divergence around the umiak i was entirely negative during the 2013 event while the regional wind vorticity around the vessel was entirely positive the regional surface ocean current divergence throughout the 2013 event was approximately constant and positive at around 0 5 10 4 s 1 while the ice drift divergence was constant and negative at about 0 6 10 4 s 1 the current vorticity remained at around the same value as the current divergence and the ice vorticity was positive counter clockwise at around 2 1 10 4 s 1 in the 2013 case it is possible that the regionally convergent wind field played a role in forcing the convergence of the local ice field fig 10 shows the average regional wind a and current b speeds and directions surrounding the umiak i throughout the entire 2010 2016 navigational record the vessel was generally subject to winds directed toward the east to sse and up to 14 ms 1 and ocean currents directed toward the sse to south and up to 0 7 ms 1 fig 11 shows the average regional ice drift speeds and directions surrounding the umiak i throughout the entire 2010 2016 navigational record the vessel was generally subject to ice drift directed toward the east to sse to south and up to 0 6 ms 1 fig 12 shows the average regional wind a and current b speed versus wind coast and current coast direction direction from the vessel to the nearest coastal point to the vessel surrounding the umiak i throughout the entire 2010 2016 navigational record wind coast and current coast direction values of zero indicate that the mean regional wind or current direction surrounding the vessel is directly toward the nearest coastal point to the vessel it is therefore assumed that wind coast and current coast direction values between 90 are likely to result in pack ice compression against the nearest coastline and therefore possibly a vessel besetting the results in fig 12 show that the wind directions during the besetting events were to within 90 of the nearest coastline for approximately 24 of the time and these winds ranged from about 3 0 ms 1 to 8 0 ms 1 the currents directions during the besetting events were to within 90 of the nearest coastline for approximately 33 of the time and these currents ranged from about 0 1 ms 1 to 0 4 ms 1 fig 13 displays average regional ice drift speed versus ice drift coast direction surrounding the umiak i throughout the entire 2010 2016 navigational record the results in fig 13 show that the ice drift directions relative to the nearest coastal point were within 90 for about 33 of the 2012 2013 besetting events the majority of the ice drift speeds during the besetting events were less than 0 2 ms 1 which is likely due to compression of the local ice field leading to relatively small drift speeds fig 14 shows histogram plots of the relative proportions of regional wind divergence values surrounding the umiak i from the 2010 2016 navigational record a as well as from the 2012 and 2013 besetting events b during 2010 2016 the umiak i was subjected mainly to weakly convergent winds negative divergence with a mean value of 1 9 10 3 s 1 during the besetting events the vessel was similarly subjected to mainly weakly convergent winds with an average value of 9 0 10 4 s 1 fig 15 shows histogram plots of the relative proportions of regional wind vorticities surrounding the umiak i from the 2010 2016 navigational record a as well as from the 2012 and 2013 besetting events b during 2010 2016 the umiak i was subjected mostly to a counter clockwise wind field positive vorticity with a mean value of 2 0 10 3 s 1 during the besetting events the vessel was similarly subjected to a mostly counter clockwise regional wind field with an average value of 2 2 10 3 s 1 as discussed earlier positive vorticity in the wind field would act to counteract compression in the local pack ice as the wind forcing combined with the rightward coriolis deflection on the ice would drive the ice radially outward and away from the vessel given this and the fact that the wind vorticities during the besetting events did not differ significantly from those experienced by the umiak i during 2010 2016 it is therefore unlikely that the wind field vorticity strongly influenced the occurrence of the besetting events fig 16 shows histogram plots of the relative proportions of the regional current divergences surrounding the umiak i from the 2010 2016 navigational record a as well as from the 2012 and 2013 besetting events b during 2010 2016 the umiak i was subjected mainly to weakly divergent currents positive divergence with a mean value of 5 1 10 6 s 1 during the besetting events the vessel was similarly subjected to mainly weakly divergent currents with an average value of 1 6 10 5 s 1 fig 17 shows histogram plots of the relative proportions of regional current vorticities surrounding the umiak i from the 2010 2016 navigational record a as well as from the 2012 and 2013 besetting events b during 2010 2016 the umiak i was subjected mostly to a clockwise current field negative vorticity with a mean value of 6 4 10 5 s 1 during the besetting events the vessel was similarly subjected to a mostly clockwise regional current field with an average value of 5 7 10 5 s 1 the negative vorticity in the current field would act to force compression in the local pack ice as the current drag forcing combined with the rightward coriolis deflection on the ice would drive the ice radially inward and against the vessel hull however given the fact that the current vorticities during the besetting events did not differ significantly from those experienced by the umiak i during 2010 2016 it is not conclusive that the negative current vorticities played a significant role in manifesting the besetting events fig 18 shows histogram plots of the relative proportions of the regional pack ice divergences surrounding the umiak i from the 2010 2016 navigational record a as well as from the 2012 and 2013 besetting events b during 2010 2016 the umiak i was subjected mainly to weakly convergent ice with a mean value of 4 9 10 7 s 1 during the besetting events the vessel was similarly subjected to mainly weakly convergent ice with an average value of 4 8 10 7 s 1 these data show that while the regional pack ice regime is mostly convergent during besetting events this is not a decisive factor in their occurrence it is likely that the regional ice concentration thickness and floe size must meet certain criteria in order for the convergent ice field to cause the vessel to become beset fig 19 shows histogram plots of the relative proportions of regional pack ice vorticities surrounding the umiak i from the 2010 2016 navigational record a as well as from the 2012 and 2013 besetting events b during 2010 2016 the umiak i was subjected mostly to a clockwise rotating pack ice field negative vorticity with a mean value of 1 3 10 4 s 1 during the besetting events the vessel was similarly subjected to a mostly clockwise rotating regional pack ice field with an average value of 2 7 10 5 s 1 the negative vorticity in the pack ice field during the besetting events is consistent with the convergence of this field as the rightward coriolis deflection on the clockwise rotating ice field would act to force the ice radially inward in the field however once again given the fact that the mainly negative ice vorticities during the besetting events did not differ significantly from those experienced by the umiak i during 2010 2016 it is probable that the negative ice vorticities had to combine with a critical set of pack ice concentrations thicknesses and floe sizes in order to manifest the besetting events fig 20 shows histogram plots of the relative proportions of the minimum distance from the umiak i to coast from the 2010 2016 navigational record a as well as during the 2012 and 2013 besetting events b these data reveal that the umiak i spent most of its 2010 2016 navigational record within 100 km of land with short periods up to 160 km from the nearest land during the two besetting events the vessel was within 95 km of the labrador coast given the fact these events took place in the shear zone in which dynamic pack ice abuts the offshore edge of the land fast ice it is apparent that the nearby presence of land fast ice provided an immovable boundary against which pack pressure could develop and impede ship navigation fig 21 shows histogram plots of the relative proportions of the total pack ice concentration at the location of the umiak i from the 2010 2016 navigational record a as well as during the 2012 and 2013 besetting events b the vessel transited through ice concentrations of 9 10 10ths for greater than 90 of its 2010 2016 navigational record and was subjected to these same ice concentrations during the two besetting events while a total ice concentration of at least 9 10ths is likely critical to the occurrence of besetting events it is clear that a high ice concentration is not a determining factor for an icebreaking vessel such as the umiak i fig 22 shows histogram plots of the relative proportions of the average pack ice thickness at the location of the umiak i from the 2010 2016 navigational record a as well as during the 2012 and 2013 besetting events b the vessel transited through ice thicknesses of 0 1 1 1 m during the 2010 2016 navigational record and more than 50 of this period was in ice thicknesses of at least 0 8 m during the besetting events the ship was in ice near the high end of the range as mean thicknesses were around 1 m similar to the total ice concentration ice thicknesses near the high end of the six year transit record range are most likely necessary for the occurrence of besetting events but both high ice concentrations and thicknesses do not by themselves lead to a high probability of besetting for the umiak i fig 23 shows histogram plots of the relative proportions of the average ice floe size at the location of the umiak i from the 2010 2016 navigational record a as well as during the 2012 and 2013 besetting events b the vessel encountered average floe sizes of less than 1000 m for greater than 70 of its six year navigational record however during the two besetting events it encountered mean floe sizes of greater than 3000 m more than 90 of the time and greater than 6000 m nearly 60 of the time this indicates that the presence of relatively large ice floes was most likely a critical factor in the occurrence of the besetting events note that in fig 14 through fig 23 there are different numbers of data points used for wind distance to the coast ocean current ice velocity and ice concentration thickness and floe size for wind figs 14 and 15 distance to the coast fig 20 and ice concentration fig 21 thickness fig 22 and floe size fig 23 2105 data points were available for the 2010 2016 period these points covered every ais and ship log position record from the vessel during this six year period however for ocean currents figs 16 and 17 and ice velocity figs 18 and 19 1745 data points were available during the same time period this is due to the fact that the umiak i spent a significant amount of time very near coastlines and these data are derived from reanalysis models which have insufficient spatial resolution to resolve data so close to the coastlines hence the data presented in fig 14 through fig 23 are normalized to percentages table 2 and table 3 provide summary statistics of the ice and metocean conditions surrounding the umiak i for the 2010 2016 navigational record and the 2012 and 2013 besetting events respectively the results in table 2 show that the ice conditions to which the umiak i was subjected during the 2010 2016 navigational record varied from 4 10ths total concentration up to complete 10 10ths coverage when the vessel was in ice but the time mean concentration of 9 10ths reveals that the vessel spent most of its time in close pack ice the average ice thickness varied from 10 cm to more than 1 m however the vessel transited mainly through the relatively thicker ice with an average thickness of 80 cm the umiak i encountered average floe sizes of greater than 1 km but also encountered a large range of floes between 10 m up to greater than 6 5 km the results in table 2 show that the umiak i was an average of 48 km from the nearest land during its 2010 2016 transit periods voyaging to within six to 160 km from land the regional mean winds around the vessel during these transit periods were often relatively calm with a time mean speed of 6 ms 1 and winds were most frequently within 90 of the coast similarly the regional mean surface currents and pack ice drift were relatively weak with mean speeds of 0 2 ms 1 and 0 1 ms 1 respectively and both were most frequently within 90 of the coast table 2 shows that the regional wind field divergence around the umiak i during 2010 2016 was mainly negative convergent while the wind field vorticity was positive counter clockwise on average in the presence of ice negative wind divergence would tend to force the ice radially inward toward the vessel while the positive vorticity would act to counteract this effect via the coriolis effect on the ice drift pattern the regional ocean current field divergence and vorticity surrounding the umiak i during 2010 2016 showed patterns which were on average opposite to those displayed by the wind field with a mainly positive current divergence and negative clockwise vorticity similar to the wind the opposing signs on the average current divergence and vorticity would tend to counteract one another with positively divergent currents forcing ice radially away from the vessel and negative vorticity in the current field forcing ice radially inward on the ship however the average divergence and vorticity in the pack ice drift around the umiak i during the six year navigational history were both negative indicating that ice was most frequently forced radially inward against the vessel hull the results in table 3 show that during the besetting events unsurprisingly the umiak i was consistently subjected to 9 10 10ths total ice concentration the average ice thickness during the besetting events was toward the high end of the 2010 2016 ice thickness distribution and was mainly around 1 m the mean floe size encountered by the umiak i during the besetting events was significantly greater than the average floe size encountered during the 2010 2016 navigational record by approximately five times the minimum average floe size during the besetting events was an order of magnitude greater than the 2010 2016 minimum and the maximum during the besetting events was the maximum of the entire six year navigational record at greater than 6 5 km it is likely that the larger floe sizes played a significant role in manifesting the besetting events as larger floes can exert greater pressures on ship hulls and will not locally deform and clear around a vessel in the same manner as smaller broken floes may do moreover ridge building which occurs in nature as a mechanism to relieve stress in the pack typically occurs at the interface between adjacent floes where irregular ice edges interact and break as the boundaries between a large floe and the surrounding ice cover would be further from the ship ice interface as depicted in fig 4 large floes would have more direct load paths through which collected wind momentum can be transferred into pressure on the hull correspondingly ice fields of the same areal extent but comprised of small ice floes would have more energy dissipation per unit area due to ridging at ice ice boundaries than would be expected for large ice floes the umiak i was 68 95 km from the nearest land during the besetting events the regional mean winds around the vessel during the events did not differ significantly in speed or direction relative to the coast when compared with the 2010 2016 record the regional mean surface currents were weaker on average compared with the six year record 0 1 ms 1 and were directed to within 90 of the nearest coastline the regional pack ice drift speed surrounding the vessel during the besetting events was on average about the same as during the 2010 2016 record 0 1 ms 1 but was most frequently not within 90 of the coast during the besetting events similar to the six year record the regional wind field divergence around the umiak i during the besetting events was on average negative convergent while the wind field vorticity was positive counter clockwise on average the regional ocean current field divergence and vorticity surrounding the umiak i during the besetting events were mainly positive and negative respectively the average divergence and vorticity in the pack ice drift around the umiak i during the besetting events were both negative 5 ice and metocean conditional criteria sets and besetting frequency based on an analysis of concurrent ice and metocean conditions during the 2012 and 2013 besetting events extracted from the 2010 2016 umiak i navigational record a full set of model criteria corresponding to the ice metocean conditions observed during the besetting events were obtained using the methodology described in section 3 and are listed as criteria set j 1 in table 4 the selected criteria were determined by first extracting the minimum total ice concentration mean thickness and mean floe size at the locations of the umiak i as well as the maximum distance from the vessel to the nearest coastline from the besetting events next the times at which the regional average winds and currents around the vessel were directed to within 90 of the nearest coastline during the besetting events were extracted as well as the minimum wind and current speeds during these periods finally the maximum positive values of the regional wind and current divergence and vorticity during the besetting events were extracted from the data to explore the effects of simplifying the model several reduced criteria sets e g j 2 6 were considered to assess the relative frequencies e g the besetting event occurrence rate given by equation 4 with which a given set of coincident ice and metocean criteria sets were associated the number of concurrent besetting and ice metocean condition events bc j and the total number of ice metocean condition events c j were calculated for the entire vessel navigation record for example if criteria set j 6 is used e g see table 4 which only considers ice concentration these criteria will result in the extraction of 193 concurrent besetting and ice metocean condition events from the umiak i ship log records n bc j 6 193 for the entire data record and 4 594 ice metocean events corresponding to these conditions e g 9 10ths total ice concentration at the location of the umiak i n c j 6 4594 for the entire six year data record applying equation 4 we can calculate the besetting rate as 6 r b j 6 n b c j 6 n c j 6 193 4594 0 04 this result in equation 6 may be interpreted as indicating that if an ice metocean event corresponding to the criteria set j 6 occurs we expect that there is a 4 chance that this ice metocean event would result in a besetting event for the umiak i this process was then applied for each criteria set and summarized in table 4 table 4 therefore represents a framework for a probabilistic model for prediction of besetting events for the umiak i the criteria sets are ranked in table 4 in descending order of their besetting event occurrence rates the table was constructed from the bottom up with each criteria set adding a condition to equation 3 the gray boxes in table 4 indicate that a parameter was not considered in that criteria set several features of these criteria sets and their besetting event occurrence rates are noteworthy the first is the predominant link the ice conditions alone have with the occurrence of besetting events when only the minimum ice concentration thickness and floe size during the besetting events are considered without regard to the wind and current conditions or the vessel distance to land 46 of their occurrence during the six year navigational record was during the besetting events e g criteria set j 4 furthermore when only minimum ice concentration and thickness during besetting are considered the occurrence of this criteria set j 5 during besetting accounts for only 17 of its occurrence during the 2010 2016 record which reinforces the probable strong influence of the minimum floe size 530 m on the causes behind the besetting events note that in table 4 pack ice drift parameters e g speed direction divergence and vorticity are not explicitly considered in the probabilistic calculations however the vessel besetting events are driven by the local ice dynamics surrounding the vessel which are ultimately controlled by the wind and current dynamics considered in the probabilistic prediction model shown here in addition the probabilistic model is designed to serve as a supplement to deterministic ice dynamic prediction models which already account for ice dynamics explicitly the ice and metocean conditional criteria sets in table 4 obviously do not cover all possible combinations of scenarios the criteria sets considered in table 4 were selected through the progressive addition of a single ice or metocean condition to the previous criteria set as one moves upward through the table so that the criteria set s besetting event occurrence rate would increase for criteria set j 1 the addition of more wind or current conditions e g wind vorticity and current divergence and vorticity was found not to increase the beset rate above 74 and in some cases decreased it to less than 46 this indicates that the ice conditions alone shown in criteria set j 4 are sufficient to predict a besetting event probability up to 46 rendering the extra metocean conditions superfluous to the model finally the work shown here represents only criteria sets which occurred during the 2012 and 2013 besetting events if the umiak i experiences more besetting events in the future under different combinational criteria sets of ice and metocean conditions then the list of criteria sets and ranges of ice and metocean conditions which occur during these events may table 4 may expand for example it may yet be possible for the umiak i to become beset under conditions of onshore winds or currents with speeds less than those shown in table 4 and in which the wind vorticity current divergence or current vorticity fields play a more critical role the model proposed in this paper as summarized in table 4 shares some similarities in the methodologies to the probabilistic models for predicting vessel besetting in pack ice presented in montewka et al 2013 and montewka et al 2015 the model proposed in montewka et al 2013 and montewka et al 2015 is based on an ais navigational dataset obtained for a single vessel an ice strengthened bulk carrier travelling between two ports similar to the present model while montewka et al 2013 and montewka et al 2015 obtain reanalysis ice parameters e g level rafted and ridged ice concentration thickness drift velocity and internal stress from a sea ice model the work presented here uses observed ice data obtained from operational ice charts derived from satellite imagery however the model presented in this paper does not explicitly consider ridged and rafted ice as no specific data on these parameters were available from either the umiak i ship logs or the ice charts while the umiak i ship logs noted the presence of ridged and rubbled ice during the 2013 besetting event they did not provide specific information on the thicknesses of these features or partial concentrations which are critical to the quantitative model presented in this paper in addition the present model for the umiak i does not explicitly account for vessel speed in ice as the montewka et al 2013 and montewka et al 2015 model does the present model does also not explicitly account for ice drift velocity or internal ice stress since these parameters come from the ice model used in montewka et al 2013 and montewka et al 2015 the montewka et al 2013 and montewka et al 2015 model accounts for wind and a parameter they term the relative direction of compression of the ice which they define as the angle between the ship s center line and the direction of the ice compression this is comparable to the present model which accounts for the direction of the wind relative to the nearest point along the coast to the ship see table 4 however there are four major parameters considered in the present model which are not considered in the work by montewka et al 2013 and montewka et al 2015 the montewka et al 2013 and montewka et al 2015 model does not account for regional ocean currents and wind field divergence nor does it consider ship distance to the coast and floe size the work shown here highlights the important role of large ice floes in the umiak i besetting events as well as the roles of onshore currents and convergent regional wind fields e g see table 4 6 conclusions and future work the results of the work presented in this paper represent a step toward the development of a probabilistic prediction model for besetting events experienced by the umiak i the ice and metocean criteria sets and their associated frequencies of occurrence during besetting events shown in table 4 are likely to change in the future as more navigational data from the umiak i becomes available probabilistic prediction models such as the one presented here improve in accuracy as the database on which they are built expands in order for the model to become operationally useful the criteria sets and associated probabilities presented in table 4 should be linked to deterministic metocean models which would provide short term e g one to three days forecasts of ice concentration and thickness as well as ice wind and current regional average speed direction relative to the nearest coast divergence and vorticity along planned voyage routes of the umiak i the design of table 4 allows it to be used under circumstances of variable availability of information for example if only forecast or observed data on ice conditions are available during a voyage operational use of the table could be limited to criteria sets j 3 6 the addition of reliable regional information on wind and ocean current conditions including wind field divergence would allow for criteria sets j 1 2 to be considered in making probabilistic forecasts of besetting for the vessel the analysis of the ice and metocean driven causes behind the two besetting events experienced by the umiak i in 2012 and 2013 reveals that the most probable causes were the relatively large ice floes encountered by the vessel in combination with a convergent regional wind field and onshore regional currents and winds this criteria set occurred during the besetting events for 74 of its overall occurrence during the 2010 2016 navigational record e g see table 4 criteria set j 1 the model presented here applies only to the umiak i as it utilizes navigational and besetting event data which are specific to the vessel s power and ice navigation capabilities a less powerful vessel than the umiak i would most likely have higher probabilities of experiencing besetting events in the ice and metocean criteria sets presented in table 4 and would probably have a greater range of such criteria sets in which it could experience besetting likewise a more powerful vessel than the umiak i would most likely be less vulnerable to besetting in the criteria sets presented in this paper and would become beset in a narrower range of conditions future work should not only focus on expanding the database on which the probabilistic model for the umiak i depends but additionally on building similar models for other vessels with different ice capabilities than the umiak i in addition future development of the model presented in this paper should incorporate in situ measured ice thickness data in particular measured thicknesses of ridged or rafted ice should be incorporated as well as ship crew observed partial concentrations of these features and any multi year or glacial ice ice velocity and associated ice field convergence data collected from marine radar products that track ice features and in situ from satellite tracked beacons can also be used for model verification acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge financial support for this work by hibernia management and development company ltd hmdc and meopar we thank dr adrienne tivy of cis for

22870,pack ice besetting events are defined as incidents in which a typical ice class vessel encounters dynamic sea ice conditions which are beyond the ship s icebreaking and maneuverability capacities and the vessel becomes stuck in the pack ice until such conditions subside besetting events can cause severe disruption to a vessel s transit schedule leading to increased operational downtime and ship crew and fuel costs hence predicting the probability of occurrence of these events can help vessel operators plan in advance accordingly possibly rerouting the vessel and saving operational costs in this paper two pack ice besetting events experienced by the umiak i an icebreaking bulk carrier owned and operated by fednav limited which runs nickel ore from the mine at voisey s bay labrador to québec city are analyzed in terms of the wind surface ocean current and sea ice conditions which caused them the particular metocean and pack ice conditions associated with the occurrence of these events are used to develop a framework for a model to predict the future occurrence of such events for the umiak i and quantify probabilities of besetting event occurrence linked to specific sets of coincident metocean and ice conditions the model will serve as a tool for predicting besetting event probabilities during umiak i navigations as well as in hindcast shipping feasibility studies to determine the likelihood of besetting for vessels with umiak i capabilities in regions of new operations the factors considered in this study are the vessel distance to the nearest coastline regional wind and surface current speed direction relative to the nearest coastline divergence and vorticity the ice factors considered are the total concentration mean thickness and floe size this represents a mean floe diameter the datasets analyzed in this paper suggest the primary causes of the two besetting events experienced by the umiak i in 2012 and 2013 were the relatively large ice floes encountered by the vessel the majority of the floes during the besetting events were greater than 6 km in diameter in combination with a convergent regional wind field and onshore winds and currents keywords ships in ice vessel besetting pack ice pressure pack ice convergence probabilistic prediction 1 introduction an ice class vessel can become beset in drifting pack ice when the local ice field converges leading to pressures on the hull for which the vessel does not possess sufficient engine power to navigate through the pressured ice further away from coastlines e g tens of km vessel besetting events in pack ice can occur when the local wind and surface ocean current fields cause the ice to converge on itself toward a central point near a coastline pack ice convergence can occur when the local wind and current fields push the ice against the shoreline besetting events can cause major disruptions to ship transits which lead to increased operational costs as shipments are delayed fuel consumption rises and crew is forced to work longer on voyages than originally planned developing an understanding of the causes behind pack ice besetting events is critical to the future planning of operations in ice prone waters and in particular development of predictive models to forecast the possible occurrence of these events this will help vessel operators avoid regions where besetting events are prone to occur and help to mitigate operational costs and disruptions to vessel route scheduling the umiak i is an icebreaking vessel owned and operated by fednav limited headquartered in montréal québec canada since the vessel was launched in november 2005 it has been contracted to ship nickel ore from the voisey s bay mine at edward s cove near nain labrador to québec city the umiak i typically makes the voyage during march april every year and encounters extensive pack ice along its route fig 1 shows a photograph of the umiak i transiting though heavy pack ice conditions along the labrador coast a and a typical québec city edward s cove route during march april 2016 b ship navigational data were obtained for the umiak i from the automatic identification system ais for a six year period spanning 2010 2016 ship log data from march 05 april 16 2012 march 27 april 07 2013 march 25 april 02 2014 and march 28 30 2016 were available to supersede the ais data for these specific periods all of the ais and ship log navigational data are from the vessel s regular québec city edward s cove route the umiak i experienced two pack ice besetting events during this six year period both just to the east of edward s cove labrador see fig 1b the first event occurred during march 31 04 00 april 07 20 00 universal time coordinated utc 2012 184 h or 7 7 days duration see fig 1b and the second occurred over april 02 01 00 07 00 utc 2013 6 h duration see fig 1b ice and environmental factors experienced by the umiak i during the two besetting events are compared against the full range of available ice and environmental data for the 2010 2016 navigational record in this fashion a probabilistic model for prediction of besetting events for the umiak i is proposed it is important to note that the work presented here applies specifically to the umiak i and the specific route taken by the vessel between québec city and edward s cove this paper presents a framework for a probabilistic model which could potentially be used to provide probabilistic forecasts of besetting events for the umiak i in real time during transit operations by observing ice wind and ocean current conditions along the umiak i route as well as weather and ocean model forecast data the probabilistic model can provide umiak i crew members with a guide to characterize the risk of getting beset in ice on their way to edward s cove or québec city the use of the model may therefore inform decisions concerning slight deviations from the planned route or altering planned steaming speeds through particular legs of the journey in order to avoid areas at high risk of besetting events besetting events are not only caused by ice and environmental factors external to the vessel but rather the interplay between these external factors and the internal maneuverability and power capabilities of the vessel itself since the work shown here is based solely on historical navigational data and besetting events experienced by the umiak i the model proposed here can only apply to this specific vessel however the methodology used to develop the model for the umiak i may be also used to develop similar models for other ice class vessels with different maneuvering and power capabilities the format of this paper is as follows in section 1 1 previous studies of vessel performance in pack ice analyses of besetting events and their causes and prior models of vessel besetting events are reviewed in section 2 the data sources used in the present work are given in section 3 methodologies for data analysis and development of a probabilistic prediction model for pack ice besetting events for the umiak i are provided section 4 explores two pack ice besetting events experienced by the umiak i during 2012 and 2013 and compares them with the background metocean and ice conditions experienced by the vessel in section 5 the probabilistic model is presented and finally in section 6 conclusions and possible future work are discussed 1 1 previous studies of vessel performance in pack ice besetting events and models previous studies have specifically addressed the causes behind vessel besetting events in pack ice e g kubat et al 2012 kubat et al 2013 kubat et al 2014 and kubat et al 2016 and more general data and model driven analyses

et al 2016 kotovirta et al 2009 introduce a prototype system for optimizing ship routes in ice covered waters the system combines ice and ship route modeling and was validated onboard merchant vessels transiting the baltic sea it was also examined using a statistical analysis of data from the automatic identification system ais which is used to record various ship navigational parameters such as latitude longitude position speed etc the system proposed by kotovirta et al 2009 achieved mean relative errors of estimated versus actual vessel transit times through sea ice covered waters of less than 0 2 s per second ss 1 for routes up to 650 km two studies by kubat et al 2010 and sayed and kubat 2011 examine model simulation results of ships transiting through pressured pack ice they found that the magnitudes of the model forces on ship hulls are consistent with measurements from the hull of the canadian coast guard ship ccgs louis st laurent the study also found that ship velocity had the greatest impact on hull ice forces with ice concentration and thickness having significant secondary effects in su et al 2010 the authors introduce a numerical method to simulate ship maneuvers in ice the study employs a coupled model between ice and ship motion and the model is validated with data from the icebreaker ahts ib tor viking ii lubbad and løset 2011 introduce a model for real time simulation of ship ice interaction which can be used in training simulators for navigation crews the model simulates the breaking rotating submergence and pushing aside of floes by the ship and is validated against experimental results as in kubat et al 2010 the authors find ice forces on the ship to be heavily dependent on vessel speed leisti et al 2011 summarize cases of compressive ice on ships in the baltic sea during the winter of 2010 and compare them to model output of areas of compressive ice kubat et al 2012 examine the risk of ship besetting event occurrence under pressured ice conditions they study hindcasts of ice dynamics conditions that led to the besetting of two vessels in the gulf of st lawrence in march 2005 the paper additionally analyzes potentially significant variables such as ice pressure ridge thickness and strain rates they find the presence of ice ridges to be a significant factor in the causes of the ship besetting events in particular ridge thickness concentration and distance from the coastline the strength of the onshore wind speed was also found to be a significant factor in causing besetting events a paper by suominen and kujala 2012 presents results of ice tank tests performed on ships in compressive ice the authors used load and pressure sensors on the model ship hulls in the tank to measure ice loads and pressures on the bow shoulder and parallel mid ship areas they tested different ice thicknesses compression rates and closing channel widths the authors concluded that static compression in the ice field does not increase the ice loads however dynamic compression during closing channel tests significantly increased the ice loads in terms of both frequency and magnitude kim et al 2013 explore the resistance performance of an icebreaking cargo ship in pack ice using a finite element fe model and synthetic ice in a towing tank they used three ice concentration regimes of 6 10ths 8 10ths and 9 10ths the authors also used refrigerated ice in the experiments to test the utility of the synthetic ice and all results were compared a study by kubat et al 2013 analyzes the development of pressured ice conditions in frobisher bay near iqaluit nunavut during the 2012 summer shipping season the paper examines ice and metocean conditions surrounding 10 besetting events involving four vessels during this period including ice concentration thickness ridge sail heights wind and surface current conditions distance from the coastline and ice pressure severity the authors find that the besetting events were associated with ice concentrations of 0 95 1 00 and ridge sail heights of 1 2 m with widespread rafting külaots et al 2013 model the effect of a compressive ice channel on a cargo ship based on findings from a model scale test in an ice tank they discuss the effects of a newly discovered mechanism for adding ice resistance forces to the vessel hull due to the collection of ice rubble below the surface ice sheet along the sides of the channel a study by montewka et al 2013 models ship performance in ice using a bayesian network approach the authors use a case study of an ice strengthened bulk carrier in finnish waters and consider the joint effects of ship speed ice compression and the concentrations and thicknesses of level ridged and rafted ice they develop an empirical probabilistic model using field data which predicts ship speed in various ice conditions and the likelihood of besetting events kubat et al 2014 present an overview of ice and environmental forcing conditions which led to ship besetting events in the gulf of st lawrence and strait of belle isle during the winter of 2013 2014 they use an ice dynamics model to study the ice drift deformation ridge thickness convergence and internal ice stress gradient conditions in the vicinity of the besetting events they additionally offer analysis of ice compression development over the gulf of st lawrence and strait of belle isle as well as specific regions which are prone to ship besetting events due to proximity to the coast and prevailing wind directions seong yeob et al 2014 develop a semi empirical model to assess ship performance in level ice and calculate resistance forces they use lindqvist s formulas to calculate the ice crushing and submersion forces they find about a 4 6 difference between their model scale test data from an ice tank and predictions from the semi empirical model wang et al 2014 discuss the results of ice tank model tests carried to assess the performance of the ccg icebreaker the john g diefenbaker a paper by hu and zhou 2015 studies the resistance forces on an icebreaking vessel using both a numerical model and experiments in an ice tank they compare the results of the model simulations with those from the ice tank experiments the ice tank experiments involved a ship going at low speeds through level ice montewka et al 2015 introduce probabilistic models for predicting ship speeds in ice and the likelihood of besetting events to develop the models they employ ship navigation ais data and ice data generated by the finnish meteorological institute s helmi numerical ice model the authors factored ship speed reductions due to operational reasons such as pilot boarding or icebreaker escort into their model so that only speed reductions due to ice conditions are considered in their model in particular they use data from the following parameters ice concentration and thickness ridged and rafted ice and ice compression the authors find that the ship speed level of compression in the ice and ice concentration represent the three most important variables which cause besetting events the models predict ship speed in ice to an accuracy level of 80 in specified bins and 90 for prediction of cases of besetting fu et al 2016 develop a probabilistic model for predicting ship besetting in ice in the northeast passage of the russian and norwegian arctic using bayesian belief networks bnns the model considers the following variables ship speed and engine power as a percent of total wind speed air temperature visibility sea surface temperature sst level ice concentration and thickness and wave height kubat et al 2016 expand on their earlier work to discuss the risks of besetting for vessels in canadian arctic and sub arctic waters they employ an ice dynamics model to hindcast ice drift ridge development and pressure to assess the risks of vessel besetting events they additionally examine a case study involving strong ice compression encountered by the mv kalvik in the southern beaufort sea in november 1985 a study by goerlandt et al 2017 analyzes ship escort and convoy operations in ice covered waters jeong et al 2017 analyze ship resistance in level ice using an empirical approach and subsequently offer a predictive model their model is validated using data from the united states coast guard uscg icebreaker healy the icebreaker araon and the icebreaker kv svalbard the model results showed an average deviation from measurements taken on the icebreakers araon and healy of between 3 1 and 5 5 respectively methods for estimating ship resistance due to sea ice ridge keels and predicting ship performance in ridged ice conditions were also explored by kuuliala et al 2017 mussells et al 2017 examine ship logs of wintertime transits through the hudson strait to the raglan nickel mine at deception bay québec in the canadian sub arctic from this analysis the authors found that a ship doing this voyage is beset in ice for an average of about 42 of the time they examine satellite imagery in order to understand the correlation between ship besetting events and the density of ridging in the husdon strait shipping corridor the results of their work were intended to be used as a basis for improving observation and prediction of hazardous ice conditions conducive to ship besetting 2 data sources the ship data on the umiak i used in the present work were obtained from two sources the ais and the handwritten ship logs from the navigation bridge crew the ais data for the umiak i were obtained from march 16 2010 to may 22 2016 this dataset provides ship time latitude longitude position true course direction in azimuthal degrees speed in knots kts draught in meters m and the voyage destination for a given voyage the temporal resolution of this dataset is not constant with times between successive data points ranging from less than 1 h to up to about two days the ship log data were obtained from march 5 2012 to march 30 2016 and offer more detailed information than the ais data along the voyage route fig 2 shows a photograph of the page containing the umiak i log for april 6 2012 in which data were recorded on ship time position true course wind direction and speed kts sea state or total ice concentration visibility in nautical miles nmi barometric pressure mbar air temperature c as well as navigational notes such as when the vessel was beset in pack ice the wind direction was recorded in the logbook as one of the 16 cardinal directions e g n nne ne etc in the present study these directions were assumed to correspond to their quantitative equivalents e g 0 22 5 45 etc the standard temporal resolution of the ship logs is 1 h as per the format of the log tables however in reality the vessel crew occasionally recorded voyage data 2 h apart and sometimes minutes to half an hour apart during times of increased activity on the bridge hence like the ais data there was no fixed time interval between data records in the umiak i ship logs for the present work the ais and ship log data were combined and chronologically sorted resulting in a more complete data set any duplicate temporal data found between the ais and log data resulted in the ais data being discarded for that time on the assumption that the crew s log records would be more accurate there is no overlap in time between the 2012 and 2014 ais records and the ship logs from the umiak i the 2012 ais records cover january 17 20 and may 17 20 whereas the ship logs cover the period march 06 to april 17 in 2014 the ais records cover january 16 18 march 01 to the end of march 25 and april 18 to may 30 whereas the ship logs cover the period march 26 to april 02 during march 28 09 00 11 00 utc 2013 the ais records and ship logs overlap with corresponding ship positions nearly identical between the two records differences in latitude and longitude positions are within 0 001 about 100 m between the two datasets for this 2 h period which consists of five ship log position records and four ais records however during march 25 27 2016 10 ais and ship log position overlapping records indicated that the vessel was consistently to the southwest of the corresponding ais position record by up to one degree in latitude and longitude the cause of this discrepancy is unknown however the ship log positions were used exclusively for this period of analysis the discrepancy may be due to a delay in reporting or transmission from the ship to the ais satellites although wind speed and direction at the umiak i location were directly measured onboard the vessel and recorded in the logbooks the present study requires knowledge of regional wind speed and direction around the ship in addition the ais data do not provide any information on winds wind speed and direction from the area surrounding the umiak i during 2010 2016 were obtained from the north american regional reanalysis narr 2018 which provides three hourly 10 m winds from 1979 present at a spatial resolution of about 0 3 about 33 km the surface ocean current and sea ice velocity data in the vicinity of the umiak i for 2010 2016 were obtained from the operational mercator global ocean analysis and forecast system copernicus 2018 this dataset has a 1 12 spatial resolution approximately 0 08 or 9 km a one hourly temporal resolution for surface currents and a daily mean temporal resolution for sea ice in this dataset the currents are initially derived from the nucleus for european models of the ocean nemo 3 1 and the sea ice velocity is derived from the louvain la neuve sea ice model lim2 the wind data were linearly interpolated in space to the 1 12 resolution of the current and ice velocity data and the wind current and ice data were subsequently all linearly interpolated in time to the times recorded in the combined umiak i ais and ship log dataset the sea ice total concentration thickness and floe size data were obtained from the canadian ice service cis daily digital ice chart archive cis 2018 for regions surrounding the umiak i s voyages during 2010 2016 in the present work daily mean sea ice thickness and floe size both parameters in meters at the ais and ship log recorded locations were computed as weighted averages of the thicknesses and floe sizes for each partial concentration of ice type ice types in the cis data files are given as thin first year fy ice medium fy ice thick fy ice etc each of which corresponds to a most likely thickness range of 30 70 cm 70 120 cm and 120 cm respectively for each ice type given in the ice charts it was assumed the thickness was the average of the range for thin and medium fy ice e g 50 cm and 95 cm respectively and the thickness was assumed to be 120 cm for thick fy ice readers are encouraged to consult the cis documentation on reading ice chart data for more information e g see environment and climate change canada 2018 fig 3 shows an example of two snapshots of the regional wind surface current and sea ice velocity and total concentration surrounding the umiak i from times recorded in the ship logs during the pack ice besetting events in 2012 a and 2013 b respectively the red and gray white regions represent areas of 8 9 10ths total concentration of drifting pack ice and 10 10ths concentration land fast ice respectively 3 methodologies for data analysis and development of a probabilistic pack ice besetting event prediction model to assess which ice and metocean conditions are expected to occur during besetting events an initial set of parameters that likely contributed to the occurrence of the pack ice besetting events experienced by the umiak i during 2012 and 2013 were identified as is discussed below first the total ice concentration and weighted average ice thickness and floe size see section 2 at the recorded positions of the umiak i for the 2010 2016 ais and vessel log data time record were extracted from the cis daily ice charts next the wind surface current and pack ice velocity data were extracted for each time in the ais ship log record for a 1 1 latitude longitude area around each umiak i position with the vessel position at the center of this box see fig 3 over the québec city to edward s cove route which the umiak i takes the zonal length of this region is about 62 76 km and its meridional length is approximately 111 km the size of the 1 1 latitude longitude box surrounding the umiak i was chosen based on the 0 3 spatial resolution of the narr wind dataset in order to ensure that the analysis of average metocean conditions surrounding the vessel encompassed an area sufficiently large to contain greater than only a single wind grid data point on any given side of the vessel twelve major factors were determined to potentially affect the occurrence of pack ice besetting events for the umiak i the total ice concentration average thickness based on cis daily ice chart ice types and floe size at the vessel location the vessel s distance to the nearest coastline the regional average wind and surface current directions relative to the nearest coastline and their speeds and the regional wind and surface current divergence and vorticity the divergence of a vector field describes the extent to which the field acts as a source or sink relative to its center with positive negative divergence values corresponding to overall outward inward flux the vorticity of a vector field quantifies the rotation of the field with overall counter clockwise clockwise motion corresponding to positive negative vorticity the connections between two of the above mentioned factors and besetting events merit further explanation the roles of floe size and wind and surface current direction relative to the nearest coastline while large floe sizes themselves cannot cause besetting events they can become a major factor when wind and ocean current conditions surrounding the vessel are favorable for besetting fig 4 shows an illustration of how larger ice floes surrounding a vessel collect the wind and ocean current forcing over a larger area than smaller floes and transfer a larger net force vector over the floe in a single direction in fig 4 the black and purple arrows represent net wind and surface current force vectors over individual ice floes larger floes collect greater momentum from the winds and currents than smaller floes and since the net force over the floe is directed in a single direction this can translate into stronger pressures against a ship hull than would be possible from smaller floes fig 5 illustrates the definition of wind and surface current direction relative to the nearest coastline in fig 5 the vessel is located nearest to a point along the québec coast to the north rather than to a point along the anticosti island coast to the south in the black 1 1 latitude longitude box surrounding the vessel the average wind or current vector is depicted with the purple arrow a vector is drawn from the vessel to the nearest point along the coast blue arrow and difference between the regional net wind or current and the vessel coast vectors can be determined green arc if this difference is between 90 and 90 then the regional winds or currents would act to push ice against the nearest coastline possibly leading to the vessel becoming beset if the vessel is close enough to the coast and the compression forces acting on the ice from winds or currents are sufficient for a discrete vector field e g defined only at fixed grid points the divergence of the wind and current fields were computed for each umiak i recorded position as follows 1 v i j u i j 1 u i j δ x v i 1 j v i j δ y where v represents the wind or current velocity vector field ms 1 u and v are the zonal and meridional components of the velocity respectively i and j are the row and column indices of the discrete vector field respectively and δ x and δ y are the zonal and meridional distances between adjacent grid points in the field m similarly the vorticity of the discrete vector fields was calculated as 2 v i j v i j 1 v i j δ x u i 1 j u i j δ y for each recorded umiak i position from the full 2010 2016 record the 12 aforementioned ice and metocean parameters most likely to contribute to the occurrence of pack ice besetting events were extracted from the datasets next the minimum ice concentration average thickness and floe size observed at the umiak i positions during the 2012 and 2013 besetting events were extracted from the cis daily ice charts in order for a vessel to become beset in pack ice there must be a sufficient mass of ice present surrounding the ship which would necessarily correspond with a minimum necessary ice concentration thickness and potentially floe size for the regional mean winds and currents during the besetting events the frequency with which the winds and currents were directed toward the nearest coastline e g within 90 relative to the coastal point determined to be closest to the vessel and the minimum average regional speed during the times of onshore winds or currents were determined a major physical mechanism for besetting of ships in ice is ice converging against a fixed boundary such as a coastline which would be caused by onshore winds and or currents of a certain minimum intensity the total divergences of the wind and current fields could be linked to the occurrence of besetting events because negative divergence convergence in one or both of these fields would force the local pack ice regime inward toward the field s central point increasing the probability of significant pressure building and therefore also increasing the probability of a vessel becoming beset the vorticities of the wind and current fields can also be linked to pack ice besetting events due to the interaction of the direct drag forcing on the pack ice dynamics from the winds and currents and the coriolis forcing for example in the northern hemisphere a clockwise rotation negative vorticity of the wind or current field could lead to convergence of the local ice regime as the coriolis forcing deflects the clockwise rotating ice regime rightward and inward upon itself likewise positive divergences and vorticities in the wind and current fields would tend to push the ice regime radially outward and decrease the chances of significant pack pressure and vessel besetting therefore the ranges of the regional wind and current field divergences and vorticities surrounding the umiak i were extracted from the time ranges over which the besetting events occurred during 2012 and 2013 it is noted that for practical reasons a besetting event is defined here as having a duration greater than 4 h as identified from the ship logs to aid in the development of a set of criteria corresponding to such events the data for all of the besetting events must be analyzed to determine values such that the probability of the ice metocean conditions c j being within the specified criteria range given that a besetting event b has occurred equals one as given by 3 p c j b n b c j n b 1 here n b c j is the number of ship log time records which occurred during the besetting events and simultaneous ice metocean condition records in the entire data record and n b is the total number of ship log time records which occurred during the besetting events this approach is an iterative process where the criteria can be successively narrowed as much as possible without violating equation 3 this will produce a set of criteria for prescribed ice metocean conditions which correspond to the observed besetting events since it is of interest to understand how the expected accuracy of the besetting event probabilities change as function of model criteria used the index j is used here to denote one specific set of criteria this allows the analyst to evaluate different criteria sets to explore potential ways to simplify or otherwise improve the model to estimate the probability of a besetting event presently or forecasting for future first requires estimating the probability of a besetting event given that a specified subset of ice metocean conditions occurs the probability of a besetting event b given conditions c j may also be termed as the besetting event occurrence rate r b j which may be defined as 4 r b j p b c j n b c j n c j where p b c j is the is the probability of occurrence of a besetting event the term n c j is the total number of individual ice metocean condition events in the entire navigational record here the index j refers to a criteria set number which is associated with a specified subset of selection criteria discussed more in section 5 to apply this model in a forecasting context we may estimate the probability of a besetting event p b i j at future time t based on the chosen jth criteria as 5 p b t j r b j p c j t where p c j t is the probability that conditions ice metocean conditions c j t occur at future time t which can be modelled using conventional ice and metocean forecasting techniques to implement this approach the ice and metocean conditions throughout the navigational record and corresponding identified besetting events were next considered as described in section 4 below 4 ice and metocean conditions experienced by the umiak i during the 2012 2013 besetting events and entire 2010 2016 navigational record in this section the metocean and ice conditions associated with the two pack ice besetting events experienced by the umiak i during 2012 and 2013 are examined and compared with the background of metocean and ice conditions experienced by the vessel across the entire navigational records during 2010 2016 the first besetting event began on march 31 04 00 2012 according to the records kept in the umiak i ship log the vessel first got beset east of edward s cove outside the shear zone at about 50 28 n 60 04 w see fig 1b for approximate location the vessel began drifting in thick first year ice under pressure while attempting to reach the land fast ice the ship log reported that surrounding ice floes were very wide deformed and mobile and traces of multi year my sea ice or glacial ice were observed with no open leads in the pack after two days the vessel was able to make progress and enter the shear zone where it got beset again the shear zone was dynamic and ice pressed against the hull after several days the besetting event ended by april 07 20 00 and the vessel was able to reach the port by altering its originally planned route table 1 summarizes the individual periods reported in the ship logs during which the vessel was beset specifically due to dynamic pressure ice in total vessel transit disruption due to pressured drifting pack ice was reported to have occurred for a total of about 157 h 6 5 days during march 31 april 07 2012 during the 2012 besetting event the vessel was not always stationary and was at times drifting with the prevailing local pack ice drift direction the second besetting event recorded on the umiak i was not as severe as the first and lasted approximately 6 h this event occurred during april 02 01 00 07 00 2013 as the vessel became beset in heavily ridged and rubbled ice in the shear zone east of edward s cove at approximately 58 18 n 60 25 5 w see fig 1b for approximate location marked by green arrow fig 6 shows the mean regional wind a and surface current b speeds and directions surrounding the umiak i during the 2012 and 2013 besetting events during the besetting events the wind directions were more variable than the current directions and were primarily directed toward the sse the strongest winds of up to 8 ms 1 were directed toward the south to sse approximately parallel to the nw se oriented labrador coastline relatively weaker wind speeds were predominantly directed toward the se to east the ocean currents were directed mainly toward the sse to se approximately parallel to the labrador coast the strongest ocean currents of up to 0 4 ms 1 were directed toward the coastline to the sse fig 7 shows the mean regional sea ice drift speeds and directions surrounding the umiak i during the two besetting events the direction of the ice drift was mainly toward the south to se during the besetting events with the drift most heavily toward the sse and strongest in this direction up to 0 4 ms 1 and toward the coastline fig 8 shows the time series of the regional wind divergence and vorticity a surrounding the umiak i during the 2012 besetting event march 31 april 07 as well as the time series for the regional surface ocean current and ice divergence and vorticity b during this event the wind divergence around the umiak i was primarily negative during the 2012 event while the regional wind vorticity around the vessel was primarily positive the regional surface ocean current divergence throughout the 2012 event was mainly positive while the ice drift divergence tracked near the current divergence was slightly below mostly hovering near zero throughout the 2012 event the current vorticity however was mainly negative during the 2012 event and the ice vorticity again closely tracked the current field clockwise rotation during april 05 06 the current field vorticity dropped to its strongest negative value during the event which was correlated with a dip in the ice vorticity an order of magnitude less than the current vorticity on april 07 just prior to the end of the 2012 event the current and ice vorticities spiked to their maximum positive values it is therefore likely that the clockwise rotating current field played a significant role in forcing the clockwise regional ice field rotation which led to compression of the dynamic ice to the east of the shear zone against the edge of the land fast ice and hence the besetting event experienced by the umiak i fig 9 shows the time series of the regional wind divergence and vorticity a surrounding the umiak i during the 2013 besetting event april 07 01 00 07 00 as well as the time series for the regional surface ocean current and ice divergence and vorticity b during this event the wind divergence around the umiak i was entirely negative during the 2013 event while the regional wind vorticity around the vessel was entirely positive the regional surface ocean current divergence throughout the 2013 event was approximately constant and positive at around 0 5 10 4 s 1 while the ice drift divergence was constant and negative at about 0 6 10 4 s 1 the current vorticity remained at around the same value as the current divergence and the ice vorticity was positive counter clockwise at around 2 1 10 4 s 1 in the 2013 case it is possible that the regionally convergent wind field played a role in forcing the convergence of the local ice field fig 10 shows the average regional wind a and current b speeds and directions surrounding the umiak i throughout the entire 2010 2016 navigational record the vessel was generally subject to winds directed toward the east to sse and up to 14 ms 1 and ocean currents directed toward the sse to south and up to 0 7 ms 1 fig 11 shows the average regional ice drift speeds and directions surrounding the umiak i throughout the entire 2010 2016 navigational record the vessel was generally subject to ice drift directed toward the east to sse to south and up to 0 6 ms 1 fig 12 shows the average regional wind a and current b speed versus wind coast and current coast direction direction from the vessel to the nearest coastal point to the vessel surrounding the umiak i throughout the entire 2010 2016 navigational record wind coast and current coast direction values of zero indicate that the mean regional wind or current direction surrounding the vessel is directly toward the nearest coastal point to the vessel it is therefore assumed that wind coast and current coast direction values between 90 are likely to result in pack ice compression against the nearest coastline and therefore possibly a vessel besetting the results in fig 12 show that the wind directions during the besetting events were to within 90 of the nearest coastline for approximately 24 of the time and these winds ranged from about 3 0 ms 1 to 8 0 ms 1 the currents directions during the besetting events were to within 90 of the nearest coastline for approximately 33 of the time and these currents ranged from about 0 1 ms 1 to 0 4 ms 1 fig 13 displays average regional ice drift speed versus ice drift coast direction surrounding the umiak i throughout the entire 2010 2016 navigational record the results in fig 13 show that the ice drift directions relative to the nearest coastal point were within 90 for about 33 of the 2012 2013 besetting events the majority of the ice drift speeds during the besetting events were less than 0 2 ms 1 which is likely due to compression of the local ice field leading to relatively small drift speeds fig 14 shows histogram plots of the relative proportions of regional wind divergence values surrounding the umiak i from the 2010 2016 navigational record a as well as from the 2012 and 2013 besetting events b during 2010 2016 the umiak i was subjected mainly to weakly convergent winds negative divergence with a mean value of 1 9 10 3 s 1 during the besetting events the vessel was similarly subjected to mainly weakly convergent winds with an average value of 9 0 10 4 s 1 fig 15 shows histogram plots of the relative proportions of regional wind vorticities surrounding the umiak i from the 2010 2016 navigational record a as well as from the 2012 and 2013 besetting events b during 2010 2016 the umiak i was subjected mostly to a counter clockwise wind field positive vorticity with a mean value of 2 0 10 3 s 1 during the besetting events the vessel was similarly subjected to a mostly counter clockwise regional wind field with an average value of 2 2 10 3 s 1 as discussed earlier positive vorticity in the wind field would act to counteract compression in the local pack ice as the wind forcing combined with the rightward coriolis deflection on the ice would drive the ice radially outward and away from the vessel given this and the fact that the wind vorticities during the besetting events did not differ significantly from those experienced by the umiak i during 2010 2016 it is therefore unlikely that the wind field vorticity strongly influenced the occurrence of the besetting events fig 16 shows histogram plots of the relative proportions of the regional current divergences surrounding the umiak i from the 2010 2016 navigational record a as well as from the 2012 and 2013 besetting events b during 2010 2016 the umiak i was subjected mainly to weakly divergent currents positive divergence with a mean value of 5 1 10 6 s 1 during the besetting events the vessel was similarly subjected to mainly weakly divergent currents with an average value of 1 6 10 5 s 1 fig 17 shows histogram plots of the relative proportions of regional current vorticities surrounding the umiak i from the 2010 2016 navigational record a as well as from the 2012 and 2013 besetting events b during 2010 2016 the umiak i was subjected mostly to a clockwise current field negative vorticity with a mean value of 6 4 10 5 s 1 during the besetting events the vessel was similarly subjected to a mostly clockwise regional current field with an average value of 5 7 10 5 s 1 the negative vorticity in the current field would act to force compression in the local pack ice as the current drag forcing combined with the rightward coriolis deflection on the ice would drive the ice radially inward and against the vessel hull however given the fact that the current vorticities during the besetting events did not differ significantly from those experienced by the umiak i during 2010 2016 it is not conclusive that the negative current vorticities played a significant role in manifesting the besetting events fig 18 shows histogram plots of the relative proportions of the regional pack ice divergences surrounding the umiak i from the 2010 2016 navigational record a as well as from the 2012 and 2013 besetting events b during 2010 2016 the umiak i was subjected mainly to weakly convergent ice with a mean value of 4 9 10 7 s 1 during the besetting events the vessel was similarly subjected to mainly weakly convergent ice with an average value of 4 8 10 7 s 1 these data show that while the regional pack ice regime is mostly convergent during besetting events this is not a decisive factor in their occurrence it is likely that the regional ice concentration thickness and floe size must meet certain criteria in order for the convergent ice field to cause the vessel to become beset fig 19 shows histogram plots of the relative proportions of regional pack ice vorticities surrounding the umiak i from the 2010 2016 navigational record a as well as from the 2012 and 2013 besetting events b during 2010 2016 the umiak i was subjected mostly to a clockwise rotating pack ice field negative vorticity with a mean value of 1 3 10 4 s 1 during the besetting events the vessel was similarly subjected to a mostly clockwise rotating regional pack ice field with an average value of 2 7 10 5 s 1 the negative vorticity in the pack ice field during the besetting events is consistent with the convergence of this field as the rightward coriolis deflection on the clockwise rotating ice field would act to force the ice radially inward in the field however once again given the fact that the mainly negative ice vorticities during the besetting events did not differ significantly from those experienced by the umiak i during 2010 2016 it is probable that the negative ice vorticities had to combine with a critical set of pack ice concentrations thicknesses and floe sizes in order to manifest the besetting events fig 20 shows histogram plots of the relative proportions of the minimum distance from the umiak i to coast from the 2010 2016 navigational record a as well as during the 2012 and 2013 besetting events b these data reveal that the umiak i spent most of its 2010 2016 navigational record within 100 km of land with short periods up to 160 km from the nearest land during the two besetting events the vessel was within 95 km of the labrador coast given the fact these events took place in the shear zone in which dynamic pack ice abuts the offshore edge of the land fast ice it is apparent that the nearby presence of land fast ice provided an immovable boundary against which pack pressure could develop and impede ship navigation fig 21 shows histogram plots of the relative proportions of the total pack ice concentration at the location of the umiak i from the 2010 2016 navigational record a as well as during the 2012 and 2013 besetting events b the vessel transited through ice concentrations of 9 10 10ths for greater than 90 of its 2010 2016 navigational record and was subjected to these same ice concentrations during the two besetting events while a total ice concentration of at least 9 10ths is likely critical to the occurrence of besetting events it is clear that a high ice concentration is not a determining factor for an icebreaking vessel such as the umiak i fig 22 shows histogram plots of the relative proportions of the average pack ice thickness at the location of the umiak i from the 2010 2016 navigational record a as well as during the 2012 and 2013 besetting events b the vessel transited through ice thicknesses of 0 1 1 1 m during the 2010 2016 navigational record and more than 50 of this period was in ice thicknesses of at least 0 8 m during the besetting events the ship was in ice near the high end of the range as mean thicknesses were around 1 m similar to the total ice concentration ice thicknesses near the high end of the six year transit record range are most likely necessary for the occurrence of besetting events but both high ice concentrations and thicknesses do not by themselves lead to a high probability of besetting for the umiak i fig 23 shows histogram plots of the relative proportions of the average ice floe size at the location of the umiak i from the 2010 2016 navigational record a as well as during the 2012 and 2013 besetting events b the vessel encountered average floe sizes of less than 1000 m for greater than 70 of its six year navigational record however during the two besetting events it encountered mean floe sizes of greater than 3000 m more than 90 of the time and greater than 6000 m nearly 60 of the time this indicates that the presence of relatively large ice floes was most likely a critical factor in the occurrence of the besetting events note that in fig 14 through fig 23 there are different numbers of data points used for wind distance to the coast ocean current ice velocity and ice concentration thickness and floe size for wind figs 14 and 15 distance to the coast fig 20 and ice concentration fig 21 thickness fig 22 and floe size fig 23 2105 data points were available for the 2010 2016 period these points covered every ais and ship log position record from the vessel during this six year period however for ocean currents figs 16 and 17 and ice velocity figs 18 and 19 1745 data points were available during the same time period this is due to the fact that the umiak i spent a significant amount of time very near coastlines and these data are derived from reanalysis models which have insufficient spatial resolution to resolve data so close to the coastlines hence the data presented in fig 14 through fig 23 are normalized to percentages table 2 and table 3 provide summary statistics of the ice and metocean conditions surrounding the umiak i for the 2010 2016 navigational record and the 2012 and 2013 besetting events respectively the results in table 2 show that the ice conditions to which the umiak i was subjected during the 2010 2016 navigational record varied from 4 10ths total concentration up to complete 10 10ths coverage when the vessel was in ice but the time mean concentration of 9 10ths reveals that the vessel spent most of its time in close pack ice the average ice thickness varied from 10 cm to more than 1 m however the vessel transited mainly through the relatively thicker ice with an average thickness of 80 cm the umiak i encountered average floe sizes of greater than 1 km but also encountered a large range of floes between 10 m up to greater than 6 5 km the results in table 2 show that the umiak i was an average of 48 km from the nearest land during its 2010 2016 transit periods voyaging to within six to 160 km from land the regional mean winds around the vessel during these transit periods were often relatively calm with a time mean speed of 6 ms 1 and winds were most frequently within 90 of the coast similarly the regional mean surface currents and pack ice drift were relatively weak with mean speeds of 0 2 ms 1 and 0 1 ms 1 respectively and both were most frequently within 90 of the coast table 2 shows that the regional wind field divergence around the umiak i during 2010 2016 was mainly negative convergent while the wind field vorticity was positive counter clockwise on average in the presence of ice negative wind divergence would tend to force the ice radially inward toward the vessel while the positive vorticity would act to counteract this effect via the coriolis effect on the ice drift pattern the regional ocean current field divergence and vorticity surrounding the umiak i during 2010 2016 showed patterns which were on average opposite to those displayed by the wind field with a mainly positive current divergence and negative clockwise vorticity similar to the wind the opposing signs on the average current divergence and vorticity would tend to counteract one another with positively divergent currents forcing ice radially away from the vessel and negative vorticity in the current field forcing ice radially inward on the ship however the average divergence and vorticity in the pack ice drift around the umiak i during the six year navigational history were both negative indicating that ice was most frequently forced radially inward against the vessel hull the results in table 3 show that during the besetting events unsurprisingly the umiak i was consistently subjected to 9 10 10ths total ice concentration the average ice thickness during the besetting events was toward the high end of the 2010 2016 ice thickness distribution and was mainly around 1 m the mean floe size encountered by the umiak i during the besetting events was significantly greater than the average floe size encountered during the 2010 2016 navigational record by approximately five times the minimum average floe size during the besetting events was an order of magnitude greater than the 2010 2016 minimum and the maximum during the besetting events was the maximum of the entire six year navigational record at greater than 6 5 km it is likely that the larger floe sizes played a significant role in manifesting the besetting events as larger floes can exert greater pressures on ship hulls and will not locally deform and clear around a vessel in the same manner as smaller broken floes may do moreover ridge building which occurs in nature as a mechanism to relieve stress in the pack typically occurs at the interface between adjacent floes where irregular ice edges interact and break as the boundaries between a large floe and the surrounding ice cover would be further from the ship ice interface as depicted in fig 4 large floes would have more direct load paths through which collected wind momentum can be transferred into pressure on the hull correspondingly ice fields of the same areal extent but comprised of small ice floes would have more energy dissipation per unit area due to ridging at ice ice boundaries than would be expected for large ice floes the umiak i was 68 95 km from the nearest land during the besetting events the regional mean winds around the vessel during the events did not differ significantly in speed or direction relative to the coast when compared with the 2010 2016 record the regional mean surface currents were weaker on average compared with the six year record 0 1 ms 1 and were directed to within 90 of the nearest coastline the regional pack ice drift speed surrounding the vessel during the besetting events was on average about the same as during the 2010 2016 record 0 1 ms 1 but was most frequently not within 90 of the coast during the besetting events similar to the six year record the regional wind field divergence around the umiak i during the besetting events was on average negative convergent while the wind field vorticity was positive counter clockwise on average the regional ocean current field divergence and vorticity surrounding the umiak i during the besetting events were mainly positive and negative respectively the average divergence and vorticity in the pack ice drift around the umiak i during the besetting events were both negative 5 ice and metocean conditional criteria sets and besetting frequency based on an analysis of concurrent ice and metocean conditions during the 2012 and 2013 besetting events extracted from the 2010 2016 umiak i navigational record a full set of model criteria corresponding to the ice metocean conditions observed during the besetting events were obtained using the methodology described in section 3 and are listed as criteria set j 1 in table 4 the selected criteria were determined by first extracting the minimum total ice concentration mean thickness and mean floe size at the locations of the umiak i as well as the maximum distance from the vessel to the nearest coastline from the besetting events next the times at which the regional average winds and currents around the vessel were directed to within 90 of the nearest coastline during the besetting events were extracted as well as the minimum wind and current speeds during these periods finally the maximum positive values of the regional wind and current divergence and vorticity during the besetting events were extracted from the data to explore the effects of simplifying the model several reduced criteria sets e g j 2 6 were considered to assess the relative frequencies e g the besetting event occurrence rate given by equation 4 with which a given set of coincident ice and metocean criteria sets were associated the number of concurrent besetting and ice metocean condition events bc j and the total number of ice metocean condition events c j were calculated for the entire vessel navigation record for example if criteria set j 6 is used e g see table 4 which only considers ice concentration these criteria will result in the extraction of 193 concurrent besetting and ice metocean condition events from the umiak i ship log records n bc j 6 193 for the entire data record and 4 594 ice metocean events corresponding to these conditions e g 9 10ths total ice concentration at the location of the umiak i n c j 6 4594 for the entire six year data record applying equation 4 we can calculate the besetting rate as 6 r b j 6 n b c j 6 n c j 6 193 4594 0 04 this result in equation 6 may be interpreted as indicating that if an ice metocean event corresponding to the criteria set j 6 occurs we expect that there is a 4 chance that this ice metocean event would result in a besetting event for the umiak i this process was then applied for each criteria set and summarized in table 4 table 4 therefore represents a framework for a probabilistic model for prediction of besetting events for the umiak i the criteria sets are ranked in table 4 in descending order of their besetting event occurrence rates the table was constructed from the bottom up with each criteria set adding a condition to equation 3 the gray boxes in table 4 indicate that a parameter was not considered in that criteria set several features of these criteria sets and their besetting event occurrence rates are noteworthy the first is the predominant link the ice conditions alone have with the occurrence of besetting events when only the minimum ice concentration thickness and floe size during the besetting events are considered without regard to the wind and current conditions or the vessel distance to land 46 of their occurrence during the six year navigational record was during the besetting events e g criteria set j 4 furthermore when only minimum ice concentration and thickness during besetting are considered the occurrence of this criteria set j 5 during besetting accounts for only 17 of its occurrence during the 2010 2016 record which reinforces the probable strong influence of the minimum floe size 530 m on the causes behind the besetting events note that in table 4 pack ice drift parameters e g speed direction divergence and vorticity are not explicitly considered in the probabilistic calculations however the vessel besetting events are driven by the local ice dynamics surrounding the vessel which are ultimately controlled by the wind and current dynamics considered in the probabilistic prediction model shown here in addition the probabilistic model is designed to serve as a supplement to deterministic ice dynamic prediction models which already account for ice dynamics explicitly the ice and metocean conditional criteria sets in table 4 obviously do not cover all possible combinations of scenarios the criteria sets considered in table 4 were selected through the progressive addition of a single ice or metocean condition to the previous criteria set as one moves upward through the table so that the criteria set s besetting event occurrence rate would increase for criteria set j 1 the addition of more wind or current conditions e g wind vorticity and current divergence and vorticity was found not to increase the beset rate above 74 and in some cases decreased it to less than 46 this indicates that the ice conditions alone shown in criteria set j 4 are sufficient to predict a besetting event probability up to 46 rendering the extra metocean conditions superfluous to the model finally the work shown here represents only criteria sets which occurred during the 2012 and 2013 besetting events if the umiak i experiences more besetting events in the future under different combinational criteria sets of ice and metocean conditions then the list of criteria sets and ranges of ice and metocean conditions which occur during these events may table 4 may expand for example it may yet be possible for the umiak i to become beset under conditions of onshore winds or currents with speeds less than those shown in table 4 and in which the wind vorticity current divergence or current vorticity fields play a more critical role the model proposed in this paper as summarized in table 4 shares some similarities in the methodologies to the probabilistic models for predicting vessel besetting in pack ice presented in montewka et al 2013 and montewka et al 2015 the model proposed in montewka et al 2013 and montewka et al 2015 is based on an ais navigational dataset obtained for a single vessel an ice strengthened bulk carrier travelling between two ports similar to the present model while montewka et al 2013 and montewka et al 2015 obtain reanalysis ice parameters e g level rafted and ridged ice concentration thickness drift velocity and internal stress from a sea ice model the work presented here uses observed ice data obtained from operational ice charts derived from satellite imagery however the model presented in this paper does not explicitly consider ridged and rafted ice as no specific data on these parameters were available from either the umiak i ship logs or the ice charts while the umiak i ship logs noted the presence of ridged and rubbled ice during the 2013 besetting event they did not provide specific information on the thicknesses of these features or partial concentrations which are critical to the quantitative model presented in this paper in addition the present model for the umiak i does not explicitly account for vessel speed in ice as the montewka et al 2013 and montewka et al 2015 model does the present model does also not explicitly account for ice drift velocity or internal ice stress since these parameters come from the ice model used in montewka et al 2013 and montewka et al 2015 the montewka et al 2013 and montewka et al 2015 model accounts for wind and a parameter they term the relative direction of compression of the ice which they define as the angle between the ship s center line and the direction of the ice compression this is comparable to the present model which accounts for the direction of the wind relative to the nearest point along the coast to the ship see table 4 however there are four major parameters considered in the present model which are not considered in the work by montewka et al 2013 and montewka et al 2015 the montewka et al 2013 and montewka et al 2015 model does not account for regional ocean currents and wind field divergence nor does it consider ship distance to the coast and floe size the work shown here highlights the important role of large ice floes in the umiak i besetting events as well as the roles of onshore currents and convergent regional wind fields e g see table 4 6 conclusions and future work the results of the work presented in this paper represent a step toward the development of a probabilistic prediction model for besetting events experienced by the umiak i the ice and metocean criteria sets and their associated frequencies of occurrence during besetting events shown in table 4 are likely to change in the future as more navigational data from the umiak i becomes available probabilistic prediction models such as the one presented here improve in accuracy as the database on which they are built expands in order for the model to become operationally useful the criteria sets and associated probabilities presented in table 4 should be linked to deterministic metocean models which would provide short term e g one to three days forecasts of ice concentration and thickness as well as ice wind and current regional average speed direction relative to the nearest coast divergence and vorticity along planned voyage routes of the umiak i the design of table 4 allows it to be used under circumstances of variable availability of information for example if only forecast or observed data on ice conditions are available during a voyage operational use of the table could be limited to criteria sets j 3 6 the addition of reliable regional information on wind and ocean current conditions including wind field divergence would allow for criteria sets j 1 2 to be considered in making probabilistic forecasts of besetting for the vessel the analysis of the ice and metocean driven causes behind the two besetting events experienced by the umiak i in 2012 and 2013 reveals that the most probable causes were the relatively large ice floes encountered by the vessel in combination with a convergent regional wind field and onshore regional currents and winds this criteria set occurred during the besetting events for 74 of its overall occurrence during the 2010 2016 navigational record e g see table 4 criteria set j 1 the model presented here applies only to the umiak i as it utilizes navigational and besetting event data which are specific to the vessel s power and ice navigation capabilities a less powerful vessel than the umiak i would most likely have higher probabilities of experiencing besetting events in the ice and metocean criteria sets presented in table 4 and would probably have a greater range of such criteria sets in which it could experience besetting likewise a more powerful vessel than the umiak i would most likely be less vulnerable to besetting in the criteria sets presented in this paper and would become beset in a narrower range of conditions future work should not only focus on expanding the database on which the probabilistic model for the umiak i depends but additionally on building similar models for other vessels with different ice capabilities than the umiak i in addition future development of the model presented in this paper should incorporate in situ measured ice thickness data in particular measured thicknesses of ridged or rafted ice should be incorporated as well as ship crew observed partial concentrations of these features and any multi year or glacial ice ice velocity and associated ice field convergence data collected from marine radar products that track ice features and in situ from satellite tracked beacons can also be used for model verification acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge financial support for this work by hibernia management and development company ltd hmdc and meopar we thank dr adrienne tivy of cis for

22871,in the search for enhanced alternatives to the conventional footings of jack up platforms the offshore industry has turned to novel types of shallow foundations a recent hybrid foundation concept was proposed that merges a skirted footing with a deeper caisson with the motivation to mobilise higher bearing capacities and increase the foundation stiffness defining the behaviour of this hybrid foundation under combined vertical horizontal and moment loadings is crucial to understanding the overall response of the offshore structure this paper presents a study of the combined bearing capacity of a hybrid foundation system both experimentally and numerically centrifuge tests were performed at an acceleration of 200 times that of earth s gravity on three different hybrid foundations resting on soft clay and subjected to combined vertical horizontal and moment loads combined loads were applied using a novel apparatus which enables independent vertical horizontal and rotational movements of the footing then numerical studies were conducted by adopting the soil properties measured in the test experimental results revealed that the central caisson s dimension plays an important role in the determination of the combined bearing capacities it also showed that for skirted foundations the combined bearing capacity is nearly identical once the footing has been pushed to the depth of its skirt even if the vertical capacity is not fully preloaded when comparing the numerical and experimental prediction of the combined bearing capacity a reasonable agreement was achieved across all hybrid footing types keywords offshore engineering hybrid foundation systems combined loadings centrifuge 1 introduction foundations for offshore structures such as mobile jack up units are subjected to large horizontal h and moment m loads in addition to changing vertical loads v motivation to use jack up drilling platforms in deeper seas and in larger storms is now greater than ever and the design of the necessary foundation system has become challenging the capacity of traditional spudcan footings and therefore the jack up under combined loading is limited by the level of vertical preload that can be placed on the spudcan prior to operations following industrial guidelines iso 2012 with experimental discussion in among others vlahos et al 2008 bienen and cassidy 2009 this is limited by the amount of sea water that can be placed into the jack ups ballast tanks jack up operators would like the ability to mobilise higher bearing capacities without having to introduce more preload which is limited to the self weight of the jack up and any additional ballast that can be induced say from seawater and are therefore motivated to trial new foundation concepts one such option is the so called hybrid foundation bienen et al 2011 2012 gaudin et al 2011 and this is the focus of this study this concept combines a skirted mat with a suction caisson to enable self installation and suction induced preloading the potential benefits of the hybrid foundation include i additional vertical horizontal and moment capacities due to geometry and an ability to mobilise larger capacities without having to vertical preload the footing and ii increased stiffness and hence reduced displacement in all directions due to limited settlement accurate estimation of the bearing capacities under combined loading conditions of offshore foundations is essential for the site specific assessment iso 2012 required before the jack up deployment the vhm framework has been increasingly applied in recent years to define foundation capacities the overwhelming majority of the combined failure envelopes on a wide range of foundations systems have been defined by numerical small strain finite element ssfe analysis bienen et al 2011 e g bransby and randolph 1999a bransby and randolph 1999b gourvenec 2003 2007 2008 gourvenec and mana 2011 monajemi and razak 2009 zhang et al 2011a b with few comprehensively verified through experiments at an enhanced gravity field and within the full vhm space in response the study presented in this paper serves three main purposes first to experimentally quantify the potential increase in combined vhm capacity resulting from the addition of the central caisson in the proposed hybrid foundation concept second use the same ssfe techniques to establish the combined capacity of the hybrid foundation used in the centrifuge experiments and to provide a quantitative comparison between the numerical and experimental predictions of the yield surface under combined loadings and third to evaluate the effect of preloading levels on the yield surface 2 the hybrid foundation the present hybrid footing concept consists of a circular skirted footing equipped with a caisson at its centre tests were carried out on three different caisson geometries to explore how this affects the yield surface parameters as shown in fig 1 and fig 2 the hybrid foundation systems share the same circular skirted footing but varies in the caisson dimensions for instance hybrid foundation system hbf2 as shown in fig 1 has a skirted mat with diameter d m of 80 mm and skirt length d m of 10 mm the internal caisson is 35 mm in diameter dc and has a skirt length d c of 20 mm a thickness t of 0 75 mm was assumed for both the mat and the caisson skirts which gives an aspect ratio d m d m 0 125 3 experimental study 3 1 centrifuge and vhm apparatus a recently developed v h m apparatus was used in the experimental programme the conventional drum centrifuge configuration only allows two degree of freedom movement of a footing perpendicular to the vertical and horizontal plane on the footing w and u respectively a third degree of freedom movement was introduced enabling the footing to rotate in plane by adding another actuator on top of the existing actuator and connected through linkage arms and hinges when rotational movement is required the new and existing actuators move in opposite directions to develop a rotational angle θ meanwhile the entire tool table needs to move in the opposite vertical direction to compensate for the vertical displacement developed due to rotation fig 3 shows that the simultaneous motion of the two actuators and the tool table along a predefined moving path ensured that the centre of rotation remained at the lrp the time evolution of this series of motions was calculated by a specially designed program that was created using the ni labview interface national instrument corporation 2003 more details of the apparatus that was used in this experiment can be found in zhang et al 2013 and cheng and cassidy 2016a 2016b fig 4 shows the v h m apparatus incorporated in the drum centrifuge vertical and horizontal displacements of the model foundations are recorded by the encoders located on the motors driving the vertical and horizontal axes of the actuators a specific loading arm with a set of three pairs of strain gauges was used to simultaneously monitor the vertical horizontal and bending moment of the hybrid footing at the lrp fig 5 3 2 sign convention the sign convention for loads and displacements adopted here follows the standardised convention system proposed by butterfield et al 1997 loading of the foundation was applied by displacement control to a load reference point lrp at the centreline of the foundation at the mudline level the lrp position was maintained constant throughout the entire experiments the load was described by the horizontal translation u vertical translation w and rotation θ positive sign conventions are shown in fig 6 3 3 sample preparation and characterisation the first stage of the sample preparation was to place a geo fabric layer in the channel of the drum with strip drains reaching the surface to allow for two way drainage during consolidation of the seabed soil details of the kaolin clay used in the experiments can be found in table 1 the sample was prepared from dry kaolin to a water content of approximately twice the liquid limit 120 the slurry was then poured into the channel of the drum centrifuge at an acceleration of 40 gbefore being consolidated at 175 gwith an effective radius of 0 6 m from the centre point during a period of six days the drum centrifuge channel was topped up with clay slurry to compensate the consolidation settlements after the last top up the sample was spun at 200 gfor seven days to ensure complete self weight consolidation at the end of consolidation the consolidated sample height was approximately 150 mm after consolidation the sample was trimmed by 50 mm to create a lightly over consolidated sample with a non zero mudline shear strength continuous profiles of the undrained shear strength of the clay soil were obtained by performing t bar penetrometer tests in flight stewart et al 1994 developed the t bar penetrometer in a beam centrifuge to determine the strength of clay the shear strength can be calculated as follows 1 s u q t b a r n t b a r where q t b a r is the penetration resistance and n t b a r is the bearing factor the plasticity analysis suggests that the value of n t b a r ranges from 9 14 for a fully smooth interface to 11 94 for a fully rough interface because the t bar used in the centrifuge is neither fully smooth nor fully rough a value of 10 5 was adopted this value was derived through experimental evidence for a range of material types stress histories and stress levels e g low et al 2011 the t bar penetrometer was driven at 1 mm s ensuring undrained conditions by satisfying the non dimensional expression recommended by finnie 1993 2 v d c v 30 where v is the velocity d is the width of the t bar and c v the consolidation coefficient of the soil sample to maintain an undisturbed testing area the spacing between each foundation test was 1 5 diameters t bar test locations were randomly chosen with the restriction of at least two t bar lengths to the next test position five t bar tests were conducted prior to testing with hybrid foundations and one additional test was also conducted immediately after testing the sample s undrained shear strength can be approximated with a linear function as 3 s u 1 44 z 200 5 34 where z is the model depth in mm and s u is given in kpa the soil channel spun continuously during the testing period to avoid swelling of the clay 3 4 experimental procedures three different types of tests were performed featuring two different tests stages as follows 1 vertical penetration test the hybrid foundation was vertically penetrated in flight at a dimensionless velocity of approximately 245 with c v 6 3 10 8 m 2 s ensuring undrained behaviour of the clay the dimensionless velocity is defined as v d c v where v is the penetration velocity 0 1 mm s d is the outer diameter of the hybrid footing d d m and c v the consolidation factor which is a measure of the rate at which the consolidation process proceeds the pure vertical load tests were performed to evaluate the vertical capacity of the hybrid foundation when the load reference point is at the soil surface i e the lid touches the soil surface further details will be provided with the experimental results 2 combined swipe test following vertical penetration displacements were applied which followed different paths identified by different u d m θ ratios through various ratios of δu to δθ whilst keeping δw 0 the measured combined vhm loads once adjusted for elasticity and rig stiffness provided a track along the yield surface all tests were performed under displacement control 3 5 testing programme the testing programme designed in the current study included 3 vertical load tests and 27 swipe tests to determine the combined yield surface of the hybrid foundation table 2 and table 3 present all tests grouped according to their types along with information about the applied ratios of displacements the u and θ values are the actual measured horizontal and rotational displacements respectively fig 5 3 6 experimental results although all three footings have been tested only selected results for hbf2 are presented here in detail the tests heighted in bold in table 2 the displacement paths followed and load paths recorded for tests hbf2 sw8 and hbf2 sw14 are illustrated in figs 8 11 all plots are presented either in model dimensions to explicitly describe the hybrid foundation response or in dimensionless form to generalise the results to any hybrid foundation dimensions to scale model dimensions to prototype dimensions displacements can be multiplied by the centrifugal acceleration of 200 and loads by 2002 see garnier et al 2007 for details 3 7 vertical load test fig 8 presents the typical load penetration curve throughout the entire swipe process for test hbf2 v1 for the first 10 mm of penetration only the inner skirts are in contact with the soil as shown on the right hand side of fig 8 frictional resistance of the inner skirts results only in minimal measured vertical load following this the outer skirts tips penetrate through the mudline and further resistance from the outer caisson is recorded the bottom of the footing plate touching the surface records the significant increase in vertical resistance starting at 18 mm of penetration in fig 8 noting that this is lower than the skirt length of 20 mm and shows that some soil is pushed inside the caisson by the skirts and or that the centrifuge test surface is not perfectly flat this ability to mobilise this additional vertical capacity is the motivation of why the hybrid foundation may be of practical use in the physical experiment this vertical resistance is mobilised over a few millimetres and showing that even kaolin clay soils are not perfectly plastic and loads need to be mobilised if soil was however defined as a perfectly plastic material this ultimate vertical load representing a full contact on the bottom side of the footing would happen instantaneously and we would call this the ultimate vertical capacity for the hybrid foundation with when the lrp at the seabed this could be easily calculated numerically using small strain finite element analysis as is described in the latter sections of this paper experimentally it was identified as illustrated in fig 8 as the intersection of the rapid increase due to mobilising the bottom plate and the latter less rapid linear increase due to the footing penetrating into soil of increasing strength with depth in test hbf2 v1 the footing was penetrated to a maximum vertical load of 549 n enabling identification of the ultimate vertical capacity of 470 n as illustrated in fig 8 it is noted that the ultimate is at a penetration of 20 mm the position where the plate should be fully contacted with the surface using the same methodology the ultimate capacity for the hbf1 and hbf3 footings when the footings base plate touches the surface were measured as 267 n and 283 n from tests hbf1 v1 and hbf3 v1 respectively these values are defined as v0 for the lrp at the surface and are used in the normalisation in the remainder of the paper this is consistent with the definition of the vertical bearing capacity of the footing at the current penetration of martin and houlsby 2000 and used in the same way for caisson footings in clay by cassidy et al 2004 cassidy et al 2006 3 8 swipe test swipe tests aimed to define the full v h m surface tests were mainly conducted from the pure vertical bearing capacity for the base plate at the mudline v 0 these are tests hbf2 sw1 to sw9 table 2 and all of the swipe tests for geometries hbf1 and hbf3 table 3 a series of tests were conducted on hybrid footing hbf2 from approximately half of the vertical load capacity at the mudline targeted 0 5v0 for tests hbf2 sw10 to sw14 table 2 this was to see if the same combined loading capacity is mobilised even if the footing is not preloaded to the full vertical capacity as this has advantages offshore in that less self weight and ballast would be needed the vertical response recorded for swipe test hbf2 sw8 is shown on fig 9 the swipe was conducted from 478 n close to the targeted 470 n the region of swipe tests hbf2 sw10 to sw14 is indicated in fig 9 for illustration fig 10 shows the horizontal load displacement response fig 10a and the corresponding vertical load against the horizontal load fig 10b which is representative of a yield surface tan 1990 during the swipe phase for tests hbf2 sw8 and hbf2 sw14 to observe the pressure change during the swipe the experimental results were normalised by d m the diameter of the foundation or a the total area of the foundation π d m 2 4 during the swipe event the horizontal load increased as the vertical load decreased at the end of the swipe both tests with v s w i p e v 0 and v s w i p e 0 5 v 0 achieved a peak horizontal load of approximately 90 n this indicates that the capacity of the hybrid footing is a function of the loads that can be fully mobilised at that embedment which is a function of the vertical v 0 capacity this is consistent with the experimental results for a single caisson in clay as shown in cassidy et al 2004 fig 11 presents the rotational load rotation response fig 11a and the corresponding vertical load against the rotational load fig 11b during the swipe phase as expected a similar trend was observed both the translation and rotation responses were applied with a constant ratio u d m θ 0 859 during the entire swipe phase at the end of the swipe both tests with v s w i p e v 0 and v s w i p e 0 5 v 0 achieved a normalised peak moment load of approximately 12 n fig 12 is the dimensionless load path in h m d m plane of the swipe test executed at u d m θ 0 859 for both swipes v s w i p e v 0 and v s w i p e 0 5 v 0 it can be observed that the shape of the two curves are almost identical but of different sizes with tests hbf2 sw14 exhibiting a peak normalised moment value of 0 052 against 0 039 for test hbf2 sw8 the value difference is due to the initial bending moment obtained prior to the test gottardi et al 1999 and byrne and houlsby 2001 derived a three dimensional yield surface from experimental swipe tests in a 1 g environment vlahos et al 2008 extended the yield surface originally proposed by martin and houlsby 2000 to allow tension capacity the vlahos et al 2008 equation was used here to interpret the current test results as follows 4 f h h 0 v 0 2 m d m m 0 v 0 2 2 α h m d m h 0 m 0 v 0 2 4 1 x 2 2 v v 0 x 2 1 v v 0 2 0 where v 0 is the apex of the surface and is determined by the vertical bearing capacity of the footing at the particular penetration and for all the cases in this paper this is for the bottom of the footing plate at the surface lrp 0 fig 6 h 0 and m 0 determine the yield surface intersection with the horizontal and moment directions respectively α is the eccentricity of the surface in the h m d m plane and x is the ratio of the peak vertical tensile capacity to the peak compressive capacity using a least squares regression calculation the best fit parameters are listed in table 4 fig 14 shows the load paths of all swipe tests projected onto the h m d m plane in each swipe test data points were coloured and highlighted separately in accordance to their specific v v 0 ratios v v 0 0 8 v v 0 0 7 etc meanwhile the theoretical yield surfaces equation 4 at the same v v 0 ratios were represented with solid lines exhibit the same colour it can be seen that the experimental results show a reasonable agreement with the surface described by equation 4 validating the best fit parameters presented in table 4 fig 13 a compares the deviatoric bearing capacities of hbf1 hbf2 with same caisson length and hbf2 hbf3 with same caisson diameter respectively see fig 15 the results illustrated that both the caisson skirt length and caisson diameter played an important effect in increasing horizontal capacity such increase appear to be linearly proportional to the caisson length and diameter increase the increase in ultimate moment capacity however is limited in comparison to the increase in ultimate horizontal capacity this observation is in line with the preliminary finite element investigation presented by bienen et al 2011 by defining a non dimensional term q cassidy et al 2002 that represents the combined h and m behaviour as q h h 0 2 m d m m 0 2 2 α h m d m h 0 m 0 the h m data can be collapsed into a generalised q plane and a direct comparison with the theoretical equation can be established this q load path is shown in fig 14 against the vertical load v for all hybrid footings tested the yield surface shape is also fit adequately as written as 5 f q v 0 2 4 1 x 2 2 v v 0 1 v v 0 2 0 and shown in fig 14 to further support the good agreement achieved on seeking those best fit parameters fig 16 extents the comparison between the measured data and the proposed yield surface for hbf2 from two dimensional space to normalised three dimensional space again a great consistency can be observed demonstrating the shape parameters provided in table 4 are adequate 4 numerical studies 4 1 finite element model the soil was modelled with shear strength increasing linearly as a linearly elastic perfectly plastic material obeying the tresca criterion all analyses presented in this paper were carried out by using the finite element software package abaqus 6 9 dassault systèmes 2009 soil strength parameters were chosen to match those measured in the complementary centrifuge tests with k 1 44 kpa m and s u m 5 34 kpa the soil was assigned an effective unit weight γ of 5 7 kn m3 the shear strength at the footing reference point fig 6 denoted s u 0 in this case coincides with s u m the undrained young s modulus e u was selected to provide a constant rigidity index of e u s u 1000 to avoid numerical problems an undrained poisson s ratio ν u of 0 49 which indicates near incompressibility was applied to the soil model the foundation itself was described as a rigid body which does not undergo any deformation with loads ad displacements relating to a single reference point rp in the current study both the numerical simulation and the physical testing were performed in three dimensional v h m space so the 3d nature of the problem has been taken into account and a comprehensive comparison can be carried out 4 2 meshes and validation the model was analysed using a semi cylindrical model the size of the soil domain was chosen to be 5d d is the footing diameter d m in width and 4d in height to avoid any boundary effects to increase the confidence in the numerical results the soil mesh was optimised and validated by comparing the results with known solutions for a circular plate gourvenec and mana 2011 and for a skirted mat with d d 0 2 gourvenec and randolph 2003 the same meshing principles were then applied to the hybrid foundation in this study using the current mesh together with a reproduced circular plate model of the same geometry the prediction for the vertical bearing capacity factor was 7 11 compared to 7 14 reported by gourvenec and mana 2011 which is only a 0 4 difference a circular plate model was developed to verify the ultimate horizontal and moment calculations comparing the predicted results to the results from gourvenec and randolph 2003 there is a 2 difference in predicting the ultimate horizontal load and a 4 difference in predicting the moment load these results demonstrate the accuracy of the fe model compared to other published solutions fig 17 shows the mesh discretisation of the model the soil model consists of approximately 49000 first order hexahedral c3d8 elements the contact surface between the footing and soil was assumed to be fully rough to reduce the computational cost the mesh was only enhanced within the 1d distance horizontally measured from the tip of the skirt and the 1d distance measured vertically from the tip of the caisson resulting in a very fine mesh around the skirt tips where stress concentrations were expected the width of the closest elements next to the skirt or caisson tip is 0 58 of the footing diameter and was kept consistent for all three foundation models 4 3 loading path as a small strain analysis the installation process was not modelled in this study instead the footing was assumed to be in place prior to the simulation in this study a displacement controlled probe test was used to identify the uniaxial horizontal vertical and moment capacity of the hybrid foundation as suggested by bransby and randolph 1997 controlled displacements w u θ as opposed to directly applied loads v h and m were imposed on the footing system lrp for the combined load cases then the yield envelopes were established by applying combined displacement ratios where each analysis followed a specific displacement ratio different to the experiment ones until foundation failure was observed the last loci of the loads of the displacement probes were used to create the failure envelopes 4 4 numerical results a total of 45 analyses were performed for all three hybrid foundation types fig 18 and fig 19 present the failure envelopes derived from the hybrid foundation hbf2 in the v h and v m d m planes respectively the outermost curves in both figures correspond to the ultimate limit states under combined horizontal and vertical load or vertical and moment load the failure envelope was established by connecting the end failure loads of the probe tests see fig 20 5 results comparison and discussion in this section the experimental and numerical results are compared in normalised v h and v m d m planes respectively by means of peak horizontal and moment loads the fully bonded foundation soil interface forces a symmetrical failure mechanism which is in agreement with the assumption of the contact surface being fully rough as shown in fig 18 the comparison between the experimental and the numerical yield surfaces shows a maximum discrepancy of 23 9 in the uniaxial horizontal capacity as shown in fig 18 similarly to the v h space there is a significant discrepancy between the experimental and numerical yield envelopes in the v m space the uniaxial moment capacity is over predicted by the numerical analysis by about 16 2 resulting in the experimental yield envelope sitting consistently below the numerical one integrating figs 16 and 17 gives combined yield envelope in the h m d m plane for hbf2 as shown in fig 18 further comparison across all hybrid foundations with respect to horizontal and moment bearing capacities are listed in table 5 to better observe the discrepancies reported in table 5 the results are also presented graphically in fig 21 the reasons why the experimentally measured vhm surfaces are slightly smaller than the numerically derived are the installation process causes disturbance of the clay soil experimentally this was also observed between experiments and ssfe on a deep embedded spudcan footing on soft clay see zhang et al 2014 in fact in the deeply buried spudcan case the discrepancy between the numerical predictions and experimental measurements was larger consistent with the fact that the hybrid installations of this paper were shallower and caused less soil disturbances during the installation process than that of the deep embedded footings the assumption of fully bonded contact behaviour between foundation and soil assumed in the fe analyses is producing higher capacities for all three hybrid footings such an assumption is un conservative considering the soil strength may be significantly reduced due to the effect of progressive strain softening from intact state to remoulded state among all three footing types hbf3 which has the lowest aspect ratio exhibits the closest match between the experimental and numerical predictions this is consistent that it causes less disturbance experimentally and has least contact area numerically table 5 comparison between numerical and experimental prediction of the bearing capacities 5 conclusions centrifuge testing and small strain finite element analyses were performed to determine the monotonic yield envelope for a hybrid foundation system resting on undrained non uniform clay soil centrifuge swipe tests were conducted using the new v h m actuator developed at uwa to investigate the combined yield surface of a hybrid foundation system an analytical expression was proposed to describe the entire v h m yield surface of the hybrid foundation system featuring one central suction caisson the maximum h and m capacities were independent of the initial vertical load applied provided the skirt of the mat is fully embedded a significant increase in capacity was observed in all directions compared to a circular skirted mat of the same size due to the inclusion of the caisson the present study has shown that both the caisson skirt length and caisson diameter played an important effect in increasing horizontal capacity such increase appear to be linearly proportional to the caisson length and diameter increase the increase in ultimate moment capacity is limited in comparison to the increase in ultimate horizontal capacity the small strain finite element method is a reasonably effective method for preliminarily assessing the yield surface reasonable agreement can be achieved between numerical and experimental models however the results are unconservative when compared with the experimental data with maximum 23 9 discrepancy the deviatoric bearing capacities are nearly identical for different preload levels once the footing has been pushed to the depth of its skirt this has major advantageous offshore as the foundation can be designed to push the skirts fully into the soil using the self weight of the jack up and ballast however additional combined loading capacity is available without having to preload the full vertical capacity of the base plate further vertical and combined loading capacity could be derived by holding the preload for a period of time as a self weight or possibly with active suction through the caisson this has not been studied here but some indication of additional vertical capacity gained with time is provided amongst others in stanier et al 2014 bienen et al 2015 and fu et al 2015 acknowledgements the work described in this

22871,in the search for enhanced alternatives to the conventional footings of jack up platforms the offshore industry has turned to novel types of shallow foundations a recent hybrid foundation concept was proposed that merges a skirted footing with a deeper caisson with the motivation to mobilise higher bearing capacities and increase the foundation stiffness defining the behaviour of this hybrid foundation under combined vertical horizontal and moment loadings is crucial to understanding the overall response of the offshore structure this paper presents a study of the combined bearing capacity of a hybrid foundation system both experimentally and numerically centrifuge tests were performed at an acceleration of 200 times that of earth s gravity on three different hybrid foundations resting on soft clay and subjected to combined vertical horizontal and moment loads combined loads were applied using a novel apparatus which enables independent vertical horizontal and rotational movements of the footing then numerical studies were conducted by adopting the soil properties measured in the test experimental results revealed that the central caisson s dimension plays an important role in the determination of the combined bearing capacities it also showed that for skirted foundations the combined bearing capacity is nearly identical once the footing has been pushed to the depth of its skirt even if the vertical capacity is not fully preloaded when comparing the numerical and experimental prediction of the combined bearing capacity a reasonable agreement was achieved across all hybrid footing types keywords offshore engineering hybrid foundation systems combined loadings centrifuge 1 introduction foundations for offshore structures such as mobile jack up units are subjected to large horizontal h and moment m loads in addition to changing vertical loads v motivation to use jack up drilling platforms in deeper seas and in larger storms is now greater than ever and the design of the necessary foundation system has become challenging the capacity of traditional spudcan footings and therefore the jack up under combined loading is limited by the level of vertical preload that can be placed on the spudcan prior to operations following industrial guidelines iso 2012 with experimental discussion in among others vlahos et al 2008 bienen and cassidy 2009 this is limited by the amount of sea water that can be placed into the jack ups ballast tanks jack up operators would like the ability to mobilise higher bearing capacities without having to introduce more preload which is limited to the self weight of the jack up and any additional ballast that can be induced say from seawater and are therefore motivated to trial new foundation concepts one such option is the so called hybrid foundation bienen et al 2011 2012 gaudin et al 2011 and this is the focus of this study this concept combines a skirted mat with a suction caisson to enable self installation and suction induced preloading the potential benefits of the hybrid foundation include i additional vertical horizontal and moment capacities due to geometry and an ability to mobilise larger capacities without having to vertical preload the footing and ii increased stiffness and hence reduced displacement in all directions due to limited settlement accurate estimation of the bearing capacities under combined loading conditions of offshore foundations is essential for the site specific assessment iso 2012 required before the jack up deployment the vhm framework has been increasingly applied in recent years to define foundation capacities the overwhelming majority of the combined failure envelopes on a wide range of foundations systems have been defined by numerical small strain finite element ssfe analysis bienen et al 2011 e g bransby and randolph 1999a bransby and randolph 1999b gourvenec 2003 2007 2008 gourvenec and mana 2011 monajemi and razak 2009 zhang et al 2011a b with few comprehensively verified through experiments at an enhanced gravity field and within the full vhm space in response the study presented in this paper serves three main purposes first to experimentally quantify the potential increase in combined vhm capacity resulting from the addition of the central caisson in the proposed hybrid foundation concept second use the same ssfe techniques to establish the combined capacity of the hybrid foundation used in the centrifuge experiments and to provide a quantitative comparison between the numerical and experimental predictions of the yield surface under combined loadings and third to evaluate the effect of preloading levels on the yield surface 2 the hybrid foundation the present hybrid footing concept consists of a circular skirted footing equipped with a caisson at its centre tests were carried out on three different caisson geometries to explore how this affects the yield surface parameters as shown in fig 1 and fig 2 the hybrid foundation systems share the same circular skirted footing but varies in the caisson dimensions for instance hybrid foundation system hbf2 as shown in fig 1 has a skirted mat with diameter d m of 80 mm and skirt length d m of 10 mm the internal caisson is 35 mm in diameter dc and has a skirt length d c of 20 mm a thickness t of 0 75 mm was assumed for both the mat and the caisson skirts which gives an aspect ratio d m d m 0 125 3 experimental study 3 1 centrifuge and vhm apparatus a recently developed v h m apparatus was used in the experimental programme the conventional drum centrifuge configuration only allows two degree of freedom movement of a footing perpendicular to the vertical and horizontal plane on the footing w and u respectively a third degree of freedom movement was introduced enabling the footing to rotate in plane by adding another actuator on top of the existing actuator and connected through linkage arms and hinges when rotational movement is required the new and existing actuators move in opposite directions to develop a rotational angle θ meanwhile the entire tool table needs to move in the opposite vertical direction to compensate for the vertical displacement developed due to rotation fig 3 shows that the simultaneous motion of the two actuators and the tool table along a predefined moving path ensured that the centre of rotation remained at the lrp the time evolution of this series of motions was calculated by a specially designed program that was created using the ni labview interface national instrument corporation 2003 more details of the apparatus that was used in this experiment can be found in zhang et al 2013 and cheng and cassidy 2016a 2016b fig 4 shows the v h m apparatus incorporated in the drum centrifuge vertical and horizontal displacements of the model foundations are recorded by the encoders located on the motors driving the vertical and horizontal axes of the actuators a specific loading arm with a set of three pairs of strain gauges was used to simultaneously monitor the vertical horizontal and bending moment of the hybrid footing at the lrp fig 5 3 2 sign convention the sign convention for loads and displacements adopted here follows the standardised convention system proposed by butterfield et al 1997 loading of the foundation was applied by displacement control to a load reference point lrp at the centreline of the foundation at the mudline level the lrp position was maintained constant throughout the entire experiments the load was described by the horizontal translation u vertical translation w and rotation θ positive sign conventions are shown in fig 6 3 3 sample preparation and characterisation the first stage of the sample preparation was to place a geo fabric layer in the channel of the drum with strip drains reaching the surface to allow for two way drainage during consolidation of the seabed soil details of the kaolin clay used in the experiments can be found in table 1 the sample was prepared from dry kaolin to a water content of approximately twice the liquid limit 120 the slurry was then poured into the channel of the drum centrifuge at an acceleration of 40 gbefore being consolidated at 175 gwith an effective radius of 0 6 m from the centre point during a period of six days the drum centrifuge channel was topped up with clay slurry to compensate the consolidation settlements after the last top up the sample was spun at 200 gfor seven days to ensure complete self weight consolidation at the end of consolidation the consolidated sample height was approximately 150 mm after consolidation the sample was trimmed by 50 mm to create a lightly over consolidated sample with a non zero mudline shear strength continuous profiles of the undrained shear strength of the clay soil were obtained by performing t bar penetrometer tests in flight stewart et al 1994 developed the t bar penetrometer in a beam centrifuge to determine the strength of clay the shear strength can be calculated as follows 1 s u q t b a r n t b a r where q t b a r is the penetration resistance and n t b a r is the bearing factor the plasticity analysis suggests that the value of n t b a r ranges from 9 14 for a fully smooth interface to 11 94 for a fully rough interface because the t bar used in the centrifuge is neither fully smooth nor fully rough a value of 10 5 was adopted this value was derived through experimental evidence for a range of material types stress histories and stress levels e g low et al 2011 the t bar penetrometer was driven at 1 mm s ensuring undrained conditions by satisfying the non dimensional expression recommended by finnie 1993 2 v d c v 30 where v is the velocity d is the width of the t bar and c v the consolidation coefficient of the soil sample to maintain an undisturbed testing area the spacing between each foundation test was 1 5 diameters t bar test locations were randomly chosen with the restriction of at least two t bar lengths to the next test position five t bar tests were conducted prior to testing with hybrid foundations and one additional test was also conducted immediately after testing the sample s undrained shear strength can be approximated with a linear function as 3 s u 1 44 z 200 5 34 where z is the model depth in mm and s u is given in kpa the soil channel spun continuously during the testing period to avoid swelling of the clay 3 4 experimental procedures three different types of tests were performed featuring two different tests stages as follows 1 vertical penetration test the hybrid foundation was vertically penetrated in flight at a dimensionless velocity of approximately 245 with c v 6 3 10 8 m 2 s ensuring undrained behaviour of the clay the dimensionless velocity is defined as v d c v where v is the penetration velocity 0 1 mm s d is the outer diameter of the hybrid footing d d m and c v the consolidation factor which is a measure of the rate at which the consolidation process proceeds the pure vertical load tests were performed to evaluate the vertical capacity of the hybrid foundation when the load reference point is at the soil surface i e the lid touches the soil surface further details will be provided with the experimental results 2 combined swipe test following vertical penetration displacements were applied which followed different paths identified by different u d m θ ratios through various ratios of δu to δθ whilst keeping δw 0 the measured combined vhm loads once adjusted for elasticity and rig stiffness provided a track along the yield surface all tests were performed under displacement control 3 5 testing programme the testing programme designed in the current study included 3 vertical load tests and 27 swipe tests to determine the combined yield surface of the hybrid foundation table 2 and table 3 present all tests grouped according to their types along with information about the applied ratios of displacements the u and θ values are the actual measured horizontal and rotational displacements respectively fig 5 3 6 experimental results although all three footings have been tested only selected results for hbf2 are presented here in detail the tests heighted in bold in table 2 the displacement paths followed and load paths recorded for tests hbf2 sw8 and hbf2 sw14 are illustrated in figs 8 11 all plots are presented either in model dimensions to explicitly describe the hybrid foundation response or in dimensionless form to generalise the results to any hybrid foundation dimensions to scale model dimensions to prototype dimensions displacements can be multiplied by the centrifugal acceleration of 200 and loads by 2002 see garnier et al 2007 for details 3 7 vertical load test fig 8 presents the typical load penetration curve throughout the entire swipe process for test hbf2 v1 for the first 10 mm of penetration only the inner skirts are in contact with the soil as shown on the right hand side of fig 8 frictional resistance of the inner skirts results only in minimal measured vertical load following this the outer skirts tips penetrate through the mudline and further resistance from the outer caisson is recorded the bottom of the footing plate touching the surface records the significant increase in vertical resistance starting at 18 mm of penetration in fig 8 noting that this is lower than the skirt length of 20 mm and shows that some soil is pushed inside the caisson by the skirts and or that the centrifuge test surface is not perfectly flat this ability to mobilise this additional vertical capacity is the motivation of why the hybrid foundation may be of practical use in the physical experiment this vertical resistance is mobilised over a few millimetres and showing that even kaolin clay soils are not perfectly plastic and loads need to be mobilised if soil was however defined as a perfectly plastic material this ultimate vertical load representing a full contact on the bottom side of the footing would happen instantaneously and we would call this the ultimate vertical capacity for the hybrid foundation with when the lrp at the seabed this could be easily calculated numerically using small strain finite element analysis as is described in the latter sections of this paper experimentally it was identified as illustrated in fig 8 as the intersection of the rapid increase due to mobilising the bottom plate and the latter less rapid linear increase due to the footing penetrating into soil of increasing strength with depth in test hbf2 v1 the footing was penetrated to a maximum vertical load of 549 n enabling identification of the ultimate vertical capacity of 470 n as illustrated in fig 8 it is noted that the ultimate is at a penetration of 20 mm the position where the plate should be fully contacted with the surface using the same methodology the ultimate capacity for the hbf1 and hbf3 footings when the footings base plate touches the surface were measured as 267 n and 283 n from tests hbf1 v1 and hbf3 v1 respectively these values are defined as v0 for the lrp at the surface and are used in the normalisation in the remainder of the paper this is consistent with the definition of the vertical bearing capacity of the footing at the current penetration of martin and houlsby 2000 and used in the same way for caisson footings in clay by cassidy et al 2004 cassidy et al 2006 3 8 swipe test swipe tests aimed to define the full v h m surface tests were mainly conducted from the pure vertical bearing capacity for the base plate at the mudline v 0 these are tests hbf2 sw1 to sw9 table 2 and all of the swipe tests for geometries hbf1 and hbf3 table 3 a series of tests were conducted on hybrid footing hbf2 from approximately half of the vertical load capacity at the mudline targeted 0 5v0 for tests hbf2 sw10 to sw14 table 2 this was to see if the same combined loading capacity is mobilised even if the footing is not preloaded to the full vertical capacity as this has advantages offshore in that less self weight and ballast would be needed the vertical response recorded for swipe test hbf2 sw8 is shown on fig 9 the swipe was conducted from 478 n close to the targeted 470 n the region of swipe tests hbf2 sw10 to sw14 is indicated in fig 9 for illustration fig 10 shows the horizontal load displacement response fig 10a and the corresponding vertical load against the horizontal load fig 10b which is representative of a yield surface tan 1990 during the swipe phase for tests hbf2 sw8 and hbf2 sw14 to observe the pressure change during the swipe the experimental results were normalised by d m the diameter of the foundation or a the total area of the foundation π d m 2 4 during the swipe event the horizontal load increased as the vertical load decreased at the end of the swipe both tests with v s w i p e v 0 and v s w i p e 0 5 v 0 achieved a peak horizontal load of approximately 90 n this indicates that the capacity of the hybrid footing is a function of the loads that can be fully mobilised at that embedment which is a function of the vertical v 0 capacity this is consistent with the experimental results for a single caisson in clay as shown in cassidy et al 2004 fig 11 presents the rotational load rotation response fig 11a and the corresponding vertical load against the rotational load fig 11b during the swipe phase as expected a similar trend was observed both the translation and rotation responses were applied with a constant ratio u d m θ 0 859 during the entire swipe phase at the end of the swipe both tests with v s w i p e v 0 and v s w i p e 0 5 v 0 achieved a normalised peak moment load of approximately 12 n fig 12 is the dimensionless load path in h m d m plane of the swipe test executed at u d m θ 0 859 for both swipes v s w i p e v 0 and v s w i p e 0 5 v 0 it can be observed that the shape of the two curves are almost identical but of different sizes with tests hbf2 sw14 exhibiting a peak normalised moment value of 0 052 against 0 039 for test hbf2 sw8 the value difference is due to the initial bending moment obtained prior to the test gottardi et al 1999 and byrne and houlsby 2001 derived a three dimensional yield surface from experimental swipe tests in a 1 g environment vlahos et al 2008 extended the yield surface originally proposed by martin and houlsby 2000 to allow tension capacity the vlahos et al 2008 equation was used here to interpret the current test results as follows 4 f h h 0 v 0 2 m d m m 0 v 0 2 2 α h m d m h 0 m 0 v 0 2 4 1 x 2 2 v v 0 x 2 1 v v 0 2 0 where v 0 is the apex of the surface and is determined by the vertical bearing capacity of the footing at the particular penetration and for all the cases in this paper this is for the bottom of the footing plate at the surface lrp 0 fig 6 h 0 and m 0 determine the yield surface intersection with the horizontal and moment directions respectively α is the eccentricity of the surface in the h m d m plane and x is the ratio of the peak vertical tensile capacity to the peak compressive capacity using a least squares regression calculation the best fit parameters are listed in table 4 fig 14 shows the load paths of all swipe tests projected onto the h m d m plane in each swipe test data points were coloured and highlighted separately in accordance to their specific v v 0 ratios v v 0 0 8 v v 0 0 7 etc meanwhile the theoretical yield surfaces equation 4 at the same v v 0 ratios were represented with solid lines exhibit the same colour it can be seen that the experimental results show a reasonable agreement with the surface described by equation 4 validating the best fit parameters presented in table 4 fig 13 a compares the deviatoric bearing capacities of hbf1 hbf2 with same caisson length and hbf2 hbf3 with same caisson diameter respectively see fig 15 the results illustrated that both the caisson skirt length and caisson diameter played an important effect in increasing horizontal capacity such increase appear to be linearly proportional to the caisson length and diameter increase the increase in ultimate moment capacity however is limited in comparison to the increase in ultimate horizontal capacity this observation is in line with the preliminary finite element investigation presented by bienen et al 2011 by defining a non dimensional term q cassidy et al 2002 that represents the combined h and m behaviour as q h h 0 2 m d m m 0 2 2 α h m d m h 0 m 0 the h m data can be collapsed into a generalised q plane and a direct comparison with the theoretical equation can be established this q load path is shown in fig 14 against the vertical load v for all hybrid footings tested the yield surface shape is also fit adequately as written as 5 f q v 0 2 4 1 x 2 2 v v 0 1 v v 0 2 0 and shown in fig 14 to further support the good agreement achieved on seeking those best fit parameters fig 16 extents the comparison between the measured data and the proposed yield surface for hbf2 from two dimensional space to normalised three dimensional space again a great consistency can be observed demonstrating the shape parameters provided in table 4 are adequate 4 numerical studies 4 1 finite element model the soil was modelled with shear strength increasing linearly as a linearly elastic perfectly plastic material obeying the tresca criterion all analyses presented in this paper were carried out by using the finite element software package abaqus 6 9 dassault systèmes 2009 soil strength parameters were chosen to match those measured in the complementary centrifuge tests with k 1 44 kpa m and s u m 5 34 kpa the soil was assigned an effective unit weight γ of 5 7 kn m3 the shear strength at the footing reference point fig 6 denoted s u 0 in this case coincides with s u m the undrained young s modulus e u was selected to provide a constant rigidity index of e u s u 1000 to avoid numerical problems an undrained poisson s ratio ν u of 0 49 which indicates near incompressibility was applied to the soil model the foundation itself was described as a rigid body which does not undergo any deformation with loads ad displacements relating to a single reference point rp in the current study both the numerical simulation and the physical testing were performed in three dimensional v h m space so the 3d nature of the problem has been taken into account and a comprehensive comparison can be carried out 4 2 meshes and validation the model was analysed using a semi cylindrical model the size of the soil domain was chosen to be 5d d is the footing diameter d m in width and 4d in height to avoid any boundary effects to increase the confidence in the numerical results the soil mesh was optimised and validated by comparing the results with known solutions for a circular plate gourvenec and mana 2011 and for a skirted mat with d d 0 2 gourvenec and randolph 2003 the same meshing principles were then applied to the hybrid foundation in this study using the current mesh together with a reproduced circular plate model of the same geometry the prediction for the vertical bearing capacity factor was 7 11 compared to 7 14 reported by gourvenec and mana 2011 which is only a 0 4 difference a circular plate model was developed to verify the ultimate horizontal and moment calculations comparing the predicted results to the results from gourvenec and randolph 2003 there is a 2 difference in predicting the ultimate horizontal load and a 4 difference in predicting the moment load these results demonstrate the accuracy of the fe model compared to other published solutions fig 17 shows the mesh discretisation of the model the soil model consists of approximately 49000 first order hexahedral c3d8 elements the contact surface between the footing and soil was assumed to be fully rough to reduce the computational cost the mesh was only enhanced within the 1d distance horizontally measured from the tip of the skirt and the 1d distance measured vertically from the tip of the caisson resulting in a very fine mesh around the skirt tips where stress concentrations were expected the width of the closest elements next to the skirt or caisson tip is 0 58 of the footing diameter and was kept consistent for all three foundation models 4 3 loading path as a small strain analysis the installation process was not modelled in this study instead the footing was assumed to be in place prior to the simulation in this study a displacement controlled probe test was used to identify the uniaxial horizontal vertical and moment capacity of the hybrid foundation as suggested by bransby and randolph 1997 controlled displacements w u θ as opposed to directly applied loads v h and m were imposed on the footing system lrp for the combined load cases then the yield envelopes were established by applying combined displacement ratios where each analysis followed a specific displacement ratio different to the experiment ones until foundation failure was observed the last loci of the loads of the displacement probes were used to create the failure envelopes 4 4 numerical results a total of 45 analyses were performed for all three hybrid foundation types fig 18 and fig 19 present the failure envelopes derived from the hybrid foundation hbf2 in the v h and v m d m planes respectively the outermost curves in both figures correspond to the ultimate limit states under combined horizontal and vertical load or vertical and moment load the failure envelope was established by connecting the end failure loads of the probe tests see fig 20 5 results comparison and discussion in this section the experimental and numerical results are compared in normalised v h and v m d m planes respectively by means of peak horizontal and moment loads the fully bonded foundation soil interface forces a symmetrical failure mechanism which is in agreement with the assumption of the contact surface being fully rough as shown in fig 18 the comparison between the experimental and the numerical yield surfaces shows a maximum discrepancy of 23 9 in the uniaxial horizontal capacity as shown in fig 18 similarly to the v h space there is a significant discrepancy between the experimental and numerical yield envelopes in the v m space the uniaxial moment capacity is over predicted by the numerical analysis by about 16 2 resulting in the experimental yield envelope sitting consistently below the numerical one integrating figs 16 and 17 gives combined yield envelope in the h m d m plane for hbf2 as shown in fig 18 further comparison across all hybrid foundations with respect to horizontal and moment bearing capacities are listed in table 5 to better observe the discrepancies reported in table 5 the results are also presented graphically in fig 21 the reasons why the experimentally measured vhm surfaces are slightly smaller than the numerically derived are the installation process causes disturbance of the clay soil experimentally this was also observed between experiments and ssfe on a deep embedded spudcan footing on soft clay see zhang et al 2014 in fact in the deeply buried spudcan case the discrepancy between the numerical predictions and experimental measurements was larger consistent with the fact that the hybrid installations of this paper were shallower and caused less soil disturbances during the installation process than that of the deep embedded footings the assumption of fully bonded contact behaviour between foundation and soil assumed in the fe analyses is producing higher capacities for all three hybrid footings such an assumption is un conservative considering the soil strength may be significantly reduced due to the effect of progressive strain softening from intact state to remoulded state among all three footing types hbf3 which has the lowest aspect ratio exhibits the closest match between the experimental and numerical predictions this is consistent that it causes less disturbance experimentally and has least contact area numerically table 5 comparison between numerical and experimental prediction of the bearing capacities 5 conclusions centrifuge testing and small strain finite element analyses were performed to determine the monotonic yield envelope for a hybrid foundation system resting on undrained non uniform clay soil centrifuge swipe tests were conducted using the new v h m actuator developed at uwa to investigate the combined yield surface of a hybrid foundation system an analytical expression was proposed to describe the entire v h m yield surface of the hybrid foundation system featuring one central suction caisson the maximum h and m capacities were independent of the initial vertical load applied provided the skirt of the mat is fully embedded a significant increase in capacity was observed in all directions compared to a circular skirted mat of the same size due to the inclusion of the caisson the present study has shown that both the caisson skirt length and caisson diameter played an important effect in increasing horizontal capacity such increase appear to be linearly proportional to the caisson length and diameter increase the increase in ultimate moment capacity is limited in comparison to the increase in ultimate horizontal capacity the small strain finite element method is a reasonably effective method for preliminarily assessing the yield surface reasonable agreement can be achieved between numerical and experimental models however the results are unconservative when compared with the experimental data with maximum 23 9 discrepancy the deviatoric bearing capacities are nearly identical for different preload levels once the footing has been pushed to the depth of its skirt this has major advantageous offshore as the foundation can be designed to push the skirts fully into the soil using the self weight of the jack up and ballast however additional combined loading capacity is available without having to preload the full vertical capacity of the base plate further vertical and combined loading capacity could be derived by holding the preload for a period of time as a self weight or possibly with active suction through the caisson this has not been studied here but some indication of additional vertical capacity gained with time is provided amongst others in stanier et al 2014 bienen et al 2015 and fu et al 2015 acknowledgements the work described in this

22872,the paper is concerned with the simulation of grounding of gravity foundations for wind turbines and the installation process of jack up rigs in seaway they are of particular interest for offshore wind parks where numerical investigations can support the safety margins of an operation the computational focus of the present study is to supplement a viscous three phase fluid soil solver for overset grids by appropriate mechanical models to analyse the dynamics of such complex systems a quaternion based motion modeller featuring several basic joint elements is used to model the mechanical interaction between different parts of a structure which can be seen as a multi body system examples included refer to simpler validation cases and generic nonetheless realistic applications which aim to illustrate the predictive capabilities of the procedure keywords jack up rigs gravity foundation coupled bodies mechanical joints seaway computational hydrodynamics 1 introduction offshore installations enable explorations of mineral deposits and especially offshore wind farms serve as a primary source of renewable energy many steps of construction work are carried out by means of jack up vessels elevated sea states can restrict or endanger the installation of offshore foundations or jack up platforms to ensure the performance efficiency and safety at work a comprehensive analysis including an assessment of operational limits has to be provided accordingly research is required to develop sound computational modelling practices which provide reliable answers at feasible numerical expenses this paper analyses hydrodynamic effects on mechanically coupled offshore structures during the installation process while taking into account the dynamics of three material phases i e air water and soil an illustrative example refers to the installation of gravity foundations for offshore wind turbines which require their towing to a desired location subsequent flooding and sinking to seabed see fig 1 towing or escorting vessels and stabilizing structures with towing hawsers by tugs are other well known operations which refer to multi body hydrodynamics luo et al 2012 luo theilen and rung 2017 rung et al 2013 for the final installation step i e setting the wind turbine jack up rigs or self elevating units are essential the installation of jack up barges itself is a complex procedure the primary use of such self elevating platforms refers to the installation maintenance and removal of offshore wind parks they are usually employed 10 k m 50 k m away from the coast and in shallow water depths between 15 m and 50 m the mobile service platforms consist of a buoyant hull fitted with a number of movable legs the hull of jack up rigs enables transportation of the unit to a desired location during transit manoeuvring and positioning the legs are in a raised position to lift up the hull the legs are lowered and penetrate into the seabed supported by the ground and stabilized by its own weight jack up rigs allow seaway and current tolerant operation the performance and operational limits of jack up platforms have been subject of several research activities e g dnv 1996 dnv 2012 jensen and capul 2006 bienen and cassidy 2006 and mirzadeh et al 2016 which usually cover either elevated or floating conditions in kang et al 2016 the towed condition of a jack up can be found the grounding of jack ups or gravity foundations were analysed in kreuzer et al 2014 qiu and grabe 2012 and bienen et al 2015 while many authors investigated selected parts of an offshore installation procedure the analysis of the entire process has not yet attracted much scientific interest which motivates the present research the study conveys the benefits of a mesh based three phase finite volume flow simulation method which facilitates an overset grid technique to address large relative motion between multiple parts of an object and a quaternion based motion model which constraints the motion of rigid body parts due to mechanical connections thus the entire installation process including rigid structure motions in irregular waves and seabed penetration can be analysed within one simulation framework the remainder of the paper is structured as follows section 2 outlines the computational framework and describes the numerical models with emphases being given to the motion model and the treatment of mechanically coupled multi body systems in section 3 validation cases and two applications concerning the installation of a gravity foundation and a jack up rig are presented final conclusions and future aims are outlined in section 4 symbolic notations of vectors are presented in bold and lower case letters whereas matrices are described in bold and upper case letters the symbols and denote values in local coordinates and time derivatives respectively subscripts are applied in different ways and will be separately defined in each section 2 computational models the computational model refers to a fluid dynamic model for multiple phases air water and soil a motion model and a seaway model the fluid dynamic model employs the incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations viz 1 ρ u t u u t f with t μ e u u p i 2 ρ t u ρ ρ u 0 here t denotes the time and u t i and f represent the velocity vector the surface stress tensor the unit tensor and the body force vector pressure and density fields refer to p and ρ the effective fluid viscosity μ e μ m μ t is composed of a molecular part μ m and a turbulent part μ t the latter is typically obtained from two equation boussinesq viscosity models e g wilcox 1988 when attention is given to multi phase flows composed from immiscible incompressible fluid components the respective equations are supplemented by immiscibility conditions for the concentration of each of the three phases α 1 2 3 3 c α t u c α 0 with 1 α c α and ρ α c α ρ α μ e α c α μ e α the latter assumes no slip between interfacing phases which allows to employ a common velocity field along the lines of the volume of fluid vof method hirt and nichols 1981 note that the simulations always employ the compatibility condition α c α 1 to determine the concentration of the third second phase in three phase two phase flows moreover all concentrations are bounded between zero and unity and the sum of the first two concentrations of a three phase flow is also limited to unity when attention is given to three phase simulations with water soil contact a slightly more elaborate model to determine the effective viscosity is employed the model employs baseline values for water and soil as well as a suspension layer viscosity for a region nested between the pure soil and water phases cf section 2 4 2 1 numerical framework the finite volume procedure fresco cf rung et al 2009 is used to obtain the numerical results presented in the present paper this procedure solves the navier stokes equations 1 3 for an incompressible fluid of multiple immiscible phases e g air water vapour or soil the segregated algorithm utilizes a cell centred and co located storage system for all transport properties in an arbitrary langrangian eulerian ale mode structured and unstructured grids can be used the implicit numerical approximation is second order accurate in space and time integrals are approximated using the well known mid point rule a pressure correction scheme is employed to obtain the iterative solution with respect to statistical rans or scale resolving les des approaches various turbulence closure models are available multi phase flows are represented by interface capturing methods based upon the volume of fluid technique vof parallel computation is enabled by a domain decomposition technique which is based on a single program multiple data message passing model the inter processor communication uses the mpi communications protocol load balancing is achieved by the parmetis partitioning software 2 2 seaway model the simulations for manoeuvring and seakeeping in waves have to overcome two major challenges the first one refers to the allocation of appropriate grid refinements to ensure an accurate representation of the incident wave field propagating towards the floating body the second challenge refers to the wave reflections induced at the outlet boundary of the computational domain a common method employs significant wave suppression by grid stretching aft of the body damping zone or numerical beach however if the encounter direction of the incident waves changes in time e g for offshore operations of tugs grid based wave damping cannot be applied an attractive way to address these challenges is the use of coupled viscous inviscid methods as proposed by gentaz et al 2004 to simplify the computational model these techniques assume that viscous effects are negligible at far field boundaries thus the propagating wave field can be assigned to an inviscid description e g linear superposed airy waves in contrast to many other approaches e g jacobsen et al 2012 we refer to an implicit forcing to couple the two solutions the coupling is realized by using a manipulation of the coefficient matrix in a way that the viscous solution is implicitly forced to match the inviscid description at the boundaries this forcing is spatially confined about half the maximum wave length from the exterior bounds and involves typically about 1 of relative forcing further details of this technique are described in wöckner et al 2010 the generation of a natural seaway is obtained by superposing regular wave components of different amplitudes and frequencies derived from empirical data the wave field characteristics is usually described by appropriate seaway spectra in the present paper the jonswap spectrum proposed in clauss et al 1988 is considered the energy distribution over the wave direction is defined by a cos 2 dispersion in the interval of ν 0 π 2 ν 0 π 2 about the main direction ν 0 to prevent recurrence frequencies are chosen arbitrarily within each discretization step size and the wave phase is random within 0 2 π luo theilen and rung 2017 have successfully applied the procedure to the analysis of a boat landing manoeuvre 2 3 overset grid method in the simulation of mechanical interactions of floating bodies the demand of geometric flexibility is evident a versatile method towards complex moving geometries is the overset grid approach also referred to as overlapping chimera grid method the procedure employs a background grid to define the extent of the computational domain and mobile foreground meshes which are frequently attached to each moving body and model their motion the overset grid approach presented in the present paper refers to a mass conservative strongly coupled and fully parallelized procedure as described in völkner et al 2017 and brunswig and rung 2011 the active cells of all overset regions are handled within one global equation system to ensure a synchronized solution through out all grids each single domain is implicitly coupled to the active cells of a donor grid along overlapping interpolations cells dynamic load balancing enables parallel computing which is unrestricted in size and arrangement of the domains moreover the priority of the overlapping grids is adjusted to their local resolution arrangements of very close moving parts and intersecting motion paths can be modelled since the grids are fitted to each body this technique highly facilitates the process of grid generation and improves the mesh quality 2 4 soil model for three phase simulations an additional state i e the soil state is considered in the sense of eq 1 and eq 2 using material parameters for the soil phase as outlined in the following the soil phase is treated as a visco static material where the fluid state is modelled by a variable viscosity the transition between the static and the viscous behaviour is initiated if a yield stress limit is exceeded and the material manifests a plastic strain rate driven deformation the latter rests upon the definition of an effective soil viscosity μ e s and employs a combined mohr coulomb and von mises yield criterion for granular materials accordingly a viscous behaviour is employed if the second invariant of the viscous stress 4 τ μ e s u u 2 μ e s s exceeds the squared yield stress i e 5 0 5 τ τ τ p 2 the yield stress is determined by a mohr coulomb criterion and models τ p from the lithostatic pressure p the internal friction angle ϕ and the cohesion c viz 6 τ p p sin ϕ c cos ϕ the related effective soil viscosity reads 7 μ e s τ p 4 s s when the strain rate vanishes the resulting soil viscosity gets singular and the static mode is recovered similar to the description of shear thinning fluids an upper viscosity limit is introduced into the model barnes et al 1989 the present study adopts the values by ulrich et al 2013 i e μ e s 1500 p a s which were confirmed in völkner et al 2015 moreover the momentum of the soil is conserved when a threshold viscosity is reached furthermore the fluid state of the soil model is combined with a suspension treatment to manage the soil water interface the suspension is assumed to be in the grain collisional regime where experiments indicate a quadratic turbulent stress velocity relation i e τ c f ρ u u the friction coefficient is assigned to c f 0 01 which follows from fraccarollo and capart 2002 and subsequent studies in ulrich et al 2013 the effective viscosity of the suspension layer assumes soil water contact and reads 8 μ e s u s c f ρ u u 4 s s it is employed for soil concentrations between 0 3 and 0 6 the transition to the water and soil phase is modelled by a concentration based linear interpolation to the respective pure water and soil values a more detailed description of the soil model can be found in ulrich et al 2013 and völkner et al 2015 2 5 motion model euler angles are the most common way to describe the angular orientation of a rigid body in a three dimensional space in a standard arrangement of three composed elementary rotations in which each of them allows one degree of freedom the effect of a gimbal lock can occur to prevent a singularity in the motion system quaternions are employed euler s theorem states that the general displacement of a body can be accomplished by a single rotation about a suitable axis over a certain angle nikravesh 1988 hence the coordinate transformation can be described by means of the angle of rotation and the direction cosines of the rotation axis a quaternion in a three dimensional space is defined as 9 p p 0 p p 0 p 1 p 2 p 3 ℝ 4 denoting n as the rotation axis φ as the rotation angle of a rigid body and introducing the euler parameters 10 p 0 cos φ 2 p p 1 p 2 p 3 t n sin φ 2 and n 1 a rotation matrix s for the transformation of an arbitrary vector s into s can be derived and reads s 2 p 0 2 p 1 2 1 2 p 1 p 2 p 0 p 3 p 1 p 3 p 0 p 2 p 1 p 2 p 0 p 3 p 0 2 p 2 2 1 2 p 2 p 3 p 0 p 1 p 1 p 3 p 0 p 2 p 2 p 3 p 0 p 1 p 0 2 p 3 2 1 2 the angular velocity ω can be obtained from the time derivative of p viz 11 p 1 2 l t ω with l p 1 p 0 p 3 p 2 p 2 p 3 p 0 p 1 p 3 p 2 p 1 p 0 using these relations the equations of motion of any rigid body or body part can be converted into quaternions and prevent the system of unpleasant gimbal locks see luo theilen and rung 2017 for more details 2 5 1 multi body interaction the equation system of k unconstrained bodies is composed by all equations of motion for translation and rotation of each single unconstrained body viz 12 m r f j ω ω j ω m thus the 6 k system can be represented by 13 a h b g here the matrix a ℝ 6 k 6 k incorporates the masses m and inertia tensors j h is the acceleration vector which inherits the second derivative of the translation vector r of the body fixed coordinate system and the local angular accelerations ω the external forces f and local external moments m are stringed together into vector g the components of vector b refer to 0 ω 1 j 1 ω 1 0 ω k j k ω k considering mechanically coupled multi body systems the equations of motion have to be supplemented by additional constraint conditions 2 5 1 1 translational joints as indicated by fig 2 the translational joint constraints two bodies to move along a common axis choose two arbitrary points on each body which are all located on the same joint axis i e p a and q a on body a and p b and q b on body b to derive constraint equations the connection vectors s a s b and d between these points have to meet the following constraints 14 φ 1 q s a s b 0 15 φ 2 q s a d 0 in other words these vectors have to be parallel to each other at all times thus there are two relative degrees of freedom between bodies connected by this translational joint since spatial position vectors are expressed by quaternions each condition is a function of a combined vector containing the translation r k and the euler parameters p k of each body k 1 2 q q 1 q 2 ℝ 14 q k r p k x y z p 0 p 1 p 2 p 3 k t each constraint equations 14 and 15 has also to meet the condition in their derivatives i e 16 φ q φ q 0 17 φ q φ q q q φ q q 0 a transformation from q r p t into h r ω t for each body yields 18 r 1 φ 1 2 p 1 φ l 1 t r 2 φ 1 2 p 2 φ l 2 t r 1 ω 1 r 2 ω 2 γ 0 b h γ 0 with γ being a specific coupling term the composition of matrix b and the associating term γ for the translational joint can be found in nikravesh et al 1985a and nikravesh et al 1985b a common way to assemble governing equations with constraint conditions is the use of lagrange multipliers λ hence the additional vector g c composed of constraint reaction forces f c and moments m c can be derived as 19 g c f 1 c m 1 c f 2 c m 2 c q 1 t φ q 2 t φ λ 1 λ 2 r 1 t φ λ 1 1 2 l 1 p 1 t φ λ 1 r 2 t φ λ 2 1 2 l 2 p 2 t φ λ 2 b t λ the final equation system which describes the motion of k mechanically coupled bodies in terms of quaternions can be summarised as follows 20 a b t b 0 h λ b 0 g γ 2 5 1 2 ropes and fenders a simple spring damper system is very versatile in its application and can also be used to model ropes and fenders ropes can only employ tension forces to a body thus eqn 12 is simply supplemented by such external forces as soon as the distance d between two points located on different bodies exceeds the relaxed rope length l the external rope force 21 f r o p e c d l d d d d will be applied to the coupled bodies herein c and d represent the spring and damping coefficients different from a rope a fender induces repellent forces to the bodies the fender gets compressed if a predefined minimum distance which refers to the fender thickness cannot be maintained during the body s motion hence fender forces are obtained by 22 f n c δ x n d n where δ x denotes the fender deformation and n is assigned to the direction of fender forces see luo theilen and rung 2017 for more details about the rope and fender model as well as corresponding validation cases 3 validation and application 3 1 run up generated by sliding wedge the first validation case was considered with experiments described in liu et al 2005 the test case studied the wave field and run up run down generated by a sliding three dimensional rigid wedge and illustrates the attainable accuracy for mechanically coupled simulations of free surface flows using overset grids fig 3 shows a sketch of the experimental setup simulations were performed for turbulent flows using the k ω model and no slip boundary conditions free surface elevations were measured at different locations two of which are depicted on the bottom of fig 3 in the present study the motion of the wedge was computed by the 6dof motion modeller and was mechanically coupled to the ramp by the translational joint described in sec 2 5 1 in other words this joint serves as a sleeve bearing for the sling wedge and the motion is calculated numerically in each time step under the mechanical joint condition thus the motion is not predefined the considered forces are confined to gravitational and fluid dynamic forces i e contact forces between the wedge and the ground are deemed negligible the initial emergence of the slide was 0 32 c m and the mass of the wedge was assigned to 467 83 k g the numerical grids contained 5 1 10 6 and 1 55 10 5 cells for the background and the foreground grid respectively the simulation used a grid refinement featuring approximately 15 cells per wave height fig 4 shows the predicted time evolution of the free surface contour at six different time steps as the wedge moves down the incline in this sequence the generation and its subsequence propagation of a wave train can be observed fig 5 compares the surface elevations simulated at gauge a and b with experimental data the wave amplitude in the simulation is slightly underestimated for gauge a and overestimated for gauge b however the wave phase is well predicted note that the experimental data were carried out by visual observation of video images supported by resistance wave gauges with unknown sampling rates overall the numerical simulation revealed a fair agreement with the experimental data furthermore the numerical variation of the wedge s motion to the incline of the ramp remains in the order of 1 10 5 and hence negligible as compared to the extent of the body o m during the entire simulation which demonstrates a reasonable functional capability of the applied mechanical joint 3 2 generic platform with heaving legs the validation case refers to a generic platform with two attached legs which are restricted to heave perpendicularly to the platform the aim was to verify the implementation of the mechanical joints as depicted in fig 6 the platform was exposed to waves and therefore performed a pitch motion both legs were coupled to the platform by translational joints the legs should thus pitch in accord with the platform but were free to heave independently the initial position of the two legs at t 0 s can be seen on the right diagram of fig 7 furthermore a constant force was applied to both legs which cause an additional heaving motion in this simulation three overlapping grids containing 2 25 10 5 cells for the background grid and 2 5 10 4 for the foreground grids were used to compute the laminar flow with slip wall boundary conditions for the verification the platform s dimension was 15 m 15 m 2 m and the dimension of each leg reads 3 m 3 m 15 m the density of all three bodies was half the density of water thus the three bodies were half submerged in the static calm water conditions the wave field was characterized by a wave height and wave length of h w 1 3 m and λ 20 m respectively a constant force of f z 135 k n was applied to the local z axis of both legs in fig 7 pitch and heave motions of the system are presented as expected all three bodies performed exactly the same pitch motion since the buoyancy forces compensated the external forces acting on the legs the legs vertical displacements were gradually diminishing the legs were initialised in different heights and therefore heaved in shifted phase the pitch of the platform and the attached legs also declined gradually as expected results were all in line with the expectations and indicated the capability of the mechanical model to capture complex relative motions of a coupled multi body system 3 3 seabed penetration of jack up legs the third test case is concerned with the leg seabed interaction emphasis is given to the predictive accuracy of the computed seabed reaction force during the penetration of an exemplary leg which featured a diameter of 4 5 m and a cone angle of 76 the leg was penetrated vertically into the superfine silica sand which is representative for many offshore locations see fig 8 results of the present simulation were compared to reference data taken from kreuzer et al 2014 who employed a finite element fe method in a coupled eulerian lagrangian cel framework to investigate the leg seabed interaction the cel fe method has been successfully used to simulate the penetration process of spudcans or legs into soils qiu and grabe 2012 to simulate the behaviour of the soil a comprehensive hypoplastic model von wolffersdorff 1996 was used by the authors in kreuzer et al 2014 in the present study the soil phase was modelled as a viscoplastic incompressible material which featured a strain rate dependent plastic deformation cf sec 2 4 inherently the elastic and compressible properties of the soil cannot be considered in this incompressible framework a remedy to this issue and thereby append reaction forces by reason of compression to the model was the supplementary use of a combination of linear fenders to the penetrated leg see fig 9 the soil resistivity manifests a similar characteristics to that of the fender model i e the reaction force rise when the material gets compressed since the seabed reaction force is nonlinear two fictitious fenders with different spring stiffness were combined to mimic the elastic behaviour of the sand this way any seabed composition or desired soil resistivity can be approximated by applying suitable fender parameters which were assigned and tuned to mimic a certain previously investigated soil behaviour thus both soil characteristics i e compressibility and plastic deformation were covered in this combined approach fig 10 displays a fair predictive agreement between the present cohesionless model cf table 1 and the reference data provided by kreuzer et al 2014 for vertical reaction forces of the leg the seabed reaction force progression was thus reasonably reproduced by the combined model 3 4 grounding of gravity foundations the following application refers to a shallow water foundation for offshore wind turbines the structure is usually towed to a desired location and subsequently lowered to the ground by partial flooding see fig 1 fig 11 depicts the investigated structure which featured eight symmetrically arranged flooding compartments and a mass of 7315 8 t the overset grids contained 9 2 10 5 cells for the background and 1 35 10 6 cells for the foreground grid the soil parameters were taken from table 1 and the soil was considered to be cohesionless to ensure a realistic sinkage depth two fictitious fenders were applied right beneath the surface of the soil phase once the bottom of the foundation hit the ground the fender will be compressed without loss of generality the fender s spring stiffness is assigned to c 1 32 10 6 n m and c 2 64 10 6 n m the damping coefficients are defined as d 1 16 10 5 k g s and d 2 8 10 5 k g s note that in this application case the fender parameters were chosen to meet desired attributes i e reasonable final sinkage depth preventing long simulation time in fact any desired soil resistivity can be applied here in the first simulation no external forces e g induced by towing hawsers were considered as indicated by fig 12 the foundation tilted aside during the simulated flooding process the reason for tilting was the reduction of stability during flooding and a small asymmetry of the discrete model which is induced by the automated generation of the unstructured mesh in view of transient inhomogeneous environmental and initial conditions an asymmetry seems not unrealistic and can harm the operation to prevent tilting the foundations are stabilized by towing hawsers of the tugs operating nearby see fig 1 center regarding this four numerical ropes were applied to the foundation s shaft and were bonded to fixed local points in a height of 10 5 c m above the free surface the arrangement of the ropes was in a circular angle of 90 around the foundation cf fig 13 all ropes had a relaxed length of 98 5 m and the emploed rope parameters were c 6 76 10 4 n m and d 2 9 10 5 n s m for the spring and damping coefficient in the beginning of the process the ropes were already strained with a initialised rope length of 99 m the simulation result by means of the flooding process and the velocity magnitudes inside the foundation at different time steps are shown in fig 14 as the water penetrated into the flooding compartments the foundation began to sink gradually until it hit the ground and was filled up completely the top diagrams of fig 15 shows the corresponding motions the vertical sinking motion stopped at 21 m i e the foundation subsided 1 m into the seabed and the vertical velocity vanished as the foundation reached the ground the rotational motion diagram reveals tilting in x and y direction at the time of highest sinking velocity but this time the foundation was stabilized by ropes which can be seen in the bottom diagrams of fig 15 as expected during the sinking phase of the foundation the rope forces decreased first since the ropes got stress relief based on the ropes arrangement as soon as the foundation experienced pitch and roll which led to tilting in the direction of rope 3 rope 2 was tightened again and forces of rope 3 were nearly vanishing finally the foundation sank to ground with a small final pitch and roll angle of 0 2 which again strained all ropes note that the rope forces are expressed by the magnitudes of the forces the force discrepancy in the final process was dominated by vertical components fig 16 depicts the velocity distribution in the installation process the sinking motion induced translational velocities under the foundations bottom i e in the suspension layer to the soil phase which leads to a soil bulge around the foundation base 3 5 jack up elevation in seaway the final application is concerned with the hydrodynamic performance during the installation process of a generic jack up vessel the aim was to analyse the hydrodynamic forces acting on the vessel and to examine potential operational limits herein all components of the computational model were combined regarding the safety of the crew during operations roll motion and large accelerations should be avoided 3 5 1 elevation process in natural seaway the first investigations were concerned with the elevation process of the generic jack up vessel kreuzer et al 2014 depicted in fig 17 the main dimensions of the considered geometry are given in table 2 herein v c g denotes the vertical distance from baseline to the center of gravity which is horizontally at amidships the jack up consisted of a main platform which had translational joints to its four legs the employed coupling allowed the legs to move only perpendicular to the ships longitudinal axis to lower the legs in reality they are flooded and additionally pushed down by a hydraulic system since the flooding of the legs are not of interest the simulation can be simplified by adding a time dependent mass conditioned by the lowering depth of the legs this mimics a water flux that scales with the vertical motion 23 m t m 0 m d t m 0 ρ w a w l z t d t m 0 ρ w a w l z t herein m 0 denotes the initial mass of the leg ρ w is the water density and a w l describes the leg s water line area the time dependent vertical position of the leg s center of gravity refers to z t six grids were used for this turbulent flow overset simulation the background grid contained 8 10 6 the platform had 5 10 6 and each leg counted 2 62 10 5 cells a fully developed jonswap spectrum of 200 wave components using h s 2 m and t s 5 s was applied the extent of the compact computational domain is 200 m 300 m and the water depth was 30 m the initial positions of the legs were assigned to 5 m above the seabed to model the compressibility of the seabed additional fenders were applied to the penetration area of each leg cf sec 3 3 the fenders act right beneath the seabed surface as soon as each single leg hit the ground the fenders will be compressed without loss of generality each fender s spring stiffness denotes to c 1 35 10 6 n m and c 2 80 10 6 n m the damping coefficients are d 1 20 10 5 k g s and d 2 20 10 5 k g s again note that any desired soil resistivity characteristic can be applied here for this application the given combination were chosen for reasonable sinkage depth after the legs penetrated into the soil the main ship lifted itself up to a given height by adding a ramp force to the platform and correlating moments at the leg joint positions to ensure stability while the platform was lifting up the legs experienced supplementary stability forces by the weight of the platform fig 18 illustrates the overall jacking procedure of a generic jack up vessel in a natural seaway and fig 19 shows the corresponding vertical motion of the platform and the legs mind that actual leg velocities typically refer to 1 2 m m i n and the legs were lowered much faster in the present study due to the flooding the legs hit the seabed for the first time at t 2 s and come at rest at a penetration depth of 2 m while the platform started to jack up itself to a defined height of 12 m the jacking forces which lifted up the platform were also applied to all legs in the opposite direction these forces and induced moments contribute to the stability of the vessel due to a draught of 6 m an air gap of 5 m was achieved at the end 3 5 2 loads on the platform the final investigations refer to the loads on the platform due to beam waves therefore the jack up vessel was exposed to harmonic waves of same wave length λ 35 m and wave height of h w 6 m during the elevation process the wave crest was supposed to hit the platform before the legs reach the ground at the time of the penetration and after the legs already dived into the seabed therefore three different phases φ 1 12 07 φ 2 10 74 and φ 3 9 41 were of particular interest fig 20 exemplifies the free surface elevation at t 1 5 s when a wave crest reached the platform fig 21 compares the lateral forces of the beam waves for different wave phases as well as the corresponding roll moments and roll motion of the vessel the maximum amplitudes of the hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on the vessel were assigned to the wave impacts since the bulk of the vessel was submerged in water at the time of impact for all three cases the platform got excited and hence performed a roll motion in the case of φ 1 the roll motion was exclusively dominated by hydrodynamic forces for φ 2 and φ 3 the legs already had contact to the ground thus the wave impact forces could cause a tilting of the vessel by the down jacked legs during subsequent lowering which was rather a mechanical effect in these cases safe working condition is not assured and jacking would not be performed mind that a critical significant wave height for jacking operation is typically 2 5 m maximum swire blue ocean 2013 öster 2016 these cases illustrated and predicted the hydrodynamic performance of jack up rigs in extreme seaway conditions 4 conclusion and future work hydrodynamic simulations of complex offshore installation procedures using mechanical couplings have been presented to overcome the challenge of large relative motions implicitly coupled overset grids were applied special seaway boundary conditions combining viscous solutions in the near field and inviscid solutions in the far field were used to avoid undesirable reflections from the boundaries and allowed for the use of relatively compact domain sizes a quaternion based motion module with constraint conditions and models of several basic mechanical joint elements has been successfully implemented with the help of the mechanical joints three phase flow simulations including structure seabed interactions have been modelled realistically the characteristics of the seabed can be modelled using a combination of fenders and the soil model finally the algorithm was successfully validated and applied to the installation process of a gravity foundation and a jack up rig future work will focus on the hydrodynamic analysis of different seaway conditions for the jacking mode to investigate safety margins furthermore more complex application scenarios and simulation methods for e g crane operations on sea and mooring systems will be of interest acknowledgement the present work was part of the project tug design grant number 03sx311a and hymott grant number 03sx390c which were funded by the federal ministry for economic

22872,the paper is concerned with the simulation of grounding of gravity foundations for wind turbines and the installation process of jack up rigs in seaway they are of particular interest for offshore wind parks where numerical investigations can support the safety margins of an operation the computational focus of the present study is to supplement a viscous three phase fluid soil solver for overset grids by appropriate mechanical models to analyse the dynamics of such complex systems a quaternion based motion modeller featuring several basic joint elements is used to model the mechanical interaction between different parts of a structure which can be seen as a multi body system examples included refer to simpler validation cases and generic nonetheless realistic applications which aim to illustrate the predictive capabilities of the procedure keywords jack up rigs gravity foundation coupled bodies mechanical joints seaway computational hydrodynamics 1 introduction offshore installations enable explorations of mineral deposits and especially offshore wind farms serve as a primary source of renewable energy many steps of construction work are carried out by means of jack up vessels elevated sea states can restrict or endanger the installation of offshore foundations or jack up platforms to ensure the performance efficiency and safety at work a comprehensive analysis including an assessment of operational limits has to be provided accordingly research is required to develop sound computational modelling practices which provide reliable answers at feasible numerical expenses this paper analyses hydrodynamic effects on mechanically coupled offshore structures during the installation process while taking into account the dynamics of three material phases i e air water and soil an illustrative example refers to the installation of gravity foundations for offshore wind turbines which require their towing to a desired location subsequent flooding and sinking to seabed see fig 1 towing or escorting vessels and stabilizing structures with towing hawsers by tugs are other well known operations which refer to multi body hydrodynamics luo et al 2012 luo theilen and rung 2017 rung et al 2013 for the final installation step i e setting the wind turbine jack up rigs or self elevating units are essential the installation of jack up barges itself is a complex procedure the primary use of such self elevating platforms refers to the installation maintenance and removal of offshore wind parks they are usually employed 10 k m 50 k m away from the coast and in shallow water depths between 15 m and 50 m the mobile service platforms consist of a buoyant hull fitted with a number of movable legs the hull of jack up rigs enables transportation of the unit to a desired location during transit manoeuvring and positioning the legs are in a raised position to lift up the hull the legs are lowered and penetrate into the seabed supported by the ground and stabilized by its own weight jack up rigs allow seaway and current tolerant operation the performance and operational limits of jack up platforms have been subject of several research activities e g dnv 1996 dnv 2012 jensen and capul 2006 bienen and cassidy 2006 and mirzadeh et al 2016 which usually cover either elevated or floating conditions in kang et al 2016 the towed condition of a jack up can be found the grounding of jack ups or gravity foundations were analysed in kreuzer et al 2014 qiu and grabe 2012 and bienen et al 2015 while many authors investigated selected parts of an offshore installation procedure the analysis of the entire process has not yet attracted much scientific interest which motivates the present research the study conveys the benefits of a mesh based three phase finite volume flow simulation method which facilitates an overset grid technique to address large relative motion between multiple parts of an object and a quaternion based motion model which constraints the motion of rigid body parts due to mechanical connections thus the entire installation process including rigid structure motions in irregular waves and seabed penetration can be analysed within one simulation framework the remainder of the paper is structured as follows section 2 outlines the computational framework and describes the numerical models with emphases being given to the motion model and the treatment of mechanically coupled multi body systems in section 3 validation cases and two applications concerning the installation of a gravity foundation and a jack up rig are presented final conclusions and future aims are outlined in section 4 symbolic notations of vectors are presented in bold and lower case letters whereas matrices are described in bold and upper case letters the symbols and denote values in local coordinates and time derivatives respectively subscripts are applied in different ways and will be separately defined in each section 2 computational models the computational model refers to a fluid dynamic model for multiple phases air water and soil a motion model and a seaway model the fluid dynamic model employs the incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations viz 1 ρ u t u u t f with t μ e u u p i 2 ρ t u ρ ρ u 0 here t denotes the time and u t i and f represent the velocity vector the surface stress tensor the unit tensor and the body force vector pressure and density fields refer to p and ρ the effective fluid viscosity μ e μ m μ t is composed of a molecular part μ m and a turbulent part μ t the latter is typically obtained from two equation boussinesq viscosity models e g wilcox 1988 when attention is given to multi phase flows composed from immiscible incompressible fluid components the respective equations are supplemented by immiscibility conditions for the concentration of each of the three phases α 1 2 3 3 c α t u c α 0 with 1 α c α and ρ α c α ρ α μ e α c α μ e α the latter assumes no slip between interfacing phases which allows to employ a common velocity field along the lines of the volume of fluid vof method hirt and nichols 1981 note that the simulations always employ the compatibility condition α c α 1 to determine the concentration of the third second phase in three phase two phase flows moreover all concentrations are bounded between zero and unity and the sum of the first two concentrations of a three phase flow is also limited to unity when attention is given to three phase simulations with water soil contact a slightly more elaborate model to determine the effective viscosity is employed the model employs baseline values for water and soil as well as a suspension layer viscosity for a region nested between the pure soil and water phases cf section 2 4 2 1 numerical framework the finite volume procedure fresco cf rung et al 2009 is used to obtain the numerical results presented in the present paper this procedure solves the navier stokes equations 1 3 for an incompressible fluid of multiple immiscible phases e g air water vapour or soil the segregated algorithm utilizes a cell centred and co located storage system for all transport properties in an arbitrary langrangian eulerian ale mode structured and unstructured grids can be used the implicit numerical approximation is second order accurate in space and time integrals are approximated using the well known mid point rule a pressure correction scheme is employed to obtain the iterative solution with respect to statistical rans or scale resolving les des approaches various turbulence closure models are available multi phase flows are represented by interface capturing methods based upon the volume of fluid technique vof parallel computation is enabled by a domain decomposition technique which is based on a single program multiple data message passing model the inter processor communication uses the mpi communications protocol load balancing is achieved by the parmetis partitioning software 2 2 seaway model the simulations for manoeuvring and seakeeping in waves have to overcome two major challenges the first one refers to the allocation of appropriate grid refinements to ensure an accurate representation of the incident wave field propagating towards the floating body the second challenge refers to the wave reflections induced at the outlet boundary of the computational domain a common method employs significant wave suppression by grid stretching aft of the body damping zone or numerical beach however if the encounter direction of the incident waves changes in time e g for offshore operations of tugs grid based wave damping cannot be applied an attractive way to address these challenges is the use of coupled viscous inviscid methods as proposed by gentaz et al 2004 to simplify the computational model these techniques assume that viscous effects are negligible at far field boundaries thus the propagating wave field can be assigned to an inviscid description e g linear superposed airy waves in contrast to many other approaches e g jacobsen et al 2012 we refer to an implicit forcing to couple the two solutions the coupling is realized by using a manipulation of the coefficient matrix in a way that the viscous solution is implicitly forced to match the inviscid description at the boundaries this forcing is spatially confined about half the maximum wave length from the exterior bounds and involves typically about 1 of relative forcing further details of this technique are described in wöckner et al 2010 the generation of a natural seaway is obtained by superposing regular wave components of different amplitudes and frequencies derived from empirical data the wave field characteristics is usually described by appropriate seaway spectra in the present paper the jonswap spectrum proposed in clauss et al 1988 is considered the energy distribution over the wave direction is defined by a cos 2 dispersion in the interval of ν 0 π 2 ν 0 π 2 about the main direction ν 0 to prevent recurrence frequencies are chosen arbitrarily within each discretization step size and the wave phase is random within 0 2 π luo theilen and rung 2017 have successfully applied the procedure to the analysis of a boat landing manoeuvre 2 3 overset grid method in the simulation of mechanical interactions of floating bodies the demand of geometric flexibility is evident a versatile method towards complex moving geometries is the overset grid approach also referred to as overlapping chimera grid method the procedure employs a background grid to define the extent of the computational domain and mobile foreground meshes which are frequently attached to each moving body and model their motion the overset grid approach presented in the present paper refers to a mass conservative strongly coupled and fully parallelized procedure as described in völkner et al 2017 and brunswig and rung 2011 the active cells of all overset regions are handled within one global equation system to ensure a synchronized solution through out all grids each single domain is implicitly coupled to the active cells of a donor grid along overlapping interpolations cells dynamic load balancing enables parallel computing which is unrestricted in size and arrangement of the domains moreover the priority of the overlapping grids is adjusted to their local resolution arrangements of very close moving parts and intersecting motion paths can be modelled since the grids are fitted to each body this technique highly facilitates the process of grid generation and improves the mesh quality 2 4 soil model for three phase simulations an additional state i e the soil state is considered in the sense of eq 1 and eq 2 using material parameters for the soil phase as outlined in the following the soil phase is treated as a visco static material where the fluid state is modelled by a variable viscosity the transition between the static and the viscous behaviour is initiated if a yield stress limit is exceeded and the material manifests a plastic strain rate driven deformation the latter rests upon the definition of an effective soil viscosity μ e s and employs a combined mohr coulomb and von mises yield criterion for granular materials accordingly a viscous behaviour is employed if the second invariant of the viscous stress 4 τ μ e s u u 2 μ e s s exceeds the squared yield stress i e 5 0 5 τ τ τ p 2 the yield stress is determined by a mohr coulomb criterion and models τ p from the lithostatic pressure p the internal friction angle ϕ and the cohesion c viz 6 τ p p sin ϕ c cos ϕ the related effective soil viscosity reads 7 μ e s τ p 4 s s when the strain rate vanishes the resulting soil viscosity gets singular and the static mode is recovered similar to the description of shear thinning fluids an upper viscosity limit is introduced into the model barnes et al 1989 the present study adopts the values by ulrich et al 2013 i e μ e s 1500 p a s which were confirmed in völkner et al 2015 moreover the momentum of the soil is conserved when a threshold viscosity is reached furthermore the fluid state of the soil model is combined with a suspension treatment to manage the soil water interface the suspension is assumed to be in the grain collisional regime where experiments indicate a quadratic turbulent stress velocity relation i e τ c f ρ u u the friction coefficient is assigned to c f 0 01 which follows from fraccarollo and capart 2002 and subsequent studies in ulrich et al 2013 the effective viscosity of the suspension layer assumes soil water contact and reads 8 μ e s u s c f ρ u u 4 s s it is employed for soil concentrations between 0 3 and 0 6 the transition to the water and soil phase is modelled by a concentration based linear interpolation to the respective pure water and soil values a more detailed description of the soil model can be found in ulrich et al 2013 and völkner et al 2015 2 5 motion model euler angles are the most common way to describe the angular orientation of a rigid body in a three dimensional space in a standard arrangement of three composed elementary rotations in which each of them allows one degree of freedom the effect of a gimbal lock can occur to prevent a singularity in the motion system quaternions are employed euler s theorem states that the general displacement of a body can be accomplished by a single rotation about a suitable axis over a certain angle nikravesh 1988 hence the coordinate transformation can be described by means of the angle of rotation and the direction cosines of the rotation axis a quaternion in a three dimensional space is defined as 9 p p 0 p p 0 p 1 p 2 p 3 ℝ 4 denoting n as the rotation axis φ as the rotation angle of a rigid body and introducing the euler parameters 10 p 0 cos φ 2 p p 1 p 2 p 3 t n sin φ 2 and n 1 a rotation matrix s for the transformation of an arbitrary vector s into s can be derived and reads s 2 p 0 2 p 1 2 1 2 p 1 p 2 p 0 p 3 p 1 p 3 p 0 p 2 p 1 p 2 p 0 p 3 p 0 2 p 2 2 1 2 p 2 p 3 p 0 p 1 p 1 p 3 p 0 p 2 p 2 p 3 p 0 p 1 p 0 2 p 3 2 1 2 the angular velocity ω can be obtained from the time derivative of p viz 11 p 1 2 l t ω with l p 1 p 0 p 3 p 2 p 2 p 3 p 0 p 1 p 3 p 2 p 1 p 0 using these relations the equations of motion of any rigid body or body part can be converted into quaternions and prevent the system of unpleasant gimbal locks see luo theilen and rung 2017 for more details 2 5 1 multi body interaction the equation system of k unconstrained bodies is composed by all equations of motion for translation and rotation of each single unconstrained body viz 12 m r f j ω ω j ω m thus the 6 k system can be represented by 13 a h b g here the matrix a ℝ 6 k 6 k incorporates the masses m and inertia tensors j h is the acceleration vector which inherits the second derivative of the translation vector r of the body fixed coordinate system and the local angular accelerations ω the external forces f and local external moments m are stringed together into vector g the components of vector b refer to 0 ω 1 j 1 ω 1 0 ω k j k ω k considering mechanically coupled multi body systems the equations of motion have to be supplemented by additional constraint conditions 2 5 1 1 translational joints as indicated by fig 2 the translational joint constraints two bodies to move along a common axis choose two arbitrary points on each body which are all located on the same joint axis i e p a and q a on body a and p b and q b on body b to derive constraint equations the connection vectors s a s b and d between these points have to meet the following constraints 14 φ 1 q s a s b 0 15 φ 2 q s a d 0 in other words these vectors have to be parallel to each other at all times thus there are two relative degrees of freedom between bodies connected by this translational joint since spatial position vectors are expressed by quaternions each condition is a function of a combined vector containing the translation r k and the euler parameters p k of each body k 1 2 q q 1 q 2 ℝ 14 q k r p k x y z p 0 p 1 p 2 p 3 k t each constraint equations 14 and 15 has also to meet the condition in their derivatives i e 16 φ q φ q 0 17 φ q φ q q q φ q q 0 a transformation from q r p t into h r ω t for each body yields 18 r 1 φ 1 2 p 1 φ l 1 t r 2 φ 1 2 p 2 φ l 2 t r 1 ω 1 r 2 ω 2 γ 0 b h γ 0 with γ being a specific coupling term the composition of matrix b and the associating term γ for the translational joint can be found in nikravesh et al 1985a and nikravesh et al 1985b a common way to assemble governing equations with constraint conditions is the use of lagrange multipliers λ hence the additional vector g c composed of constraint reaction forces f c and moments m c can be derived as 19 g c f 1 c m 1 c f 2 c m 2 c q 1 t φ q 2 t φ λ 1 λ 2 r 1 t φ λ 1 1 2 l 1 p 1 t φ λ 1 r 2 t φ λ 2 1 2 l 2 p 2 t φ λ 2 b t λ the final equation system which describes the motion of k mechanically coupled bodies in terms of quaternions can be summarised as follows 20 a b t b 0 h λ b 0 g γ 2 5 1 2 ropes and fenders a simple spring damper system is very versatile in its application and can also be used to model ropes and fenders ropes can only employ tension forces to a body thus eqn 12 is simply supplemented by such external forces as soon as the distance d between two points located on different bodies exceeds the relaxed rope length l the external rope force 21 f r o p e c d l d d d d will be applied to the coupled bodies herein c and d represent the spring and damping coefficients different from a rope a fender induces repellent forces to the bodies the fender gets compressed if a predefined minimum distance which refers to the fender thickness cannot be maintained during the body s motion hence fender forces are obtained by 22 f n c δ x n d n where δ x denotes the fender deformation and n is assigned to the direction of fender forces see luo theilen and rung 2017 for more details about the rope and fender model as well as corresponding validation cases 3 validation and application 3 1 run up generated by sliding wedge the first validation case was considered with experiments described in liu et al 2005 the test case studied the wave field and run up run down generated by a sliding three dimensional rigid wedge and illustrates the attainable accuracy for mechanically coupled simulations of free surface flows using overset grids fig 3 shows a sketch of the experimental setup simulations were performed for turbulent flows using the k ω model and no slip boundary conditions free surface elevations were measured at different locations two of which are depicted on the bottom of fig 3 in the present study the motion of the wedge was computed by the 6dof motion modeller and was mechanically coupled to the ramp by the translational joint described in sec 2 5 1 in other words this joint serves as a sleeve bearing for the sling wedge and the motion is calculated numerically in each time step under the mechanical joint condition thus the motion is not predefined the considered forces are confined to gravitational and fluid dynamic forces i e contact forces between the wedge and the ground are deemed negligible the initial emergence of the slide was 0 32 c m and the mass of the wedge was assigned to 467 83 k g the numerical grids contained 5 1 10 6 and 1 55 10 5 cells for the background and the foreground grid respectively the simulation used a grid refinement featuring approximately 15 cells per wave height fig 4 shows the predicted time evolution of the free surface contour at six different time steps as the wedge moves down the incline in this sequence the generation and its subsequence propagation of a wave train can be observed fig 5 compares the surface elevations simulated at gauge a and b with experimental data the wave amplitude in the simulation is slightly underestimated for gauge a and overestimated for gauge b however the wave phase is well predicted note that the experimental data were carried out by visual observation of video images supported by resistance wave gauges with unknown sampling rates overall the numerical simulation revealed a fair agreement with the experimental data furthermore the numerical variation of the wedge s motion to the incline of the ramp remains in the order of 1 10 5 and hence negligible as compared to the extent of the body o m during the entire simulation which demonstrates a reasonable functional capability of the applied mechanical joint 3 2 generic platform with heaving legs the validation case refers to a generic platform with two attached legs which are restricted to heave perpendicularly to the platform the aim was to verify the implementation of the mechanical joints as depicted in fig 6 the platform was exposed to waves and therefore performed a pitch motion both legs were coupled to the platform by translational joints the legs should thus pitch in accord with the platform but were free to heave independently the initial position of the two legs at t 0 s can be seen on the right diagram of fig 7 furthermore a constant force was applied to both legs which cause an additional heaving motion in this simulation three overlapping grids containing 2 25 10 5 cells for the background grid and 2 5 10 4 for the foreground grids were used to compute the laminar flow with slip wall boundary conditions for the verification the platform s dimension was 15 m 15 m 2 m and the dimension of each leg reads 3 m 3 m 15 m the density of all three bodies was half the density of water thus the three bodies were half submerged in the static calm water conditions the wave field was characterized by a wave height and wave length of h w 1 3 m and λ 20 m respectively a constant force of f z 135 k n was applied to the local z axis of both legs in fig 7 pitch and heave motions of the system are presented as expected all three bodies performed exactly the same pitch motion since the buoyancy forces compensated the external forces acting on the legs the legs vertical displacements were gradually diminishing the legs were initialised in different heights and therefore heaved in shifted phase the pitch of the platform and the attached legs also declined gradually as expected results were all in line with the expectations and indicated the capability of the mechanical model to capture complex relative motions of a coupled multi body system 3 3 seabed penetration of jack up legs the third test case is concerned with the leg seabed interaction emphasis is given to the predictive accuracy of the computed seabed reaction force during the penetration of an exemplary leg which featured a diameter of 4 5 m and a cone angle of 76 the leg was penetrated vertically into the superfine silica sand which is representative for many offshore locations see fig 8 results of the present simulation were compared to reference data taken from kreuzer et al 2014 who employed a finite element fe method in a coupled eulerian lagrangian cel framework to investigate the leg seabed interaction the cel fe method has been successfully used to simulate the penetration process of spudcans or legs into soils qiu and grabe 2012 to simulate the behaviour of the soil a comprehensive hypoplastic model von wolffersdorff 1996 was used by the authors in kreuzer et al 2014 in the present study the soil phase was modelled as a viscoplastic incompressible material which featured a strain rate dependent plastic deformation cf sec 2 4 inherently the elastic and compressible properties of the soil cannot be considered in this incompressible framework a remedy to this issue and thereby append reaction forces by reason of compression to the model was the supplementary use of a combination of linear fenders to the penetrated leg see fig 9 the soil resistivity manifests a similar characteristics to that of the fender model i e the reaction force rise when the material gets compressed since the seabed reaction force is nonlinear two fictitious fenders with different spring stiffness were combined to mimic the elastic behaviour of the sand this way any seabed composition or desired soil resistivity can be approximated by applying suitable fender parameters which were assigned and tuned to mimic a certain previously investigated soil behaviour thus both soil characteristics i e compressibility and plastic deformation were covered in this combined approach fig 10 displays a fair predictive agreement between the present cohesionless model cf table 1 and the reference data provided by kreuzer et al 2014 for vertical reaction forces of the leg the seabed reaction force progression was thus reasonably reproduced by the combined model 3 4 grounding of gravity foundations the following application refers to a shallow water foundation for offshore wind turbines the structure is usually towed to a desired location and subsequently lowered to the ground by partial flooding see fig 1 fig 11 depicts the investigated structure which featured eight symmetrically arranged flooding compartments and a mass of 7315 8 t the overset grids contained 9 2 10 5 cells for the background and 1 35 10 6 cells for the foreground grid the soil parameters were taken from table 1 and the soil was considered to be cohesionless to ensure a realistic sinkage depth two fictitious fenders were applied right beneath the surface of the soil phase once the bottom of the foundation hit the ground the fender will be compressed without loss of generality the fender s spring stiffness is assigned to c 1 32 10 6 n m and c 2 64 10 6 n m the damping coefficients are defined as d 1 16 10 5 k g s and d 2 8 10 5 k g s note that in this application case the fender parameters were chosen to meet desired attributes i e reasonable final sinkage depth preventing long simulation time in fact any desired soil resistivity can be applied here in the first simulation no external forces e g induced by towing hawsers were considered as indicated by fig 12 the foundation tilted aside during the simulated flooding process the reason for tilting was the reduction of stability during flooding and a small asymmetry of the discrete model which is induced by the automated generation of the unstructured mesh in view of transient inhomogeneous environmental and initial conditions an asymmetry seems not unrealistic and can harm the operation to prevent tilting the foundations are stabilized by towing hawsers of the tugs operating nearby see fig 1 center regarding this four numerical ropes were applied to the foundation s shaft and were bonded to fixed local points in a height of 10 5 c m above the free surface the arrangement of the ropes was in a circular angle of 90 around the foundation cf fig 13 all ropes had a relaxed length of 98 5 m and the emploed rope parameters were c 6 76 10 4 n m and d 2 9 10 5 n s m for the spring and damping coefficient in the beginning of the process the ropes were already strained with a initialised rope length of 99 m the simulation result by means of the flooding process and the velocity magnitudes inside the foundation at different time steps are shown in fig 14 as the water penetrated into the flooding compartments the foundation began to sink gradually until it hit the ground and was filled up completely the top diagrams of fig 15 shows the corresponding motions the vertical sinking motion stopped at 21 m i e the foundation subsided 1 m into the seabed and the vertical velocity vanished as the foundation reached the ground the rotational motion diagram reveals tilting in x and y direction at the time of highest sinking velocity but this time the foundation was stabilized by ropes which can be seen in the bottom diagrams of fig 15 as expected during the sinking phase of the foundation the rope forces decreased first since the ropes got stress relief based on the ropes arrangement as soon as the foundation experienced pitch and roll which led to tilting in the direction of rope 3 rope 2 was tightened again and forces of rope 3 were nearly vanishing finally the foundation sank to ground with a small final pitch and roll angle of 0 2 which again strained all ropes note that the rope forces are expressed by the magnitudes of the forces the force discrepancy in the final process was dominated by vertical components fig 16 depicts the velocity distribution in the installation process the sinking motion induced translational velocities under the foundations bottom i e in the suspension layer to the soil phase which leads to a soil bulge around the foundation base 3 5 jack up elevation in seaway the final application is concerned with the hydrodynamic performance during the installation process of a generic jack up vessel the aim was to analyse the hydrodynamic forces acting on the vessel and to examine potential operational limits herein all components of the computational model were combined regarding the safety of the crew during operations roll motion and large accelerations should be avoided 3 5 1 elevation process in natural seaway the first investigations were concerned with the elevation process of the generic jack up vessel kreuzer et al 2014 depicted in fig 17 the main dimensions of the considered geometry are given in table 2 herein v c g denotes the vertical distance from baseline to the center of gravity which is horizontally at amidships the jack up consisted of a main platform which had translational joints to its four legs the employed coupling allowed the legs to move only perpendicular to the ships longitudinal axis to lower the legs in reality they are flooded and additionally pushed down by a hydraulic system since the flooding of the legs are not of interest the simulation can be simplified by adding a time dependent mass conditioned by the lowering depth of the legs this mimics a water flux that scales with the vertical motion 23 m t m 0 m d t m 0 ρ w a w l z t d t m 0 ρ w a w l z t herein m 0 denotes the initial mass of the leg ρ w is the water density and a w l describes the leg s water line area the time dependent vertical position of the leg s center of gravity refers to z t six grids were used for this turbulent flow overset simulation the background grid contained 8 10 6 the platform had 5 10 6 and each leg counted 2 62 10 5 cells a fully developed jonswap spectrum of 200 wave components using h s 2 m and t s 5 s was applied the extent of the compact computational domain is 200 m 300 m and the water depth was 30 m the initial positions of the legs were assigned to 5 m above the seabed to model the compressibility of the seabed additional fenders were applied to the penetration area of each leg cf sec 3 3 the fenders act right beneath the seabed surface as soon as each single leg hit the ground the fenders will be compressed without loss of generality each fender s spring stiffness denotes to c 1 35 10 6 n m and c 2 80 10 6 n m the damping coefficients are d 1 20 10 5 k g s and d 2 20 10 5 k g s again note that any desired soil resistivity characteristic can be applied here for this application the given combination were chosen for reasonable sinkage depth after the legs penetrated into the soil the main ship lifted itself up to a given height by adding a ramp force to the platform and correlating moments at the leg joint positions to ensure stability while the platform was lifting up the legs experienced supplementary stability forces by the weight of the platform fig 18 illustrates the overall jacking procedure of a generic jack up vessel in a natural seaway and fig 19 shows the corresponding vertical motion of the platform and the legs mind that actual leg velocities typically refer to 1 2 m m i n and the legs were lowered much faster in the present study due to the flooding the legs hit the seabed for the first time at t 2 s and come at rest at a penetration depth of 2 m while the platform started to jack up itself to a defined height of 12 m the jacking forces which lifted up the platform were also applied to all legs in the opposite direction these forces and induced moments contribute to the stability of the vessel due to a draught of 6 m an air gap of 5 m was achieved at the end 3 5 2 loads on the platform the final investigations refer to the loads on the platform due to beam waves therefore the jack up vessel was exposed to harmonic waves of same wave length λ 35 m and wave height of h w 6 m during the elevation process the wave crest was supposed to hit the platform before the legs reach the ground at the time of the penetration and after the legs already dived into the seabed therefore three different phases φ 1 12 07 φ 2 10 74 and φ 3 9 41 were of particular interest fig 20 exemplifies the free surface elevation at t 1 5 s when a wave crest reached the platform fig 21 compares the lateral forces of the beam waves for different wave phases as well as the corresponding roll moments and roll motion of the vessel the maximum amplitudes of the hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on the vessel were assigned to the wave impacts since the bulk of the vessel was submerged in water at the time of impact for all three cases the platform got excited and hence performed a roll motion in the case of φ 1 the roll motion was exclusively dominated by hydrodynamic forces for φ 2 and φ 3 the legs already had contact to the ground thus the wave impact forces could cause a tilting of the vessel by the down jacked legs during subsequent lowering which was rather a mechanical effect in these cases safe working condition is not assured and jacking would not be performed mind that a critical significant wave height for jacking operation is typically 2 5 m maximum swire blue ocean 2013 öster 2016 these cases illustrated and predicted the hydrodynamic performance of jack up rigs in extreme seaway conditions 4 conclusion and future work hydrodynamic simulations of complex offshore installation procedures using mechanical couplings have been presented to overcome the challenge of large relative motions implicitly coupled overset grids were applied special seaway boundary conditions combining viscous solutions in the near field and inviscid solutions in the far field were used to avoid undesirable reflections from the boundaries and allowed for the use of relatively compact domain sizes a quaternion based motion module with constraint conditions and models of several basic mechanical joint elements has been successfully implemented with the help of the mechanical joints three phase flow simulations including structure seabed interactions have been modelled realistically the characteristics of the seabed can be modelled using a combination of fenders and the soil model finally the algorithm was successfully validated and applied to the installation process of a gravity foundation and a jack up rig future work will focus on the hydrodynamic analysis of different seaway conditions for the jacking mode to investigate safety margins furthermore more complex application scenarios and simulation methods for e g crane operations on sea and mooring systems

in general conventional mooring systems involving ropes and rope winches have been mostly used for mooring operations mostly human work force is required for mooring operations that conducted by using of conventional system instead of new tech automation systems mooring process of vessels is one of the most dangerous operations because of the high accident risk during mooring operations an international insurance company united kingdom protection and indemnity club published a report that expresses type of injuries from mooring operations causing claims over us 100 000 from 1987 to 2013

during mooring operation is analysed by using fuzzy extended fault tree analysing fta the next section gives theoretical background of the method 2 1 fuzzy fault tree analysis ffta in traditional fta the failure probabilities of system are treated as crisp values in predicting the failure probability of the top event te khan and husain 2001 the data scarcity is one of the greatest problem for calculating the failure rate of component in the maritime industry lavasani et al 2015a to deal with this limitation fuzzy extended fault tree analysis was introduced the basic aim of the ffta is to define potential causes of system failures sahin 2017 the method provides to assess probability of the te using analytic methods which requires system quantitative reliability information lavasani et al 2015b since data scarcity is one of the significant challenge in maritime industry the expert judgement possibilities can be an alternative solution in the method akyuz 2017 soner et al 2017 most of the human decisions are based on qualitative and possibility terms rather than probabilistic terms fuzzy logic works on possibilistic terms and converts them into probabilistic values baig and ruzli 2014 therefore fuzzy sets are adopted into the fta to transform possibilities of expert judgement to probability celik et al 2010 application of fuzzy set theory makes it possible to elicit the expert judgment which is given in natural language as linguistic variables demirel et al 2019 akyuz and celik 2018 gul et al 2017 mahmood et al 2013 possibility can be defined as the qualitative characteristic of an event whereas the probability is the numerical quantitative characteristic of likelihood of an event the method basically consists of a few sequential steps in the first step the ft diagram is created in the second step expert judgements are obtained by using fuzzy logic thereafter obtained fuzzy linguistic judgement are used to convert possibilities to probabilities then minimal cut sets mcss and te of the fault tree is predicted the mcs is a set of basic events whose simultaneous occurrence ensures that the top event occurs fig 1 shows conceptual framework of method 2 1 1 constructing ft diagram in the first step ft diagram is constructed once te is determined the te seems the most significant event whose consequences are potentially catastrophic for human and maritime environment the te is selected to construct ft diagram which addresses the chains of events by using logic gates 2 1 2 obtaining possibilities from the expert judgment since there is lack of data in maritime industry obtaining possibilities from the expert judgement can be a practical solution the experts state their opinions for each basic event be which refers to the starting points for the chains of events due to the scarcity of data expert elicitation is required to synthase of expert s opinions of a subject lavasani et al 2015a as the importance of each expert s opinion about an attribute might not be equal the assessments are influenced by the degree of importance of each expert yuhua and datao 2005 introduced weighting score to represent the relative quality of different expert the weighting scores of experts were determined according to title service time experience and education level if some experts are viewed as better than others the better experts might be given greater weight also mooring operation is more difficult and complex for ship crew compared to shore crew most of mooring operation process performed by ship crew using mooring winches swivels and ropes that s why sea service experience is more important than shore service experience and ranking score of sea service time determined higher than shore service time for evaluation the expert judgement is performed in linguistic terms which are used for soliciting expert opinion for each basic event be lavasani et al 2015b table 1 demonstrates weighting scores of non homogenous experts senol et al 2015 hsu and chen 1994 proposed a non homogeneous group of expert elicitation method called as sam similarity aggregation method to transform linguistic terms to their corresponding fuzzy numbers the basic steps of sam are defined as follows i aggregating obtained possibilities in this step suppose each expert suppose each expert e k k 1 2 m expresses his her opinion on a particular attribute against a specific context by a predefined set of linguistic variables the linguistic term is transformed to the corresponding fuzzy numbers the detail of algorithm is expressed as follows senol et al 2015 lavasani et al 2015a 1 calculating degree of agreement e u and e v denotes each pair of experts and s u v r u r u states opinions of them where s u v r u r v 0 1 in this context a a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 and b b 1 b 2 b 3 b 4 are two generic trapezoidal fuzzy numbers the following equation 1 at this point can be used to determine degree of similarity between these two fuzzy numbers by using by the similarity function of s 1 s a b 1 1 4 i 1 4 a i b i where s a b 0 1 the larger value of s a b the greater similarity between two fuzzy numbers of a a n d b 2 calculate average agreement

following equation 4 are used to estimate consensus coefficient degree of the experts e u u 1 2 m 4 c c e u β w e u 1 β r a e u 5 aggregate result of the experts judgments the final step is to aggregate result of the experts judgments ag which can be obtained as following equation 5 5 r a g c e 1 r 1 c e 2 r 2 c e m r m ii defuzzifying of aggregated expert judgment fuzzy possibility the aim of this step is to convert triangular or trapezoidal numbers into crisp numbers in order to analyse by decision maker under fuzzy environment a centre of area coa technique is adopted for defuzzification lavasani et al 2015a b sugeno 1999 6 x u i x x d x u i x in the equation x denotes fuzzy possibility u i x states aggregated membership function and x gives output variable iii converting possibilities to probabilities in this step possibilities gathered from expert judgements are transformed into probabilities onisawa 1988 introduced an equations 7 and 8 to convert fuzzy failure possibility to fuzzy failure probability the rate of fuzzy probability fp t can be taken from fuzzy possibility fps rates onisawa 1988 equations 7 and 8 show how fps rates of mcss can be transformed into the fp t values according to swain and guttmann 1983 the fuzzy probability score fpr can be obtained from the fuzzy possibility score fps and is defined as mentes and helvacioglu 2011 7 p r 1 10 k f p s 0 0 f p s 0 8 k 1 f p s f p s 1 3 2 301 2 1 3 mcs and overall probability of te calculation the mcs is one of the critical elements of the ft which involves a set of mcss it is used to understand the structural vulnerability of a system the following equation expresses mcs 9 9 t m c s 1 m c s 2 m c s n i 1 n c m c s accordingly equation 10 is employed to evaluate probability of

undesired events in the system and cause to the te andrews and moss 2002 clearly expressed that if ft has mcs represented by i 1 n in this context in case at least one mcs exist then the te z will

capable of prioritising of each mcs which is of paramount during risk assessment the ranking of mcs gives importance degree during occurrence of the te in this paper a vesely fussell importance measure v fim methodology is employed to rank of mcs following equation 12 is used 12 i i v f t q i t q s t where i i v f t states importance of m c i q i t denotes occurrence probability of m c b and q i t defines occurrence probability of the te in all mcs 3 application the ffta is applied to a real case marine accident for conducting a comprehensive risk analysing the case of m t zarga is analysed the accident occurred while the tanker ship m t zarga was berthing manoeuvring to lng liquefied neutral gas terminal 3 1 problem statement mooring of vessels is one of the most dangerous operations in maritime industry since mooring operations pose high accident risk many of them have occurred during mooring operations which may cause severe consequences such as fatalities injuries and financial loss the contributory factors consist of lack of mooring equipment maintenance untrained and inexperienced personnel equipment failures available weather conditions poor communication safety procedure errors risk assessment failure in general kuzu and arslan 2017 the catastrophic consequences may occur in case of a mooring failure at tanker terminals hence risk levels of mooring operations at tanker ship terminals are higher when compared to other terminals 3 2 narrative a real case ship accident the case of mt zarga a mooring accident occurred at the south hook tanker terminal on march 2015 a deck officer in charge of forward mooring party on board m t zarga was seriously injured during berthing operation at the south hook tanker terminal due to a parted mooring rope m t zarga was carrying 266 000 m3 lng liquefied neutral gas cargo when accident occurred after announcement of all fast tugs assisted to berthing operation were instructed to let go at that time the wind force suddenly increased to 38 knots and m t zarga started to move out of her berthing position master of ship instructed deck officer in charge of forward mooring party to heave up forward spring ropes for berthing m t zarga again the deck officer in charge positioned aft of roller fairlead of forward spring ropes and ordered winch operator to heave up spring ropes that began to creak after a while excessive tensioned rope suddenly parted and struck head of deck officer in charge a third officer contacted with bridge and informed master about accident and severe injury of deck officer in charge the master of ship requested medical aid for injured deck officer and two tugs for keeping tanker alongside maib 2015 2017 3 3 marine expert definition a group of experts two pilot two ship master one chief officer and one academician were participated into survey to determine failure possibilities of be with respect to the fuzzy scale pilots ship masters and chief officer are experienced in mooring operations the academician has sea experience as junior officer and his field of study is maritime safety and risk analysis experiences and educational levels of participants illustrated in table 2 as profile details of marine experts 3 4 an extensive risk analysis for severe accident during tanker mooring operation a comprehensive risk analysis of mooring operation of m t zarga is performed to enhance safety and mitigate risks in maritime industry in this case mooring operation had concluded with severe head injury of crew therefore parted rope injury during ship mooring operation is selected as the te since it may pose acute dangers for crew the ft diagram for severe head injury during tanker mooring operation is provided in fig 2 the ft diagram is constructed under supervision of six marine experts as illustrated in the ft diagram there are twenty one bes and five intermediate events ie described table 3 shows the operational faults related with severe head injury accident during ship mooring operation since there is lack of failure data in maritime industry the fuzzy sets are employed to obtain failure rates when one of be evaluated as very unlikely by experts this evaluation means that the effect of be is insignificant for occurrence of te the linguistic expression of marine experts can be converted into fuzzy numbers sahin 2017 in this context fig 3 shows fuzzy rating and membership functions and table 4 depicts linguistic terms and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers of possibilities chen and hwang 2015 chen and hwang 2015 developed a numerical approximation method where standardized seven linguistic scales very low vl low l mildly low ml medium m mildly high mh high h very high hv were introduced these numerical scales are capable of transforming linguistic expression of experts into fuzzy numbers to estimate possibility conversion scale for linguistic variables i e linguistic terms and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers of possibilities shown in table 5 baas and kwakernaak 1977 chen 2015 since there are six marine experts participated survey their opinion about an attribute might not be equal table 5 illustrates marine expert weights with respect to the expert profiles table 6 in this context shows linguistic judgements of marine experts for priorities of each be after obtained judgements of marine experts aggregation stage is applied since there are twenty one bes determined by marine experts be1 is selected as demonstration for aggregation stage equations 1 4 are used respectively in this context table 7 shows similarity functions and similarity values table 8 illustrates average agreement of marine experts aa relative agreement ra of marine experts and consensus coefficient cc in this section β is assigned as 0 5 since all marine experts are considered as identical senol et al 2015 equation 5 is applied to obtain aggregated expert judgements on operational failures thereafter defuzzification process is adopted to transform fuzzy numbers into crisp values equation 6 table 9 shows aggregated expert judgements and defuzzified failure possibilities for each be since the possibilities of each failure are derived from judgements of experts they must be transformed into probabilities to calculate the mcss and te in this case equations 7 and 8 are used table 10 illustrates probabilities of failures obtained from possibilities in order to calculate probability of te in the ship accident the case of mt zarga equations 9 and 10 are used in the view of ft diagram and logic gates described in the ft the failure probability of te is found as 8 29e 02 after obtained probability of the te the mcss are determined table 11 shows mcss their occurrence probabilities and v fim list of mcss by applying equation 12 3 5 findings and extended discussions in the view of finding probability of the te indicates that there is definite high risk during ship mooring operations the basic events having highest failure probabilities and mcss are the most important factors that should be eliminated for risk avoidance the te is mostly affected by the basic events of be3 be9 and be20as well as mcs of be1be2 and be19be20be21 the most important basic events are determined as misinformation be3 standing in snap back zone during mooring operation be9 and using improper ropes for mooring be20 as per calculations of occurrence probability misinformation stems from wrong instruction that given by pilot captain or mooring master during mooring operations misinformation causes operation failures that may result to accidents during ship mooring operations snap back zone is the space where it is probable that the broken mooring rope recoil with extreme forces markings of snap back zones enable warning mooring crew to avoid standing snap back zones when mooring ropes are under tension use of improper ropes for mooring causes rope breakage each mooring ropes has safety working load swl as per its own specifications such as manufacturing materials rope construction number of rope strands etc mooring ropes should have strength to resist static and dynamic loads during mooring operations otherwise mooring ropes break and result to severe accident communication which is one of the most important factors for safe mooring operations carried out via communication equipment and by using standard marine communication phrases proper communication between pilot and captain enables safe directing ships in mooring operation and proper communication between pilot and tug enables safe tug assistance to ships in mooring operations language conflict b1 malfunction of communication equipment b2 and planning improper quay for berthing b19 using improper ropes for mooring b20 and improper tug assistance 21 creates mcss together that s why these basic events that create mcss are also important and should be eliminated for risk avoidance during mooring operations also this study reveals that selection and inspection of mooring ropes communication and standing snap back zone during mooring operation are critical factors that trigger mooring accident injury by parted ropes occurrence probability of critical basic events can be reduced by various risk control options for preventing mooring accident injuries proper communication between mooring operation parties should be enabled for safe mooring operations this can be achieved by application standard training modules that consist of both theoretical hands on trainings and on board trainings to mooring operation parties at certain intervals selection and inspection of mooring ropes determined as another critical factor for preventing mooring accident injury by parted ropes there are various types of mooring ropes and proper type of ropes should be used for safe mooring operations ship size tonnage usage area material specification and safe working load of ropes are things to take into consideration for selecting proper mooring ropes standing in snap back zone also determined as a critical factor at this study audio visual warning alarm that warns mooring parties in case of entering to snap back zone can be developed for prevention of standing in snap back zone during mooring operation personal protective equipment ppe of mooring crew can be toughened by durable materials and bumpers to mitigate severity of injury due to parted rope in case of a mooring accident calculation based on subjective probabilities is applied in several cases korta et al 1996 4 conclusion mooring operation at ships poses serious concerns in terms of safety for ship crew ship and marine environment therefore determining potential risks related to ship mooring operation are quite significant for maritime safety researchers this paper performs a comprehensive risk analysing to enhance maritime safety in operational aspects as well as to prevent maritime environment to accomplish this purpose the fta is adopted under fuzzy environment the use of fuzzy probability can describe the failure probability of each basic event and their uncertainties gul et al 2017 lavasani et al 2015a b the paper is capable of performing extensive quantitative risk analysing a real case study related with accident in ship mooring operation is analysed to underline the potential contribution of the ffta in risk management in the light of the extended risk analysing the occurrence probability of the te and mcss are calculated after quantifying the occurrence of the te and ranking of the mcss based on their calculated priorities v fim the mcss be3 and be9 have been observed as the substantial component of the system besides its robust theoretical background the findings of the ffta is capable of minimizing risk of te in the system the outcomes of this paper also provides practical contributions to risk analysis for ship owners and tanker terminal managers in particular preventing severe accident in critical port and terminal operations acknowledgement this article is partially produced from phd dissertation entitled modelling tanker mooring operations

ruzli 2014 therefore fuzzy sets are adopted into the fta to transform possibilities of expert judgement to probability celik et al 2010 application of fuzzy set theory makes it possible to elicit the expert judgment which is given in natural language as linguistic variables demirel et al 2019 akyuz and celik 2018 gul et al 2017 mahmood et al 2013 possibility can be defined as the qualitative characteristic of an event whereas the probability is the numerical quantitative characteristic of likelihood of an event the method basically consists of a few sequential steps in the first step the ft diagram is created in the second step expert judgements are obtained by using fuzzy logic thereafter obtained fuzzy linguistic judgement are used to convert possibilities to probabilities then minimal cut sets mcss and te of the fault tree is predicted the mcs is a set of basic events whose simultaneous occurrence ensures that the top event occurs fig 1 shows conceptual framework of method 2 1 1 constructing ft diagram in the first step ft diagram is constructed once te is determined the te seems the most significant event whose consequences are potentially catastrophic for human and maritime environment the te is selected to construct ft diagram which addresses the chains of events by using logic gates 2 1 2 obtaining possibilities from the expert judgment since there is lack of data in maritime industry obtaining possibilities from the expert judgement can be a practical solution the experts state their opinions for each basic event be which refers to the starting points for the chains of events due to the scarcity of data expert elicitation is required to synthase of expert s opinions of a subject lavasani et al 2015a as the importance of each expert s opinion about an attribute might not be equal the assessments are influenced by the degree of importance of each expert yuhua and datao 2005 introduced weighting score to represent the relative quality of different expert the weighting scores of experts were determined according to title service time experience and education level if some experts are viewed as better than others the better experts might be given greater weight also mooring operation is more difficult and complex for ship crew compared to shore crew most of mooring operation process performed by ship crew using mooring winches swivels and ropes that s why sea service experience is more important than shore service experience and ranking score of sea service time determined higher than shore service time for evaluation the expert judgement is performed in linguistic terms which are used for soliciting expert opinion for each basic event be lavasani et al 2015b table 1 demonstrates weighting scores of non homogenous experts senol et al 2015 hsu and chen 1994 proposed a non homogeneous group of expert elicitation method called as sam similarity aggregation method to transform linguistic terms to their corresponding fuzzy numbers the basic steps of sam are defined as follows i aggregating obtained possibilities in this step suppose each expert suppose each expert e k k 1 2 m expresses his her opinion on a particular attribute against a specific context by a predefined set of linguistic variables the linguistic term is transformed to the corresponding fuzzy numbers the detail of algorithm is expressed as follows senol et al 2015 lavasani et al 2015a 1 calculating degree of agreement e u and e v denotes each pair of experts and s u v r u r u states opinions of them where s u v r u r v 0 1 in this context a a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 and b b 1 b 2 b 3 b 4 are two generic trapezoidal fuzzy numbers the following equation 1 at this point can be used to determine degree of similarity between these two fuzzy numbers by using by the similarity function of s 1 s a b 1 1 4 i 1 4 a i b i where s a b 0 1 the larger value of s a b the greater similarity between two fuzzy numbers of a a n d b 2 calculate average agreement aa degree aa e u of the experts in this step following equation 2 is used to determine average agreement degree of the experts 2 a a e u 1 m 1 u v m s r u r v 3 determine relative agreement ra degree

following equation 4 are used to estimate consensus coefficient degree of the experts e u u 1 2 m 4 c c e u β w e u 1 β r a e u 5 aggregate result of the experts judgments the final step is to aggregate result of the experts judgments ag which can be obtained as following equation 5 5 r a g c e 1 r 1 c e 2 r 2 c e m r m ii defuzzifying of aggregated expert judgment fuzzy possibility the aim of this step is to convert triangular or trapezoidal numbers into crisp numbers in order to analyse by decision maker under fuzzy environment a centre of area coa technique is adopted for defuzzification lavasani et al 2015a b sugeno 1999 6 x u i x x d x u i x in the equation x denotes fuzzy possibility u i x states aggregated membership function and x gives output variable iii converting possibilities to probabilities in this step possibilities gathered from expert judgements are transformed into probabilities onisawa 1988 introduced an equations 7 and 8 to convert fuzzy failure possibility to fuzzy failure probability the rate of fuzzy probability fp t can be taken from fuzzy possibility fps rates onisawa 1988 equations 7 and 8 show how fps rates of mcss can be transformed into the fp t values according to swain and guttmann 1983 the fuzzy probability score fpr can be obtained from the fuzzy possibility score fps and is defined as mentes and helvacioglu 2011 7 p r 1 10 k f p s 0 0 f p s 0 8 k 1 f p s f p s 1 3 2 301 2 1 3 mcs and overall probability of te calculation the mcs is one of the critical elements of the ft which involves a set of mcss it is used to understand the structural vulnerability of a system the following equation expresses mcs 9 9 t m c s 1 m c s 2 m c s n i 1 n c m c s accordingly equation 10 is employed to evaluate probability of te occurrence the given equation is valid only certain limited conditions each mcs is independent 10 p t p m c s 1 m c s 2 m c s n p m c s 1 p m c s 2 p m c s n p m c s 1 m c s 2 p m c s 1 m c s 3 p m

undesired events in the system and cause to the te andrews and moss 2002 clearly expressed that if ft has mcs represented by i 1 n in this context in case at least one mcs exist then the te z will exists following equation 11 will be used 11 z m c 1 m c 2 m c n c i 1 n c m c i where p m c s i states occurrence probability of mcsi and n denotes the number of mcs 2 1 4 ranking of mcs the fta is capable of prioritising of each mcs which is of paramount during risk assessment the ranking of mcs gives importance degree during occurrence of the te in this paper a vesely fussell importance measure v fim methodology is employed to rank of mcs following equation 12 is used 12 i i v f t q i t q s t where i i v f t states importance of m c i q i t denotes occurrence probability of m c b and q i t defines occurrence probability of the te in all mcs 3 application the ffta is applied to a real case marine accident for conducting a comprehensive risk analysing the case of m t zarga is analysed the accident occurred while the tanker ship m t zarga was berthing manoeuvring to lng liquefied neutral gas terminal 3 1 problem statement mooring of vessels is one of the most dangerous operations in maritime industry since mooring operations pose high accident risk many of them have occurred during mooring operations which may cause severe consequences such as fatalities injuries and financial loss the contributory factors consist of lack of mooring equipment maintenance untrained and inexperienced personnel equipment failures available weather conditions poor communication safety procedure errors risk assessment failure in general kuzu and arslan 2017 the catastrophic consequences may occur in case of a mooring failure at tanker terminals hence risk levels of mooring operations at tanker ship terminals are higher when compared to other terminals 3 2 narrative a real case ship accident the case of mt zarga a mooring accident occurred at the south hook tanker terminal on march 2015 a deck officer in charge of forward mooring party on board m t zarga was seriously injured during berthing operation at the south hook tanker terminal due to a parted mooring rope m t zarga was carrying 266 000 m3 lng liquefied neutral gas cargo when accident occurred after announcement of all fast tugs assisted to berthing operation were instructed to let go at that time the wind force suddenly increased to 38 knots and m t zarga started to move out of her berthing position master of ship instructed deck officer in charge of forward mooring party to heave up forward spring ropes for berthing m t zarga again the deck officer in charge positioned aft of roller fairlead of forward spring ropes and ordered winch operator to heave up spring ropes that began to creak after a while excessive tensioned rope suddenly parted and struck head of deck officer in charge a third officer contacted with bridge and informed master about accident and severe injury of deck officer in charge the master of ship requested medical aid for injured deck officer and two tugs for keeping tanker alongside maib 2015 2017 3 3 marine expert definition a group of experts two pilot two ship master one chief officer and one academician were participated into survey to determine failure possibilities of be with respect to the fuzzy scale pilots ship masters and chief officer are experienced in mooring operations the academician has sea experience as junior officer and his field of study is maritime safety and risk analysis experiences and educational levels of participants illustrated in table 2 as profile details of marine experts 3 4 an extensive risk analysis for severe accident during tanker mooring operation a comprehensive risk analysis of mooring operation of m t zarga is performed to enhance safety and mitigate risks in maritime industry in this case mooring operation had concluded with severe head injury of crew therefore parted rope injury during ship mooring operation is selected as the te since it may pose acute dangers for crew the ft diagram for severe head injury during tanker mooring operation is provided in fig 2 the ft diagram is constructed under supervision of six marine experts as illustrated in the ft diagram there are twenty one bes and five intermediate events ie described table 3 shows the operational faults related with severe head injury accident during ship mooring operation since there is lack of failure data in maritime industry the fuzzy sets are employed to obtain failure rates when one of be evaluated as very unlikely by experts this evaluation means that the effect of be is insignificant for occurrence of te the linguistic expression of marine experts can be converted into fuzzy numbers sahin 2017 in this context fig 3 shows fuzzy rating and membership functions and table 4 depicts linguistic terms and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers of possibilities chen and hwang 2015 chen and hwang 2015 developed a numerical approximation method where standardized seven linguistic scales very low vl low l mildly low ml medium m mildly high mh high h very high hv were introduced these numerical scales are capable of transforming linguistic expression of experts into fuzzy numbers to estimate possibility conversion scale for linguistic variables i e linguistic terms and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers of possibilities shown in table 5 baas and kwakernaak 1977 chen 2015 since there are six marine experts participated survey their opinion about an attribute might not be equal table 5 illustrates marine expert weights with respect to the expert profiles table 6 in this context shows linguistic judgements of marine experts for priorities of each be after obtained judgements of marine experts aggregation stage is applied since there are twenty one bes determined by marine experts be1 is selected as demonstration for aggregation stage equations 1 4 are used respectively in this context table 7 shows similarity functions and similarity values table 8 illustrates average agreement of marine experts aa relative agreement ra of marine experts and consensus coefficient cc in this section β is assigned as 0 5 since all marine experts are considered as identical senol et al 2015 equation 5 is applied to obtain aggregated expert judgements on operational failures thereafter defuzzification process is adopted to transform fuzzy numbers into crisp values equation 6 table 9 shows aggregated expert judgements and defuzzified failure possibilities for each be since the possibilities of each failure are derived from judgements of experts they must be transformed into probabilities to calculate the mcss and te in this case equations 7 and 8 are used table 10 illustrates probabilities of failures obtained from possibilities in order to calculate probability of te in the ship accident the case of mt zarga equations 9 and 10 are used in the view of ft diagram and logic gates described in the ft the failure probability of te is found as 8 29e 02 after obtained probability of the te the mcss are determined table 11 shows mcss their occurrence probabilities and v fim list of mcss by applying equation 12 3 5 findings and extended discussions in the view of finding probability of the te indicates that there is definite high risk during ship mooring operations the basic events having highest failure probabilities and mcss are the most important factors that should be eliminated for risk avoidance the te is mostly affected by the basic events of be3 be9 and be20as well as mcs of be1be2 and be19be20be21 the most important basic events are determined as misinformation be3 standing in snap back zone during mooring operation be9 and using improper ropes for mooring be20 as per calculations of occurrence probability misinformation stems from wrong instruction that given by pilot captain or mooring master during mooring operations misinformation causes operation failures that may result to accidents during ship mooring operations snap back zone is the space where it is probable that the broken mooring rope recoil with extreme forces markings of snap back zones enable warning mooring crew to avoid standing snap back zones when mooring ropes are under tension use of improper ropes for mooring causes rope breakage each mooring ropes has safety working load swl as per its own specifications such as manufacturing materials rope construction number of rope strands etc mooring ropes should have strength to resist static and dynamic loads during mooring operations otherwise mooring ropes break and result to severe accident communication which is one of the most important factors for safe mooring operations carried out via communication equipment and by using standard marine communication phrases proper communication between pilot and captain enables safe directing ships in mooring operation and proper communication between pilot and tug enables safe tug assistance to ships in mooring operations language conflict b1 malfunction of communication equipment b2 and planning improper quay for berthing b19 using improper ropes for mooring b20 and improper tug assistance 21 creates mcss together that s why these basic events that create mcss are also important and should be eliminated for risk avoidance during mooring operations also this study reveals that selection and inspection of mooring ropes communication and standing snap back zone during mooring operation are critical factors that trigger mooring accident injury by parted ropes occurrence probability of critical basic events can be reduced by various risk control options for preventing mooring accident injuries proper communication between mooring operation parties should be enabled for safe mooring operations this can be achieved by application standard training modules that consist of both theoretical hands on trainings and on board trainings to mooring operation parties at certain intervals selection and inspection of mooring ropes determined as another critical factor for preventing mooring accident injury by parted ropes there are various types of mooring ropes and proper type of ropes should be used for safe mooring operations ship size tonnage usage area material specification and safe working load of ropes are things to take into consideration for selecting proper mooring ropes standing in snap back zone also determined as a critical factor at this study audio visual warning alarm that warns mooring parties in case of entering to snap back zone can be developed for prevention of standing in snap back zone during mooring operation personal protective equipment ppe of mooring crew can be toughened by durable materials and bumpers to mitigate severity of injury due to parted rope in case of a mooring accident calculation based on subjective probabilities is applied in several cases korta et al 1996 4 conclusion mooring operation at ships poses serious concerns in terms of safety for ship crew ship and marine environment therefore determining potential risks related to ship mooring operation are quite significant for maritime safety researchers this paper performs a comprehensive risk analysing to enhance maritime safety in operational aspects as well as to prevent maritime environment to accomplish this purpose the fta is adopted under fuzzy environment the use of fuzzy probability can describe the failure probability of each basic event and their uncertainties gul et al 2017 lavasani et al 2015a b the paper is capable of performing extensive quantitative risk analysing a real case study related with accident in ship mooring operation is analysed to underline the potential contribution of the ffta in risk management in the light of the extended risk analysing the occurrence probability of the te and mcss are calculated after quantifying the occurrence of the te and ranking of the mcss based on their calculated priorities v fim the mcss be3 and be9 have been observed as the substantial component of the system besides its robust theoretical background the findings of the ffta is capable of minimizing risk of te in the system the outcomes of this paper also provides practical contributions to risk analysis for ship owners and tanker terminal managers in particular preventing severe accident in critical port and terminal operations acknowledgement this article is partially produced from phd dissertation entitled modelling tanker mooring operations

22874,human error is a significant factor triggering oil tanker collisions drawbacks jeopardizing the effectiveness of human error analysis from traditional studies are spotted this study proposes a risk assessment of human error contribution to oil tanker collision the research evaluates the collision probability of oil tanker using a fault tree analysis fta structure under which a modified fuzzy bayesian network based cognitive reliability error analysis method cream is developed to conduct human error assessment 39 specialists with substantial seagoing experience are invited to provide expert judgement for oil tanker navigation particularly in vicinity of the taiwanese waters different from traditional studies the proposed methodology provides a higher degree of result distinguishability meanwhile contemplating the weights and quantitative effects caused by the ambient elements without the loss of information from the experts it is concluded that lack of bridge resource management communication lack of communication between ships fatigue and collision regulation violations are the elements with higher occurrence rates and would also have great potential contributing to oil tanker collision once the likelihoods deteriorated in addition number of simultaneous goals in the bridge is the common performance condition cpc that significantly causes the occurrence of all the human error basic events keywords maritime risk assessment human error ship collision fault tree analysis cognitive reliability error analysis method fuzzy bayesian network 1 introduction over decades both international and national maritime authorities have devoted immense efforts to enhance ship safety however a large number of shipping accidents still take place worldwide according to the marine accident statistics from transportation safety board tsb of canada the most frequent type of shipping accidents from 2007 to 2016 is collision with the occurrence rate of 30 20 in 2649 casualties it is also true in taiwan where 34 98 of the shipping disasters taking place in the waters from 2010 to 2016 and 40 31 of the taiwanese merchant vessel tragedies during the period between 1992 and 2016 attribute to collision according to ministry of transportation and communications motc oil tankers could be the largest vessel type contributing to oil spill volume oil tanker collision has the highest occurrence percentage among all oil tanker accidents based on the international maritime organization imo global integrated shipping information system gisis database uğurlu et al 2013 according to statistics 75 96 of marine casualties are attributable to human errors pennie et al 2007 uğurlu et al 2015 while enormous endeavors are devoted to deal with such an issue the occurrence of human error in marine accidents still remains at an undesired level gaonkar et al 2011 noroozi et al 2014a such a statement still holds when investigating the causes of oil tanker collisions uğurlu et al 2013 a number of studies conduct human error assessment for maritime operations as well as oil tanker collisions however the drawbacks of such studies include the use of the human error database from nuclear power plants incapability of contemplating the relative importance of inputs lack of the ability to provide probabilistic outcomes loss of useful information from expert judgement low distinguishability degree of risk results and shortage of considering important factors in the ambiance affecting human performance such shortcomings may jeopardize the effectiveness of human error analysis and the outcomes may be questioned the objective of this study is to establish a methodology of human error assessment that is capable of resolving the aforementioned dilemmas and subsequently applied to assess ship collision risks for oil tankers navigating in taiwanese waters a group of experts familiar with oil tanker navigation in the taiwanese waters from the shipping industry and academia are invited to work as the consultants with the assistance from such experts the references from the marine accident databases including imo gisis canadian tsb and r o c motc as well as previous literature the study constructs a logical safety structure based on fault tree analysis fta addressing the relationships between events triggering ship collisions the human error related basic events are further analyzed taking into account the individual technological contextual and organizational factors that determine the human performance in ship operations owing to the data scarceness of such ambient factors the experts provide professional judgement to bridge the gap by virtue of a hybrid model incorporating fuzzy and bayesian network bn the likelihoods for each human error related basic event are acquired such a human error prediction model will have the capability to provide probabilistic outcomes with better risk discrimination meanwhile considers every piece of useful information from experts as well as the relative importance of each ambient factor with the aid from marine accident databases and previous studies the likelihoods of hardware related basic events are obtained the overall probability of oil tanker collision in taiwanese waters can consequently be determined finally crucial elements basic events leading to the accident are identified by virtue of a sensitivity analysis it is believed that the research outcomes generated from this study will be the useful information for the shipping industry academia and related government agencies in the aspect of enhancing oil tanker safety 2 literature review 2 1 marine accidents ship collision is one of the most frequent marine accidents worldwide a marine casualty analysis for ship disasters in turkish territorial waters between 2005 and 2015 indicates that collision is the most common accident type bolat 2016 it is also true in taiwan according to the statistics collected by motc with regard to the shipping accidents of the taiwanese merchant vessels from 1992 to 2016 as shown in table 1 40 31 of the tragedies attribute to collision likewise it can be seen from table 2 that such an accident type accounts for 34 98 of the merchant ship casualties taking place in the taiwanese waters during the period between 2010 and 2016 both tables 1 and 2 indicate that ship collision is the main cause of the merchant shipping accidents in taiwan 2 2 oil tanker accidents and human error ship collisions and groundings are the accident types that can lead to serious consequences particularly in relation to marine environmental pollution according to the main findings of a navigation risk analysis valdez banda et al 2016 furthermore oil tanker groundings and collisions are the main causes of the oil spill disasters over 700 tones occurring from the years of 1970 2017 and account for 29 and 32 of all the accidents itopf 2018 allowing for the catastrophic impacts potentially caused by oil spill a number of risk studies have been conducted to provide the insights regarding the possible occurrence of given spill sizes resulting from tanker collisions goerlandt and montewka 2015 montewka 2009 while the percentage of groundings has been declining there has been a steady increase in the collision proportion over the decades and such a figure reaches over 40 since the 2000s itopf 2018 in this sense oil tanker collisions may be one of the ship types imposing most pollution risks at sea nowadays although counter measures have been taken at an international level to enhance ship safety tanker accidents still remain a constant threat typical oil tanker accidents include collision grounding fire and sinking the most frequent tragedy type of oil tanker is collision according to the marine statistics compiled by the imo gisis database uğurlu et al 2013 a study investigates the marine accidents resulting in oil pollution and economic loss caused by the aframax tankers over 80 000 dwt during the period between 1978 and 2003 papanikolaou et al 2007 a total of 792 tanker accidents are analyzed collision is also the most frequent accident type and accounts for 29 of all the casualties furthermore the research reveals that the accidents involving collision grounding and explosion are highly related to human error 2 3 human error studies in the maritime domain and limitations 2 3 1 lack of considering input weights the evaluation of human error in the maritime domain has been regarded as an onerous mission due to the absence of empirical data a number of human error studies are proposed notwithstanding the existence of such a dilemma considering safety and pollution prevention a certain amount of literature conduct human error probability hep evaluations for the operations onboard oil tankers or liquefied petroleum gas lpg carriers some of such studies are under cognitive reliability error analysis method cream scheme while others are based on fuzzy success likelihood index method slim human error assessment and reduction technique heart and analytic hierarchy process ahp techniques akyuz 2015 2016 akyuz and celik 2014 2015 yang et al 2013 while the aforementioned studies have the capability of generating heps particularly in situations where the lack of data exists such models lack the consideration of input weights 2 3 2 lack of evaluating crucial ambient factors contributing to human errors human error analysis may be complicated and more factors may need to contemplate in order to appreciate the root causes of the slips lapses mistakes and violations it may seem logical to blame accidents on the lapses of individuals or a small group of ship crews however the latent conditions influencing crew behavior during navigation are often ignored these involve the number of simultaneous missions availability of procedures or plans availability of time crew collaboration quality adequacy of experience and training such conditions are sometimes deemed as hazards which could trigger accidents once in combination with unsafe acts hollnagel 1998 thus human error should be determined by the overall effects from such individual technological contextual and organizational factors onboard vessels while not quantitatively generating hep outcomes a study considers such factors to identify the common patterns of human error in ship groundings and collisions which enable the shipping industry to propose safety measures to intervene the development of such accidents macrae 2009 it is noted that some other ship collision models have been proposed to tackle human errors graziano et al 2016 uğurlu et al 2013 emond 2012 martins and maturana 2010 however none of such studies evaluates the quantitative effects on hep caused by such ambient elements 2 3 3 incapability of providing probabilistic outcomes and information loss in conversion processes common human reliability analysis methods include therp slim heart and cream islam et al 2018 noroozi et al 2014b musharraf et al 2013 among such methods cream is constructed based on expert judgement and may suffer from the influence of the uncertainties including vagueness randomness and ignorance nevertheless such an approach has the capability of contemplating the effects on heps resulting from the individual technological contextual and organizational factors a number of studies conduct human error and collision risk assessment using bn due to its feature of expressing dependence and independence relationships among variables montewka et al 2017 islam et al 2018 afenyo et al 2017 john et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 such a mechanism provides a framework for addressing many of the shortcomings in human reliability analysis involving uncertain knowledge due to randomness and ignorance groth and swiler 2013 however some bn based maritime studies generate outcomes either in the format of belief degrees with linguistic grades or in a form of utility levels rather than a probabilistic nature yang et al 2008 eleye datubo et al 2008 others incorporate the approximate reasoning approach into bns in which parameter observations are converted using the max min operation this however may lose useful information from expert judgement in addition a cream based bn utilizes a systematic expert elicitation process to assess heps and proposed safety measures for winter navigation operations valdez banda et al 2015 while the study illustrates the applicability of such a type of model for ship navigation the weight of each cpc is not taken into account 2 3 4 low degree of result discrimination an extend cream is developed to equip cognitive failure probability with crisp results rather than probability intervals he et al 2008 however the outcome distinguishability level may be low due to the ill definition of the adopted linguistic terms in addition it is very often that human error assessment in the maritime domain is conducted using the fuzzy number approach due to the lack of data ren et al 2009 a study conducts a risk assessment of oil tanker grounding using fta and evaluates hep based on fuzzy cream ung 2018a the research provides a systematic way to provide probabilistic outcomes taking into account the human error and machinery breakdown likelihoods by virtue of a new fuzzy rule mechanism using fuzzy bayesian reasoning under the cream structure the study has the feature of considering the relative importance and the effects of the ambient elements it also has the strength of providing heps without the loss of information from each rule during the aggregation process however the distinguishability level may be questioned particularly in situations where the input information of the scenarios is close to each other due to the application of the fuzzy number approach suppose a specific human element is under risk evaluation by two different levels of visibility using the fuzzy cream proposed by ung 2018a such two visibility distances are set to 3 5 and 6 5 nautical miles which could be mapped as 35 and 65 in fig 1 where the range of the universe of discourse is within 0 and 10 nautical miles and belong to the moderate category also suppose the rest of the 6 cpcs are described by moderate the fuzzy conclusions acquired for the two scenarios are identical namely tactical 0 5 and opportunistic 0 5 accordingly the heps of such two scenarios are the same i e 2 2387 10 3 it is the fuzzy number technique based on interval calculations that cause the heps of the two scenarios indistinguishable from each other this implies that cpc 5 would be described by moderate once the observation is within 25 75 according to fig 1 2 4 justification of the research ship collision is one of the most frequent marine accidents worldwide it is also true in taiwanese waters oil tanker accidents may be one of the ship types imposing most pollution risks at sea the most frequent oil tanker disaster is collision according to the imo gisis database literature reveals that the oil tanker accidents involving collision grounding and explosion are highly related to human error while traditional human error studies have the strength of providing outcomes for marine operations in situations where the lack of data exists such methods have the drawbacks discussed in sections 2 3 accordingly there is a need to conduct an oil tanker collision assessment based on a framework capable of providing probabilistic outcomes with better risk discriminations and resolving the shortcomings of the traditional studies 3 methodology the objective of this research is to establish an oil tanker collision study that provides heps with a higher degree of outcome distinguishability meanwhile reserves the features of considering the relative importance and the effects of the ambient elements without the loss of information during the rule aggregation process thus the methodology is constructed based on ung 2018a with a modified fuzzy cream for the combination of cpc observations allowing for achieving better risk discernment it starts with a fault tree structure of oil tanker collision the basic events involving machinery failures and human errors leading to oil tanker collision are identified the basic events associated with human error are analyzed based on the modified fuzzy cream mechanism in which the likelihood of each event is determined by the status of the associated cpcs a synthesis process takes place using a fuzzy rule base method in which cpcs and the combined consequent are expressed in a format of linguistic grades with corresponding belief degrees the fuzzy conclusion fuzzy marginal probability for each basic event and fuzzy posterior probability of each cpc are acquired by bn the defuzzification and transformation processes are initiated to equip the fuzzy outcome of each basic event with a probabilistic nature after incorporating the likelihoods of the machinery breakdown events obtained from traditional studies and databases into the fault tree the probability of the oil tanker collision can be determined finally crucial human error related events are identified using a sensitivity analysis by which the extent of human error contribution to oil tanker collision can be recognized 3 1 development of a fault tree for oil tanker collision the first step of the methodology is the development of a fault tree expressing the interaction and escalation of the events resulting in oil tanker collision based on accident databases casualty reports and expert judgement a group of experts familiar with oil tanker navigation in the taiwanese waters from the shipping industry and academia are invited to work as the consultants errors related to human performance and incapacitation as well as hardware functions can be modeled altogether li et al 2012 in general an effective fta depends upon in depth analysis of previous similar accidents thus the accident reports and traditional studies with regard to oil tanker collision play important roles in the construction of the fault tree 3 2 hep assessment using a modified cream a modified cream is proposed in this study to conduct the hep of each human error related basic event it is noted that the traditional cream calculates the number of the positive and negative cpcs to derive the relevant control mode and the failure rate interval rather than the performance variability according to prof erik hollnagel in addition the method focuses on the component of a system only namely human a structural point of view should be provided instead different from the basic cream the proposed approach provides precise failure rates which are subsequently adopted as inputs for the fault tree structure in which human errors and instrument failures are contemplated in a systematic manner 3 2 1 establishment of cpcs extensive human error studies have concluded that the importance of the peripheral conditions in which a mission is executed is greater than the characteristics of the mission itself marseguerra et al 2007 thus it is the individual contextual technological and organizational factors that matter the human performance onboard oil tankers yang et al 2013 thus this study conducts the hep assessment for each human related event using cream by which the causal relations between the observations of such ambient factors and the hep can be appreciated table 3 contains the description of the cpcs for this research it is noted that this study only considers 7 cpcs this is because working condition may overlap adequacy of man machine interface and operational support cpc 2 and degree of brightness and visibility cpc 5 meanwhile available time could result from number of simultaneous goals cpc 4 adequacy of training and experience cpc 6 and crew collaboration quality cpc 7 in the collision accidents according to a consultation with marine experts 3 2 2 fuzzy definition of the linguistic terms describing each cpc different from traditional bn studies in which the prior probabilities of the parameters are directly and deterministically judged by the experts this study utilizes fuzzy set theory to accomplish such a mission thus the vagueness uncertainty due to the ill defined concept in observations can be avoided the number of the linguistic terms adopted to evaluate the effects of the 7 cpcs on each human error related basic event is first judged it is noted that the determination of the quantity of such terms depends upon the extent of the information gathered in general the more information an analyst has the higher the number of linguistic terms is secondly the linguistic terms are defined using the discrete fuzzy set theory in the theory fuzzy sets utilized for input evaluation are specified using a set of categories expressing the degrees of such parameters hooda and raich 2015 klir and yuan 1995 smithson and verkuilen 2006 zimmermann 2006 suppose u 1 2 3 u 1 u denotes a category group in the universe of discourse that is applied to characterize a fuzzy set namely low which could be modeled as follows l o w 1 0 1 0 5 2 0 3 0 u 1 0 u the memberships for the categories in u belonging to low can then be described as follows μ l o w 1 0 0 5 0 0 0 it is noted that the number of categories is recommended to be no more than 7 considering the limits of human cogitative discrimination karwowski and mital 1986 wang et al 1995 table 4 is the fuzzy definition of the linguistic terms namely low moderate and high to be adopted for this study using 5 categories based on the experts consulted 3 2 3 mapping and transformation of fuzzy observations into subjective belief degrees the experts with substantial seagoing experience will provide professional opinions expressing the effects of the 7 cpcs on each basic event using the defined fuzzy sets a mapping process referring to the defined fuzzy sets as well as a transformation method subsequently take place for acquiring the belief degree for each fuzzy set the acquired observations for a specific cream factor cpc i can be mapped back to one or all of the specified fuzzy sets using the best fit approach schmucker 1984 ung 2018b wang et al 1995 the technique adopts the distance between cpc i and each of the defined fuzzy sets to express the degree to which the element belongs to each of the linguistic terms the distance between the fuzzy data of cpc i and a linguistic term j l j can be specified using equation 1 based on the best fit approach 1 d c p c i j c p c i l j j 1 u μ c p c i j μ l j j 2 1 2 in equation 1 each d c p c i j is a relative unscaled distance between the acquired observations for cpc i and each of the defined linguistic terms the closer cpc i is to the jth linguistic term the smaller d c p c i j is furthermore d c p c i j is equal to zero once cpc i is completely assessed to the jth linguistic term in terms of the membership functions cpc i will not be evaluated to the other fuzzy sets in any way suppose d c p c i j is the smallest distance among the fuzzy sets for cpc i also let α c p c i j denote the reciprocals of the relative distance between the acquired observations for cpc i and each of the defined fuzzy sets with reference to d c p c i j thus α c p c i j can be defined using equation 2 2 α c p c i j 1 d c p c i j d c p c i j in cases where d c p c i j 0 α c p c i j will be equal to 1 while the others have a value of zero the expert judgement acquired will subsequently be converted into the belief degree format using equation 3 wang et al 1995 yang et al 2008 3 β c p c i j α c p c i j j 1 n α c p c i j where β c p c i j is the normalized value of α c p c i j expressing the degree to which cpc i belongs to the jth fuzzy set and 4 j 1 j β c p c i j also if cpc i is completely assessed to the jth fuzzy set then β c p c i j is equal to 1 whereas values of the others are equal to 0 the value of β c p c i j can be viewed as a belief degree representing the degree to which cpc i belongs to the jth fuzzy set for the purpose of reducing the data subjectivity a group of specialists are invited to provide a comprehensive view for the human error related events suppose n experts are invited to give the expert judgment with regard to the status of cpc i the combined consensus from such specialists can be acquired using equation 5 given the weight of each expert is of equal 5 β c p c i j j j 1 j β c p c i j n where β c p c i j j denotes the combined degree to which cpc i belongs to the jth fuzzy set after aggregating the opinion from j experts stating that the cpc should be described by the jth fuzzy set j is adopted to express the number of the fuzzy sets of low l moderate m and high h and the summation of such three sets is equal to n and also 6 j l m h n β c p c i j j 1 in situations where the relative importance of each specialist is various the magnitude of weight for each expert is determined according to the years of the seagoing experience equation 7 is introduced to derive the degree of the relative importance for each expert 7 θ n δ n n 1 n δ n where θ n is the degree of the relative importance for expert n δ n denotes the years of the seagoing experience of the specialist and also 8 n 1 n θ n 1 accordingly the combined expert judgment from such specialists with regard to the status of cpc i can be acquired by rewriting the contents of equation 5 and is determined as follows 9 β c p c i j j n 1 n β c p c i j θ n 3 2 4 establishment of fuzzy rule base allowing for providing risk studies with better result discrimination the fuzzy rule base in this study is established using the approach developed by ung 2018a such a rule base approach has the advantage of contemplating the grades of fuzzy sets and the weights of cpcs in the antecedent when deriving the consequent for each rule in this study the importance values for the linguistic terms applied namely low moderate and high are arbitrarily set to 0 0 5 and1 0 respectively also suppose cpc 1 cpc 2 and cpc v are evaluated by u fuzzy sets the index for the acquirement of the appropriate evaluation grades in the contextual control mode cocom and the associated confidence degrees in the kth rule can be obtained using equation 10 10 s k 1 a u 1 c p c 1 w c p c 1 1 a u 2 c p c 2 w c p c 2 1 a u v c p c v w c p c v where s k is the score for the identification of the appropriate linguistic terms in the kth rule 1 a u1 cpc1 1 a u2 cpc2 and 1 a uv cpcv are the importance values for the fuzzy sets a u1 a u2 and a uv that describe cpc 1 cpc 2 and cpc v in the antecedent and w cpc1 w cpc2 and w cpcv are the weights for cpc 1 cpc 2 and cpc v conventional cream studies logarithmically describe the universe of discourse in which the fuzzy sets of strategic tactical opportunistic and scrambled are applied to define the human mal operation probability for specific events hollnagel 1998 thus a transformation process takes places to convert s k into the logarithmical value within the universe of discourse at which the membership functions of the fuzzy sets are located ung 2018a the probability intervals defined by traditional cream studies will be an important reference to this end the logarithmical values can subsequently be determined using equation 11 11 c l k s k r s 0 r l where c l k is the corresponding logarithmical values for the kth rule s k denotes the score in the universe of discourse of the linguistic terms describing the consequent portion in the kth rule r s is the range of the scores for the linguistic terms characterizing the consequent part and r l expresses the interval of the logarithmical values for the linguistic terms depicting the consequent portion suppose c l k is located at the position shown in fig 2 the appropriate fuzzy set and the associated degrees of confidence identified for the kth rule can be identified as opportunistic d k o scrambled d k s 3 2 5 acquirement of fuzzy conclusion and fuzzy posterior probabilities using bn this study adopts bn to obtain the fuzzy conclusion as well as the fuzzy posterior probabilities for each human error related basic event the belief degrees converted from each cpc observations are considered as the prior probabilities whereas the confidence degree of each fuzzy set in the consequent are adopted as the conditional probabilities ung 2018a suppose a specific human error basic event is influenced by v cpcs each of which is evaluated by u fuzzy sets the fuzzy conclusion for linguistic term l depicting the cocom can be obtained using equation 12 it is noted every piece of the information from each cpc and the conditional probabilities from each rule are meticulously contemplated 12 p y y l c p c 1 c p c 2 c p c v p c p c 1 c p c 2 c p c v y y l u z p d u v l q v 1 v p q u v where q c p c u 1 c p c u 2 c p c u v u u 1 u 2 u v z u u 1 1 2 u 1 u 2 1 2 u 2 u v 1 2 u v p y y l is the degree fuzzy marginal probability of the lth linguistic term in the fuzzy conclusion y for a specific basic event related to human error and l strategic tactical opportunistic and scrambled p d u v l q denotes the degree of confidence fuzzy conditional probability of the lth linguistic term describing the consequent of each rule given c p c u 1 c p c u 2 c p c u v and p q uv denotes the fuzzy prior probability of cpc v described by the uth linguistic term based on the consensus from the experts using equation 5 or 9 p y y l is the synthesized risk outcomes i e the fuzzy marginal probability of the lth linguistic term in the fuzzy conclusion y for a human error related basic event further investigations can be carried out to evaluate the degree of a particular linguistic term contained in a cpc contributing to the fuzzy conclusion provided that such a fuzzy conclusion is assessed to a specific linguistic term by virtue of equation 13 based on the bn mechanism such influence can be appreciated accordingly the cpcs giving rise to significant effects to the fuzzy conclusion are identified 13 p q u v u y y l p q u v u p y y l q u v u p y y l where p q u v u j y y l is the fuzzy posterior probability of the uth linguistic term of cpc v given the information that the fuzzy conclusion is assessed to the lth linguistic term p q u v u is the fuzzy prior probability of cpc v with regard to the uth linguistic term p y y l q u v u denotes the fuzzy conditional probability of the lth linguistic term of the fuzzy conclusion given the information that cpc v belongs to the uth linguistic term and p y y l expresses the fuzzy marginal probability of the lth linguistic term in the fuzzy conclusion 3 2 6 acquirement of hep the fuzzy conclusion acquired is in a format of fuzzy probability further analysis is required to appreciate its quantitative yet probabilistic results this is achieved by conducting the processes of defuzzification and transformation the former has the capability of translating the fuzzy conclusion into its crisp meaning and the latter has the feature of equipping the crisp outcome with a probabilistic nature allowing for the precision the center of area coa approach is adopted to defuzzfy the fuzzy conclusion while a number of algorithms are available and applied rao and saraf 1996 roychowdhury and pedrycz 2001 runkler 1996 runkler and glesner 1993 van leekwijck and kerre 1999 patel and mohan 2002 ung and shen 2011 ung 2018a the method determines the center of the area of the synthesized membership functions using equation 14 14 c y y μ y l x x d x y μ y l x d x where c y is the crisp value of the fuzzy conclusion y for the human error related basic event and μ yl x denotes the membership functions of the linguistic term l applied by the fuzzy conclusion y the value of c y has a logarithmic nature and is needed to transform into probabilistic results using equation 15 15 p y 1 10 c y where p y denotes the hep of a basic event under consideration 3 3 calculation of oil tanker collision probability and analysis of human error contribution to oil tanker collision the heps obtained using the aforementioned steps will be incorporated into the fault tree of oil tanker collision the occurrence rates of the others including machinery failures on the other hand will be obtained based on the traditional oil tanker collision studies as well as the statistics from imo gisis after deriving the minimal cut sets i e the smallest combination of all basic events using boolean algebra the probability of the oil tanker collision can be determined based on equations 16 and 17 celik et al 2010 finally crucial human error related basic events are identified using sensitivity analysis and the results will provide the insights into the extents to which human errors contribute to oil tanker collisions by virtue of sensitivity analysis the effect on the overall collision probability resulting from minor alternations of each human error related basic event can be appreciated the factors significantly drive the outcomes upwards or downwards are the human elements playing crucial role in the occurrence of oil tanker collision 16 p c i 1 n p b i 17 p c 1 i 1 n 1 p b i where p c is the probability of the oil tanker collision and b i denotes the probability of the basic event i 4 model validation and application 4 1 modified cream validation for the purpose of illustrating that the risk outcome discrimination of the modified cream proposed is better than that of ung 2018a this study introduces two different scenarios shown in table 5 based on the skeletons described in section 2 3 4 accordingly the visibility distances for scenarios 1 and 2 are set to 3 5 and 6 5 nautical miles also suppose the rest of the 6 cpcs are precisely described by moderate the visibility statuses of the two scenarios are mapped as 0 1 0 7 2 1 0 3 0 3 4 0 5 and 0 1 0 3 2 1 0 3 0 7 4 0 5 referring to the fuzzy definition in table 4 where the visibility boundary is set to 10 nautical miles apart from cpc 5 the rest of the cpcs have the identical evaluation grades according to common human perception the hep of scenario 1 will be slightly higher than that of scenario 2 notwithstanding the fuzzy data of such two cases are close to each other according to the methodology the belief degrees for scenarios 1 and 2 are obtained using equations 1 3 as shown in table 6 only cpc 5 is described by three linguistic terms low moderate and high with the belief degrees meanwhile the others have one moderate in both cases thus the number of the fuzzy rule combination is 3 and the fuzzy sets obtained as well as the confidence degrees associated in the consequent for the scenarios are identical table 7 contains the details of the combination and the derived consequent using the pattern aforementioned in section 3 2 4 table 8 lists the fuzzy conclusions and heps for the two scenarios using equations 12 14 and 15 by virtue of the hep comparison the outcomes generated by the modified framework are consistent with the common human perception although the fuzzy data of the two cases are close to each other the modified cream is still capable of discriminating the magnitude differences between the scenarios accordingly the proposed cream has a higher degree of distinguishability than the one developed by ung 2018a it is such a modified cream that is applied to the oil tank collision study a step by step application is provided in section 4 2 and it is believed that the risk outcomes produced will be more reasonable than traditional studies 4 2 oil tanker collision study in this study a total of 39 experts including 21 captains and 18 chief officers from the shipping industry and academia are invited to work as the consultants offering the professional opinions 28 out of these captains and officers have the working experience onboard oil tankers all the experts are familiar with the geographical and meteorological characteristics of the taiwanese waters the average years of seagoing experience of such specialists are 21 and 10 respectively the case study selected is taiwanese strait the traffic density of the western taiwanese coast is higher than that of the eastern one in particular the hsinchu penghu and kaohsiung waters are the sea areas with the highest frequencies of marine accidents sung 2012 such specialists provide expert judgement with regard to collision risks for oil tankers navigating in vicinity of the aforementioned taiwanese waters the 39 specialists are invited to evaluate a scenario in which the human error related basic events leading to a collision of a suezmax oil tanker passing through the hsinchu penghu and kaohsiung waters are considered in terms of investigating the prevailing circumstance of each cpc the scenario is set in wintertime during which rough seas and strong wind are likely to encounter the expert judgment from the captains and chief officers mainly reflects the current status of such ambient factors that influence the crew performance in the bridge and the safety culture of the taiwanese shipping companies 4 2 1 fta of oil tanker collision based on accident databases casualty reports and expert judgement the fta in fig 3 shows the sequences of the collision of a suezmax oil tanker based on the imo gisis database previous accident reports the experts and traditional studies for oil tankers martins and maturana 2010 uğurlu et al 2013 for the purpose of evaluating human error contributions to oil tanker collision only basic events be of 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 and 18 are further analyzed the data of the rest i e the events of 1 13 14 15 16 and 17 are obtained based on the gisis database accident reports and traditional studies for oil tankers 4 2 2 human error assessment using a modified cream based on fbn 4 2 2 1 acquirement of fuzzy data from the experts based on the fuzzy sets defined each human error related basic event is evaluated using the 7 cpcs based on the fuzzy sets defined in table 4 in other words bes 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 and 18 are analyzed using low moderate and high the experts are asked to give the professional opinions with regard to the status of each cpc for each be per passage of taiwan strait particularly the hsinchu penghu and kaohsiung waters table 9 provides the fuzzy data of be 2 containing the frequency of each linguistic term for each cpc based on the expert judgement from the 39 experienced specialists allowing for the length of paper the professional opinions for bes 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 and 18 are not given however are available from the author 4 2 2 2 combination of fuzzy data for each cpc given the statement from the majority of the experts that the relative importance of each specialist should be equal the fuzzy data of each cpc acquired from such professionals for each human error related basic event is synthesized to obtain the consensus using equations 1 3 and 5 accordingly table 10 contains the belief degrees of each cpc for be 2 the outcomes of the other basic events are not given in this study however are available from the author 4 2 2 3 fuzzy rule base this research evaluates the cpcs using the linguistic terms of low moderate and high 7 inputs are under consideration in this study 2187 rules are accordingly developed provided that the weight of each cpc is of equal table 11 is the rule examples with the associated degrees of confidence constructed based on section 3 2 4 it can be seen from the table that slight positive negative changes in the event observations described by low moderate and high in the antecedent will result in the incremental decreasing consequent compared with traditional rule base approaches the logicality of the mechanism proposed in this study is reinforced accordingly the model proposed in this study is capable of producing outcomes in a sensible way 4 2 2 4 acquisition of fuzzy conclusion and fuzzy posterior probabilities using bn the bn constructed for this study consists of 7 parent nodes cpcs and 1 child node fuzzy conclusion as shown in fig 4 according to the experts cocom i e the fuzzy conclusion is influenced by all the 7 cpcs and further cpcs 2 and 3 as well as cpcs 1 and cpc 6 also cause impacts to cpcs 4 and 7 respectively it is noted that cpc 4 is affected by cpcs 2 and 3 due to fact that the higher user friendliness level of control panel of navigation instruments and more complete ism procedures and plans will ease the navigational burden of ship crew thus less distraction enables oow to become more focused on traffic since the number of tasks for navigation has been reduced in addition more thorough safety policies and practices shore based support from the company cpc 1 and sufficient crew training and experience cpc 6 imply a higher level of crew collaboration quality cpc 7 this is because integrated safety policies bring detailed safety practices that entitle oow to gain background knowledge and sufficient support such as additional deck crew recruitment onboard ships reduces the level of fatigue furthermore crew experience and skill trainings such as bridge resource management brm enhance the communication teamwork decision making and situation awareness in the bridge table 12 contains the examples of 2187 rules with the prior and conditional probabilities of each cpc and the corresponding consequent for the oil tanker collision study the fuzzy conclusion is obtained based on equation 12 contemplating all the information from rules 1 to 2187 fig 5 shows the outcome obtained using hugin lite 8 5 that is expressed in the format of fuzzy marginal probabilities for the child node i e the cocom for the oil tanker collision in the bn the fuzzy conclusions of the other human error related basic events are acquired using the aforementioned pattern and table 13 contains the outcomes of all the events the fuzzy marginal probabilities of each basic event can be further investigated to appreciate the relationship between each cpc and the occurrence probability of the event for the purpose of identifying the crucial cpcs contributing to the highest event outcome the fuzzy posterior probability is only applied to consider the worst linguistic term i e scrambled fig 6 shows the posterior probability of the fuzzy set for be 2 based on equation 13 using hugin lite 8 5 given the information that the fuzzy conclusion is completely assessed to scrambled the important factors contributing to be 2 include cpcs 4 2 5 and 1 of which the belief degrees of low are greater than 50 this is followed by cpcs 3 6 and 7 respectively table 14 lists the top 4 crucial elements resulting in the highest occurrence likelihoods of each be according to the table the most significant factor playing important roles in the rise of all human error bes is number of simultaneous goals cpc 4 with the frequency of 12 this is followed by adequacy of organization cpc 1 adequacy of mmi and os cpc 2 and availability of p p cpc 3 of which the numbers of the appearance in the table are 11 9 and 9 respectively 4 2 2 5 defuzzification and transformation of fuzzy conclusions into probabilistic outcomes the fuzzy marginal probabilities of each human error related basic event i e the fuzzy conclusions are transformed into the probabilistic outcomes using equation 14 given the fuzzy marginal probabilities acquired in table 13 the graphical presentation of the fuzzy conclusion for be 2 is established as shown in fig 7 the fuzzy conclusions of be 2 and the other cream related basic events are subsequently defuzzified and transformed into heps as shown in table 15 using equations 14 and 15 it can be seen from the table that the higher degrees of opportunistic and scrambled a basic event has the greater hep it deserves compared with the others be 4 has the highest hep since the event has the greatest magnitudes of opportunistic and scrambled such a phenomenon can be traced back to the original observations shown in table 16 where be 4 has the second least highs 98 the fifth and third largest numbers of low 63 and moderate 112 among the 12 bes according to the 39 experts be 6 on the other hand has the lowest hep due to the fact that the event is only evaluated using the minimal number of low 42 meanwhile the second most quantity of high 126 4 2 3 oil tanker collision probability the probabilities of the human error related basic events have been obtained based on the modified fbn based cream model the likelihoods of the others including bes 1 13 14 15 16 and 17 are collected from imo gisis and traditional oil tanker collision studies uğurlu et al 2013 gaonkar et al 2011 martins and maturana 2010 consequently the oil tanker collision probability can be determined using equations 16 and 17 the outcome of the case study is 5 2 10 3 per passage of taiwan strait particularly the hsinchu penghu and kaohsiung waters fig 8 presents the pathway and likelihoods of all the events 4 2 4 analysis of human error contribution to oil tanker collision this study carries out a sensitivity analysis to recognize the crucial human error related basic events contributing to oil tanker collision according to fig 9 the collision probabilities are sensitive to minor variations of bes 2 lack of brm com 3 lack of com bet ships 4 fatigue 5 colreg violations and 18 interpretation failures a further scrutiny is also conducted to appreciate the extent to which the variations of bes 6 oow handling failures 7 master verification failures 8 master failures 9 procedure violations 10 faulty procedures 11 improper lookout and 12 misuse of navigation instruments affect the collision probability in fig 10 the top event probability is relatively sensitive to minor alternations of bes 9 10 11 and 12 than that of bes 8 6 and 7 5 discussion the basic events of lack of brm com fatigue lack of com bet ships and colreg violations are ranked at nos 3 1 5 and 6 positions in the hep priority list and also give rise to substantial contributions to oil tanker collision brm includes the communication teamwork decision making and situation awareness of all personnel in the bridge including the pilot captain oow and helmsman its importance in ship navigation in particular with a pilot onboard is also recognized chauvin et al 2013 lack of brm com is concerned with the absence of close loop communication involving the opinion exchanges of salient features regarding to the current situation and discussions of the roles between the bridge members such a failure could lead to the loss of the opportunities for mutual performance monitoring and supportive behavior from the bridge members heavy workload is a major cause of fatigue recently it has been suggested that such an element directly links to the occurrence of most shipping accidents uğurlu et al 2015 the statement that lack of com bet ships and colreg violations are crucial factors for oil tanker collision is consistent with the outcomes generated by uğurlu et al 2013 lack of com bet ships may originate from insufficient english heavy workload and the disturbance by simultaneous tasks according to the imo gisis database the most frequent colreg violations of oil tankers include rule 5 look out rule 7 risk of collision rule 6 safe speed rule 34 manoeuvring and warning signals rule 8 action to avoid collision rule 14 head on situation rule 19 conduct of vessels in restricted visibility and rule 35 sound signals in restricted visibility the counter measures aimed at diminishing the occurrence of lack of brm com fatigue lack of com bet ships and colreg violations should be proposed possible risk control options may include periodical brm trainings and communications the disposition of supplemental crew and regular bridge navigation exercises using simulators such safety measures should focus on internal and external information exchange appropriate use of maritime english and colreg while be of interpretation failures of navigational instruments has the third lowest likelihood among the 12 events attentions should also be paid to ensure that the probability of such an event constantly stays in a low yet acceptable level due to its potential contributing to the accident regular training courses regarding state of the art apparatus for navigation are suggested to propose likewise risk control options shall be planed for bes of procedure violations and faulty procedures since the probabilistic outcomes of such two events are ranked at higher positions and would cause a certain level of influence to collision once the likelihoods deteriorated shipping companies are suggested to establish effective response schemes with regard to non conformities and deficient procedures designated persons dps shall review such procedure violations and speculate likely yet negative outcomes which are subsequently disseminated to ship crew to emphasize the importance of established safety practices faulty procedures should also be examined and redevised to ensure that such modified procedures are specifically appropriate for each of oil tankers further work for the findings of this study may be the application of formal safety assessment fsa introduced by imo to adopt the steps of risk control options cost benefit assessment and decision making accordingly cost effective safety measures could be proposed taking into account the financial feasibility of each shipping company 6 conclusion marine accidents come about mainly due to human errors the appraisal of human error contribution to ship casualties is burdensome due to the scarce or incompleteness of data the contexts where ship crews perform duties are often influenced by the individual technological contextual and organizational factors it is such elements that determine the human performance in ship operations and human error should be treated as a combined outcome of such factors onboard vessels accordingly this research evaluates the collision probability of oil tanker based on an fta structure under which a modified fuzzy cream model is developed to conduct human error assessment different from traditional studies the proposed methodology provides a higher degree of result distinguishability meanwhile contemplating the weights and quantitative effects caused by the ambient elements without the loss of information from experts on the other hand this study constructs an fta presenting a vivid picture of the oil tanker collision sequences and collects the expert judgement from the 39 specialists with substantial seagoing experience the bes of lack of brm com lack of com bet ships fatigue and colreg violations have higher positions in the hep priority list and also give rise to substantial contributions to oil tanker collision according to the analysis such elements have the potential of causing perception failures and trigger the unwanted accident in addition the probabilistic outcomes of procedure violations and faulty procedures are also ranked higher and would cause a certain level of influence to collision once the likelihoods deteriorated possible risk control options may include periodical brm trainings and communications the disposition of supplemental crew and regular bridge navigation exercises using simulators given the information that the fuzzy conclusions of such cream related bes are completely assessed to the worse scenario scrambled the significant factors contributing to the rise of the heps is number of simultaneous goals adequacy of mmi and os adequacy of organization the availability of p p as well as degree of brightness and visibility likely counter measures may involve the deployment of additional personnel for bridge lookouts the enhancement of shore base support levels for ships renew or procurement of more user friendly navigation instruments and review of the ism related procedures and plans one of the limitations in this study is that experts possess great portions in subjective modeling approaches like the one proposed in this study while the proposed methodology has the strength of providing logical and sensible results without the distortion of professional judgement from experts its beauty would be jeopardized without the participation of qualified experts in addition the fta established makes use of the information from accident databases casualty reports and expert judgement when risk assessment is undertaken to evaluate cases in which the lack of data exists and complex interdependence between factors with multiple states are necessary to consider the application of the proposed fta may be unrealistic nevertheless given sufficient accident reports and appropriate expert judgment the oil tanker collision study proposed based on fta in combination with the modified cream method is able to generate reasonable probabilistic outcomes and provide useful references for enhancing oil tanker safety acknowledgement the author would like to express the gratitude to national taiwan ocean university for supporting the academic resources needed for this research 
22874,human error is a significant factor triggering oil tanker collisions drawbacks jeopardizing the effectiveness of human error analysis from traditional studies are spotted this study proposes a risk assessment of human error contribution to oil tanker collision the research evaluates the collision probability of oil tanker using a fault tree analysis fta structure under which a modified fuzzy bayesian network based cognitive reliability error analysis method cream is developed to conduct human error assessment 39 specialists with substantial seagoing experience are invited to provide expert judgement for oil tanker navigation particularly in vicinity of the taiwanese waters different from traditional studies the proposed methodology provides a higher degree of result distinguishability meanwhile contemplating the weights and quantitative effects caused by the ambient elements without the loss of information from the experts it is concluded that lack of bridge resource management communication lack of communication between ships fatigue and collision regulation violations are the elements with higher occurrence rates and would also have great potential contributing to oil tanker collision once the likelihoods deteriorated in addition number of simultaneous goals in the bridge is the common performance condition cpc that significantly causes the occurrence of all the human error basic events keywords maritime risk assessment human error ship collision fault tree analysis cognitive reliability error analysis method fuzzy bayesian network 1 introduction over decades both international and national maritime authorities have devoted immense efforts to enhance ship safety however a large number of shipping accidents still take place worldwide according to the marine accident statistics from transportation safety board tsb of canada the most frequent type of shipping accidents from 2007 to 2016 is collision with the occurrence rate of 30 20 in 2649 casualties it is also true in taiwan where 34 98 of the shipping disasters taking place in the waters from 2010 to 2016 and 40 31 of the taiwanese merchant vessel tragedies during the period between 1992 and 2016 attribute to collision according to ministry of transportation and communications motc oil tankers could be the largest vessel type contributing to oil spill volume oil tanker collision has the highest occurrence percentage among all oil tanker accidents based on the international maritime organization imo global integrated shipping information system gisis database uğurlu et al 2013 according to statistics 75 96 of marine casualties are attributable to human errors pennie et al 2007 uğurlu et al 2015 while enormous endeavors are devoted to deal with such an issue the occurrence of human error in marine accidents still remains at an undesired level gaonkar et al 2011 noroozi et al 2014a such a statement still holds when investigating the causes of oil tanker collisions uğurlu et al 2013 a number of studies conduct human error assessment for maritime operations as well as oil tanker collisions however the drawbacks of such studies include the use of the human error database from nuclear power plants incapability of contemplating the relative importance of inputs lack of the ability to provide probabilistic outcomes loss of useful information from expert judgement low distinguishability degree of risk results and shortage of considering important factors in the ambiance affecting human performance such shortcomings may jeopardize the effectiveness of human error analysis and the outcomes may be questioned the objective of this study is to establish a methodology of human error assessment that is capable of resolving the aforementioned dilemmas and subsequently applied to assess ship collision risks for oil tankers navigating in taiwanese waters a group of experts familiar with oil tanker navigation in the taiwanese waters from the shipping industry and academia are invited to work as the consultants with the assistance from such experts the references from the marine accident databases including imo gisis canadian tsb and r o c motc as well as previous literature the study constructs a logical safety structure based on fault tree analysis fta addressing the relationships between events triggering ship collisions the human error related basic events are further analyzed taking into account the individual technological contextual and organizational factors that determine the human performance in ship operations owing to the data scarceness of such ambient factors the experts provide professional judgement to bridge the gap by virtue of a hybrid model incorporating fuzzy and bayesian network bn the likelihoods for each human error related basic event are acquired such a human error prediction model will have the capability to provide probabilistic outcomes with better risk discrimination meanwhile considers every piece of useful information from experts as well as the relative importance of each ambient factor with the aid from marine accident databases and previous studies the likelihoods of hardware related basic events are obtained the overall probability of oil tanker collision in taiwanese waters can consequently be determined finally crucial elements basic events leading to the accident are identified by virtue of a sensitivity analysis it is believed that the research outcomes generated from this study will be the useful information for the shipping industry academia and related government agencies in the aspect of enhancing oil tanker safety 2 literature review 2 1 marine accidents ship collision is one of the most frequent marine accidents worldwide a marine casualty analysis for ship disasters in turkish territorial waters between 2005 and 2015 indicates that collision is the most common accident type bolat 2016 it is also true in taiwan according to the statistics collected by motc with regard to the shipping accidents of the taiwanese merchant vessels from 1992 to 2016 as shown in table 1 40 31 of the tragedies attribute to collision likewise it can be seen from table 2 that such an accident type accounts for 34 98 of the merchant ship casualties taking place in the taiwanese waters during the period between 2010 and 2016 both tables 1 and 2 indicate that ship collision is the main cause of the merchant shipping accidents in taiwan 2 2 oil tanker accidents and human error ship collisions and groundings are the accident types that can lead to serious consequences particularly in relation to marine environmental pollution according to the main findings of a navigation risk analysis valdez banda et al 2016 furthermore oil tanker groundings and collisions are the main causes of the oil spill disasters over 700 tones occurring from the years of 1970 2017 and account for 29 and 32 of all the accidents itopf 2018 allowing for the catastrophic impacts potentially caused by oil spill a number of risk studies have been conducted to provide the insights regarding the possible occurrence of given spill sizes resulting from tanker collisions goerlandt and montewka 2015 montewka 2009 while the percentage of groundings has been declining there has been a steady increase in the collision proportion over the decades and such a figure reaches over 40 since the 2000s itopf 2018 in this sense oil tanker collisions may be one of the ship types imposing most pollution risks at sea nowadays although counter measures have been taken at an international level to enhance ship safety tanker accidents still remain a constant threat typical oil tanker accidents include collision grounding fire and sinking the most frequent tragedy type of oil tanker is collision according to the marine statistics compiled by the imo gisis database uğurlu et al 2013 a study investigates the marine accidents resulting in oil pollution and economic loss caused by the aframax tankers over 80 000 dwt during the period between 1978 and 2003 papanikolaou et al 2007 a total of 792 tanker accidents are analyzed collision is also the most frequent accident type and accounts for 29 of all the casualties furthermore the research reveals that the accidents involving collision grounding and explosion are highly related to human error 2 3 human error studies in the maritime domain and limitations 2 3 1 lack of considering input weights the evaluation of human error in the maritime domain has been regarded as an onerous mission due to the absence of empirical data a number of human error studies are proposed notwithstanding the existence of such a dilemma considering safety and pollution prevention a certain amount of literature conduct human error probability hep evaluations for the operations onboard oil tankers or liquefied petroleum gas lpg carriers some of such studies are under cognitive reliability error analysis method cream scheme while others are based on fuzzy success likelihood index method slim human error assessment and reduction technique heart and analytic hierarchy process ahp techniques akyuz 2015 2016 akyuz and celik 2014 2015 yang et al 2013 while the aforementioned studies have the capability of generating heps particularly in situations where the lack of data exists such models lack the consideration of input weights 2 3 2 lack of evaluating crucial ambient factors contributing to human errors human error analysis may be complicated and more factors may need to contemplate in order to appreciate the root causes of the slips lapses mistakes and violations it may seem logical to blame accidents on the lapses of individuals or a small group of ship crews however the latent conditions influencing crew behavior during navigation are often ignored these involve the number of simultaneous missions availability of procedures or plans availability of time crew collaboration quality adequacy of experience and training such conditions are sometimes deemed as hazards which could trigger accidents once in combination with unsafe acts hollnagel 1998 thus human error should be determined by the overall effects from such individual technological contextual and organizational factors onboard vessels while not quantitatively generating hep outcomes a study considers such factors to identify the common patterns of human error in ship groundings and collisions which enable the shipping industry to propose safety measures to intervene the development of such accidents macrae 2009 it is noted that some other ship collision models have been proposed to tackle human errors graziano et al 2016 uğurlu et al 2013 emond 2012 martins and maturana 2010 however none of such studies evaluates the quantitative effects on hep caused by such ambient elements 2 3 3 incapability of providing probabilistic outcomes and information loss in conversion processes common human reliability analysis methods include therp slim heart and cream islam et al 2018 noroozi et al 2014b musharraf et al 2013 among such methods cream is constructed based on expert judgement and may suffer from the influence of the uncertainties including vagueness randomness and ignorance nevertheless such an approach has the capability of contemplating the effects on heps resulting from the individual technological contextual and organizational factors a number of studies conduct human error and collision risk assessment using bn due to its feature of expressing dependence and independence relationships among variables montewka et al 2017 islam et al 2018 afenyo et al 2017 john et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 such a mechanism provides a framework for addressing many of the shortcomings in human reliability analysis involving uncertain knowledge due to randomness and ignorance groth and swiler 2013 however some bn based maritime studies generate outcomes either in the format of belief degrees with linguistic grades or in a form of utility levels rather than a probabilistic nature yang et al 2008 eleye datubo et al 2008 others incorporate the approximate reasoning approach into bns in which parameter observations are converted using the max min operation this however may lose useful information from expert judgement in addition a cream based bn utilizes a systematic expert elicitation process to assess heps and proposed safety measures for winter navigation operations valdez banda et al 2015 while the study illustrates the applicability of such a type of model for ship navigation the weight of each cpc is not taken into account 2 3 4 low degree of result discrimination an extend cream is developed to equip cognitive failure probability with crisp results rather than probability intervals he et al 2008 however the outcome distinguishability level may be low due to the ill definition of the adopted linguistic terms in addition it is very often that human error assessment in the maritime domain is conducted using the fuzzy number approach due to the lack of data ren et al 2009 a study conducts a risk assessment of oil tanker grounding using fta and evaluates hep based on fuzzy cream ung 2018a the research provides a systematic way to provide probabilistic outcomes taking into account the human error and machinery breakdown likelihoods by virtue of a new fuzzy rule mechanism using fuzzy bayesian reasoning under the cream structure the study has the feature of considering the relative importance and the effects of the ambient elements it also has the strength of providing heps without the loss of information from each rule during the aggregation process however the distinguishability level may be questioned particularly in situations where the input information of the scenarios is close to each other due to the application of the fuzzy number approach suppose a specific human element is under risk evaluation by two different levels of visibility using the fuzzy cream proposed by ung 2018a such two visibility distances are set to 3 5 and 6 5 nautical miles which could be mapped as 35 and 65 in fig 1 where the range of the universe of discourse is within 0 and 10 nautical miles and belong to the moderate category also suppose the rest of the 6 cpcs are described by moderate the fuzzy conclusions acquired for the two scenarios are identical namely tactical 0 5 and opportunistic 0 5 accordingly the heps of such two scenarios are the same i e 2 2387 10 3 it is the fuzzy number technique based on interval calculations that cause the heps of the two scenarios indistinguishable from each other this implies that cpc 5 would be described by moderate once the observation is within 25 75 according to fig 1 2 4 justification of the research ship collision is one of the most frequent marine accidents worldwide it is also true in taiwanese waters oil tanker accidents may be one of the ship types imposing most pollution risks at sea the most frequent oil tanker disaster is collision according to the imo gisis database literature reveals that the oil tanker accidents involving collision grounding and explosion are highly related to human error while traditional human error studies have the strength of providing outcomes for marine operations in situations where the lack of data exists such methods have the drawbacks discussed in sections 2 3 accordingly there is a need to conduct an oil tanker collision assessment based on a framework capable of providing probabilistic outcomes with better risk discriminations and resolving the shortcomings of the traditional studies 3 methodology the objective of this research is to establish an oil tanker collision study that provides heps with a higher degree of outcome distinguishability meanwhile reserves the features of considering the relative importance and the effects of the ambient elements without the loss of information during the rule aggregation process thus the methodology is constructed based on ung 2018a with a modified fuzzy cream for the combination of cpc observations allowing for achieving better risk discernment it starts with a fault tree structure of oil tanker collision the basic events involving machinery failures and human errors leading to oil tanker collision are identified the basic events associated with human error are analyzed based on the modified fuzzy cream mechanism in which the likelihood of each event is determined by the status of the associated cpcs a synthesis process takes place using a fuzzy rule base method in which cpcs and the combined consequent are expressed in a format of linguistic grades with corresponding belief degrees the fuzzy conclusion fuzzy marginal probability for each basic event and fuzzy posterior probability of each cpc are acquired by bn the defuzzification and transformation processes are initiated to equip the fuzzy outcome of each basic event with a probabilistic nature after incorporating the likelihoods of the machinery breakdown events obtained from traditional studies and databases into the fault tree the probability of the oil tanker collision can be determined finally crucial human error related events are identified using a sensitivity analysis by which the extent of human error contribution to oil tanker collision can be recognized 3 1 development of a fault tree for oil tanker collision the first step of the methodology is the development of a fault tree expressing the interaction and escalation of the events resulting in oil tanker collision based on accident databases casualty reports and expert judgement a group of experts familiar with oil tanker navigation in the taiwanese waters from the shipping industry and academia are invited to work as the consultants errors related to human performance and incapacitation as well as hardware functions can be modeled altogether li et al 2012 in general an effective fta depends upon in depth analysis of previous similar accidents thus the accident reports and traditional studies with regard to oil tanker collision play important roles in the construction of the fault tree 3 2 hep assessment using a modified cream a modified cream is proposed in this study to conduct the hep of each human error related basic event it is noted that the traditional cream calculates the number of the positive and negative cpcs to derive the relevant control mode and the failure rate interval rather than the performance variability according to prof erik hollnagel in addition the method focuses on the component of a system only namely human a structural point of view should be provided instead different from the basic cream the proposed approach provides precise failure rates which are subsequently adopted as inputs for the fault tree structure in which human errors and instrument failures are contemplated in a systematic manner 3 2 1 establishment of cpcs extensive human error studies have concluded that the importance of the peripheral conditions in which a mission is executed is greater than the characteristics of the mission itself marseguerra et al 2007 thus it is the individual contextual technological and organizational factors that matter the human performance onboard oil tankers yang et al 2013 thus this study conducts the hep assessment for each human related event using cream by which the causal relations between the observations of such ambient factors and the hep can be appreciated table 3 contains the description of the cpcs for this research it is noted that this study only considers 7 cpcs this is because working condition may overlap adequacy of man machine interface and operational support cpc 2 and degree of brightness and visibility cpc 5 meanwhile available time could result from number of simultaneous goals cpc 4 adequacy of training and experience cpc 6 and crew collaboration quality cpc 7 in the collision accidents according to a consultation with marine experts 3 2 2 fuzzy definition of the linguistic terms describing each cpc different from traditional bn studies in which the prior probabilities of the parameters are directly and deterministically judged by the experts this study utilizes fuzzy set theory to accomplish such a mission thus the vagueness uncertainty due to the ill defined concept in observations can be avoided the number of the linguistic terms adopted to evaluate the effects of the 7 cpcs on each human error related basic event is first judged it is noted that the determination of the quantity of such terms depends upon the extent of the information gathered in general the more information an analyst has the higher the number of linguistic terms is secondly the linguistic terms are defined using the discrete fuzzy set theory in the theory fuzzy sets utilized for input evaluation are specified using a set of categories expressing the degrees of such parameters hooda and raich 2015 klir and yuan 1995 smithson and verkuilen 2006 zimmermann 2006 suppose u 1 2 3 u 1 u denotes a category group in the universe of discourse that is applied to characterize a fuzzy set namely low which could be modeled as follows l o w 1 0 1 0 5 2 0 3 0 u 1 0 u the memberships for the categories in u belonging to low can then be described as follows μ l o w 1 0 0 5 0 0 0 it is noted that the number of categories is recommended to be no more than 7 considering the limits of human cogitative discrimination karwowski and mital 1986 wang et al 1995 table 4 is the fuzzy definition of the linguistic terms namely low moderate and high to be adopted for this study using 5 categories based on the experts consulted 3 2 3 mapping and transformation of fuzzy observations into subjective belief degrees the experts with substantial seagoing experience will provide professional opinions expressing the effects of the 7 cpcs on each basic event using the defined fuzzy sets a mapping process referring to the defined fuzzy sets as well as a transformation method subsequently take place for acquiring the belief degree for each fuzzy set the acquired observations for a specific cream factor cpc i can be mapped back to one or all of the specified fuzzy sets using the best fit approach schmucker 1984 ung 2018b wang et al 1995 the technique adopts the distance between cpc i and each of the defined fuzzy sets to express the degree to which the element belongs to each of the linguistic terms the distance between the fuzzy data of cpc i and a linguistic term j l j can be specified using equation 1 based on the best fit approach 1 d c p c i j c p c i l j j 1 u μ c p c i j μ l j j 2 1 2 in equation 1 each d c p c i j is a relative unscaled distance between the acquired observations for cpc i and each of the defined linguistic terms the closer cpc i is to the jth linguistic term the smaller d c p c i j is furthermore d c p c i j is equal to zero once cpc i is completely assessed to the jth linguistic term in terms of the membership functions cpc i will not be evaluated to the other fuzzy sets in any way suppose d c p c i j is the smallest distance among the fuzzy sets for cpc i also let α c p c i j denote the reciprocals of the relative distance between the acquired observations for cpc i and each of the defined fuzzy sets with reference to d c p c i j thus α c p c i j can be defined using equation 2 2 α c p c i j 1 d c p c i j d c p c i j in cases where d c p c i j 0 α c p c i j will be equal to 1 while the others have a value of zero the expert judgement acquired will subsequently be converted into the belief degree format using equation 3 wang et al 1995 yang et al 2008 3 β c p c i j α c p c i j j 1 n α c p c i j where β c p c i j is the normalized value of α c p c i j expressing the degree to which cpc i belongs to the jth fuzzy set and 4 j 1 j β c p c i j also if cpc i is completely assessed to the jth fuzzy set then β c p c i j is equal to 1 whereas values of the others are equal to 0 the value of β c p c i j can be viewed as a belief degree representing the degree to which cpc i belongs to the jth fuzzy set for the purpose of reducing the data subjectivity a group of specialists are invited to provide a comprehensive view for the human error related events suppose n experts are invited to give the expert judgment with regard to the status of cpc i the combined consensus from such specialists can be acquired using equation 5 given the weight of each expert is of equal 5 β c p c i j j j 1 j β c p c i j n where β c p c i j j denotes the combined degree to which cpc i belongs to the jth fuzzy set after aggregating the opinion from j experts stating that the cpc should be described by the jth fuzzy set j is adopted to express the number of the fuzzy sets of low l moderate m and high h and the summation of such three sets is equal to n and also 6 j l m h n β c p c i j j 1 in situations where the relative importance of each specialist is various the magnitude of weight for each expert is determined according to the years of the seagoing experience equation 7 is introduced to derive the degree of the relative importance for each expert 7 θ n δ n n 1 n δ n where θ n is the degree of the relative importance for expert n δ n denotes the years of the seagoing experience of the specialist and also 8 n 1 n θ n 1 accordingly the combined expert judgment from such specialists with regard to the status of cpc i can be acquired by rewriting the contents of equation 5 and is determined as follows 9 β c p c i j j n 1 n β c p c i j θ n 3 2 4 establishment of fuzzy rule base allowing for providing risk studies with better result discrimination the fuzzy rule base in this study is established using the approach developed by ung 2018a such a rule base approach has the advantage of contemplating the grades of fuzzy sets and the weights of cpcs in the antecedent when deriving the consequent for each rule in this study the importance values for the linguistic terms applied namely low moderate and high are arbitrarily set to 0 0 5 and1 0 respectively also suppose cpc 1 cpc 2 and cpc v are evaluated by u fuzzy sets the index for the acquirement of the appropriate evaluation grades in the contextual control mode cocom and the associated confidence degrees in the kth rule can be obtained using equation 10 10 s k 1 a u 1 c p c 1 w c p c 1 1 a u 2 c p c 2 w c p c 2 1 a u v c p c v w c p c v where s k is the score for the identification of the appropriate linguistic terms in the kth rule 1 a u1 cpc1 1 a u2 cpc2 and 1 a uv cpcv are the importance values for the fuzzy sets a u1 a u2 and a uv that describe cpc 1 cpc 2 and cpc v in the antecedent and w cpc1 w cpc2 and w cpcv are the weights for cpc 1 cpc 2 and cpc v conventional cream studies logarithmically describe the universe of discourse in which the fuzzy sets of strategic tactical opportunistic and scrambled are applied to define the human mal operation probability for specific events hollnagel 1998 thus a transformation process takes places to convert s k into the logarithmical value within the universe of discourse at which the membership functions of the fuzzy sets are located ung 2018a the probability intervals defined by traditional cream studies will be an important reference to this end the logarithmical values can subsequently be determined using equation 11 11 c l k s k r s 0 r l where c l k is the corresponding logarithmical values for the kth rule s k denotes the score in the universe of discourse of the linguistic terms describing the consequent portion in the kth rule r s is the range of the scores for the linguistic terms characterizing the consequent part and r l expresses the interval of the logarithmical values for the linguistic terms depicting the consequent portion suppose c l k is located at the position shown in fig 2 the appropriate fuzzy set and the associated degrees of confidence identified for the kth rule can be identified as opportunistic d k o scrambled d k s 3 2 5 acquirement of fuzzy conclusion and fuzzy posterior probabilities using bn this study adopts bn to obtain the fuzzy conclusion as well as the fuzzy posterior probabilities for each human error related basic event the belief degrees converted from each cpc observations are considered as the prior probabilities whereas the confidence degree of each fuzzy set in the consequent are adopted as the conditional probabilities ung 2018a suppose a specific human error basic event is influenced by v cpcs each of which is evaluated by u fuzzy sets the fuzzy conclusion for linguistic term l depicting the cocom can be obtained using equation 12 it is noted every piece of the information from each cpc and the conditional probabilities from each rule are meticulously contemplated 12 p y y l c p c 1 c p c 2 c p c v p c p c 1 c p c 2 c p c v y y l u z p d u v l q v 1 v p q u v where q c p c u 1 c p c u 2 c p c u v u u 1 u 2 u v z u u 1 1 2 u 1 u 2 1 2 u 2 u v 1 2 u v p y y l is the degree fuzzy marginal probability of the lth linguistic term in the fuzzy conclusion y for a specific basic event related to human error and l strategic tactical opportunistic and scrambled p d u v l q denotes the degree of confidence fuzzy conditional probability of the lth linguistic term describing the consequent of each rule given c p c u 1 c p c u 2 c p c u v and p q uv denotes the fuzzy prior probability of cpc v described by the uth linguistic term based on the consensus from the experts using equation 5 or 9 p y y l is the synthesized risk outcomes i e the fuzzy marginal probability of the lth linguistic term in the fuzzy conclusion y for a human error related basic event further investigations can be carried out to evaluate the degree of a particular linguistic term contained in a cpc contributing to the fuzzy conclusion provided that such a fuzzy conclusion is assessed to a specific linguistic term by virtue of equation 13 based on the bn mechanism such influence can be appreciated accordingly the cpcs giving rise to significant effects to the fuzzy conclusion are identified 13 p q u v u y y l p q u v u p y y l q u v u p y y l where p q u v u j y y l is the fuzzy posterior probability of the uth linguistic term of cpc v given the information that the fuzzy conclusion is assessed to the lth linguistic term p q u v u is the fuzzy prior probability of cpc v with regard to the uth linguistic term p y y l q u v u denotes the fuzzy conditional probability of the lth linguistic term of the fuzzy conclusion given the information that cpc v belongs to the uth linguistic term and p y y l expresses the fuzzy marginal probability of the lth linguistic term in the fuzzy conclusion 3 2 6 acquirement of hep the fuzzy conclusion acquired is in a format of fuzzy probability further analysis is required to appreciate its quantitative yet probabilistic results this is achieved by conducting the processes of defuzzification and transformation the former has the capability of translating the fuzzy conclusion into its crisp meaning and the latter has the feature of equipping the crisp outcome with a probabilistic nature allowing for the precision the center of area coa approach is adopted to defuzzfy the fuzzy conclusion while a number of algorithms are available and applied rao and saraf 1996 roychowdhury and pedrycz 2001 runkler 1996 runkler and glesner 1993 van leekwijck and kerre 1999 patel and mohan 2002 ung and shen 2011 ung 2018a the method determines the center of the area of the synthesized membership functions using equation 14 14 c y y μ y l x x d x y μ y l x d x where c y is the crisp value of the fuzzy conclusion y for the human error related basic event and μ yl x denotes the membership functions of the linguistic term l applied by the fuzzy conclusion y the value of c y has a logarithmic nature and is needed to transform into probabilistic results using equation 15 15 p y 1 10 c y where p y denotes the hep of a basic event under consideration 3 3 calculation of oil tanker collision probability and analysis of human error contribution to oil tanker collision the heps obtained using the aforementioned steps will be incorporated into the fault tree of oil tanker collision the occurrence rates of the others including machinery failures on the other hand will be obtained based on the traditional oil tanker collision studies as well as the statistics from imo gisis after deriving the minimal cut sets i e the smallest combination of all basic events using boolean algebra the probability of the oil tanker collision can be determined based on equations 16 and 17 celik et al 2010 finally crucial human error related basic events are identified using sensitivity analysis and the results will provide the insights into the extents to which human errors contribute to oil tanker collisions by virtue of sensitivity analysis the effect on the overall collision probability resulting from minor alternations of each human error related basic event can be appreciated the factors significantly drive the outcomes upwards or downwards are the human elements playing crucial role in the occurrence of oil tanker collision 16 p c i 1 n p b i 17 p c 1 i 1 n 1 p b i where p c is the probability of the oil tanker collision and b i denotes the probability of the basic event i 4 model validation and application 4 1 modified cream validation for the purpose of illustrating that the risk outcome discrimination of the modified cream proposed is better than that of ung 2018a this study introduces two different scenarios shown in table 5 based on the skeletons described in section 2 3 4 accordingly the visibility distances for scenarios 1 and 2 are set to 3 5 and 6 5 nautical miles also suppose the rest of the 6 cpcs are precisely described by moderate the visibility statuses of the two scenarios are mapped as 0 1 0 7 2 1 0 3 0 3 4 0 5 and 0 1 0 3 2 1 0 3 0 7 4 0 5 referring to the fuzzy definition in table 4 where the visibility boundary is set to 10 nautical miles apart from cpc 5 the rest of the cpcs have the identical evaluation grades according to common human perception the hep of scenario 1 will be slightly higher than that of scenario 2 notwithstanding the fuzzy data of such two cases are close to each other according to the methodology the belief degrees for scenarios 1 and 2 are obtained using equations 1 3 as shown in table 6 only cpc 5 is described by three linguistic terms low moderate and high with the belief degrees meanwhile the others have one moderate in both cases thus the number of the fuzzy rule combination is 3 and the fuzzy sets obtained as well as the confidence degrees associated in the consequent for the scenarios are identical table 7 contains the details of the combination and the derived consequent using the pattern aforementioned in section 3 2 4 table 8 lists the fuzzy conclusions and heps for the two scenarios using equations 12 14 and 15 by virtue of the hep comparison the outcomes generated by the modified framework are consistent with the common human perception although the fuzzy data of the two cases are close to each other the modified cream is still capable of discriminating the magnitude differences between the scenarios accordingly the proposed cream has a higher degree of distinguishability than the one developed by ung 2018a it is such a modified cream that is applied to the oil tank collision study a step by step application is provided in section 4 2 and it is believed that the risk outcomes produced will be more reasonable than traditional studies 4 2 oil tanker collision study in this study a total of 39 experts including 21 captains and 18 chief officers from the shipping industry and academia are invited to work as the consultants offering the professional opinions 28 out of these captains and officers have the working experience onboard oil tankers all the experts are familiar with the geographical and meteorological characteristics of the taiwanese waters the average years of seagoing experience of such specialists are 21 and 10 respectively the case study selected is taiwanese strait the traffic density of the western taiwanese coast is higher than that of the eastern one in particular the hsinchu penghu and kaohsiung waters are the sea areas with the highest frequencies of marine accidents sung 2012 such specialists provide expert judgement with regard to collision risks for oil tankers navigating in vicinity of the aforementioned taiwanese waters the 39 specialists are invited to evaluate a scenario in which the human error related basic events leading to a collision of a suezmax oil tanker passing through the hsinchu penghu and kaohsiung waters are considered in terms of investigating the prevailing circumstance of each cpc the scenario is set in wintertime during which rough seas and strong wind are likely to encounter the expert judgment from the captains and chief officers mainly reflects the current status of such ambient factors that influence the crew performance in the bridge and the safety culture of the taiwanese shipping companies 4 2 1 fta of oil tanker collision based on accident databases casualty reports and expert judgement the fta in fig 3 shows the sequences of the collision of a suezmax oil tanker based on the imo gisis database previous accident reports the experts and traditional studies for oil tankers martins and maturana 2010 uğurlu et al 2013 for the purpose of evaluating human error contributions to oil tanker collision only basic events be of 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 and 18 are further analyzed the data of the rest i e the events of 1 13 14 15 16 and 17 are obtained based on the gisis database accident reports and traditional studies for oil tankers 4 2 2 human error assessment using a modified cream based on fbn 4 2 2 1 acquirement of fuzzy data from the experts based on the fuzzy sets defined each human error related basic event is evaluated using the 7 cpcs based on the fuzzy sets defined in table 4 in other words bes 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 and 18 are analyzed using low moderate and high the experts are asked to give the professional opinions with regard to the status of each cpc for each be per passage of taiwan strait particularly the hsinchu penghu and kaohsiung waters table 9 provides the fuzzy data of be 2 containing the frequency of each linguistic term for each cpc based on the expert judgement from the 39 experienced specialists allowing for the length of paper the professional opinions for bes 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 and 18 are not given however are available from the author 4 2 2 2 combination of fuzzy data for each cpc given the statement from the majority of the experts that the relative importance of each specialist should be equal the fuzzy data of each cpc acquired from such professionals for each human error related basic event is synthesized to obtain the consensus using equations 1 3 and 5 accordingly table 10 contains the belief degrees of each cpc for be 2 the outcomes of the other basic events are not given in this study however are available from the author 4 2 2 3 fuzzy rule base this research evaluates the cpcs using the linguistic terms of low moderate and high 7 inputs are under consideration in this study 2187 rules are accordingly developed provided that the weight of each cpc is of equal table 11 is the rule examples with the associated degrees of confidence constructed based on section 3 2 4 it can be seen from the table that slight positive negative changes in the event observations described by low moderate and high in the antecedent will result in the incremental decreasing consequent compared with traditional rule base approaches the logicality of the mechanism proposed in this study is reinforced accordingly the model proposed in this study is capable of producing outcomes in a sensible way 4 2 2 4 acquisition of fuzzy conclusion and fuzzy posterior probabilities using bn the bn constructed for this study consists of 7 parent nodes cpcs and 1 child node fuzzy conclusion as shown in fig 4 according to the experts cocom i e the fuzzy conclusion is influenced by all the 7 cpcs and further cpcs 2 and 3 as well as cpcs 1 and cpc 6 also cause impacts to cpcs 4 and 7 respectively it is noted that cpc 4 is affected by cpcs 2 and 3 due to fact that the higher user friendliness level of control panel of navigation instruments and more complete ism procedures and plans will ease the navigational burden of ship crew thus less distraction enables oow to become more focused on traffic since the number of tasks for navigation has been reduced in addition more thorough safety policies and practices shore based support from the company cpc 1 and sufficient crew training and experience cpc 6 imply a higher level of crew collaboration quality cpc 7 this is because integrated safety policies bring detailed safety practices that entitle oow to gain background knowledge and sufficient support such as additional deck crew recruitment onboard ships reduces the level of fatigue furthermore crew experience and skill trainings such as bridge resource management brm enhance the communication teamwork decision making and situation awareness in the bridge table 12 contains the examples of 2187 rules with the prior and conditional probabilities of each cpc and the corresponding consequent for the oil tanker collision study the fuzzy conclusion is obtained based on equation 12 contemplating all the information from rules 1 to 2187 fig 5 shows the outcome obtained using hugin lite 8 5 that is expressed in the format of fuzzy marginal probabilities for the child node i e the cocom for the oil tanker collision in the bn the fuzzy conclusions of the other human error related basic events are acquired using the aforementioned pattern and table 13 contains the outcomes of all the events the fuzzy marginal probabilities of each basic event can be further investigated to appreciate the relationship between each cpc and the occurrence probability of the event for the purpose of identifying the crucial cpcs contributing to the highest event outcome the fuzzy posterior probability is only applied to consider the worst linguistic term i e scrambled fig 6 shows the posterior probability of the fuzzy set for be 2 based on equation 13 using hugin lite 8 5 given the information that the fuzzy conclusion is completely assessed to scrambled the important factors contributing to be 2 include cpcs 4 2 5 and 1 of which the belief degrees of low are greater than 50 this is followed by cpcs 3 6 and 7 respectively table 14 lists the top 4 crucial elements resulting in the highest occurrence likelihoods of each be according to the table the most significant factor playing important roles in the rise of all human error bes is number of simultaneous goals cpc 4 with the frequency of 12 this is followed by adequacy of organization cpc 1 adequacy of mmi and os cpc 2 and availability of p p cpc 3 of which the numbers of the appearance in the table are 11 9 and 9 respectively 4 2 2 5 defuzzification and transformation of fuzzy conclusions into probabilistic outcomes the fuzzy marginal probabilities of each human error related basic event i e the fuzzy conclusions are transformed into the probabilistic outcomes using equation 14 given the fuzzy marginal probabilities acquired in table 13 the graphical presentation of the fuzzy conclusion for be 2 is established as shown in fig 7 the fuzzy conclusions of be 2 and the other cream related basic events are subsequently defuzzified and transformed into heps as shown in table 15 using equations 14 and 15 it can be seen from the table that the higher degrees of opportunistic and scrambled a basic event has the greater hep it deserves compared with the others be 4 has the highest hep since the event has the greatest magnitudes of opportunistic and scrambled such a phenomenon can be traced back to the original observations shown in table 16 where be 4 has the second least highs 98 the fifth and third largest numbers of low 63 and moderate 112 among the 12 bes according to the 39 experts be 6 on the other hand has the lowest hep due to the fact that the event is only evaluated using the minimal number of low 42 meanwhile the second most quantity of high 126 4 2 3 oil tanker collision probability the probabilities of the human error related basic events have been obtained based on the modified fbn based cream model the likelihoods of the others including bes 1 13 14 15 16 and 17 are collected from imo gisis and traditional oil tanker collision studies uğurlu et al 2013 gaonkar et al 2011 martins and maturana 2010 consequently the oil tanker collision probability can be determined using equations 16 and 17 the outcome of the case study is 5 2 10 3 per passage of taiwan strait particularly the hsinchu penghu and kaohsiung waters fig 8 presents the pathway and likelihoods of all the events 4 2 4 analysis of human error contribution to oil tanker collision this study carries out a sensitivity analysis to recognize the crucial human error related basic events contributing to oil tanker collision according to fig 9 the collision probabilities are sensitive to minor variations of bes 2 lack of brm com 3 lack of com bet ships 4 fatigue 5 colreg violations and 18 interpretation failures a further scrutiny is also conducted to appreciate the extent to which the variations of bes 6 oow handling failures 7 master verification failures 8 master failures 9 procedure violations 10 faulty procedures 11 improper lookout and 12 misuse of navigation instruments affect the collision probability in fig 10 the top event probability is relatively sensitive to minor alternations of bes 9 10 11 and 12 than that of bes 8 6 and 7 5 discussion the basic events of lack of brm com fatigue lack of com bet ships and colreg violations are ranked at nos 3 1 5 and 6 positions in the hep priority list and also give rise to substantial contributions to oil tanker collision brm includes the communication teamwork decision making and situation awareness of all personnel in the bridge including the pilot captain oow and helmsman its importance in ship navigation in particular with a pilot onboard is also recognized chauvin et al 2013 lack of brm com is concerned with the absence of close loop communication involving the opinion exchanges of salient features regarding to the current situation and discussions of the roles between the bridge members such a failure could lead to the loss of the opportunities for mutual performance monitoring and supportive behavior from the bridge members heavy workload is a major cause of fatigue recently it has been suggested that such an element directly links to the occurrence of most shipping accidents uğurlu et al 2015 the statement that lack of com bet ships and colreg violations are crucial factors for oil tanker collision is consistent with the outcomes generated by uğurlu et al 2013 lack of com bet ships may originate from insufficient english heavy workload and the disturbance by simultaneous tasks according to the imo gisis database the most frequent colreg violations of oil tankers include rule 5 look out rule 7 risk of collision rule 6 safe speed rule 34 manoeuvring and warning signals rule 8 action to avoid collision rule 14 head on situation rule 19 conduct of vessels in restricted visibility and rule 35 sound signals in restricted visibility the counter measures aimed at diminishing the occurrence of lack of brm com fatigue lack of com bet ships and colreg violations should be proposed possible risk control options may include periodical brm trainings and communications the disposition of supplemental crew and regular bridge navigation exercises using simulators such safety measures should focus on internal and external information exchange appropriate use of maritime english and colreg while be of interpretation failures of navigational instruments has the third lowest likelihood among the 12 events attentions should also be paid to ensure that the probability of such an event constantly stays in a low yet acceptable level due to its potential contributing to the accident regular training courses regarding state of the art apparatus for navigation are suggested to propose likewise risk control options shall be planed for bes of procedure violations and faulty procedures since the probabilistic outcomes of such two events are ranked at higher positions and would cause a certain level of influence to collision once the likelihoods deteriorated shipping companies are suggested to establish effective response schemes with regard to non conformities and deficient procedures designated persons dps shall review such procedure violations and speculate likely yet negative outcomes which are subsequently disseminated to ship crew to emphasize the importance of established safety practices faulty procedures should also be examined and redevised to ensure that such modified procedures are specifically appropriate for each of oil tankers further work for the findings of this study may be the application of formal safety assessment fsa introduced by imo to adopt the steps of risk control options cost benefit assessment and decision making accordingly cost effective safety measures could be proposed taking into account the financial feasibility of each shipping company 6 conclusion marine accidents come about mainly due to human errors the appraisal of human error contribution to ship casualties is burdensome due to the scarce or incompleteness of data the contexts where ship crews perform duties are often influenced by the individual technological contextual and organizational factors it is such elements that determine the human performance in ship operations and human error should be treated as a combined outcome of such factors onboard vessels accordingly this research evaluates the collision probability of oil tanker based on an fta structure under which a modified fuzzy cream model is developed to conduct human error assessment different from traditional studies the proposed methodology provides a higher degree of result distinguishability meanwhile contemplating the weights and quantitative effects caused by the ambient elements without the loss of information from experts on the other hand this study constructs an fta presenting a vivid picture of the oil tanker collision sequences and collects the expert judgement from the 39 specialists with substantial seagoing experience the bes of lack of brm com lack of com bet ships fatigue and colreg violations have higher positions in the hep priority list and also give rise to substantial contributions to oil tanker collision according to the analysis such elements have the potential of causing perception failures and trigger the unwanted accident in addition the probabilistic outcomes of procedure violations and faulty procedures are also ranked higher and would cause a certain level of influence to collision once the likelihoods deteriorated possible risk control options may include periodical brm trainings and communications the disposition of supplemental crew and regular bridge navigation exercises using simulators given the information that the fuzzy conclusions of such cream related bes are completely assessed to the worse scenario scrambled the significant factors contributing to the rise of the heps is number of simultaneous goals adequacy of mmi and os adequacy of organization the availability of p p as well as degree of brightness and visibility likely counter measures may involve the deployment of additional personnel for bridge lookouts the enhancement of shore base support levels for ships renew or procurement of more user friendly navigation instruments and review of the ism related procedures and plans one of the limitations in this study is that experts possess great portions in subjective modeling approaches like the one proposed in this study while the proposed methodology has the strength of providing logical and sensible results without the distortion of professional judgement from experts its beauty would be jeopardized without the participation of qualified experts in addition the fta established makes use of the information from accident databases casualty reports and expert judgement when risk assessment is undertaken to evaluate cases in which the lack of data exists and complex interdependence between factors with multiple states are necessary to consider the application of the proposed fta may be unrealistic nevertheless given sufficient accident reports and appropriate expert judgment the oil tanker collision study proposed based on fta in combination with the modified cream method is able to generate reasonable probabilistic outcomes and provide useful references for enhancing oil tanker safety acknowledgement the author would like to express the gratitude to national taiwan ocean university for supporting the academic resources needed for this research
