20585,in this paper the dynamic stiffness method dsm is presented to investigate the vibration characterizes of coupled conical ribbed cylindrical conical shell structure with general boundary condition rib stiffeners are evenly distributed in the inner side of the cylindrical shell firstly the coupled structure is divided into several components i e conical and cylindrical shells annular plate according to the geometric properties and coupling boundary conditions the displacement fields of the components are derived from the governing equations exactly then the dynamic stiffness matrix is formulated based on the relationship between the displacements and forces on the boundaries of the components the global dynamic stiffness matrix of the coupled structure is assembled in a similar way as used in the finite element method fem in addition the experimental model of conical ribbed cylindrical conical shell structure is built and vibration test is conducted the accuracy and stability of the present method are validated by comparing the present results with the results obtained by fem and experimental test several numerical examples are conducted to understand the effects of geometric parameters on the dynamic behaviors of the coupled structure which can offer positive guides for acoustic design of the combined shell structure keywords dynamic stiffness formulation coupled shell structure dynamic behavior stiffened shell vibration analysis 1 introduction shells of revolution are very common foundation structures in practical engineering applications by virtue of their excellent mechanical properties for example the pressure hull of submarine and the fuselage of aircraft are generally constituted of coupled shell structures impact and shock from mechanical equipment are always inevitably which may result in undesired vibration and fatigue phenomenon therefore it is of high interest and importance to evaluate and analyze the dynamic characteristics of the shell structures thoroughly in initial design stages the main purpose of the present paper is to develop an accurate and efficient dynamic modeling method for coupled shell structure with general boundary condition in the last century donnell flügge reissner and other scholars have developed different thin shell theories based on different simplified assumptions of strain displacement equations which have greatly promoted the development of thin shell theory those research achievements of thin shell theories at that time were documented thoroughly by leissa leissa 1973 nevertheless the theoretical basis only provides the stress strain relationships and equations of motion of the shell structures how to obtain exact solutions of the vibration problems have become the subject of many researchers for a long period of time in recent decades various numerical and analytical methods have emerged for example differential quadrature method bert and malik 1996 lam et al 2002 shu 1996 transfer matrix method irie et al 1982 1983 tottenham and shimizu 1972 energy based method chen et al 2013 jin et al 2014 lee and kwak 2015 li et al 2018 sun et al 2018 finite element method guo et al 2002 luah and fan 1989 and so forth however most of the present modeling methods are focused on the vibration problem of an individual shell such as cylindrical conical or spherical shells less studies on vibration of coupled shell structures are reported for the reasons of structural discontinuity and difference of physical coordinate systems in general coupled shell structures can be classified into two groups according to their properties one is rib stiffened shell and another is combination of different types of shells the stiffening ribs are generally treated by averaging their mass and stiffness over the surface of the shell or regarding as discrete members in the former case stiffened shell can be equivalent to an orthotropic shell where the stiffening ribs are distributed evenly and closely along the axial direction of the shell the equivalent technique basdekas and chi 1971 caresta and kessissoglou 2009 pan et al 2008 is simple but has high request for the number and distribution of the stiffening ribs in addition the results are not accurate enough in high frequency range when the wavelength of vibration is smaller than the space between those ribs thus the stiffening ribs are also regarded as discrete components to improve calculation accuracy in this case the distribution geometry material of the stiffening ribs can be assigned discretionarily curved beam element is most commonly used to simulate the discrete stiffening rib jafari and bagheri 2006 qu et al 2013a talebitooti et al 2010 jafari and bagheri jafari and bagheri 2006 investigated vibration behaviors of the non uniform rib stiffened cylindrical shell based on the ritz method taking into consideration of the stretching bending and wrapping motions the kinetic energy of the stiffening rib was developed wang et al 2015 derived the acting forces and moment from the stiffener based on the timoshenko beam theory and developed the dynamic model of rib stiffened conical shell via the relation between the displacements of the stiffener and neutral surface displacements of the shell component tounsi et al 2014 regarded the ribbed cylindrical shell as a stepped shell with variable thickness and the ribbed part was simulated with a thickened shell component of different middle surface but for large shell structure like ship hull the size of the rib is generally large and the cross section is usually flat under the circumstances the beam element or shell element cannot represent the local mode of the rib properly a few researchers started to deal with vibration problems of stiffened shell by describing the stiffened ribs using the equations of annular plate with different approximate analytical methods wei et al 2013 xie et al 2015 y et al 2016 for complex shell combinations like the hull of submarine and aircraft the stiffened shell is just a part of the whole structure and they also typically contain different kinds of shells of revolution after an extensive literature it is found that a large amount of research has studied the dynamic and vibration characteristics of combined shells of revolution stanley and ganesan stanley and ganesan 1996 proposed an semi analytical finite element method for vibration analysis of conical shell and obtained the vibration analysis models of cylindrical shell and circular plates by setting the semi vertex angles as 0 and 90 then the global equations of the shell plate combination are obtained by the assembly procedure used in the fem using the similar formulation efraim and eisenberger efraim and eisenberger 2006 established the analysis model of conical shell structure using the power series method firstly then studied the vibration behaviors of different coupled shell structures huang and soedel huang and soedel 1993 proposed a receptance method to study the modal characteristics of a cylindrical shell joined to a annular plate with arbitrary axial position wang et al 2004 investigated the power flow characteristics of cylindrical shell rectangular plate coupled system irie et al 1984 used the transfer matrix method for free vibration analysis of the conical cylindrical shell combinations in the formulation the displacement coordination relation at the coupling boundaries can be effectively established by the displacement transfer point matrix which shows the superiority of the transfer matrix method in the analysis of continuous coupled structures free vibration analysis of conical shell with annular end plate is presented by liang and chen liang and chen 2006 based on the transfer matrix method the transfer matrix is solved by using the recursive formula method which greatly improved the computational accuracy compared with the commonly used runge kutta gill method combining with the idea of precise integration method zhong 2004 wang and guo 2016 developed a precise transfer matrix method to investigate the vibration response of stiffened combined conical cylindrical spherical shell bagheri et al 2018 conducted free vibration response of joined conical cylindrical conical shell by the generalized differential quadrature method based on the first order shear deformation shell theory as well as the donnell thin shell theory ma et al 2014 2017 presented an improved fourier ritz method for free and forced vibration of coupled conical cylindrical shells and annular plate cylindrical shell combinations the boundary and coupling conditions are implemented by the penalty function method which may result in ill conditioned system and redundant derivation to solve the above problem su and jin su and jin 2016 proposed a fourier spectral element method for model analysis of conical cylindrical spherical shells by introducing the boundary node information into the admissible function where the coupling boundary energy functional can be omitted and the mass matrix and stiffness matrix of the coupled shell can be obtained directly by using assembly procedure similar to the finite element method combining the thin shell theory and multilevel partition technique qu and his couthers qu et al 2013b wu et al 2013 developed a semi analytical theoretical model of stiffened shell combinations based on the modified variational method caresta and kessissoglou 2010 employed the wave solution and power series solution for vibration analysis of calendrical shell and conical shell respectively the continuity and equilibrium conditions at the coupling boundaries conical shell and cylindrical shell are used to build the final governing equation of the isotropic coupled cylindrical conical shells chen and her couthers chen et al 2015 xie et al 2019 xie and chen 2018 developed the wave based models for various kinds of shell of combinations it is worth noting that most of the literature referred above have been devoted to theoretical modeling for vibration analysis of shell of combinations however only few research focused on experimental investigation pellicano pellicano 2007 built an experimental set up to verify the frequency damping and mode shape of the cylindrical shell modal test of cylindrical spherical shell is performed by lee et al 2002 to verify the reliability of the analytical solution meyer et al 2017 conducted experiments to investigate the effect of non axisymmetric internal frame on the vibroacoustic behavior of stiffened cylindrical shell vibro acoustic experiments of cylindrical shell immersed in ice covered water are carried out by wang et al 2019 and the influence of immersion depth ice thickness density temperature on the sound radiation and vibration properties are investigated from the literature review experiment results on complex coupled shell structures are very rare in recent years the dynamic stiffness method is well developed for free and forced vibration predictions of shell and plate structures the dynamic stiffness method can be regarded as a semi analytical and semi numerical method which has distinct advantages in computational efficiency and convergence for complex shell of combinations it is only needed to divide the whole structure into several subdomains instead of dividing the structure into a large number of elements like in the element based methods initially the research focused on the formulation of the dynamic stiffness method for vibration problems of beam and plate structures banerjee and ananthapuvirajah 2019a b liu and banerjee 2016 nefovska danilovic and petronijevic 2015 were widely reported recently the dynamic stiffness method started to be used for vibration modeling cylindrical shell kolarević and nefovska danilovic 2020 kolarević et al 2016 but to the authors knowledge there is no public report on vibration modeling of complex shell combinations based on the dynamic stiffness formulation in this paper the dynamic stiffness formulation is presented for vibration analysis of conical ribbed cylindrical conical shell besides experiment model is designed to verified the theoretical model stiffened ribs are assumed to be uniformly distributed in the cylindrical shell domain which are dispersed into separate units and described by equations of annular plate in the formulation regardless of boundary conditions the displacement fields of the cylindrical shell conical shell and annular plate are expressed as exponential functions power series functions and bessel functions respectively the dynamic stiffness matrixes of the components are formulated based on the relationship between the displacements and forces of the boundary ends based on the boundary continuity condition the global dynamic stiffness matrix of the coupled structure can be obtained by adopting the matrix assembly technique both free and forced vibration analysis of the coupled shell are performed numerical and experimental examples are implemented to verify the present method subsequently paramedic study is performed to investigate the dynamic characteristics of the coupled conical ribbed cylindrical conical shell structure 2 theoretical formulations 2 1 description of the model referring to fig 1 the sketch of conical ribbed cylindrical conical shell structure is depicted where the ribbed cylindrical shell is combined with two conical shells rib stiffeners and bulkheads are distributed inside of the cylindrical shell along the axial direction uniformly the cross sectional area of the stiffener is d h p thicknesses of the conical shell cylindrical shell and annular plate are assumed to be of uniform values and donated as h c h s and h p the semi vertex angle of the conical shell is donated as α and the radii at the large and small ends are r 0 and r 1 l c and l s are the lengths of the conical and cylindrical shells the coupled shell can be decomposed into several conical shells cylindrical shells and annular plates along the coupling boundaries among the components fig 2 shows the local coordinate systems of the three components and the stress diagram at the boundary ends the conical shell is described in the coordinate system x c θ r where x c θ and r are coordinate axes along the generatrix circumferential and normal directions displacements of the conical shell along the axes are defined as u c v c and w c and ψ c w c x c is slope the corresponding forces are donated as n x c v x c n x θ c and m x c the cylindrical shell is described in the coordinate system x s θ r where x s θ and r are coordinate axes along the generatrix circumferential and normal directions displacements of the cylindrical shell along the axes are defined as u s v s and w s and ψ s w s x s is slope the corresponding forces are donated as n x s n x θ s q x s and m x s the coordinate system r θ x p is considered for the annular plate in which r θ and x p donate radial circumferential and axial directions respectively displacements of the annular plate can be defined as u p v p and w p in r θ and x p directions and ψ p w p r is the slope the stiffeners and bulkheads are simulated by equation of annular plate thus the forces with respect to the axes are defined as n r p n θ p n x p and m p respectively displacement fields of the shell and plate components in the θ and r i c s p directions can be expressed as 1 u i u i x i θ e j ω t 2 v i v i x i θ e j ω t 3 w i w i x i θ e j ω t in which j 1 ω is the circular frequency for a shell or plate of revolution the displacement components are distributed periodically in circumferential directions thus the general solutions of the cylindrical shell conical shell and annular plate can be further expressed as following infinite series based on the technique of separation of variables 4 u i x i θ t u i x i θ e i ω t m 0 u i m x i cos m θ e i ω t 5 v i x i θ t v i x i θ e i ω t m 0 v i m x i sin m θ e i ω t 6 w i x i θ t w i x i θ e i ω t m 0 w i m x i cos m θ e i ω t where m is integer which indicates the wave numbers in circumferential direction 2 2 formulation of the dynamic stiffness matrix in the formulation the materials properties of those components are assumed to be consistent which are donated as young s modulus e poisson ratio υ and mass density ρ meanwhile the thicknesses of the shell and plate components are considered as small enough with respect to the other geometric dimensions and of uniform size therefore the thin shell and plate theories are used in the following modeling process in this section general solutions and dynamic stiffness for the cylindrical shell conical shell and annular plate are formulated in detail 2 2 1 cylindrical shell based on the flügge thin shell theory the governing differential equations of the cylindrical shell can be expressed as leissa 1973 7 l 11 s u s

respectively the sizes of k m p i and k m p o are both 4 4 the problem of in plane or out of plane vibration can be calculated separately by solving eq 53 or eq 54 but when plate shell coupled

boundary conditions the convenience and flexibility of assembly procedure of the dynamic stiffness method contributes to its great applicability in coping with complex couple structure hereinbefore the dynamic stiffness formulations of the three shells and plate components have been presented then assembly procedures based on the displacement compatibility conditions are employed to construct the whole dynamic stiffness matrix for the complex conical ribbed cylindrical conical shell structure but it should be noted that all the three kinds of components are in their own local coordinate thus the displacements of the components should be transformed into a global coordinate system before the assembly procedure then according to the relationship between the local coordinate system and the global coordinate system the spatial transformation matrix is constructed and the stiffness matrix of the subunit component in the local coordinate system is converted into the global coordinate system in the formulation the coordinate system of the cylindrical shell is selected as the global coordinate system for illustrative purpose the relationship of displacements and forces between the coupled boundaries of the shells and plate are show in fig 6 the displacement can be converted from the local coordinate system into the global coordinate system by the transformation matrix t as following 58 x t x g where subscript g represents the global coordinate system the matrix t can be obtained based on the coordination relation between displacement at the coupling boundary from fig 6 the continuity conditions between the cylindrical shell annular plate and conical shell cylindrical shell can be described respectively as following 59 u s w p n x p n x s v s v p n θ p n θ s w s u p

which subscripts p and c represent annular plate and conical shell respectively using orthogonal transformation the equations of motion of the annular plate and conical shell in the global coordinate system can be expressed as 63 q p c g k p c g q p c g where k p c g t p c t k p c t p c is dynamic stiffness matrix in global coordinate system once the dynamic stiffness matrixes of the subunits are computed they can be assembled in the global dynamic stiffness matrix for the coupled structure as schematically depicted in fig 7 the entire equation of motion for the coupled structure can be given as 64 q w k w q w where k w q w and q w are the whole dynamic stiffness matrix force vector and displacement vector respectively the natural frequency and dynamic response can be directly obtained by solving eq 64 the assemble technique used here is familiar with that adopted in the fem but the difference is that the present matrix is assembled along the boundary lines rather than the element nodes in the fem a single dynamic stiffness shell or plate element is adequate to calculate any frequency range of dynamic response for an individual component to any desired accuracy therefore low computational efficiency caused by mesh partition in element based method can be avoided in the present method base on the formulation any prescribed boundary conditions ranging from classical elastic boundary conditions mass attachments as well as elastic coupling restraints can be applied directly and accurately for the sake of brevity only the classical boundary condition is considered for example if there are zero elements in displacement vector q m the corresponding row and columns of k m will be condensed for clamped boundaries in is note that the condensation of the dynamic stiffness matrix can further reduce the dimension of the system and improve the computational efficiency when free vibration of the coupled shell structure is considered the vector q w in eq 64 will be assigned as zero firstly then the natural frequencies can be determined by searching the trial value of frequency which will make the determinant of k w be equal zero it can be implemented by iterative interpolation as the natural frequency is determined the corresponding mode shape can be obtained naturally by substituting natural frequency back into eq 64 3 numerical examples and discussion in this part the vibration analysis model is implemented in the matlab software which provides solutions for the coupled shell structures with high accuracy and efficiency convergence and validation of free vibration analysis is firstly implemented in section 3 1 then force vibration analysis is validated and paramedical analysis is carried out in section 3 2 3 1 free vibration numerical examples are carried out to validate the convergence and accuracy of the proposed dynamic stiffness method natural frequencies of conical stiffened cylindrical conical shell in fig 1 under different boundary conditions is calculated the geometric parameters are assumed as r 0 1 m r 1 3 25 m 2 l c 7 28 m α π 10 l s 30 m h 0 04 m d 0 08 m the whole structure is assumed to be of isotropic materials and the material properties are taken as e 210 gpa ρ 7800 kg m 3 υ 0 3 for the coupled shell structure only boundary condition of the conical shell is concerned for brevity only three kind of classical boundary conditions often encountered in practices are used which are defined as clamped edge c u c 0 v c 0 w c 0 ψ c 0 simple supported edge s n x c 0 v c 0 w c 0 m x c 0 free edge f n x c 0 n x θ c 0 v c 0 m x c 0 in the following examples natural frequencies of coupled shell structure with f f c f and c c boundary conditions are calculated the two letter string employed here represents the combinations of boundary condition where the two letters represent the boundary condition of the left and right ends respectively to validate the influence of the rib stiffener on the vibration characteristics of the coupled shell no stiffener is considered in the first model and 59 stiffeners are evenly distributed along the axis of the cylindrical shell in the second model the first 20 natural frequencies of the two models obtained by present method are given in table 1 and table 2 meanwhile solutions obtained by the fem software ansys are also included for reference in the ansys element 63 is employed for both shell and plate structures and two mesh size are employed for comparison i e 0 2 m and 0 1 m it is found that the results of fem are almost unchanged as the mesh size decreases from 0 2 m to 0 1 m which can prove that the fem results are almost convergent and the reference date is reliable at the same time it can be seen from the tables that the present results agree well with those obtained by fem which indicated the present method is sufficiently accurate to solve the free vibration of coupled shell structure with general boundary conditions fig 8 and fig 9 depict the vibration mode shapes of the shell models under different boundary conditions which can help to understand the certain features for the free vibration of the coupled shell structures it can be seen that the circumferential number m of the low order modes is concentrated at 2 and 3 it is note that although the boundary conditions are different some modes and their corresponding frequencies are nearly the same for example the 2ed modes under f f and c c boundary condition as well as the 3rd mode under c f boundary condition the main reason is that the radius of the conical shells at both ends shrink which increases the local stiffness at both ends in those modes the overall structure is dominated by the local vibration of the middle cylindrical shell in this case the influence of boundary is negligible comparing the figures of the corresponding orders in figs 8 and 9 it can be found that the modal shapes corresponding to the same boundary conditions are very similar because there is free boundary end in f f and c f boundary conditions the mode shapes can be divided into two types 1 vibration located in the middle cylinder and vibration located in the free end of the conical shell for the modes of type 1 the stiffened ribs have increased the frequencies but the mode shapes keep unchanged however the mode shapes keep unchanged and frequencies decrease slightly for the modes of type 2 this is due to that the rib stiffeners have no influence on the stiffness of the conical shell and meanwhile increase the mass of the whole structure 3 2 forced vibration 3 2 1 validation the large scale of the shell structure used in present example will lead to high modal density so it is difficult to conduct characteristic analysis from the perspective of free vibration in the following forced vibration will be implemented to investigate the vibration characteristics of conical stiffened cylindrical conical shell the material and geometric properties used in the numerical examples are identical to those in section 3 1 it is assumed that the driving point force f a f e i ω t is located on the left end of the subconical shell which can be referred in fig 10 a complex young s modulus e e 1 j η is introduced in the calculations to represent the damping effect where η 0 005 is the structural damping factor according to the free vibration analysis the circumferential wave numbers corresponding to the modes of the present model in low frequency range are relatively small therefore the truncated number of the circumferential number is selected as 10 the reliability of this method on forced vibration calculation is verified by comparing with the results of finite element method the mesh sizes are set to 0 02 m and 0 01 m respectively in ansys software to verify the convergence of the finite element method fig 11 and fig 12 show the dynamic responses of the drive point under forces in transverse and axial directions respectively firstly it can be seen that two groups of fem results agree well with each other as the mesh is further refined the curve changes slightly and only differences exist at the peak positions thus the fem results can be considered as convergent and credible excellent agreement of the present results and fem results can be also observed in the figures and meanwhile the smaller the mesh size the closer the fem results are to the present results which can confirm the accuracy and reliability of the method in predicting the dynamic responses of complex coupled shell structure it is note that the element number in the fem model reach to 52832 as the mesh size is 0 02 m but the element number is only 139 in the dynamic stiffness formulation obviously number of degrees of freedom of the present method is far smaller than that of the fem 3 2 2 characteristic analysis normally bulkheads are distributed in the inner side of the shell structure which can separate the inner space and increase the structural stability in the following example the inner radii of the 5th 15th 25th 35th 45th and 55th rib stiffeners are set as minimal so as to model the bulkhead fig 13 shows the frequency response curves of displaces in different directions under excitation in different directions it is seen that the many resonance peaks have disappeared especially in the lower frequency range after the adding of the bulkheads vibration amplitude in the trough declines obviously when subjected to axial force vibration amplitudes at the resonant peaks are also declined after 60 hz the resonant peaks are getting denser and at this point the vibration amplitude gradually approaches that of the case without bulkheads the above results show that the uniform distribution of bulkheads in the ribbed shell combination can effectively strengthen the overall stiffness of the structure and the vibration of the shell part is effectively restrained but the effect is gradually weakened in the high frequency range for an underwater vehicle excitation from stern part is important excitation source which is genrally passed from the conical shell to the whole structure it is clear that the subconical shell will directly influence the dynamic characteristic of the hull structure so the effects of geometrical features of the subconical shell on the dyanmic characteristics of coupled shell structure are investigated fig 14 shows the viration of dyanmic responses of the coupled shell with different small end radius r 0 of the subconical shell where the values of the r 0 is set as 0 5 m 1 m and 1 5 m respectively it can be seen from the figures that the resonance peak is relatively sparse when r 0 0 5 m and the overall vibration amplitude is the lowest due to the wide range of troughs as the value of r 0 increases the number of resonant peak in the curves increases significantly comparing the corresponding curves of r 0 1 m and r 0 1 5 m it is found that the resonance peak in the low frequency range is significantly shifted to the low frequency direction in the whole analysis frequency band the larger the value of r 0 is the higher the response amplitude is especially for the transverse displacement it is concluded that the closer the excitation point is to the central position of the shell the less the natural frequency of vibration is aroused and the smaller the vibration response fig 15 shows the dynamic responses of the coupled shell structure with different thicknesses of the subconical shell where the h c are set as 0 04 m 0 035 m and 0 03 m by comparing the curves it is found that the influence rules of the variation of conical shell thickness on the vibration responses caused by the axial and transverse excitations are relatively consistent with the increase of the thickness many resonant peaks shift to the low frequency direction it is of interest to note that transverse displacement is decreased as the thickness increases while the axial displacement is almost unaffected this is mainly because the vibration amplitude of the axial displacement is much lower which is less affected by the shell thickness observing the curves in fig 15 b and d it is also noted that many antiresonances appears in the high frequency range it is summarized that increase in thickness of the subconical shell can significantly suppress the vibration 4 experimental validation in this section an experimental model as shown in fig 16 is set up to verify the effectivenes of the present mehtod and investigate the vibarion behaviour of the coupled shell structure from an experimental point of view the middle cylindrical shell is made of seamless steel tube within 9 ribs rib stiffeners distributed evenly in its inner side the two ends of the shell are connected with the conical shell respectively all materials are made of steel 20 geometric property of the model are given as following cylindrical shell length 2 m thickness 0 0085 m and diameter 0 6 m small end radius of the cone 0 15 m length 0 48 m semi vertex angle 18 thickness 0 0055 m inner radius of the stiffener 0 266 m the thickness 0 0074 m width 0 03 m the experimental model is lifted by a crane through a spring the natural frequency of the spring mass system formed by the spring and the model is about 1 6 hz which is suitble for simulating the free boundary conditions in view of the large size of the test model the couple shell is divided into 16 and 24 parts in the circumferential and axial direction respectively and up to 384 measuring points are employed the vibration informations of 8 measuring points are picked up by a single knock and the vibration information of all measuring points is obtained by 48 groups of tests comparison between experimental and analytical results for the first 10 orders of natural frequencies are illustrated in table 3 it is observed that the present results agree well with the experimental results and the largest relative error is no more than 4 08 because of the weak acoustic structure coupling effect is overlooked in present calculation compared with practical test in air frequencies obtained by experiment are slightly large than the theoretical results fig 17 shows several mode shapes obtained both by theoretical and experimental models due to various influences in the testing process and the limited number of measuring points the mode shapes obtained by test are lacking in smooth and uniform but the overall mode shapes given by the two forecasting methods are still highly consistent which not only indicate the effectiveness of the modal shapes but also verify the corresponding relationship between the test results and theoretical results given in table 3 next the forced vibration test is implemented and the distribution of excitation points and measuring points are shown in fig 18 transverse displacement responses at point b obtained from the experimental and theoretical model are given in fig 19 it is seen that two groups of response curves coincide well with each other some resonant peaks are slightly deviated which has been reflected in modal experiments the reason may be attributed to the material uniformity and machining accuracy of the test model are different from the ideal model to some extent and the free boundary conditions in the test is also different from the ideal state meanwhile the high frequency response is more sensitive to the above differences so the deviation in the curves gradually increases in the high frequency range the amplitude difference of the peak values is obvious which is mainly because the structural damping value is fixed in the theoretical model and it is difficult to keep consistent with the structural damping of the experimental model next vibration responses at different measuring points subjected to uniform excitation force is studied as shown in fig 20 dynamic responses of points c and d given for example it can be seen that the resonant peaks in the curves are one to one correspondence but the peak values are obviously different and the trends of axial vibration and transverse vibration are also different for the two points taking the axis vibration for example in fig 20 a peak values of modes 3 and 10 for point d are large rather peak values of modes 5 and 8 for point c are large however the above comparison results are quite the opposite for the transverse vibration in fig 20 b for illustrative purpose some selected modal shapes are also depicted in fig 20 b it is found that the point c is just located at the node position of the modal shape so the resonance peak disappears it is the same issue for mode 5 and mode 8 as for the mode 3 and mode 10 point c is located at the maximum of the modal shapes so the amplitude of acceleration at point c is slightly higher than point d the above analysis shows that the node has a direct influence on the frequency response in addition the characteristics of axial vibration and transverse vibration of the shell are obviously different which should be analyzed separately if necessary 5 conclusion a dynamic stiffness formulation is developed to analyze the vibration behavior of shell combinations that consist of conical cylindrical shells and annular plates each type of substructure in the combination is regarded as an individual dynamic stiffness element that is formulated by the dynamic stiffness method all the general solutions are exactly derived based on the governing equations of the substructures which guarantees the high accuracy and convergence of the present solution relationship between the forces and displacements on the boundary lines is constructed to formulate the frequency dependent dynamic stiffness matrix the entire dynamic stiffness matrix for the shell combination can be assembled according to the interface continuity between the substructures excellent accuracy and reliability of the dynamic stiffness formulation have been validated by comparing with results obtained by fem and experiment base on the formulation effects of geometric parameters of sub conical shell and bulkhead on the vibration characteristics are investigated which is believed to have useful information for vibration optimization design of this kind of shell combination

20585,in this paper the dynamic stiffness method dsm is presented to investigate the vibration characterizes of coupled conical ribbed cylindrical conical shell structure with general boundary condition rib stiffeners are evenly distributed in the inner side of the cylindrical shell firstly the coupled structure is divided into several components i e conical and cylindrical shells annular plate according to the geometric properties and coupling boundary conditions the displacement fields of the components are derived from the governing equations exactly then the dynamic stiffness matrix is formulated based on the relationship between the displacements and forces on the boundaries of the components the global dynamic stiffness matrix of the coupled structure is assembled in a similar way as used in the finite element method fem in addition the experimental model of conical ribbed cylindrical conical shell structure is built and vibration test is conducted the accuracy and stability of the present method are validated by comparing the present results with the results obtained by fem and experimental test several numerical examples are conducted to understand the effects of geometric parameters on the dynamic behaviors of the coupled structure which can offer positive guides for acoustic design of the combined shell structure keywords dynamic stiffness formulation coupled shell structure dynamic behavior stiffened shell vibration analysis 1 introduction shells of revolution are very common foundation structures in practical engineering applications by virtue of their excellent mechanical properties for example the pressure hull of submarine and the fuselage of aircraft are generally constituted of coupled shell structures impact and shock from mechanical equipment are always inevitably which may result in undesired vibration and fatigue phenomenon therefore it is of high interest and importance to evaluate and analyze the dynamic characteristics of the shell structures thoroughly in initial design stages the main purpose of the present paper is to develop an accurate and efficient dynamic modeling method for coupled shell structure with general boundary condition in the last century donnell flügge reissner and other scholars have developed different thin shell theories based on different simplified assumptions of strain displacement equations which have greatly promoted the development of thin shell theory those research achievements of thin shell theories at that time were documented thoroughly by leissa leissa 1973 nevertheless the theoretical basis only provides the stress strain relationships and equations of motion of the shell structures how to obtain exact solutions of the vibration problems have become the subject of many researchers for a long period of time in recent decades various numerical and analytical methods have emerged for example differential quadrature method bert and malik 1996 lam et al 2002 shu 1996 transfer matrix method irie et al 1982 1983 tottenham and shimizu 1972 energy based method chen et al 2013 jin et al 2014 lee and kwak 2015 li et al 2018 sun et al 2018 finite element method guo et al 2002 luah and fan 1989 and so forth however most of the present modeling methods are focused on the vibration problem of an individual shell such as cylindrical conical or spherical shells less studies on vibration of coupled shell structures are reported for the reasons of structural discontinuity and difference of physical coordinate systems in general coupled shell structures can be classified into two groups according to their properties one is rib stiffened shell and another is combination of different types of shells the stiffening ribs are generally treated by averaging their mass and stiffness over the surface of the shell or regarding as discrete members in the former case stiffened shell can be equivalent to an orthotropic shell where the stiffening ribs are distributed evenly and closely along the axial direction of the shell the equivalent technique basdekas and chi 1971 caresta and kessissoglou 2009 pan et al 2008 is simple but has high request for the number and distribution of the stiffening ribs in addition the results are not accurate enough in high frequency range when the wavelength of vibration is smaller than the space between those ribs thus the stiffening ribs are also regarded as discrete components to improve calculation accuracy in this case the distribution geometry material of the stiffening ribs can be assigned discretionarily curved beam element is most commonly used to simulate the discrete stiffening rib jafari and bagheri 2006 qu et al 2013a talebitooti et al 2010 jafari and bagheri jafari and bagheri 2006 investigated vibration behaviors of the non uniform rib stiffened cylindrical shell based on the ritz method taking into consideration of the stretching bending and wrapping motions the kinetic energy of the stiffening rib was developed wang et al 2015 derived the acting forces and moment from the stiffener based on the timoshenko beam theory and developed the dynamic model of rib stiffened conical shell via the relation between the displacements of the stiffener and neutral surface displacements of the shell component tounsi et al 2014 regarded the ribbed cylindrical shell as a stepped shell with variable thickness and the ribbed part was simulated with a thickened shell component of different middle surface but for large shell structure like ship hull the size of the rib is generally large and the cross section is usually flat under the circumstances the beam element or shell element cannot represent the local mode of the rib properly a few researchers started to deal with vibration problems of stiffened shell by describing the stiffened ribs using the equations of annular plate with different approximate analytical methods wei et al 2013 xie et al 2015 y et al 2016 for complex shell combinations like the hull of submarine and aircraft the stiffened shell is just a part of the whole structure and they also typically contain different kinds of shells of revolution after an extensive literature it is found that a large amount of research has studied the dynamic and vibration characteristics of combined shells of revolution stanley and ganesan stanley and ganesan 1996 proposed an semi analytical finite element method for vibration analysis of conical shell and obtained the vibration analysis models of cylindrical shell and circular plates by setting the semi vertex angles as 0 and 90 then the global equations of the shell plate combination are obtained by the assembly procedure used in the fem using the similar formulation efraim and eisenberger efraim and eisenberger 2006 established the analysis model of conical shell structure using the power series method firstly then studied the vibration behaviors of different coupled shell structures huang and soedel huang and soedel 1993 proposed a receptance method to study the modal characteristics of a cylindrical shell joined to a annular plate with arbitrary axial position wang et al 2004 investigated the power flow characteristics of cylindrical shell rectangular plate coupled system irie et al 1984 used the transfer matrix method for free vibration analysis of the conical cylindrical shell combinations in the formulation the displacement coordination relation at the coupling boundaries can be effectively established by the displacement transfer point matrix which shows the superiority of the transfer matrix method in the analysis of continuous coupled structures free vibration analysis of conical shell with annular end plate is presented by liang and chen liang and chen 2006 based on the transfer matrix method the transfer matrix is solved by using the recursive formula method which greatly improved the computational accuracy compared with the commonly used runge kutta gill method combining with the idea of precise integration method zhong 2004 wang and guo 2016 developed a precise transfer matrix method to investigate the vibration response of stiffened combined conical cylindrical spherical shell bagheri et al 2018 conducted free vibration response of joined conical cylindrical conical shell by the generalized differential quadrature method based on the first order shear deformation shell theory as well as the donnell thin shell theory ma et al 2014 2017 presented an improved fourier ritz method for free and forced vibration of coupled conical cylindrical shells and annular plate cylindrical shell combinations the boundary and coupling conditions are implemented by the penalty function method which may result in ill conditioned system and redundant derivation to solve the above problem su and jin su and jin 2016 proposed a fourier spectral element method for model analysis of conical cylindrical spherical shells by introducing the boundary node information into the admissible function where the coupling boundary energy functional can be omitted and the mass matrix and stiffness matrix of the coupled shell can be obtained directly by using assembly procedure similar to the finite element method combining the thin shell theory and multilevel partition technique qu and his couthers qu et al 2013b wu et al 2013 developed a semi analytical theoretical model of stiffened shell combinations based on the modified variational method caresta and kessissoglou 2010 employed the wave solution and power series solution for vibration analysis of calendrical shell and conical shell respectively the continuity and equilibrium conditions at the coupling boundaries conical shell and cylindrical shell are used to build the final governing equation of the isotropic coupled cylindrical conical shells chen and her couthers chen et al 2015 xie et al 2019 xie and chen 2018 developed the wave based models for various kinds of shell of combinations it is worth noting that most of the literature referred above have been devoted to theoretical modeling for vibration analysis of shell of combinations however only few research focused on experimental investigation pellicano pellicano 2007 built an experimental set up to verify the frequency damping and mode shape of the cylindrical shell modal test of cylindrical spherical shell is performed by lee et al 2002 to verify the reliability of the analytical solution meyer et al 2017 conducted experiments to investigate the effect of non axisymmetric internal frame on the vibroacoustic behavior of stiffened cylindrical shell vibro acoustic experiments of cylindrical shell immersed in ice covered water are carried out by wang et al 2019 and the influence of immersion depth ice thickness density temperature on the sound radiation and vibration properties are investigated from the literature review experiment results on complex coupled shell structures are very rare in recent years the dynamic stiffness method is well developed for free and forced vibration predictions of shell and plate structures the dynamic stiffness method can be regarded as a semi analytical and semi numerical method which has distinct advantages in computational efficiency and convergence for complex shell of combinations it is only needed to divide the whole structure into several subdomains instead of dividing the structure into a large number of elements like in the element based methods initially the research focused on the formulation of the dynamic stiffness method for vibration problems of beam and plate structures banerjee and ananthapuvirajah 2019a b liu and banerjee 2016 nefovska danilovic and petronijevic 2015 were widely reported recently the dynamic stiffness method started to be used for vibration modeling cylindrical shell kolarević and nefovska danilovic 2020 kolarević et al 2016 but to the authors knowledge there is no public report on vibration modeling of complex shell combinations based on the dynamic stiffness formulation in this paper the dynamic stiffness formulation is presented for vibration analysis of conical ribbed cylindrical conical shell besides experiment model is designed to verified the theoretical model stiffened ribs are assumed to be uniformly distributed in the cylindrical shell domain which are dispersed into separate units and described by equations of annular plate in the formulation regardless of boundary conditions the displacement fields of the cylindrical shell conical shell and annular plate are expressed as exponential functions power series functions and bessel functions respectively the dynamic stiffness matrixes of the components are formulated based on the relationship between the displacements and forces of the boundary ends based on the boundary continuity condition the global dynamic stiffness matrix of the coupled structure can be obtained by adopting the matrix assembly technique both free and forced vibration analysis of the coupled shell are performed numerical and experimental examples are implemented to verify the present method subsequently paramedic study is performed to investigate the dynamic characteristics of the coupled conical ribbed cylindrical conical shell structure 2 theoretical formulations 2 1 description of the model referring to fig 1 the sketch of conical ribbed cylindrical conical shell structure is depicted where the ribbed cylindrical shell is combined with two conical shells rib stiffeners and bulkheads are distributed inside of the cylindrical shell along the axial direction uniformly the cross sectional area of the stiffener is d h p thicknesses of the conical shell cylindrical shell and annular plate are assumed to be of uniform values and donated as h c h s and h p the semi vertex angle of the conical shell is donated as α and the radii at the large and small ends are r 0 and r 1 l c and l s are the lengths of the conical and cylindrical shells the coupled shell can be decomposed into several conical shells cylindrical shells and annular plates along the coupling boundaries among the components fig 2 shows the local coordinate systems of the three components and the stress diagram at the boundary ends the conical shell is described in the coordinate system x c θ r where x c θ and r are coordinate axes along the generatrix circumferential and normal directions displacements of the conical shell along the axes are defined as u c v c and w c and ψ c w c x c is slope the corresponding forces are donated as n x c v x c n x θ c and m x c the cylindrical shell is described in the coordinate system x s θ r where x s θ and r are coordinate axes along the generatrix circumferential and normal directions displacements of the cylindrical shell along the axes are defined as u s v s and w s and ψ s w s x s is slope the corresponding forces are donated as n x s n x θ s q x s and m x s the coordinate system r θ x p is considered for the annular plate in which r θ and x p donate radial circumferential and axial directions respectively displacements of the annular plate can be defined as u p v p and w p in r θ and x p directions and ψ p w p r is the slope the stiffeners and bulkheads are simulated by equation of annular plate thus the forces with respect to the axes are defined as n r p n θ p n x p and m p respectively displacement fields of the shell and plate components in the θ and r i c s p directions can be expressed as 1 u i u i x i θ e j ω t 2 v i v i x i θ e j ω t 3 w i w i x i θ e j ω t in which j 1 ω is the circular frequency for a shell or plate of revolution the displacement components are distributed periodically in circumferential directions thus the general solutions of the cylindrical shell conical shell and annular plate can be further expressed as following infinite series based on the technique of separation of variables 4 u i x i θ t u i x i θ e i ω t m 0 u i m x i cos m θ e i ω t 5 v i x i θ t v i x i θ e i ω t m 0 v i m x i sin m θ e i ω t 6 w i x i θ t w i x i θ e i ω t m 0 w i m x i cos m θ e i ω t where m is integer which indicates the wave numbers in circumferential direction 2 2 formulation of the dynamic stiffness matrix in the formulation the materials properties of those components are assumed to be consistent which are donated as young s modulus e poisson ratio υ and mass density ρ meanwhile the thicknesses of the shell and plate components are considered as small enough with respect to the other geometric dimensions and of uniform size therefore the thin shell and plate theories are used in the following modeling process in this section general solutions and dynamic stiffness for the cylindrical shell conical shell and annular plate are formulated in detail 2 2 1 cylindrical shell based on the flügge thin shell theory the governing differential equations of the cylindrical shell can be expressed as leissa 1973 7 l 11 s u s

conical shell 2 2 3 annular plate governing equations of annular plate with consideration of both in plane and transverse vibrations can be expressed as leissa 1973 40 r u p r u p r 1 r v p θ 1 υ 2 r

motion and k b ρ ω 2 h d p 1 4 is wave number of transverse motion fig 5 shows the sketch of displacements and forces at the boundary ends of the annular plate similarly the displacements and forces are given in vector form as 49 q m p i u m p r 1 v m p r 1 u m p r 2 v m p r 2 q m p o w m p r 1 ψ m p r 1 w m p r 2 ψ m p r 2 50 q m p i n r m p r 1 n θ m p r 1 n r m p r 2 n θ m p r 2 q p m o n x m p r 1 m m p r 1 n x m p r 2 m m p r 2 where the superscripts i and o indicate the in plane and out of plane motions of the annular plate structure by extracting the coefficients one can obtain the displacement and force vectors in concise matrix form as 51 q m p i d m p i c m p i q m p o d m p o c m p o 52 q m p i t f m p i c m p i q m p o t f m p o c m p o then the equations of motion can be

respectively the sizes of k m p i and k m p o are both 4 4 the problem of in plane or out of plane vibration can be calculated separately by solving eq 53 or eq 54 but when plate shell coupled structure is encountered both kinds the of vibrations should be involved the above two equations can be further integrated and the whole equation of motion and dynamic stiffness matrix for the annular plate can be expressed as 55 q m p k m p q m p where 56 q m p q m p i r 1 q m p o r 1 q m p i r 2 q m p o r 2 k m k m p i 11 0 k m p i 12 0 0 k m p o 11 0 k m p o 12 k m p i 21 0 k m p i 22 0 0 k m p

boundary conditions the convenience and flexibility of assembly procedure of the dynamic stiffness method contributes to its great applicability in coping with complex couple structure hereinbefore the dynamic stiffness formulations of the three shells and plate components have been presented then assembly procedures based on the displacement compatibility conditions are employed to construct the whole dynamic stiffness matrix for the complex conical ribbed cylindrical conical shell structure but it should be noted that all the three kinds of components are in their own local coordinate thus the displacements of the components should be transformed into a global coordinate system before the assembly procedure then according to the relationship between the local coordinate system and the global coordinate system the spatial transformation matrix is constructed and the stiffness matrix of the subunit component in the local coordinate system is converted into the global coordinate system in the formulation the coordinate system of the cylindrical shell is selected as the global coordinate system for illustrative purpose the relationship of displacements and forces between the coupled boundaries of the shells and plate are show in fig 6 the displacement can be converted from the local coordinate system into the global coordinate system by the transformation matrix t as following 58 x t x g where subscript g represents the global coordinate system the matrix t can be obtained based on the coordination relation between displacement at the coupling boundary from fig 6 the continuity conditions between the cylindrical shell annular plate and conical shell cylindrical shell can be described respectively as following 59 u s w p n x p n x s v s v p n θ p n θ s w s u p n r p q x s ψ s ψ p m p m x s 60 u c u s cos α w s sin α v c v s w c u s sin α w s cos α ψ c ψ s n x c n x s cos α q x s sin α n x θ c n x θ s v x c n x s sin α q x s cos α m x c m x s according to eq 59 and eq 60 61 t p 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 62 t c cos α 0 sin α 0 0 1 0 0 sin α 0 cos α 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 cos α 0 sin α 0 0 1 0 0 sin α 0 cos α 0 0 0 0 1 in which subscripts p and c represent annular plate and conical shell respectively using orthogonal transformation the equations of motion of the annular plate and conical shell in the global coordinate system can be expressed as 63 q p c g k p c g q p c g where k p c g t p c t k p c t p c is dynamic stiffness matrix in global coordinate system once the dynamic stiffness matrixes of the subunits are computed they can be assembled in the global dynamic stiffness matrix for the coupled structure as schematically depicted in fig 7 the entire equation of motion for the coupled structure can be given as 64 q w k w q w where k w q w and q w are the whole dynamic stiffness matrix force vector and displacement vector respectively the natural frequency and dynamic response can be directly obtained by solving eq 64 the assemble technique used here is familiar with that adopted in the fem but the difference is that the present matrix is assembled along the boundary lines rather than the element nodes in the fem a single dynamic stiffness shell or plate element is adequate to calculate any frequency range of dynamic response for an individual component to any desired accuracy therefore low computational efficiency caused by mesh partition in element based method can be avoided in the present method base on the formulation any prescribed boundary conditions ranging from classical elastic boundary conditions mass attachments as well as elastic coupling restraints can be applied directly and accurately for the sake of brevity only the classical boundary condition is considered for example if there are zero elements in displacement vector q m the corresponding row and columns of k m will be condensed for clamped boundaries in is note that the condensation of the dynamic stiffness matrix can further reduce the dimension of the system and improve the computational efficiency when free vibration of the coupled shell structure is considered the vector q w in eq 64 will be assigned as zero firstly then the natural frequencies can be determined by searching the trial value of frequency which will make the determinant of k w be equal zero it can be implemented by iterative interpolation as the natural frequency is determined the corresponding mode shape can be obtained naturally by substituting natural frequency back into eq 64 3 numerical examples and discussion in this part the vibration analysis model is implemented in the matlab software which provides solutions for the coupled shell structures with high accuracy and efficiency convergence and validation of free vibration analysis is firstly implemented in section 3 1 then force vibration analysis is validated and paramedical analysis is carried out in section 3 2 3 1 free vibration numerical examples are carried out to validate the convergence and accuracy of the proposed dynamic stiffness method natural frequencies of conical stiffened cylindrical conical shell in fig 1 under different boundary conditions is calculated the geometric parameters are assumed as r 0 1 m r 1 3 25 m 2 l c 7 28 m α π 10 l s 30 m h 0 04 m d 0 08 m the whole structure is assumed to be of isotropic materials and the material properties are taken as e 210 gpa ρ 7800 kg m 3 υ 0 3 for the coupled shell structure only boundary condition of the conical shell is concerned for brevity only three kind of classical boundary conditions often encountered in practices are used which are defined as clamped edge c u c 0 v c 0 w c 0 ψ c 0 simple supported edge s n x c 0 v c 0 w c 0 m x c 0 free edge f n x c 0 n x θ c 0 v c 0 m x c 0 in the following examples natural frequencies of coupled shell structure with f f c f and c c boundary conditions are calculated the two letter string employed here represents the combinations of boundary condition where the two letters represent the boundary condition of the left and right ends respectively to validate the influence of the rib stiffener on the vibration characteristics of the coupled shell no stiffener is considered in the first model and 59 stiffeners are evenly distributed along the axis of the cylindrical shell in the second model the first 20 natural frequencies of the two models obtained by present method are given in table 1 and table 2 meanwhile solutions obtained by the fem software ansys are also included for reference in the ansys element 63 is employed for both shell and plate structures and two mesh size are employed for comparison i e 0 2 m and 0 1 m it is found that the results of fem are almost unchanged as the mesh size decreases from 0 2 m to 0 1 m which can prove that the fem results are almost convergent and the reference date is reliable at the same time it can be seen from the tables that the present results agree well with those obtained by fem which indicated the present method is sufficiently accurate to solve the free vibration of coupled shell structure with general boundary conditions fig 8 and fig 9 depict the vibration mode shapes of the shell models under different boundary conditions which can help to understand the certain features for the free vibration of the coupled shell structures it can be seen that the circumferential number m of the low order modes is concentrated at 2 and 3 it is note that although the boundary conditions are different some modes and their corresponding frequencies are nearly the same for example the 2ed modes under f f and c c boundary condition as well as the 3rd mode under c f boundary condition the main reason is that the radius of the conical shells at both ends shrink which increases the local stiffness at both ends in those modes the overall structure is dominated by the local vibration of the middle cylindrical shell in this case the influence of boundary is negligible comparing the figures of the corresponding orders in figs 8 and 9 it can be found that the modal shapes corresponding to the same boundary conditions are very similar because there is free boundary end in f f and c f boundary conditions the mode shapes can be divided into two types 1 vibration located in the middle cylinder and vibration located in the free end of the conical shell for the modes of type 1 the stiffened ribs have increased the frequencies but the mode shapes keep unchanged however the mode shapes keep unchanged and frequencies decrease slightly for the modes of type 2 this is due to that the rib stiffeners have no influence on the stiffness of the conical shell and meanwhile increase the mass of the whole structure 3 2 forced vibration 3 2 1 validation the large scale of the shell structure used in present example will lead to high modal density so it is difficult to conduct characteristic analysis from the perspective of free vibration in the following forced vibration will be implemented to investigate the vibration characteristics of conical stiffened cylindrical conical shell the material and geometric properties used in the numerical examples are identical to those in section 3 1 it is assumed that the driving point force f a f e i ω t is located on the left end of the subconical shell which can be referred in fig 10 a complex young s modulus e e 1 j η is introduced in the calculations to represent the damping effect where η 0 005 is the structural damping factor according to the free vibration analysis the circumferential wave numbers corresponding to the modes of the present model in low frequency range are relatively small therefore the truncated number of the circumferential number is selected as 10 the reliability of this method on forced vibration calculation is verified by comparing with the results of finite element method the mesh sizes are set to 0 02 m and 0 01 m respectively in ansys software to verify the convergence of the finite element method fig 11 and fig 12 show the dynamic responses of the drive point under forces in transverse and axial directions respectively firstly it can be seen that two groups of fem results agree well with each other as the mesh is further refined the curve changes slightly and only differences exist at the peak positions thus the fem results can be considered as convergent and credible excellent agreement of the present results and fem results can be also observed in the figures and meanwhile the smaller the mesh size the closer the fem results are to the present results which can confirm the accuracy and reliability of the method in predicting the dynamic responses of complex coupled shell structure it is note that the element number in the fem model reach to 52832 as the mesh size is 0 02 m but the element number is only 139 in the dynamic stiffness formulation obviously number of degrees of freedom of the present method is far smaller than that of the fem 3 2 2 characteristic analysis normally bulkheads are distributed in the inner side of the shell structure which can separate the inner space and increase the structural stability in the following example the inner radii of the 5th 15th 25th 35th 45th and 55th rib stiffeners are set as minimal so as to model the bulkhead fig 13 shows the frequency response curves of displaces in different directions under excitation in different directions it is seen that the many resonance peaks have disappeared especially in the lower frequency range after the adding of the bulkheads vibration amplitude in the trough declines obviously when subjected to axial force vibration amplitudes at the resonant peaks are also declined after 60 hz the resonant peaks are getting denser and at this point the vibration amplitude gradually approaches that of the case without bulkheads the above results show that the uniform distribution of bulkheads in the ribbed shell combination can effectively strengthen the overall stiffness of the structure and the vibration of the shell part is effectively restrained but the effect is gradually weakened in the high frequency range for an underwater vehicle excitation from stern part is important excitation source which is genrally passed from the conical shell to the whole structure it is clear that the subconical shell will directly influence the dynamic characteristic of the hull structure so the effects of geometrical features of the subconical shell on the dyanmic characteristics of coupled shell structure are investigated fig 14 shows the viration of dyanmic responses of the coupled shell with different small end radius r 0 of the subconical shell where the values of the r 0 is set as 0 5 m 1 m and 1 5 m respectively it can be seen from the figures that the resonance peak is relatively sparse when r 0 0 5 m and the overall vibration amplitude is the lowest due to the wide range of troughs as the value of r 0 increases the number of resonant peak in the curves increases significantly comparing the corresponding curves of r 0 1 m and r 0 1 5 m it is found that the resonance peak in the low frequency range is significantly shifted to the low frequency direction in the whole analysis frequency band the larger the value of r 0 is the higher the response amplitude is especially for the transverse displacement it is concluded that the closer the excitation point is to the central position of the shell the less the natural frequency of vibration is aroused and the smaller the vibration response fig 15 shows the dynamic responses of the coupled shell structure with different thicknesses of the subconical shell where the h c are set as 0 04 m 0 035 m and 0 03 m by comparing the curves it is found that the influence rules of the variation of conical shell thickness on the vibration responses caused by the axial and transverse excitations are relatively consistent with the increase of the thickness many resonant peaks shift to the low frequency direction it is of interest to note that transverse displacement is decreased as the thickness increases while the axial displacement is almost unaffected this is mainly because the vibration amplitude of the axial displacement is much lower which is less affected by the shell thickness observing the curves in fig 15 b and d it is also noted that many antiresonances appears in the high frequency range it is summarized that increase in thickness of the subconical shell can significantly suppress the vibration 4 experimental validation in this section an experimental model as shown in fig 16 is set up to verify the effectivenes of the present mehtod and investigate the vibarion behaviour of the coupled shell structure from an experimental point of view the middle cylindrical shell is made of seamless steel tube within 9 ribs rib stiffeners distributed evenly in its inner side the two ends of the shell are connected with the conical shell respectively all materials are made of steel 20 geometric property of the model are given as following cylindrical shell length 2 m thickness 0 0085 m and diameter 0 6 m small end radius of the cone 0 15 m length 0 48 m semi vertex angle 18 thickness 0 0055 m inner radius of the stiffener 0 266 m the thickness 0 0074 m width 0 03 m the experimental model is lifted by a crane through a spring the natural frequency of the spring mass system formed by the spring and the model is about 1 6 hz which is suitble for simulating the free boundary conditions in view of the large size of the test model the couple shell is divided into 16 and 24 parts in the circumferential and axial direction respectively and up to 384 measuring points are employed the vibration informations of 8 measuring points are picked up by a single knock and the vibration information of all measuring points is obtained by 48 groups of tests comparison between experimental and analytical results for the first 10 orders of natural frequencies are illustrated in table 3 it is observed that the present results agree well with the experimental results and the largest relative error is no more than 4 08 because of the weak acoustic structure coupling effect is overlooked in present calculation compared with practical test in air frequencies obtained by experiment are slightly large than the theoretical results fig 17 shows several mode shapes obtained both by theoretical and experimental models due to various influences in the testing process and the limited number of measuring points the mode shapes obtained by test are lacking in smooth and uniform but the overall mode shapes given by the two forecasting methods are still highly consistent which not only indicate the effectiveness of the modal shapes but also verify the corresponding relationship between the test results and theoretical results given in table 3 next the forced vibration test is implemented and the distribution of excitation points and measuring points are shown in fig 18 transverse displacement responses at point b obtained from the experimental and theoretical model are given in fig 19 it is seen that two groups of response curves coincide well with each other some resonant peaks are slightly deviated which has been reflected in modal experiments the reason may be attributed to the material uniformity and machining accuracy of the test model are different from the ideal model to some extent and the free boundary conditions in the test is also different from the ideal state meanwhile the high frequency response is more sensitive to the above differences so the deviation in the curves gradually increases in the high frequency range the amplitude difference of the peak values is obvious which is mainly because the structural damping value is fixed in the theoretical model and it is difficult to keep consistent with the structural damping of the experimental model next vibration responses at different measuring points subjected to uniform excitation force is studied as shown in fig 20 dynamic responses of points c and d given for example it can be seen that the resonant peaks in the curves are one to one correspondence but the peak values are obviously different and the trends of axial vibration and transverse vibration are also different for the two points taking the axis vibration for example in fig 20 a peak values of modes 3 and 10 for point d are large rather peak values of modes 5 and 8 for point c are large however the above comparison results are quite the opposite for the transverse vibration in fig 20 b for illustrative purpose some selected modal shapes are also depicted in fig 20 b it is found that the point c is just located at the node position of the modal shape so the resonance peak disappears it is the same issue for mode 5 and mode 8 as for the mode 3 and mode 10 point c is located at the maximum of the modal shapes so the amplitude of acceleration at point c is slightly higher than point d the above analysis shows that the node has a direct influence on the frequency response in addition the characteristics of axial vibration and transverse vibration of the shell are obviously different which should be analyzed separately if necessary 5 conclusion a dynamic stiffness formulation is developed to analyze the vibration behavior of shell combinations that consist of conical cylindrical shells and annular plates each type of substructure in the combination is regarded as an individual dynamic stiffness element that is formulated by the dynamic stiffness method all the general solutions are exactly derived based on the governing equations of the substructures which guarantees the high accuracy and convergence of the present solution relationship between the forces and displacements on the boundary lines is constructed to formulate the frequency dependent dynamic stiffness matrix the entire dynamic stiffness matrix for the shell combination can be assembled according to the interface continuity between the substructures excellent accuracy and reliability of the dynamic stiffness formulation have been validated by comparing with results obtained by fem and experiment base on the formulation effects of geometric parameters of

20586,tugboats are often called upon to rescue disabled ships on open seas this study represents a fundamental step toward automating the towing mission of disabled vessels it deals with the control of transient planar dynamics for a two ship ensemble connected by a massless cable this is a multibody structure whose components are coupled by non holonomic inequality constraints two control strategies were designed by exploiting the essential temporal scale difference between relative tugboat ship dynamics induced by the constraints and the relatively slow motion of the mass center of the two ship ensemble in the first strategy the leading ship was controlled to maintain a prescribed heading angle and surge speed for the mass center of the two ship ensemble while in the second one the leading vessel was controlled to track prescribed set targets for its desired heading angle and surge speed the first strategy reduces the controller s susceptibility to sharp variations in the towline tension and is suitable for maritime applications involving powered vessels performing cooperative transport of a large floating object the results demonstrated the viability of the control strategies proved that the first strategy is as effective as the second one and showed the robustness of controllers to environmental disturbances keywords multibody system autonomous towing interconnected vessels control towing maneuvers 1 introduction emergency towing vessels etvs and harbor tugs are relied on to rescue wrecked or disabled ships in bad weather on the open seas by towing them to a safe location moreover they are also tasked to intercept disabled marine vessels stabilize their movements and prevent them from going ashore in order to prevent catastrophic environmental disasters uk house of commons transport committee 2011 shigunov and schellin 2015 each such incident would normally involve an etv or a tugboat a disabled marine vessel and a towline a sample data point on the frequency of these incidents has been taken from the 6th report of session 2010 12 hc 948 uk house of commons transport committee 2011 which indicates that etvs alone were involved in towing 70 disabled vessels and 18 stricken vessels off the uk shoreline from 2001 to 2010 given the important and dangerous missions performed by etvs and tugboats under harsh sea states the current work represents a fundamental step toward automating the towing task of these systems it examines different approaches to determine an efficient control strategy for an ensemble of two ships connected by a towline with one of the vessels being wrecked or disabled this challenging problem involves the dynamics and control of an underactuated multi body system subjected to non holonomic inequality constraints fully autonomous marine vessels are advantageous in efficiently operating ships under harsh environmental conditions and serve to eliminate human errors in navigation and control that led to catastrophic incidents in the past bc ferries press release 2006 alderton 2018 due to significantly enhanced computational speed of on board processors and recent advances in control algorithms the research area of robotics and autonomous vehicles has witnessed a steady expansion to include numerous marine applications an excellent literature review on the latest developments in motion control of maritime autonomous surface ships mass is provided in wang et al 2019 it suggests future research challenges in ship dynamic modeling intelligent control algorithms and autonomy the authors have also alluded to the difficulties in experimentally validating advanced control algorithms on actual ships due to safety concerns cost and size of marine vessels autonomous marine surface vessels can be used to minimize the risk to human lives in dangerous operations such as the towing of a submerged fish to automate the influence demining task pereda et al 2010 moreover emergency towing tasks of disabled ships can greatly benefit from the autonomous operation of etvs and tugboats since their missions are mostly performed under severe weather conditions the challenges associated with the autonomous operation of a tugboat during a salvage mission stem from the fact that the marine system being controlled undergoes structural variations during the phase of the mission when the tugboat is heading toward the disabled ship the marine system would simply consist of the tugboat however during the second phase of the mission the tugboat will be connected to the disabled vessel through a towline in order to tow it to a safe location thus the structural dynamics and the control strategy of the marine system would greatly differ in complexity from one phase of the mission to another the current work covers the nonlinear dynamics and control of the marine system during the second phase of the salvage mission the two ship ensemble including the towline must be stabilized and navigated to a safe location by solely relying on the tugboat actuators the challenge in controlling such a two ship ensemble arises from the uncontrollability of the disabled ship whenever the towline seize to be taut thus the controller of the tugboat has two objectives the first one is to restore and maintain the controllability of the disabled ship while the second objective would be to ensure that the overall system tracks a specified trajectory enhanced safety and fault tolerance along with improved operational efficiency and capability can be attained by incorporating multi vessel system in certain maritime applications ianagui and tannuri 2019 proposed a decentralized cooperative control scheme to synchronize the motion of a multi vessel dynamic positioning dp system during towing and station keeping tasks of unactuated floating structures this study focuses on both global positioning and formation control of the multi vessel dp system the consensus theory ren et al 2007 generally used to preserve the formation of the multi unit system has been extended in this work to include a global positioning task this was done by using a virtual leader consisting of a proportional integral pi controller acting on the error between the signal of a reference generator and the actual position of the floating structure the proposed decentralized cooperative control scheme requires all dp vessels to share their estimated positions sage 1968 with their respective neighboring vessels each dp vessel incorporated a proportional derivative integral pid controller to independently correct its own position relative to those of its neighboring vessels including the unactuated floating structure through a consensus algorithm the global positioning task is performed by providing the dp vessels with the desired location of the virtual leader instead of the actual position of the floating structure this scheme was implemented on a set of dp vessels connected to a floating structure through towlines the dynamics of the vessels were represented by linear second order models the effectiveness of the proposed approach in carrying out both formation control and leader following tasks was demonstrated by numerical simulations moratelli et al 2013 implemented a lagrangian based control scheme in a simulated brazilian offloading operation between a floating production storage and offloading fpso vessel and a shuttle tanker for enhanced safety in such maritime applications an integrated control scheme was devised for the multibody system to provide global and relative positioning between the two vessels each vessel is considered to be dynamically positioned and the number of its actuators is assumed to be equal to the number of degrees of freedom representing its planar dynamics the vessels are connected by a towline and required to maintain a tandem configuration the control law was formulated by introducing virtual constraints in the lagrangian control scheme whereby the control vector is defined by the product of the jacobian matrix of the constraint equations and the lagrange multiplier vector two constraint equations were imposed on the fpso to minimize its heading error and to keep its excursion from a desired global position within a specified threshold however three constraint equations were dedicated to maintain the shuttle tanker dynamically positioned with respect to the fpso these equations aimed at preserving a constant distance between the two vessels ensuring a tandem configuration and minimizing the heading error of the shuttle tanker the simulation results demonstrated that the proposed approach yields a better performance than a pd scheme in controlling the two vessel system chen et al 2019 proposed a multi layer distributed control algorithm negenborn and maestre 2014 to enable a triangular configuration of autonomous surface vessels asvs in performing a cooperative transport of a large floating object the proposed multi component control task entails the tracking of a prescribed trajectory by the floating object preserving the formation of the asvs during the maneuver and coordinating the control efforts of the asvs the objective of the highest layer in the proposed control hierarchy is twofold first it determines the overall forces and moment required to keep the floating object on its desired trajectory second it assigns the forces to be generated by each asv so that their collective efforts yield the required forces and moment of the floating object the control actions of each asv were determined by a model predictive controller mpc and applied on the floating object through towlines the formulation considers the planar motion of the system and treats the towlines as catenary cables while accounting for their mass and elasticity simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by moving a large vessel inbound the port of rotterdam other studies have focused on the course stability of a towed ship the dynamic behavior and tension in the towline the control of a fleet formation and the dynamical behavior of various tug towed ship configurations for instance roberts 2005 analyzed the directional stability of a towed body during the launch and recovery stages from a naval ship kijima and varyani 1985 assessed the effects of wind on the course stability of an ensemble of ships consisting of a tugboat towing two vessels in series the motion of the vessels was restricted to the horizontal plane and the velocities of the ships are assumed to be constant the model ignored the effects of wave excitations and used isherwood s formulation isherwood 1973 to account for the wind effects the towlines between the marine vessels were assumed to be massless straight and rigid the results revealed a poor course stability when the wind velocity is comparable to the steady velocity of the system however a stable system behavior was obtained for higher wind velocities moreover the wind direction was found to affect the course stability of the system which was poor for the case of following wind and good for the case of against wind fitriadhy and yasukawa 2011 conducted linear and nonlinear analyses of the turning ability in calm water of a marine system consisting of a tug towing a barge it was found that the relocation of the tow point closer to the tug s center of gravity can significantly decrease the diameter of the turning maneuver furthermore the course stability of a towed ship under uniform and constant wind conditions have been assessed by fitriadhy et al 2013 who considered the motion of the vessel in the horizontal plane the towline was considered to have the shape of a catenary curve modeled by a finite number of 2 d lumped masses that are connected by segments into an entire truss element this lumped mass model was introduced to capture towline characteristics such as its inertia and drag force effects the wind forces and moments applied on the windage areas of both the tug and the towed ship were also determined by incorporating isherwood 1973 formulations the numerical results were generated under different wind velocities and directions linear stability analysis demonstrated that the course stability of unstable barges can be stabilized with increasing speeds of beam to following winds however stable barges can exhibit unstable performance when subjected to head and following winds longer towlines were ineffective in improving the stability characteristics of unstable barges and the converse was true for stable barges these results were confirmed by the authors nonlinear analyses the authors noted that wind induced towing instability can result in the impulsive towline tension accompanied by serious towing accidents such as towline breakage or collisions in these studies one way coupling between the tug boat and the towed ship was considered this was done by assuming that the motion of the tug boat is prescribed the stability characteristics of a barge towing system was examined by lee 1989 a three degrees of freedom nonlinear model was developed for the horizontal planar dynamics of towed barge the formulation ignored the wave excitations along with the effects of wind and sea currents however the elastic behavior of the towline was accounted for in the model by considering an empirical nonlinear spring formulation however the stability of the system was examined based on the linear approach further the nonlinear equations of motion of the barge were analyzed in the vicinity of the equilibrium configurations of the system to validate the linear stability analysis this study examined the effects of length and material properties of the towline on the towing stability the results showed that inappropriate length of the towline can lead to a hazardous operation of the barge towing system and may make it difficult to maintain the towed barge close to its equilibrium configuration furthermore the simulation results revealed that the amplitudes of the barge response obtained by employing a stiff polyester towline tend to be larger than those obtained when a soft nylon towline was used bernitsas and chung 1990 aimed at providing qualitative inferences pertaining to the global dynamic behavior of a ship towed by two tug boats using stability analysis based on both linear analysis near equilibria and global nonlinear analysis of the corresponding autonomous system the equations of motion describe the vessels motion in the horizontal plane three quasi static towline models for synthetic fiber ropes chains and steel cables were employed in this study the formulation also included the effects of wave excitations wind and sea currents the tow force required for towing a containership under emergency conditions while maintaining a certain towing speed was estimated by shigunov and schellin 2015 five containerships of different capacities were considered in this study the formulation was based on the equilibrium equations of the towed vessel in the horizontal plane all computations were carried out under steady state conditions by taking into account hydrodynamic loads associated with a calm water state resistive forces and moments induced by steady currents and constant wind along with the effects of time averaged wave drift the effects of the rudder the propeller and the towline forces were ignored kim et al 2016 developed a computer code to predict the direction and speed of a disabled marine vessel when it is being towed by one or more tugboats and or pushers the code determines the hull resistance in calm water along with added resistances induced by waves wind drifting angle propeller locking and speed loss associated with shallow water effect the purpose of the code is to optimize the size and the number of required tugboats to safely carry out the retrieval mission other studies concentrated on the dynamics of towlines a lumped parameter model of the dynamic behavior of a two part towing cable system during a turning maneuver was presented by gao and wang 2018 moreover kamman and huston 2001 assessed the dynamics of long towlines used in deployment and retrieval tasks in marine applications the towline was modeled as a series of massless links with point masses attached at their extremities the links were assumed to be rigid except for those located near the tow point which were considered to be extensible a scheme to efficiently assess the seakeeping performance of surface marine vessels in close proximity towing was devised by okan 2002 such a scheme can be useful in selecting parameters that would lead to motion minimization of the towed system the formulation focused on the heave and pitch motions subjected to regular waves a sea state degradation factor was introduced to characterize the expected penalty on seakeeping performance of the system moreover there are numerous publications dealing with the navigation and control of a fleet of marine surface vessels arrichiello et al 2006 pereda et al 2011 these studies are driven by the fact that certain tasks may not be achievable by a single ship or can be best accomplished by using a multi vessel system arrichiello et al 2006 implemented a null space based nsb behavioral control scheme to guide a fleet of marine surface vessels in complex environments while performing simultaneous tasks such as obstacle avoidance and maintaining a certain fleet formation these tasks have to be achieved over the entire speed envelope of the fleet which involves fully actuated configurations at low speeds and under actuated configurations at high speeds note that all vessels in the fleet are active and none of them are considered to be disabled johansen et al 2003 considered a maneuvering task of a single towed body by a tugboat a maneuvering controller was developed to force the towed body to follow a desired path with a prescribed speed a lumped mass model of the system was used it was suggested that local control actuation forces applied to the towed body can alleviate the controller bandwidth limitations on the towing ship hajieghrary et al 2018 tackled the cooperative transport problem involving multiple autonomous surface vehicles asvs towing a single buoyant load all asvs are connected through cables to the same point on the buoyant load the main goal of the proposed cooperative control scheme was to ensure that the load tracks a reference trajectory this was done by making the asvs follow parallel trajectories to the reference one moreover the control signals aimed at maintaining the cables between the asvs and the buoyant load taut this study required all towlines to be taut in the initial system s configuration otherwise the asvs may not be able to move the load along its reference trajectory in their future efforts the authors would extend their work to address hard constraints on the control variables and to enable the system in recovering from loss in the tension forces of the towlines in the current study an ensemble of two ships connected by a towline with one of the vessels being disabled is considered three degrees of freedom nonlinear models were developed for the tugboat and the towed ship to describe their motions in the horizontal plane the formulation accounts for the effects of wave excitations wind and sea current fluid drag forces and moments the non holonomic constraint of the system has been effectively eliminated by modeling the towline using a specific potential energy function of the distance between the cable s extremities d the corresponding potential well is very shallow when d is smaller than the original length of the cable d 0 however when d becomes slightly greater than d 0 the potential energy experiences a sharp spike resembling that of a tensile deformations of the cable furthermore the control schemes have been designed by exploiting the essential temporal scale difference between the relative tugboat ship dynamics induced by the constraints and the relatively slow motion of the mass center of the two ship ensemble two control strategies have been devised in this work in the first one the towing leading vessel is controlled with the intent to maintain a prescribed heading angle and surge speed for the mass center of the two ship ensemble while in the second one the leading vessel was controlled to track prescribed set targets for its desired heading angle and surge speed the rationale for introducing the first control strategy is to reduce the controller s susceptibility to sharp variations in the towline tension force note that the dynamics of the leading ship are directly and adversely impacted by large spikes in the cable tension normally occurring during transient periods if the focus of the controller is on the dynamic behavior of the leading ship as is the case in the second control strategy then the cable force becomes an external disturbance applied on the controlled vessel and the control action must counteract its effect this will have a tendency to induce undesirable fluctuations in the closed loop response of the two ship ensemble a plausible approach for dealing with such an undesirable effect would be to control the leading ship in such a way that the mass center of the two ship ensemble tracks prescribed heading angle and surge speed when the control focus is shifted to the dynamic behavior of the mass center then the cable force becomes an internal force in the two ship ensemble with a negligible effect on the dynamics of the mass center of the system such a control strategy tends to isolate the effects of spikes in the cable force from the smooth translational motion of the mass center therefore the proposed control strategies would yield greatly differing control commands that have to be executed nonetheless by the same actuators of the leading ship the manuscript is organized as follows the dynamic model for the two ship ensemble is derived in the next section the proposed two control strategies are formulated in section 3 the simulation results illustrated by a set of figures followed by discussions in section 4 finally the work is briefly summarized and the main conclusions are withdrawn 2 two body problem formulation for a surface ship towing configuration 2 1 basic assumptions and equations of motion let us consider a two ship ensemble consisting of a tug boat of mass m 1 and a disabled ship or barge of mass m 2 the two ships are considered to be connected by a massless cable as depicted in fig 1 the planar dynamics of the marine vessels are formulated with respect to the inertial reference frame x y z along with its associated orthogonal basis i j k the mass center of the two ship ensemble is denoted by c and its position vector is given by 1 r 1 m 1 m 2 m 1 r 1 m 2 r 2 x i y j the relative position vector of the tug boat mass center with respect to that of the disabled boat is 2 r r 1 r 2 x i y j where 3a r 1 r m 2 m 1 m 2 r x 1 i y 1 j x m 2 m 1 m 2 x i y m 2 m 1 m 2 y j 3b r 2 r m 1 m 1 m 2 r x 2 i y 2 j x m 1 m 1 m 2 x i y m 1 m 1 m 2 y j since the focus is on the dynamics of the system in the horizontal plane then the angular displacement vectors of both the tugboat and the disabled ship are given by ψ 1 ψ 1 k and ψ 2 ψ 2 k respectively the total kinetic energy of the system can be written as 4 t 1 2 m 1 r 1 r 1 1 2 m 2 r 2 r 2 1 2 ω t j ω 1 2 m 1 m 2 x 2 y 2 m 1 m 2 2 m 1 m 2 x 2 y 2 1 2 j 1 ψ 1 2 1 2 j 2 ψ 2 2 where ω t ψ 1 ψ 2 and j j 1 0 0 j 2 the dynamics of the ships are subjected to unilateral non holonomic inequality constraints stemming from the limits imposed on the distance between the points on the marine vessels where the cable extremities are attached this distance can be determined as follows 5 d x a 2 cos ψ 2 b 1 cos ψ 1 2 y a 2 sin ψ 2 b 1 sin ψ 1 2 for an inextensible cable d t must satisfy the following inequality constraint 6 d t d 0 the equality holds in eq 6 whenever the cable is taut which may produce a large spike in the cable force that would directly impact the dynamic behavior of the ships moreover the following unilateral constraint equation is imposed to prevent the ships from colliding 7 d min d t one of the control objectives would be to ensure that the above inequality constraint is always satisfied moratelli et al 2013 used lagrange multipliers to handle virtual holonomic constraints that were artificially introduced to control the relative positions between neighboring vessels in a multibody system the lagrange multipliers approach can certainly be applied in the current work to handle the non holonomic inequality constraints required to cover the cable slack and cable taut configurations however such a method would significantly increase the complexity of the formulations therefore an alternate approach was implemented in the current study to describe the physical response of the cable which develops in spatio temporal scales of different order of magnitude in comparison to typical ship motions from the cable dynamics the tensile cable force has the most significant effect on the dynamical behavior of the connected vessels thus a phenomenological model for generating the tensile force was incorporated herein in lieu of a detailed cable model the current study uses a specific potential energy function describing a shallow potential well when the cable is not taut while increasing exponentially as the cable is stretched beyond its original length d 0 such a function emulates the strain energy stored in a cable under tension the potential energy with such properties can be represented in multiple ways in the current work it is given by the following phenomenological function 8 u d k a λ a 2 exp λ a d d 0 k b λ b 2 exp λ b d d min where the parameters λ a and λ b characterize the sharpness of the potential well near d t d 0 and d t d min respectively the cable restoring force representing the only interaction between the active and passive vessels is given by 9 u d k a λ a exp λ a d d 0 k b λ b exp λ b d d min where the parameters k a and k b are the linear stiffness of the restoring force near d t d 0 and d t d min respectively the lagrangian of the entire system can be determined from eqs 4 and 8 as follows 10 l t u by defining the vector of the generalized coordinates to be q t x y x y ψ 1 ψ 2 then the equations of motion can be obtained from 11 d d t l q i l q i q i i 1 6 where q i is the ith non conservative generalized force note that the equations corresponding to i 1 2 represent the translational dynamics of the mass center of the two ship system the equations associated with i 3 4 yield the relative dynamics between the vessels while those corresponding to i 5 6 describe the rotational yaw motions of the ships the virtual work principle is used to determine the non conservative generalized forces as follows 12 δ w f 1 δ r 1 f 2 δ r 2 m 1 δ ψ 1 m 2 δ ψ 2 f 1 δ r m 2 m 1 m 2 δ r f 2 δ r m 1 m 1 m 2 δ r m 1 δ ψ 1 m 2 δ ψ 2 f 1 f 2 δ r 1 m 1 m 2 m 2 f 1 m 1 f 2 δ r m 1 δ ψ 1 m 2 δ ψ 2 where f 1 f x 1 i f y 1 j m 1 m z 1 k f 2 f x 2 i f y 2 j and m 2 m z 2 k are the resultant forces and moments applied on the tug and disabled boats respectively substitution of eqs 1 3 into eq 12 gives 13 δ w f x 1 f x 2 δ x f y 1 f y 2 δ y m 2 f x 1 m 1 f x 2 m 1 m 2 δ x

to obtain the following final form of the equations of motion 14a m 1 m 2 x f x 1 f x 2 14b m 1 m 2 y f y 1 f y 2 14c m 1 m 2 m 1 m 2 x u d d x a 2 cos ψ 2 b 1 cos ψ 1 m 2 f x 1 m 1 f x 2 m 1 m 2 14d

m z 2 in the current study the external forces and moments applied on both ships are limited to those induced by drag and wave excitations along with the control force and moment on the tugboat these forcing functions are best represented with respect to the local coordinate systems x 1 y 1 z 1 and x 2 y 2 z 2 that are attached to the mass centers of the tug and disabled ships respectively see fig 2 the force and moment components defined with respect to the inertial frame in eq 14 can easily be related to their counterparts f x i f y i and m z i expressed with respect to the body fixed coordinates as follows 15 f x i f x i cos ψ i f y i sin ψ i f y i f x i sin ψ i f y i cos ψ i i 1 2 m z i m z i where f x i f y i and m z i reflect the effects of wave excitations control actions along with the drag forces and moments induced by wind and sea currents in the present study empirical formulations have been adopted to represent the combined effects of propeller thrust drag forces and moments along with wave excitations consequently f x i f y i and m z i are represented as 16a f x i p i cos θ i q 1 i w q x i a 1 2 ρ w a t e r a i f v x i r c v i r c 16b f y i p i sin θ i q 2 i

and θ i are the propeller thrust and angular displacement corresponding to the ith vessel respectively it should be noted that the control actions in this work are restricted to the tugboat consequently p 2 and θ 2 are set to zero throughout this study the forces and moment corresponding to wave excitations q 1 i w q 2 i w and q 3 i w are formulated in subsection 2 2 similarly the drag forces and moment induced by wind q x i a q y i a and q z i a are given in subsection 2 3 the remaining terms in eqs 16a to 16c represent the sea current effects the v x i r c and v y i r c terms are the projections onto the body fixed x i and y i axes of the relative velocity vector of the ith ship with respect to the water free surface at x i y i respectively they can be computed from 17 v x i r

free surface from the ship s longitudinal axis note that both v x i c x i y i and v y i c x i y i are set to zero when the vessels pass through zones free of sea currents 2 2 wave loads different types of wave loads on marine vessels were discussed in recent review by ibrahim 2020 the current formulation used in capturing the effects of wave excitations on the marine vessels is similar to the one used by khaled and chalhoub 2011 it is briefly described here for completeness of the reported work long crested sea waves are assumed in the computation of the wave excitation forces and moment

wave excitation forces the raos were generated from the ratio of the wave excitation force impacting the degree of freedom of the marine vessel over the wave amplitude these transfer functions were obtained numerically using a 3 d potential theory software wamit lee and newman 2004 the reader is referred to khaled and chalhoub 2011 for a detailed description of the wave forcing functions 2 3 wind drag forces and moment the drag forces and yaw moment induced by wind are determined as follows isherwood 1973 fossen 1994 khaled and chalhoub 2011 23a q x i a 1 2 c x i a ρ a i r a i t v i r w 2

provided by isherwood 1973 3 control strategies 3 1 control inputs and targets in the present study the control variables are restricted to the thrust p 1 t and the angular displacement θ 1 t of the tugboat propeller see fig 2 the impact of the control actions are transmitted to the disabled ship through the towline force the challenge in controlling such a two ship ensemble stems from the fact that the disabled ship becomes uncontrollable whenever the cable seize to be taut therefore the controller of the tug has to simultaneously perform two tasks the first one aims at restoring and maintaining the controllability of the system by ensuring that the cable is always taut this task has to be performed without producing large impulsive tension force in the cable that could result in the ships moving towards each other with the possibility of a collision the objective of the second control task is to ensure that the system follows a prescribed heading angle and surge speed two potential strategies for controlling the two ship ensemble have been pursued in the present work in the first control strategy cs 1 the leading vessel is controlled to maintain a prescribed heading angle and surge speed for the mass center of the two ship ensemble while in the second control strategy cs 2 the leading ship is controlled to track prescribed set targets for its desired heading angle and surge speed the rationale for the first control strategy cs 1 stems from the fact that the dynamics of the leading ship are directly and adversely impacted by the large spikes in the cable tension that occur during transient periods if the focus of the controller is on the dynamic behavior of the leading ship as is the case in the second control strategy then the cable force becomes an external disturbance applied on the controlled vessel and the control action must counteract its effect this will have a tendency to induce undesirable oscillations in the closed loop response of the two ship ensemble a plausible approach for dealing with such an undesirable phenomenon would be to control the leading ship so that the mass center of the two ship ensemble maintains desired heading angle and surge speed as is the case in the first control strategy when the control focus is shifted to the dynamic behavior of the mass center then the cable force becomes an internal force in the two ship ensemble and its effect would be minimal on the dynamics of the mass center of the system such a control strategy tends to isolate the effects of spikes in the cable force from the smooth translational motion of the mass center it is important to realize that the center of mass of the two ship ensemble remains controllable even though the towline seizes to be taut and both ships are decoupled focusing the control algorithm on the dynamic response of the mass center of the multi vessel system has a tendency to lessen the effect of the spikes in the towline tension force this will render the controller to be most efficient as confirmed by the results shown in section 4 in the implementation of the first control strategy one would prescribe the desired velocity vector of the mass center v m c d t along with the angle that it forms with the inertial x axis ψ m c d t both v m c d t and ψ m c d t cannot be directly achieved since the mass center is not an actual physical point of the two ship ensemble moreover the control actions are restricted to the leading ship with the controller determining the control actions θ 1 t and p 1 t based on the prescribed surge speed v 1 d t and heading angle ψ 1 d t of the leading ship therefore it is imperative to relate both v m c d t and ψ m c d t to v 1 d t and ψ 1 d t respectively the relation between v m c d t and v 1 d t can easily be deduced from the definition of the mass center as 25 v 1 d t m 1 m 2 m 1 v m c d t m 2 m 1 v 2 t 1 μ v m c d t μ v 2 t where v 2 t is the velocity vector of the disabled ship and μ m 2 m 1 the scalar equations corresponding to eq 25 can be written as 26a x 1 d 1 μ v m c d cos ψ m c d μ x 2 f i l t e r e d 1 μ x m c d μ x 2 f i l t e r e d 26b y 1 d 1 μ v m c d sin ψ m c d μ y 2 f i l t e r e d 1 μ y m c d μ y 2 f i l t e r e d note that the components of v 2 t tend to be noisy and have to be filtered in order to generate a smooth reference path for the leading vessel to reduce the phase lag induced by the filter and to take advantage of the smoothness of both x m c d and y m c d the signals x 2 f i l t e r e d and y 2 f i l t e r e d are determined herein as follows 27a x 2 f i l t e r e d t 0 t g f t τ x 2 τ x m c d τ d τ x m c d t 27b y 2 f i l t e r e d t 0 t g f t τ y 2 τ y m c d τ d τ y m c d t where g f t is the transfer function of a first order low pass filter the substitution of eqs 27a and 27b into eqs 26a and 26b yields 28a x 1 d t x m c d t μ 0 t g f t τ x m c d τ x 2 τ d τ 28b y 1 d t y m c d t μ 0 t g f t τ y m c d τ y 2 τ d τ from which the desired speed and heading angle of the leading ship can easily be obtained from 29a v 1 d x 1 d 2 y 1 d 2 29b tan ψ 1 d y 1 d x 1 d the performance of the two control strategies are then compared to determine the most efficient and viable approach for controlling the two ship ensemble when the control actions are being restricted to the leading ship 3 2 controller description a pid controller was used to control the heading angle of the leading ship as follows 30 θ 1 t k p h e ψ 1 t k d h e ψ 1 t k i h 0 t e ψ 1 τ d τ where e ψ 1 t ψ 1 d t ψ 1 t the propeller thrust control signal of the leading ship p 1 t is formulated based on a weighted average of two control signals namely the control component responsible for keeping the cable taut p 1 c t and the trajectory tracking control signal p 1 t t thus p 1 t is given by 31 p 1 t p 1 c t 1 w t p 1 t t w t where w t is a weighting factor to be discussed later on in this subsection pid controllers were used to determine both p 1 c t and p 1 t t which leads to the following expressions for the control signals 32a p 1 c t k p c e d t k d c e d t k i c 0 t e d τ d τ 32b p 1 t t k p t e v t k d t e v t k i t 0 t e v τ d τ where e d t d 0 d t and e v t v 1 d t v 1 t the terms v 1 d t and v 1 t refer to the desired and actual surge speeds of the leading ship respectively the weighting factor w t in eq 31 has been introduced to ensure a smooth transition from the cable control force p 1 c t to the tracking control signal p 1 t t it is limited to the range 0 1 and assigned a zero value whenever the cable is not taut so that p 1 t is solely defined by the cable control force p 1 c t note that the cable in this study is considered to be extensible and its elongation depends on many factors such as the cruising speed drag forces and moments along with the wave excitation effects in the proposed control strategies the cable must be taut and its length stabilized around a steady state value before w t can be allowed to increase from 0 to 1 stepwise discontinuities in the numerical values of w t were avoided by implementing a smoothing transformation of a heaviside unit step function this was done by employing a second order overdamped linear oscillator as follows 33 w t 1 e ζ ω n t t 0 cosh ω n ζ 2 1 t t 0 ζ ζ 2 1 sinh ω n ζ 2 1 t t 0 u t t 0 where ω n 0 1 and 10 r a d s 1 for increasing and decreasing w t respectively ζ 2 is the damping ratio and u t t 0 is a unit step function delayed by t o seconds the latter represents the settling time for the cable to become taut and its length reaches and remains within a specified threshold from its steady state value i e d t d s s 0 001 m this procedure is repeated every time the distance between the towline extremities becomes shorter than the unstretched cable length 4 simulation results and discussion 4 1 control strategies the simulation results were carried out to demonstrate the viability of the proposed control strategies for the two ship ensemble all simulation results were generated based on the following target heading angle ψ t t and cruising speed v t t 34a v t v t if w 0 v 0 v w 1 e κ t t w v w if w 0 34b ψ t 0 if w 0 π 2 t t w 200 if w 0 ψ t π π if ψ t π where the exponent κ determines the transition rate from v w to the desired steady state value of the surge speed v o equation 34a reveals that the target speed is equated to the actual speed v t of the system whenever the cable is not taut the target speed v t is only specified during the tracking phase of the maneuver and considered to be the surge speed of either the mass center or the leading ship based on the selected control strategy the exponential term provides a smooth transition from the cable control to the tracking control and tends to lessen the demands on the actuators by preventing the control signals from reaching their saturation limits in addition the smoothing process of the desired motion entails the resetting of the target speed whenever the cable becomes in a slack state due to intensive environmental disturbances induced by strong sea currents or any other external source that is powerful enough to cause significant antiphase behavior in the two body system equation 34b specifies the desired heading angle with the condition that the tracking maneuver can only be carried out after the cable is taut by requiring w t 0 the physical constraints of the leading ship actuators are accounted for by imposing the following inequalities on p 1 t and θ 1 t along with their slew rates 35a 0 n p 1 t 2 10 7 n and 10 7 n s 1 p 1 t 10 6 n s 1 35b θ 1 t π 3 r a d and θ 1 t 0 2 r a d s 1 in the first control strategy cs 1 the leading ship is controlled to ensure that the mass center of the two ship ensemble tracks the target motion defined in eqs 34a and 34b however in the second control strategy cs 2 the leading vessel is controlled to accurately track the target surge speed and heading angle specified in eqs 34a and 34b note that the control actions in both control strategies are restricted to the propeller thrust and angular displacement of the leading vessel the performance of the two control strategies are then compared to examine the viability of controlling a multi vessel system through its mass center it should be emphasized that the propeller thrust control signal as defined in eq 31 aims at controlling the surge speed of either the mass center of the two ship ensemble in the first strategy or the leading ship in the second strategy along with the distance between the cable extremities in order to prevent large spikes in the cable tension during transient periods thus an additional objective of the simulations is to demonstrate that the control of the surge speed and the cable tension can be performed in a non contradictory manner according to eq 31 due to different temporal scales of these two processes to generate the simulation results based on the first control strategy cs 1 eqs 34a and 34b were used to define ψ m c d t and v m c d t as follows 36a v m c d t v t t 36b ψ m c d t ψ t t consequently v 1 d t and ψ 1 d t can be determined from eqs 29a and 29b after the substitution of v m c d t and ψ m c d t in eqs 26a and 26b however the implementation of the second control strategy was performed by specifying the following expressions for the desired heading angle ψ 1 d t and the surge speed v 1 d t of the leading ship 37a v 1 d t v t t 37b ψ 1 d t ψ t t the above equations are then used in determining the errors e ψ 1 t and e v t which are needed to evaluate eqs 30 and 32b respectively the tuned values of the control gains in eqs 30 and 32 along with the physical parameters of the system are listed in table 1 it should be pointed out that same values were used for the control gains in both control strategies the numerical simulations involve four different cases aimed at assessing different characteristics of the proposed control strategies the model for the two ship ensemble and the control strategies were coded in matlab simulink and stateflow charts 4 2 case 1 assessment and comparison between the control strategies in this case the performance of the two control strategies are assessed by accounting for wave excitations and considering a cable length of 25 m the simulation results are shown in figs 3 9 note that in figs 5 9 parts a and b refer to the results generated by the first and second control strategies respectively since both control strategies generated similar profiles for d t and w t then one figure is shown for each of these two terms recall that the massless cable was considered to be flexible its elasticity was accounted for by employing a specific potential energy emulating the strain energy stored in a cable under tension see eq 8 fig 3 shows that the cable stretched beyond its original length to settle at 25 6 m during the initial transient phase fig 4 demonstrates that the multi vessel system was initially controlled by the force p 1 c t during the first 90 seconds to ensure a smooth tightening of the cable without inducing large spikes in its tensile force this is illustrated in fig 5a and b in spite of the fact that the cable tension became greater than zero at around t 75 s the control strategies kept the cable controller active until the cable length stabilized at around t 90 s beyond that point w t started to increase gradually from 0 to 1 to yield a smooth transition from the cable controller p 1 c t to the tracking controller p 1 t t the transition phase for w t occurred between t 90 s and t 350 s during this period the resultant control force of the propeller thrust p 1 t was computed according to eq 31 and the cable tension forces reached their steady state values beyond the initial 350 s w t remained 1 for the remainder of the maneuver which is indicative that the two ship ensemble completed the maneuver while behaving like a single rigid body with the cable remaining firmly taut this fact is manifested in both parts of fig 7 where the surge speeds of the leading ship the disabled ship and the mass center of the system are practically all equal for both control strategies the wave excitation effects on both p 1 t cable tension and θ 1 t were not significant to alter the dynamic response of the closed loop systems this is confirmed in the zoomed in windows of fig 5a b 6a and 6b figs 7 and 8 exhibit three distinct phases of the motion the first one occurs during the first 90 s where only p 1 c t is applied and no tracking was performed the second phase entails the tracking of a half circle which takes place from 90 to 560 s the third phase involves a straight line trajectory tracking during the remainder of the maneuver fig 7 demonstrates that both control strategies are capable of accurately tracking their desired surge speeds it should be pointed out that the dynamic response in fig 7a does not exhibit an overshoot due to the cs 1 control strategy because the actual surge speed accurately tracks the desired one the bump in the response during the turning phase of the maneuver stems from the velocity vector formulation in eqs 25 29 that were used in determining the required surge speed of the leading ship that would yield the desired surge speed of the mass center similar tracking characteristics were exhibited for the heading angle in fig 8a and b as expected for the cs 1 control strategy the heading angle of the disabled ship lagged the desired angle specified in eq 36b during the turning phase of the maneuver however this error vanished during the straight line trajectory tracking phase of the maneuver fig 6a and b shows slightly different angular displacements of the propeller between the two control strategies this is due to the different surge speed profiles used by cs 1 and cs 2 see fig 7 fig 9 provides the desired and actual trajectories followed by the two ship ensemble under the proposed control strategies figs 3 9 serve to prove that the mass center control strategy cs 1 is as effective as the leading ship control strategy cs 2 it certainly would have a greater advantage over cs 2 in controlling powered multi vessels during their cooperative transport of a large floating object 4 3 case 2 effects of wave excitations the focus of this case is to assess the effects of wave excitations on the closed loop response of the two ship ensemble figs 3 9 demonstrate that the wide spectrum oscillatory perturbations due to wave loads were not able to produce any destabilizing effects on the closed loop responses of the two ship ensemble that were generated by the proposed control strategies the most pronounced effects of wave excitations seems to appear in the control signals as shown in the zoomed in windows of figs 5 and 6 this can be verified by comparing figs 5a and 6a with figs 10 and 11 which were obtained by ignoring wave excitations and implementing the cs 1 control strategy on the multi vessel system all high frequency oscillations in both p 1 t and the cable tension see zoomed in windows of figs 5a and 6a disappeared in figs 10 and 11 4 4 case 3 effects of cable length and environmental disturbances in this case the effects of both cable length and environmental disturbances on the dynamic response of the two ship ensemble under the cs 1 control actions are examined this was done by assuming a cable length of 100 m and considering that the leading and disabled vessels would individually experience strong sea current disturbances varying in magnitudes and applied at different times the effect of the cable length on the dynamic response of the controlled two ship ensemble was investigated by comparing the results generated using 25 m cable see figs 3 4 and 5a to 8a and 100 m towlines see figs 12 17 the comparison was carried out on the first 940 s of the maneuver the results corresponding to different cable length revealed similar pattern of dynamical behavior of the controlled multi vessel systems next the robustness of the cs 1 control strategy to environmental disturbances induced by sea currents was assessed by requiring the two ship ensemble to cross a zone defined by the interval x f 2 x x f 1 and arbitrary y as a part of its desired trajectory each vessel entering this zone would experience a significant disturbance induced by a sea current the magnitude of the disturbance on the ith vessel was determined by considering the following expressions for v x i c x i y i and v y i c x i y i in eqs 16 19 38 v x i c x i y i 1 2 v i c tanh κ c x i x f 2 tanh κ c x i x f 1 v y i c x i y i 0 and κ c 0 1 where x f 1 and x f 2 are the boundaries of the zone in which the sea current is considered to be present their numerical values were selected to be 4000 m and 4050 m respectively in order to point the sea current velocity vector in the positive x direction thus opposing the ship motion which was headed in the negative x direction in this case v 1 c and v 2 c were chosen to be 17 m s 1 and 8 5 m s 1 respectively note that the disturbances on the ships were different since they depended on the relative velocity vector of the ith vessel with respect to the water free surface in the current study the leading ship entered the sea current zone at around t 947 s when x 1 4000 m and started to experience a disturbance that lasted until t 963 s at which time x 1 4050 m and the ship exited the zone during the same period the disabled vessel was free from any disturbances because it was located outside of the sea current zone under the resistive influence of the disturbance the surge speed of the leading ship started to decrease while the disabled ship somewhat maintained its momentum as a consequence the distance between the two vessels started to decrease while the cs 1 control scheme reacted to the sudden environmental disturbance on the leading ship fig 12 reveals that d t becomes 100 m at t 953 s which is the unstretched length of the cable at that instant the tension in the towline became zero and the two ship ensemble ceased to behave like a single rigid body this resulted in out of phase heading angles of the vessels see fig 17 and the surge speed of the leading ship became smaller than that of the disabled ship see fig 16a and b the slack configuration of the cable caused the control strategy cs 1 to lose its controllability over the disabled ship and allowed the two ship ensemble to behave as two independent vessels to regain the full controllability over the system cs 1 de activated the tracking controller p 1 t t and reactivated the cable controller p 1 c t by resetting w t to zero see fig 13 however d t continued to decrease until it reached 94 3 m at around t 966 s at which time p 1 c t was able to reverse the trend in d t and started to stretch the cable by increasing the distance between the vessels fig 12 reveals that d t reached 100 m at t 993 s at that moment the cable tension became greater than zero see fig 14 and cs 1 regained its controllability over the disabled ship the controlled system continued with this mode of operation until t 1011 s when the cable length stabilized and the smooth transition from p 1 c t to p 1 t t began by gradually increasing the numerical values of w t from zero to one see fig 13 while this transition was taking place the surge speeds of the leading and disabled ships became equal at t 1017 s thus indicating that the two ship ensemble started to once again behave like a single rigid body whose speed was increasing to track the desired surge speed of the mass center see fig 16a and b however at around t 1028 s the disabled ship entered the sea current zone and endured a strong resistive effect of a disturbance that lasted until t 1044 s during that time the leading ship was already outside of the sea current zone and did not experience any disturbance this resulted in a drastic increase in the cable tension which actually aided the two ship ensemble to preserve its single rigid body behavior during a severe transient phase the adverse effect of the disturbance on the disabled vessel was manifested by a temporary large tracking error in the surge speed leading the cs 1 controller to overreact and causing an overshoot in the response see fig 16a and b note that in rejecting the effect of the disturbance on the disabled ship the propeller thrust control signal p 1 t reached its saturation limit for a brief period starting at t 1044 s once the second vessel cleared the sea current zone the control strategy cs 1 was able to entirely recover from the effects of the disturbances by eliminating the tracking error in both the surge speed and the heading angle this is demonstrated in figs 16 and 17 therefore figs 12 17 serve to demonstrate the capability of the cs 1 control strategy in recovering from considerable back to back disturbances on the multi vessel system simulation results pertaining to an interesting case where the two ship ensemble was subjected to a single disturbance applied on the leading ship are shown and discussed in appendix a 4 5 case 4 effects of environmental disturbances due to waves wind and sea currents case 4 investigates the combined effects of waves wind and sea currents on the closed loop response of the two ship ensemble the wave excitations were considered to be always present a large wind zone covering most of the maneuver of the two ship ensemble was introduced the sea current field was considered to be a subset of the wind zone the combined effects of environmental disturbances were applied during a turning phase in the maneuver of the two ship ensemble consequently the angles of attack of waves wind and sea currents were continually varying and the vessels were subjected to considerable disturbances in this case the cable length was selected to be 100 m and the system was controlled by the cs 1 control strategy the sea current effect was accounted for when the vessels pass through a zone defined by the interval y f 2 y y f 1 and arbitrary x see fig 18 the magnitude of the disturbance on the ith vessel was determined by considering the following expressions for v x i c x i y i and v y i c x i y i in eqs 16 19 39 v x i c x i y i 1 2 v i c tanh κ c y i y f 2 tanh κ c y i y f 1 v y i c x i y i 0 and κ c 0 1 where y f 1 and y f 2 are the boundaries of the sea current field their numerical values were selected to be 1930 m and 1700 m respectively in order to apply the environmental disturbances during a turning phase of the maneuver in this case v 1 c and v 2 c were chosen to be 6 m s 1 and 3 m s 1 respectively the wind effect was considered in the zone defined by the interval y y w 100 m and arbitrary x see fig 18 the magnitude of the wind disturbance on the ith vessel was determined by considering the following expression for v w x i y i in eqs 23 and 24 40 v i w x i y i 1 2 v w 1 tanh κ w y i y w and κ w 0 1 where v w and θ w were assigned numerical values of 15 m s 1 and 10 o respectively in the region defined by y w y y f 2 and arbitrary x the environmental disturbances were induced solely by wave excitations and wind effect fig 18 demonstrates a stable closed loop response of the two ship ensemble during a turning phase of the maneuver the wind effect tended to increase the tracking error of the mass center of the system the portion of the curve in fig 19 corresponding to this region spans over a time period from t 1 168 s to t 2 391 s during this period the cable was kept steady at a constant length in the subsequent region bounded by y f 2 y y f 1 and arbitrary x the environmental disturbances were due to wave excitations wind and sea current effects fig 18 reveals a brief deviation from the desired track in this zone however the controller was able to reverse the trend and start converging the system to the desired trajectory in the presence of environmental disturbances this zone corresponds to the time span between t 2 391 s and t 3 460 s in fig 19 which reveals small but controllable fluctuations in the cable length beyond that period fig 19 shows that the cable length smoothly converges to its stretched length prior to sea current disturbances 5 summary and conclusion the planar dynamics of a two ship ensemble consisting of a tug boat and a disabled vessel have been formulated in this work the model considers that the marine vessels are connected by a massless cable the effects of unilateral non holonomic inequality constraints induced by the limits on the distance between the points on the marine vessels where the cable extremities are attached are represented by a specific potential energy function having a shallow potential well when the cable is not taut however this function tends to increase exponentially as the cable is stretched beyond its original length which emulates the strain energy stored in a cable under tension in addition the model incorporates empirical formulations to reflect the combined effects of fluid resistive loads wave excitations and sea current disturbances the control variables in the two ship ensemble are restricted to the propeller thrust and angular displacement of the leading ship the control actions are transmitted to the disabled ship through the cable force two control strategies for the two ship ensemble are proposed in the first strategy cs 1 the leading ship is controlled so that the mass center of the two ship ensemble tracks a desired trajectory while in the second strategy cs 2 the leading vessel is controlled to accurately track a desired trajectory the simulation results demonstrated the viability of the proposed control strategies and revealed that cs 1 can be as effective as cs 2 in controlling the two ship ensemble note that cs 1 would have a greater advantage over cs 2 in controlling powered multi vessel system during their cooperative transport of a large floating object moreover they showed that the wide spectrum oscillatory perturbations due to wave loads were not able to destabilize the closed loop responses of the two ship ensemble that were generated by the proposed control strategies to investigate the effects of the towline length two cases were considered using 25 m and 100 m cable length the results exhibited similar pattern of planar dynamical behavior of the multi vessel system under the cs 1 control strategy however one would expect the cable length to play a more significant and impactful role on the dynamics of the two ship ensemble when heave pitch and roll degrees of freedom are accounted for in the dynamic model of the system the disturbance rejection characteristic of the cs 1 control strategy was examined by considering a case whereby the leading and disabled vessels individually experienced strong sea current disturbances varying in magnitudes and applied at different times the disturbance on the leading ship led to a zero tension in the towline causing the cs 1 control strategy to lose its controllability over the disabled ship and led the two ship ensemble to behave as two independent vessels furthermore the two vessels exhibited out of phase heading angles during this phase of the maneuver however within a short period of time the cs 1 control strategy regained its controllability over the disabled ship stabilized the cable length and forced the two ship ensemble to once again behave like a single rigid body the disturbance on the disabled ship had an opposite effect on the towline it served to drastically increase the cable tension that enhanced the capability of the two ship ensemble to preserve its behavior like a single rigid body under severe transient conditions the main adverse effect of the second disturbance was the temporary large increase in the tracking error of the surge speed which the cs 1 control strategy was able to entirely recover from it this case demonstrated the disturbance rejection characteristic of the cs 1 control strategy which was able to recover from considerable back to back disturbances applied on the multi vessel system an additional case was included to demonstrate the robustness of the cs 1 control strategy to environmental disturbances induced by wave excitations wind and sea current effects the results showed a brief divergence of the mass center of the two ship ensemble from its desired trajectory however the cs 1 control strategy was capable of bringing back the controlled system to its desired trajectory

appendix a subsection 4 4 included simulation results pertaining to the dynamic response of the two ship ensemble controlled by cs 1 and subjected to sea current disturbances that were applied on the leading and disabled ships at different times the same case is considered in this section with the exception that the sea current disturbance is only applied on the leading ship this is more of an academic scenario but serves to reveal interesting features of the proposed mass center control strategy similar to case 3 the environmental disturbance is applied on the leading ship when 4050 m x 1 4000 m the dynamic responses of the multi vessel system from case 3 and this one are only expected to differ after t 1028 s when the disturbance was applied on the disabled ship this can be confirmed by comparing figs a 1 to a 4 with their counterparts in figs 14 17 the disturbance resulted in a temporary large tracking error in the surge speed leading the cs 1 controller to overreact and causing an overshoot in the response see fig 16a and b since the disturbance on the disabled ship was not considered in this case then the recovery from the disturbance applied on the leading ship was smooth with no overshoot as can be verified from fig a 3 in addition the disturbance effect on the heading angle was quickly rejected by the controller as illustrated in fig a 4 thus the proposed cs 1 control strategy was capable of yielding a smooth recovery from a single disturbance while it led to slight overshoot in recovering from considerable back to back disturbances fig a 1 propeller thrust

20586,tugboats are often called upon to rescue disabled ships on open seas this study represents a fundamental step toward automating the towing mission of disabled vessels it deals with the control of transient planar dynamics for a two ship ensemble connected by a massless cable this is a multibody structure whose components are coupled by non holonomic inequality constraints two control strategies were designed by exploiting the essential temporal scale difference between relative tugboat ship dynamics induced by the constraints and the relatively slow motion of the mass center of the two ship ensemble in the first strategy the leading ship was controlled to maintain a prescribed heading angle and surge speed for the mass center of the two ship ensemble while in the second one the leading vessel was controlled to track prescribed set targets for its desired heading angle and surge speed the first strategy reduces the controller s susceptibility to sharp variations in the towline tension and is suitable for maritime applications involving powered vessels performing cooperative transport of a large floating object the results demonstrated the viability of the control strategies proved that the first strategy is as effective as the second one and showed the robustness of controllers to environmental disturbances keywords multibody system autonomous towing interconnected vessels control towing maneuvers 1 introduction emergency towing vessels etvs and harbor tugs are relied on to rescue wrecked or disabled ships in bad weather on the open seas by towing them to a safe location moreover they are also tasked to intercept disabled marine vessels stabilize their movements and prevent them from going ashore in order to prevent catastrophic environmental disasters uk house of commons transport committee 2011 shigunov and schellin 2015 each such incident would normally involve an etv or a tugboat a disabled marine vessel and a towline a sample data point on the frequency of these incidents has been taken from the 6th report of session 2010 12 hc 948 uk house of commons transport committee 2011 which indicates that etvs alone were involved in towing 70 disabled vessels and 18 stricken vessels off the uk shoreline from 2001 to 2010 given the important and dangerous missions performed by etvs and tugboats under harsh sea states the current work represents a fundamental step toward automating the towing task of these systems it examines different approaches to determine an efficient control strategy for an ensemble of two ships connected by a towline with one of the vessels being wrecked or disabled this challenging problem involves the dynamics and control of an underactuated multi body system subjected to non holonomic inequality constraints fully autonomous marine vessels are advantageous in efficiently operating ships under harsh environmental conditions and serve to eliminate human errors in navigation and control that led to catastrophic incidents in the past bc ferries press release 2006 alderton 2018 due to significantly enhanced computational speed of on board processors and recent advances in control algorithms the research area of robotics and autonomous vehicles has witnessed a steady expansion to include numerous marine applications an excellent literature review on the latest developments in motion control of maritime autonomous surface ships mass is provided in wang et al 2019 it suggests future research challenges in ship dynamic modeling intelligent control algorithms and autonomy the authors have also alluded to the difficulties in experimentally validating advanced control algorithms on actual ships due to safety concerns cost and size of marine vessels autonomous marine surface vessels can be used to minimize the risk to human lives in dangerous operations such as the towing of a submerged fish to automate the influence demining task pereda et al 2010 moreover emergency towing tasks of disabled ships can greatly benefit from the autonomous operation of etvs and tugboats since their missions are mostly performed under severe weather conditions the challenges associated with the autonomous operation of a tugboat during a salvage mission stem from the fact that the marine system being controlled undergoes structural variations during the phase of the mission when the tugboat is heading toward the disabled ship the marine system would simply consist of the tugboat however during the second phase of the mission the tugboat will be connected to the disabled vessel through a towline in order to tow it to a safe location thus the structural dynamics and the control strategy of the marine system would greatly differ in complexity from one phase of the mission to another the current work covers the nonlinear dynamics and control of the marine system during the second phase of the salvage mission the two ship ensemble including the towline must be stabilized and navigated to a safe location by solely relying on the tugboat actuators the challenge in controlling such a two ship ensemble arises from the uncontrollability of the disabled ship whenever the towline seize to be taut thus the controller of the tugboat has two objectives the first one is to restore and maintain the controllability of the disabled ship while the second objective would be to ensure that the overall system tracks a specified trajectory enhanced safety and fault tolerance along with improved operational efficiency and capability can be attained by incorporating multi vessel system in certain maritime applications ianagui and tannuri 2019 proposed a decentralized cooperative control scheme to synchronize the motion of a multi vessel dynamic positioning dp system during towing and station keeping tasks of unactuated floating structures this study focuses on both global positioning and formation control of the multi vessel dp system the consensus theory ren et al 2007 generally used to preserve the formation of the multi unit system has been extended in this work to include a global positioning task this was done by using a virtual leader consisting of a proportional integral pi controller acting on the error between the signal of a reference generator and the actual position of the floating structure the proposed decentralized cooperative control scheme requires all dp vessels to share their estimated positions sage 1968 with their respective neighboring vessels each dp vessel incorporated a proportional derivative integral pid controller to independently correct its own position relative to those of its neighboring vessels including the unactuated floating structure through a consensus algorithm the global positioning task is performed by providing the dp vessels with the desired location of the virtual leader instead of the actual position of the floating structure this scheme was implemented on a set of dp vessels connected to a floating structure through towlines the dynamics of the vessels were represented by linear second order models the effectiveness of the proposed approach in carrying out both formation control and leader following tasks was demonstrated by numerical simulations moratelli et al 2013 implemented a lagrangian based control scheme in a simulated brazilian offloading operation between a floating production storage and offloading fpso vessel and a shuttle tanker for enhanced safety in such maritime applications an integrated control scheme was devised for the multibody system to provide global and relative positioning between the two vessels each vessel is considered to be dynamically positioned and the number of its actuators is assumed to be equal to the number of degrees of freedom representing its planar dynamics the vessels are connected by a towline and required to maintain a tandem configuration the control law was formulated by introducing virtual constraints in the lagrangian control scheme whereby the control vector is defined by the product of the jacobian matrix of the constraint equations and the lagrange multiplier vector two constraint equations were imposed on the fpso to minimize its heading error and to keep its excursion from a desired global position within a specified threshold however three constraint equations were dedicated to maintain the shuttle tanker dynamically positioned with respect to the fpso these equations aimed at preserving a constant distance between the two vessels ensuring a tandem configuration and minimizing the heading error of the shuttle tanker the simulation results demonstrated that the proposed approach yields a better performance than a pd scheme in controlling the two vessel system chen et al 2019 proposed a multi layer distributed control algorithm negenborn and maestre 2014 to enable a triangular configuration of autonomous surface vessels asvs in performing a cooperative transport of a large floating object the proposed multi component control task entails the tracking of a prescribed trajectory by the floating object preserving the formation of the asvs during the maneuver and coordinating the control efforts of the asvs the objective of the highest layer in the proposed control hierarchy is twofold first it determines the overall forces and moment required to keep the floating object on its desired trajectory second it assigns the forces to be generated by each asv so that their collective efforts yield the required forces and moment of the floating object the control actions of each asv were determined by a model predictive controller mpc and applied on the floating object through towlines the formulation considers the planar motion of the system and treats the towlines as catenary cables while accounting for their mass and elasticity simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by moving a large vessel inbound the port of rotterdam other studies have focused on the course stability of a towed ship the dynamic behavior and tension in the towline the control of a fleet formation and the dynamical behavior of various tug towed ship configurations for instance roberts 2005 analyzed the directional stability of a towed body during the launch and recovery stages from a naval ship kijima and varyani 1985 assessed the effects of wind on the course stability of an ensemble of ships consisting of a tugboat towing two vessels in series the motion of the vessels was restricted to the horizontal plane and the velocities of the ships are assumed to be constant the model ignored the effects of wave excitations and used isherwood s formulation isherwood 1973 to account for the wind effects the towlines between the marine vessels were assumed to be massless straight and rigid the results revealed a poor course stability when the wind velocity is comparable to the steady velocity of the system however a stable system behavior was obtained for higher wind velocities moreover the wind direction was found to affect the course stability of the system which was poor for the case of following wind and good for the case of against wind fitriadhy and yasukawa 2011 conducted linear and nonlinear analyses of the turning ability in calm water of a marine system consisting of a tug towing a barge it was found that the relocation of the tow point closer to the tug s center of gravity can significantly decrease the diameter of the turning maneuver furthermore the course stability of a towed ship under uniform and constant wind conditions have been assessed by fitriadhy et al 2013 who considered the motion of the vessel in the horizontal plane the towline was considered to have the shape of a catenary curve modeled by a finite number of 2 d lumped masses that are connected by segments into an entire truss element this lumped mass model was introduced to capture towline characteristics such as its inertia and drag force effects the wind forces and moments applied on the windage areas of both the tug and the towed ship were also determined by incorporating isherwood 1973 formulations the numerical results were generated under different wind velocities and directions linear stability analysis demonstrated that the course stability of unstable barges can be stabilized with increasing speeds of beam to following winds however stable barges can exhibit unstable performance when subjected to head and following winds longer towlines were ineffective in improving the stability characteristics of unstable barges and the converse was true for stable barges these results were confirmed by the authors nonlinear analyses the authors noted that wind induced towing instability can result in the impulsive towline tension accompanied by serious towing accidents such as towline breakage or collisions in these studies one way coupling between the tug boat and the towed ship was considered this was done by assuming that the motion of the tug boat is prescribed the stability characteristics of a barge towing system was examined by lee 1989 a three degrees of freedom nonlinear model was developed for the horizontal planar dynamics of towed barge the formulation ignored the wave excitations along with the effects of wind and sea currents however the elastic behavior of the towline was accounted for in the model by considering an empirical nonlinear spring formulation however the stability of the system was examined based on the linear approach further the nonlinear equations of motion of the barge were analyzed in the vicinity of the equilibrium configurations of the system to validate the linear stability analysis this study examined the effects of length and material properties of the towline on the towing stability the results showed that inappropriate length of the towline can lead to a hazardous operation of the barge towing system and may make it difficult to maintain the towed barge close to its equilibrium configuration furthermore the simulation results revealed that the amplitudes of the barge response obtained by employing a stiff polyester towline tend to be larger than those obtained when a soft nylon towline was used bernitsas and chung 1990 aimed at providing qualitative inferences pertaining to the global dynamic behavior of a ship towed by two tug boats using stability analysis based on both linear analysis near equilibria and global nonlinear analysis of the corresponding autonomous system the equations of motion describe the vessels motion in the horizontal plane three quasi static towline models for synthetic fiber ropes chains and steel cables were employed in this study the formulation also included the effects of wave excitations wind and sea currents the tow force required for towing a containership under emergency conditions while maintaining a certain towing speed was estimated by shigunov and schellin 2015 five containerships of different capacities were considered in this study the formulation was based on the equilibrium equations of the towed vessel in the horizontal plane all computations were carried out under steady state conditions by taking into account hydrodynamic loads associated with a calm water state resistive forces and moments induced by steady currents and constant wind along with the effects of time averaged wave drift the effects of the rudder the propeller and the towline forces were ignored kim et al 2016 developed a computer code to predict the direction and speed of a disabled marine vessel when it is being towed by one or more tugboats and or pushers the code determines the hull resistance in calm water along with added resistances induced by waves wind drifting angle propeller locking and speed loss associated with shallow water effect the purpose of the code is to optimize the size and the number of required tugboats to safely carry out the retrieval mission other studies concentrated on the dynamics of towlines a lumped parameter model of the dynamic behavior of a two part towing cable system during a turning maneuver was presented by gao and wang 2018 moreover kamman and huston 2001 assessed the dynamics of long towlines used in deployment and retrieval tasks in marine applications the towline was modeled as a series of massless links with point masses attached at their extremities the links were assumed to be rigid except for those located near the tow point which were considered to be extensible a scheme to efficiently assess the seakeeping performance of surface marine vessels in close proximity towing was devised by okan 2002 such a scheme can be useful in selecting parameters that would lead to motion minimization of the towed system the formulation focused on the heave and pitch motions subjected to regular waves a sea state degradation factor was introduced to characterize the expected penalty on seakeeping performance of the system moreover there are numerous publications dealing with the navigation and control of a fleet of marine surface vessels arrichiello et al 2006 pereda et al 2011 these studies are driven by the fact that certain tasks may not be achievable by a single ship or can be best accomplished by using a multi vessel system arrichiello et al 2006 implemented a null space based nsb behavioral control scheme to guide a fleet of marine surface vessels in complex environments while performing simultaneous tasks such as obstacle avoidance and maintaining a certain fleet formation these tasks have to be achieved over the entire speed envelope of the fleet which involves fully actuated configurations at low speeds and under actuated configurations at high speeds note that all vessels in the fleet are active and none of them are considered to be disabled johansen et al 2003 considered a maneuvering task of a single towed body by a tugboat a maneuvering controller was developed to force the towed body to follow a desired path with a prescribed speed a lumped mass model of the system was used it was suggested that local control actuation forces applied to the towed body can alleviate the controller bandwidth limitations on the towing ship hajieghrary et al 2018 tackled the cooperative transport problem involving multiple autonomous surface vehicles asvs towing a single buoyant load all asvs are connected through cables to the same point on the buoyant load the main goal of the proposed cooperative control scheme was to ensure that the load tracks a reference trajectory this was done by making the asvs follow parallel trajectories to the reference one moreover the control signals aimed at maintaining the cables between the asvs and the buoyant load taut this study required all towlines to be taut in the initial system s configuration otherwise the asvs may not be able to move the load along its reference trajectory in their future efforts the authors would extend their work to address hard constraints on the control variables and to enable the system in recovering from loss in the tension forces of the towlines in the current study an ensemble of two ships connected by a towline with one of the vessels being disabled is considered three degrees of freedom nonlinear models were developed for the tugboat and the towed ship to describe their motions in the horizontal plane the formulation accounts for the effects of wave excitations wind and sea current fluid drag forces and moments the non holonomic constraint of the system has been effectively eliminated by modeling the towline using a specific potential energy function of the distance between the cable s extremities d the corresponding potential well is very shallow when d is smaller than the original length of the cable d 0 however when d becomes slightly greater than d 0 the potential energy experiences a sharp spike resembling that of a tensile deformations of the cable furthermore the control schemes have been designed by exploiting the essential temporal scale difference between the relative tugboat ship dynamics induced by the constraints and the relatively slow motion of the mass center of the two ship ensemble two control strategies have been devised in this work in the first one the towing leading vessel is controlled with the intent to maintain a prescribed heading angle and surge speed for the mass center of the two ship ensemble while in the second one the leading vessel was controlled to track prescribed set targets for its desired heading angle and surge speed the rationale for introducing the first control strategy is to reduce the controller s susceptibility to sharp variations in the towline tension force note that the dynamics of the leading ship are directly and adversely impacted by large spikes in the cable tension normally occurring during transient periods if the focus of the controller is on the dynamic behavior of the leading ship as is the case in the second control strategy then the cable force becomes an external disturbance applied on the controlled vessel and the control action must counteract its effect this will have a tendency to induce undesirable fluctuations in the closed loop response of the two ship ensemble a plausible approach for dealing with such an undesirable effect would be to control the leading ship in such a way that the mass center of the two ship ensemble tracks prescribed heading angle and surge speed when the control focus is shifted to the dynamic behavior of the mass center then the cable force becomes an internal force in the two ship ensemble with a negligible effect on the dynamics of the mass center of the system such a control strategy tends to isolate the effects of spikes in the cable force from the smooth translational motion of the mass center therefore the proposed control strategies would yield greatly differing control commands that have to be executed nonetheless by the same actuators of the leading ship the manuscript is organized as follows the dynamic model for the two ship ensemble is derived in the next section the proposed two control strategies are formulated in section 3 the simulation results illustrated by a set of figures followed by discussions in section 4 finally the work is briefly summarized and the main conclusions are withdrawn 2 two body problem formulation for a surface ship towing configuration 2 1 basic assumptions and equations of motion let us consider a two ship ensemble consisting of a tug boat of mass m 1 and a disabled ship or barge of mass m 2 the two ships are considered to be connected by a massless cable as depicted in fig 1 the planar dynamics of the marine vessels are formulated with respect to the inertial reference frame x y z along with its associated orthogonal basis i j k the mass center of the two ship ensemble is denoted by c and its position vector is given by 1 r 1 m 1 m 2 m 1 r 1 m 2 r 2 x i y j the relative position vector of the tug boat mass center with respect to that of the disabled boat is 2 r r 1 r 2 x i y j where 3a r 1 r m 2 m 1 m 2 r x 1 i y 1 j x m 2 m 1 m 2 x i y m 2 m 1 m 2 y j 3b r 2 r m 1 m 1 m 2 r x 2 i y 2 j x m 1 m 1 m 2 x i y m 1 m 1 m 2 y j since the focus is on the dynamics of the system in the horizontal plane then the angular displacement vectors of both the tugboat and the disabled ship are given by ψ 1 ψ 1 k and ψ 2 ψ 2 k respectively the total kinetic energy of the system can be written as 4 t 1 2 m 1 r 1 r 1 1 2 m 2 r 2 r 2 1 2 ω t j ω 1 2 m 1 m 2 x 2 y 2 m 1 m 2 2 m 1 m 2 x 2 y 2 1 2 j 1 ψ 1 2 1 2 j 2 ψ 2 2 where ω t ψ 1 ψ 2 and j j 1 0 0 j 2 the dynamics of the ships are subjected to unilateral non holonomic inequality constraints stemming from the limits imposed on the distance between the points on the marine vessels where the cable extremities are attached this distance can be determined as follows 5 d x a 2 cos ψ 2 b 1 cos ψ 1 2 y a 2 sin ψ 2 b 1 sin ψ 1 2 for an inextensible cable d t must satisfy the following inequality constraint 6 d t d 0 the equality holds in eq 6 whenever the cable is taut which may produce a large spike in the cable force that would directly impact the dynamic behavior of the ships moreover the following unilateral constraint equation is imposed to prevent the ships from colliding 7 d min d t one of the control objectives would be to ensure that the above inequality constraint is always satisfied moratelli et al 2013 used lagrange multipliers to handle virtual holonomic constraints that were artificially introduced to control the relative positions between neighboring vessels in a multibody system the lagrange multipliers approach can certainly be applied in the current work to handle the non holonomic inequality constraints required to cover the cable slack and cable taut configurations however such a method would significantly increase the complexity of the formulations therefore an alternate approach was implemented in the current study to describe the physical response of the cable which develops in spatio temporal scales of different order of magnitude in comparison to typical ship motions from the cable dynamics the tensile cable force has the most significant effect on the dynamical behavior of the connected vessels thus a phenomenological model for generating the tensile force was incorporated herein in lieu of a detailed cable model the current study uses a specific potential energy function describing a shallow potential well when the cable is not taut while increasing exponentially as the cable is stretched beyond its original length d 0 such a function emulates the strain energy stored in a cable under tension the potential energy with such properties can be represented in multiple ways in the current work it is given by the following phenomenological function 8 u d k a λ a 2 exp λ a d d 0 k b λ b 2 exp λ b d d min where the parameters λ a and λ b characterize the sharpness of the potential well near d t d 0 and d t d min respectively the cable restoring force representing the only interaction between the active and passive vessels is given by 9 u d k a λ a exp λ a d d 0 k b λ b exp λ b d d min where the parameters k a and k b are the linear stiffness of the restoring force near d t d 0 and d t d min respectively the lagrangian of the entire system can be determined from eqs 4 and 8 as follows 10 l t u by defining the vector of the generalized coordinates to be q t x y x y ψ 1 ψ 2 then the equations of motion can be obtained from 11 d d t l q i l q i q i i 1 6 where q i is the ith non conservative generalized force note that the equations corresponding to i 1 2 represent the translational dynamics of the mass center of the two ship system the equations associated with i 3 4 yield the relative dynamics between the vessels while those corresponding to i 5 6 describe the rotational yaw motions of the ships the virtual work principle is used to determine the non conservative generalized forces as follows 12 δ w f 1 δ r 1 f 2 δ r 2 m 1 δ ψ 1 m 2 δ ψ 2 f 1 δ r m 2 m 1 m 2 δ r f 2 δ r m 1 m 1 m 2 δ r m 1 δ ψ 1 m 2 δ ψ 2 f 1 f 2 δ r 1 m 1 m 2 m 2 f 1 m 1 f 2 δ r m 1 δ ψ 1 m 2 δ ψ 2 where f 1 f x 1 i f y 1 j m 1 m z 1 k f 2 f x 2 i f y 2 j and m 2 m z 2 k are the resultant forces and moments applied on the tug and disabled boats respectively substitution of eqs 1 3 into eq 12 gives 13 δ w f x 1 f x 2 δ x f y 1 f y 2 δ y m 2 f x 1 m 1 f x 2 m 1 m 2 δ x

to obtain the following final form of the equations of motion 14a m 1 m 2 x f x 1 f x 2 14b m 1 m 2 y f y 1 f y 2 14c m 1 m 2 m 1 m 2 x u d d x a 2 cos ψ 2 b 1 cos ψ 1 m 2 f x 1 m 1 f x 2 m 1 m 2 14d

m z 2 in the current study the external forces and moments applied on both ships are limited to those induced by drag and wave excitations along with the control force and moment on the tugboat these forcing functions are best represented with respect to the local coordinate systems x 1 y 1 z 1 and x 2 y 2 z 2 that are attached to the mass centers of the tug and disabled ships respectively see fig 2 the force and moment components defined with respect to the inertial frame in eq 14 can easily be related to their counterparts f x i f y i and m z i expressed with respect to the body fixed coordinates as follows 15 f x i f x i cos ψ i f y i sin ψ i f y i f x i sin ψ i f y i cos ψ i i 1 2 m z i m z i where f x i f y i and m z i reflect the effects of wave excitations control actions along with the drag forces and moments induced by wind and sea currents in the present study empirical formulations have been adopted to represent the combined effects of propeller thrust drag forces and moments along with wave excitations consequently f x i f y i and m z i are represented as 16a f x i p i cos θ i q 1 i w q x i a 1 2 ρ w a t e r a i f v x i r c v i r c 16b f y i p i sin θ i q 2 i

and θ i are the propeller thrust and angular displacement corresponding to the ith vessel respectively it should be noted that the control actions in this work are restricted to the tugboat consequently p 2 and θ 2 are set to zero throughout this study the forces and moment corresponding to wave excitations q 1 i w q 2 i w and q 3 i w are formulated in subsection 2 2 similarly the drag forces and moment induced by wind q x i a q y i a and q z i a are given in subsection 2 3 the remaining terms in eqs 16a to 16c represent the sea current effects the v x i r c and v y i r c terms are the projections onto the body fixed x i and y i axes of the relative velocity vector of the ith ship with respect to the water free surface at x i y i respectively they can be computed from 17 v x i r c v y i r c cos ψ i sin ψ i sin ψ i cos ψ i x i v x i c x i y i y i v y i c x i y i i 1 2 v x i c x i y i and v y i c x i y i are the components of the sea current velocity field expressed with respect to the inertial frame and evaluated at the mass center location of the ith vessel v i r c is the modulus of the relative velocity vector of the ith ship with respect to the water free surface it can be calculated from 18 v i r c v x i r c 2 v y i r c 2 the current effective angular velocity in the vicinity of the ith ship is estimated through the vorticity of the sea current as follows 19 ω i x i y i 1 2 v y i c x i v x i c y i x x i y y i i 1 2 in case of zero vorticity the term 1 2 ζ i ρ w a t e r a i s ψ i ψ i l i 2 in eq 16c describes the water drag moment preventing the ith ship from spinning freely in eq 16 the terms v x i r c v i r c and v y i r c v i r c incorporate the effect of the vessel s drift induced by deviations of the ship relative speed with respect to the water free surface from the ship s longitudinal axis note that both v x i c x i y i and v y i c x i y i are set to zero when the vessels pass through zones free of sea currents 2 2 wave loads different types of wave loads on marine vessels were discussed in recent review by ibrahim 2020 the current formulation used in capturing the effects of wave excitations on the marine vessels is similar to the one used by khaled and chalhoub 2011 it is briefly described here for completeness of the reported work long crested sea waves are assumed in the computation of the wave excitation forces and moment

provided by isherwood 1973 3 control strategies 3 1 control inputs and targets in the present study the control variables are restricted to the thrust p 1 t and the angular displacement θ 1 t of the tugboat propeller see fig 2 the impact of the control actions are transmitted to the disabled ship through the towline force the challenge in controlling such a two ship ensemble stems from the fact that the disabled ship becomes uncontrollable whenever the cable seize to be taut therefore the controller of the tug has to simultaneously perform two tasks the first one aims at restoring and maintaining the controllability of the system by ensuring that the cable is always taut this task has to be performed without producing large impulsive tension force in the cable that could result in the ships moving towards each other with the possibility of a collision the objective of the second control task is to ensure that the system follows a prescribed heading angle and surge speed two potential strategies for controlling the two ship ensemble have been pursued in the present work in the first control strategy cs 1 the leading vessel is controlled to maintain a prescribed heading angle and surge speed for the mass center of the two ship ensemble while in the second control strategy cs 2 the leading ship is controlled to track prescribed set targets for its desired heading angle and surge speed the rationale for the first control strategy cs 1 stems from the fact that the dynamics of the leading ship are directly and adversely impacted by the large spikes in the cable tension that occur during transient periods if the focus of the controller is on the dynamic behavior of the leading ship as is the case in the second control strategy then the cable force becomes an external disturbance applied on the controlled vessel and the control action must counteract its effect this will have a tendency to induce undesirable oscillations in the closed loop response of the two ship ensemble a plausible approach for dealing with such an undesirable phenomenon would be to control the leading ship so that the mass center of the two ship ensemble maintains desired heading angle and surge speed as is the case in the first control strategy when the control focus is shifted to the dynamic behavior of the mass center then the cable force becomes an internal force in the two ship ensemble and its effect would be minimal on the dynamics of the mass center of the system such a control strategy tends to isolate the effects of spikes in the cable force from the smooth translational motion of the mass center it is important to realize that the center of mass of the two ship ensemble remains controllable even though the towline seizes to be taut and both ships are decoupled focusing the control algorithm on the dynamic response of the mass center of the multi vessel system has a tendency to lessen the effect of the spikes in the towline tension force this will render the controller to be most efficient as confirmed by the results shown in section 4 in the implementation of the first control strategy one would prescribe the desired velocity vector of the mass center v m c d t along with the angle that it forms with the inertial x axis ψ m c d t both v m c d t and ψ m c d t cannot be directly achieved since the mass center is not an actual physical point of the two ship ensemble moreover the control actions are restricted to the leading ship with the controller determining the control actions θ 1 t and p 1 t based on the prescribed surge speed v 1 d t and heading angle ψ 1 d t of the leading ship therefore it is imperative to relate both v m c d t and ψ m c d t to v 1 d t and ψ 1 d t respectively the relation between v m c d t and v 1 d t can easily be deduced from the definition of the mass center as 25 v 1 d t m 1 m 2 m 1 v m c d t m 2 m 1 v 2 t 1 μ v m c d t μ v 2 t where v 2 t is the velocity vector of the disabled ship and μ m 2 m 1 the scalar equations corresponding to eq 25 can be written as 26a x 1 d 1 μ v m c d cos ψ m c d μ x 2 f i l t e r e d 1 μ x m c d μ x 2 f i l t e r e d 26b y 1 d 1 μ v m c d sin ψ m c d μ y 2 f i l t e r e d 1 μ y m c d μ y 2 f i l t e r e d note that the components of v 2 t tend to be noisy and have to be filtered in order to generate a smooth reference path for the leading vessel to reduce the phase lag induced by the filter and to take advantage of the smoothness of both x m c d and y m c d the signals x 2 f i l t e r e d and y 2 f i l t e r e d are determined herein as follows 27a x 2 f i l t e r e d t 0 t g f t τ x 2 τ x m c d τ d τ x m c d t 27b y 2 f i l t e r e d t 0 t g f t τ y 2 τ y m c d τ d τ y m c d t where g f t is the transfer function of a first order low pass filter the substitution of eqs 27a and 27b into eqs 26a and 26b yields 28a x 1 d t x m c d t μ 0 t g f t τ x m c d τ x 2 τ d τ 28b y 1 d t y m c d t μ 0 t g f t τ y m c d τ y 2 τ d τ from which the desired speed and heading angle of the leading ship can easily be obtained from 29a v 1 d x 1 d 2 y 1 d 2 29b tan ψ 1 d y 1 d x 1 d the performance of the two control strategies are then compared to determine the most efficient and viable approach for controlling the two ship ensemble when the control actions are being restricted to the leading ship 3 2 controller description a pid controller was used to control the heading angle of the leading ship as follows 30 θ 1 t k p h e ψ 1 t k d h e ψ 1 t k i h 0 t e ψ 1 τ d τ where e ψ 1 t ψ 1 d t ψ 1 t the propeller thrust control signal of the leading ship p 1 t is formulated based on a weighted average of two control signals namely the control component responsible for keeping the cable taut p 1 c t and the trajectory tracking control signal p 1 t t thus p 1 t is given by 31 p 1 t p 1 c t 1 w t p 1 t t w t where w t is a weighting factor to be discussed later on in this subsection pid controllers were used to determine both p 1 c t and p 1 t t which leads to the following expressions for the control signals 32a p 1 c t k p c e d t k d c e d t k i c 0 t e d τ d τ 32b p 1 t t k p t e v t k d t e v t k i t 0 t e v τ d τ where e d t d 0 d t and e v t v 1 d t v 1 t the terms v 1 d t and v 1 t refer to the desired and actual surge speeds of the leading ship respectively the weighting factor w t in eq 31 has been introduced to ensure a smooth transition from the cable control force p 1 c t to the tracking control signal p 1 t t it is limited to the range 0 1 and assigned a zero value whenever the cable is not taut so that p 1 t is solely defined by the cable control force p 1 c t note that the cable in this study is considered to be extensible and its elongation depends on many factors such as the cruising speed drag forces and moments along with the wave excitation effects in the proposed control strategies the cable must be taut and its length stabilized around a steady state value before w t can be allowed to increase from 0 to 1 stepwise discontinuities in the numerical values of w t were avoided by implementing a smoothing transformation of a heaviside unit step function this was done by employing a second order overdamped linear oscillator as follows 33 w t 1 e ζ ω n t t 0 cosh ω n ζ 2 1 t t 0 ζ ζ 2 1 sinh ω n ζ 2 1 t t 0 u t t 0 where ω n 0 1 and 10 r a d s 1 for increasing and decreasing w t respectively ζ 2 is the damping ratio and u t t 0 is a unit step function delayed by t o seconds the latter represents the settling time for the cable to become taut and its length reaches and remains within a specified threshold from its steady state value i e d t d s s 0 001 m this procedure is repeated every time the distance between the towline extremities becomes shorter than the unstretched cable length 4 simulation results and discussion 4 1 control strategies the simulation results were carried out to demonstrate the viability of the proposed control strategies for the two ship ensemble all simulation results were generated based on the following target heading angle ψ t t and cruising speed v t t 34a v t v t if w 0 v 0 v w 1 e κ t t w v w if w 0 34b ψ t 0 if w 0 π 2 t t w 200 if w 0 ψ t π π if ψ t π where the exponent κ determines the transition rate from v w to the desired steady state value of the surge speed v o equation 34a reveals that the target speed is equated to the actual speed v t of the system whenever the cable is not taut the target speed v t is only specified during the tracking phase of the maneuver and considered to be the surge speed of either the mass center or the leading ship based on the selected control strategy the exponential term provides a smooth transition from the cable control to the tracking control and tends to lessen the demands on the actuators by preventing the control signals from reaching their saturation limits in addition the smoothing process of the desired motion entails the resetting of the target speed whenever the cable becomes in a slack state due to intensive environmental disturbances induced by strong sea currents or any other external source that is powerful enough to cause significant antiphase behavior in the two body system equation 34b specifies the desired heading angle with the condition that the tracking maneuver can only be carried out after the cable is taut by requiring w t 0 the physical constraints of the leading ship actuators are accounted for by imposing the following inequalities on p 1 t and θ 1 t along with their slew rates 35a 0 n p 1 t 2 10 7 n and 10 7 n s 1 p 1 t 10 6 n s 1 35b θ 1 t π 3 r a d and θ 1 t 0 2 r a d s 1 in the first control strategy cs 1 the leading ship is controlled to ensure that the mass center of the two ship ensemble tracks the target motion defined in eqs 34a and 34b however in the second control strategy cs 2 the leading vessel is controlled to accurately track the target surge speed and heading angle specified in eqs 34a and 34b note that the control actions in both control strategies are restricted to the propeller thrust and angular displacement of the leading vessel the performance of the two control strategies are then compared to examine the viability of controlling a multi vessel system through its mass center it should be emphasized that the propeller thrust control signal as defined in eq 31 aims at controlling the surge speed of either the mass center of the two ship ensemble in the first strategy or the leading ship in the second strategy along with the distance between the cable extremities in order to prevent large spikes in the cable tension during transient periods thus an additional objective of the simulations is to demonstrate that the control of the surge speed and the cable tension can be performed in a non contradictory manner according to eq 31 due to different temporal scales of these two processes to generate the simulation results based on the first control strategy cs 1 eqs 34a and 34b were used to define ψ m c d t and v m c d t as follows 36a v m c d t v t t 36b ψ m c d t ψ t t consequently v 1 d t and ψ 1 d t can be determined from eqs 29a and 29b after the substitution of v m c d t and ψ m c d t in eqs 26a and 26b however the implementation of the second control strategy was performed by specifying the following expressions for the desired heading angle ψ 1 d t and the surge speed v 1 d t of the leading ship 37a v 1 d t v t t 37b ψ 1 d t ψ t t the above equations are then used in determining the errors e ψ 1 t and e v t which are needed to evaluate eqs 30 and 32b respectively the tuned values of the control gains in eqs 30 and 32 along with the physical parameters of the system are listed in table 1 it should be pointed out that same values were used for the control gains in both control strategies the numerical simulations involve four different cases aimed at assessing different characteristics of the proposed control strategies the model for the two ship ensemble and the control strategies were coded in matlab simulink and stateflow charts 4 2 case 1 assessment and comparison between the control strategies in this case the performance of the two control strategies are assessed by accounting for wave excitations and considering a cable length of 25 m the simulation results are shown in figs 3 9 note that in figs 5 9 parts a and b refer to the results generated by the first and second control strategies respectively since both control strategies generated similar profiles for d t and w t then one figure is shown for each of these two terms recall that the massless cable was considered to be flexible its elasticity was accounted for by employing a specific potential energy emulating the strain energy stored in a cable under tension see eq 8 fig 3 shows that the cable stretched beyond its original length to settle at 25 6 m during the initial transient phase fig 4 demonstrates that the multi vessel system was initially controlled by the force p 1 c t during the first 90 seconds to ensure a smooth tightening of the cable without inducing large spikes in its tensile force this is illustrated in fig 5a and b in spite of the fact that the cable tension became greater than zero at around t 75 s the control strategies kept the cable controller active until the cable length stabilized at around t 90 s beyond that point w t started to increase gradually from 0 to 1 to yield a smooth transition from the cable controller p 1 c t to the tracking controller p 1 t t the transition phase for w t occurred between t 90 s and t 350 s during this period the resultant control force of the propeller thrust p 1 t was computed according to eq 31 and the cable tension forces reached their steady state values beyond the initial 350 s w t remained 1 for the remainder of the maneuver which is indicative that the two ship ensemble completed the maneuver while behaving like a single rigid body with the cable remaining firmly taut this fact is manifested in both parts of fig 7 where the surge speeds of the leading ship the disabled ship and the mass center of the system are practically all equal for both control strategies the wave excitation effects on both p 1 t cable tension and θ 1 t were not significant to alter the dynamic response of the closed loop systems this is confirmed in the zoomed in windows of fig 5a b 6a and 6b figs 7 and 8 exhibit three distinct phases of the motion the first one occurs during the first 90 s where only p 1 c t is applied and no tracking was performed the second phase entails the tracking of a half circle which takes place from 90 to 560 s the third phase involves a straight line trajectory tracking during the remainder of the maneuver fig 7 demonstrates that both control strategies are capable of accurately tracking their desired surge speeds it should be pointed out that the dynamic response in fig 7a does not exhibit an overshoot due to the cs 1 control strategy because the actual surge speed accurately tracks the desired one the bump in the response during the turning phase of the maneuver stems from the velocity vector formulation in eqs 25 29 that were used in determining the required surge speed of the leading ship that would yield the desired surge speed of the mass center similar tracking characteristics were exhibited for the heading angle in fig 8a and b as expected for the cs 1 control strategy the heading angle of the disabled ship lagged the desired angle specified in eq 36b during the turning phase of the maneuver however this error vanished during the straight line trajectory tracking phase of the maneuver fig 6a and b shows slightly different angular displacements of the propeller between the two control strategies this is due to the different surge speed profiles used by cs 1 and cs 2 see fig 7 fig 9 provides the desired and actual trajectories followed by the two ship ensemble under the proposed control strategies figs 3 9 serve to prove that the mass center control strategy cs 1 is as effective as the leading ship control strategy cs 2 it certainly would have a greater advantage over cs 2 in controlling powered multi vessels during their cooperative transport of a large floating object 4 3 case 2 effects of wave excitations the focus of this case is to assess the effects of wave excitations on the closed loop response of the two ship ensemble figs 3 9 demonstrate that the wide spectrum oscillatory perturbations due to wave loads were not able to produce any destabilizing effects on the closed loop responses of the two ship ensemble that were generated by the proposed control strategies the most pronounced effects of wave excitations seems to appear in the control signals as shown in the zoomed in windows of figs 5 and 6 this can be verified by comparing figs 5a and 6a with figs 10 and 11 which were obtained by ignoring wave excitations and implementing the cs 1 control strategy on the multi vessel system all high frequency oscillations in both p 1 t and the cable tension see zoomed in windows of figs 5a and 6a disappeared in figs 10 and 11 4 4 case 3 effects of cable length and environmental disturbances in this case the effects of both cable length and environmental disturbances on the dynamic response of the two ship ensemble under the cs 1 control actions are examined this was done by assuming a cable length of 100 m and considering that the leading and disabled vessels would individually experience strong sea current disturbances varying in magnitudes and applied at different times the effect of the cable length on the dynamic response of the controlled two ship ensemble was investigated by comparing the results generated using 25 m cable see figs 3 4 and 5a to 8a and 100 m towlines see figs 12 17 the comparison was carried out on the first 940 s of the maneuver the results corresponding to different cable length revealed similar pattern of dynamical behavior of the controlled multi vessel systems next the robustness of the cs 1 control strategy to environmental disturbances induced by sea currents was assessed by requiring the two ship ensemble to cross a zone defined by the interval x f 2 x x f 1 and arbitrary y as a part of its desired trajectory each vessel entering this zone would experience a significant disturbance induced by a sea current the magnitude of the disturbance on the ith vessel was determined by considering the following expressions for v x i c x i y i and v y i c x i y i in eqs 16 19 38 v x i c x i y i 1 2 v i c tanh κ c x i x f 2 tanh κ c x i x f 1 v y i c x i y i 0 and κ c 0 1 where x f 1 and x f 2 are the boundaries of the zone in which the sea current is considered to be present their numerical values were selected to be 4000 m and 4050 m respectively in order to point the sea current velocity vector in the positive x direction thus opposing the ship motion which was headed in the negative x direction in this case v 1 c and v 2 c were chosen to be 17 m s 1 and 8 5 m s 1 respectively note that the disturbances on the ships were different since they depended on the relative velocity vector of the ith vessel with respect to the water free surface in the current study the leading ship entered the sea current zone at around t 947 s when x 1 4000 m and started to experience a disturbance that lasted until t 963 s at which time x 1 4050 m and the ship exited the zone during the same period the disabled vessel was free from any disturbances because it was located outside of the sea current zone under the resistive influence of the disturbance the surge speed of the leading ship started to decrease while the disabled ship somewhat maintained its momentum as a consequence the distance between the two vessels started to decrease while the cs 1 control scheme reacted to the sudden environmental disturbance on the leading ship fig 12 reveals that d t becomes 100 m at t 953 s which is the unstretched length of the cable at that instant the tension in the towline became zero and the two ship ensemble ceased to behave like a single rigid body this resulted in out of phase heading angles of the vessels see fig 17 and the surge speed of the leading ship became smaller than that of the disabled ship see fig 16a and b the slack configuration of the cable caused the control strategy cs 1 to lose its controllability over the disabled ship and allowed the two ship ensemble to behave as two independent vessels to regain the full controllability over the system cs 1 de activated the tracking controller p 1 t t and reactivated the cable controller p 1 c t by resetting w t to zero see fig 13 however d t continued to decrease until it reached 94 3 m at around t 966 s at which time p 1 c t was able to reverse the trend in d t and started to stretch the cable by increasing the distance between the vessels fig 12 reveals that d t reached 100 m at t 993 s at that moment the cable tension became greater than zero see fig 14 and cs 1 regained its controllability over the disabled ship the controlled system continued with this mode of operation until t 1011 s when the cable length stabilized and the smooth transition from p 1 c t to p 1 t t began by gradually increasing the numerical values of w t from zero to one see fig 13 while this transition was taking place the surge speeds of the leading and disabled ships became equal at t 1017 s thus indicating that the two ship ensemble started to once again behave like a single rigid body whose speed was increasing to track the desired surge speed of the mass center see fig 16a and b however at around t 1028 s the disabled ship entered the sea current zone and endured a strong resistive effect of a disturbance that lasted until t 1044 s during that time the leading ship was already outside of the sea current zone and did not experience any disturbance this resulted in a drastic increase in the cable tension which actually aided the two ship ensemble to preserve its single rigid body behavior during a severe transient phase the adverse effect of the disturbance on the disabled vessel was manifested by a temporary large tracking error in the surge speed leading the cs 1 controller to overreact and causing an overshoot in the response see fig 16a and b note that in rejecting the effect of the disturbance on the disabled ship the propeller thrust control signal p 1 t reached its saturation limit for a brief period starting at t 1044 s once the second vessel cleared the sea current zone the control strategy cs 1 was able to entirely recover from the effects of the disturbances by eliminating the tracking error in both the surge speed and the heading angle this is demonstrated in figs 16 and 17 therefore figs 12 17 serve to demonstrate the capability of the cs 1 control strategy in recovering from considerable back to back disturbances on the multi vessel system simulation results pertaining to an interesting case where the two ship ensemble was subjected to a single disturbance applied on the leading ship are shown and discussed in appendix a 4 5 case 4 effects of environmental disturbances due to waves wind and sea currents case 4 investigates the combined effects of waves wind and sea currents on the closed loop response of the two ship ensemble the wave excitations were considered to be always present a large wind zone covering most of the maneuver of the two ship ensemble was introduced the sea current field was considered to be a subset of the wind zone the combined effects of environmental disturbances were applied during a turning phase in the maneuver of the two ship ensemble consequently the angles of attack of waves wind and sea currents were continually varying and the vessels were subjected to considerable disturbances in this case the cable length was selected to be 100 m and the system was controlled by the cs 1 control strategy the sea current effect was accounted for when the vessels pass through a zone defined by the interval y f 2 y y f 1 and arbitrary x see fig 18 the magnitude of the disturbance on the ith vessel was determined by considering the following expressions for v x i c x i y i and v y i c x i y i in eqs 16 19 39 v x i c x i y i 1 2 v i c tanh κ c y i y f 2 tanh κ c y i y f 1 v y i c x i y i 0 and κ c 0 1 where y f 1 and y f 2 are the boundaries of the sea current field their numerical values were selected to be 1930 m and 1700 m respectively in order to apply the environmental disturbances during a turning phase of the maneuver in this case v 1 c and v 2 c were chosen to be 6 m s 1 and 3 m s 1 respectively the wind effect was considered in the zone defined by the interval y y w 100 m and arbitrary x see fig 18 the magnitude of the wind disturbance on the ith vessel was determined by considering the following expression for v w x i y i in eqs 23 and 24 40 v i w x i y i 1 2 v w 1 tanh κ w y i y w and κ w 0 1 where v w and θ w were assigned numerical values of 15 m s 1 and 10 o respectively in the region defined by y w y y f 2 and arbitrary x the environmental disturbances were induced solely by wave excitations and wind effect fig 18 demonstrates a stable closed loop response of the two ship ensemble during a turning phase of the maneuver the wind effect tended to increase the tracking error of the mass center of the system the portion of the curve in fig 19 corresponding to this region spans over a time period from t 1 168 s to t 2 391 s during this period the cable was kept steady at a constant length in the subsequent region bounded by y f 2 y y f 1 and arbitrary x the environmental disturbances were due to wave excitations wind and sea current effects fig 18 reveals a brief deviation from the desired track in this zone however the controller was able to reverse the trend and start converging the system to the desired trajectory in the presence of environmental disturbances this zone corresponds to the time span between t 2 391 s and t 3 460 s in fig 19 which reveals small but controllable fluctuations in the cable length beyond that period fig 19 shows that the cable length smoothly converges to its stretched length prior to sea current disturbances 5 summary and conclusion the planar dynamics of a two ship ensemble consisting of a tug boat and a disabled vessel have been formulated in this work the model considers that the marine vessels are connected by a massless cable the effects of unilateral non holonomic inequality constraints induced by the limits on the distance between the points on the marine vessels where the cable extremities are attached are represented by a specific potential energy function having a shallow potential well when the cable is not taut however this function tends to increase exponentially as the cable is stretched beyond its original length which emulates the strain energy stored in a cable under tension in addition the model incorporates empirical formulations to reflect the combined effects of fluid resistive loads wave excitations and sea current disturbances the control variables in the two ship ensemble are restricted to the propeller thrust and angular displacement of the leading ship the control actions are transmitted to the disabled ship through the cable force two control strategies for the two ship ensemble are proposed in the first strategy cs 1 the leading ship is controlled so that the mass center of the two ship ensemble tracks a desired trajectory while in the second strategy cs 2 the leading vessel is controlled to accurately track a desired trajectory the simulation results demonstrated the viability of the proposed control strategies and revealed that cs 1 can be as effective as cs 2 in controlling the two ship ensemble note that cs 1 would have a greater advantage over cs 2 in controlling powered multi vessel system during their cooperative transport of a large floating object moreover they showed that the wide spectrum oscillatory perturbations due to wave loads were not able to destabilize the closed loop responses of the two ship ensemble that were generated by the proposed control strategies to investigate the effects of the towline length two cases were considered using 25 m and 100 m cable length the results exhibited similar pattern of planar dynamical behavior of the multi vessel system under the cs 1 control strategy however one would expect the cable length to play a more significant and impactful role on the dynamics of the two ship ensemble when heave pitch and roll degrees of freedom are accounted for in the dynamic model of the system the disturbance rejection characteristic of the cs 1 control strategy was examined by considering a case whereby the leading and disabled vessels individually experienced strong sea current disturbances varying in magnitudes and applied at different times the disturbance on the leading ship led to a zero tension in the towline causing the cs 1 control strategy to lose its controllability over the disabled ship and led the two ship ensemble to behave as two independent vessels furthermore the two vessels exhibited out of phase heading angles during this phase of the maneuver however within a short period of time the cs 1 control strategy regained its controllability over the disabled ship stabilized the cable length and forced the two ship ensemble to once again behave like a single rigid body the disturbance on the disabled ship had an opposite effect on the towline it served to drastically increase the cable tension that enhanced the capability of the two ship ensemble to preserve its behavior like a single rigid body under severe transient conditions the main adverse effect of the second disturbance was the temporary large increase in the tracking error of the surge speed which the cs 1 control strategy was able to entirely recover from it this case demonstrated the disturbance rejection characteristic of the cs 1 control strategy which was able to recover from considerable back to back disturbances applied on the multi vessel system an additional case was included to demonstrate the robustness of the cs 1 control strategy to environmental disturbances induced by wave excitations wind and sea current effects the results showed a brief divergence of the mass center of the two ship ensemble from its desired trajectory however the cs 1 control strategy was capable of bringing back the controlled system to its desired trajectory future work will focus on implementing the cs 1 control strategy on a powered multi vessel system during a cooperative transport task of a large floating object credit authorship contribution

appendix a subsection 4 4 included simulation results pertaining to the dynamic response of the two ship ensemble controlled by cs 1 and subjected to sea current disturbances that were applied on the leading and disabled ships at different times the same case is considered in this section with the exception that the sea current disturbance is only applied on the leading ship this is more of an academic scenario but serves to reveal interesting features of the proposed mass center control strategy similar to case 3 the environmental disturbance is applied on the leading ship when 4050 m x 1 4000 m the dynamic responses of the multi vessel system from case 3 and this one are only expected to differ after t 1028 s when the disturbance was applied on the disabled ship this can be confirmed by comparing figs a 1 to a 4 with their counterparts in figs 14 17 the disturbance resulted in a temporary large tracking error in the surge speed leading the cs 1 controller to overreact and causing an overshoot in the response see fig 16a and b since the disturbance on the disabled ship was not considered in this case then the recovery from the disturbance applied on the leading ship was smooth with no overshoot as can be verified from fig a 3 in addition the disturbance effect on the heading angle was quickly rejected by the controller as illustrated in fig a 4 thus the proposed cs 1 control strategy was capable of yielding a smooth recovery from a single disturbance while it led to slight overshoot in recovering from considerable back to back disturbances fig a 1 propeller thrust

constructs a multisource information gray fusion model msigfm due to the lack of torpedo loading reliability test data given that various types of reference information may correspond to different test times and are not equidistant this study takes the unequal time interval grey model as the core and creates the model through two fusions this model can modify the results based on other relevant information thus its simulation and prediction accuracy have been greatly improved the main contributions of this paper are as follows 1 it does not make too many requirements on the distribution of reference information and enriches the source of reference information 2 the experimental results show that this model can better adapt to the medium and long term prediction of data and its accuracy is greatly improved compared with the model without information fusion the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the main theories of information fusion model non

by the proposed msigfm with the non equidistant grey model negm without fusion finally section 6 draws the conclusion 2 msigfm 2 1 non equidistant grey model the grey gm 1 1 model is based on equidistant sequences however in the prediction of torpedo loading reliability the reference multi source information may be obtained at different time points and the data for torpedo loading reliability may be obtained through untimed truncation experiments that is the time sequence of the obtained data may be non equidistant to solve this problem a non equidistant sequence must be converted into equidistant sequence and a gm 1 1 model must be established si feng 2015 hui et al 2012 wen zhan and jun feng 2005 if a non equidistant sequence y 0 t i y 0 t 1 y 0 t 2 y 0 t n exists then the corresponding time sequence is t t 1 t 2 t n the average time interval is 1 t 0 1 n 1 i 1 n 1 t i 1 n 1 t n t 1 the unit time difference coefficient between the actual observation period t i and the mean time distance t 0 is 2 μ t i t i i 1 t 0 t 0 the difference between the actual observation periods is 3 y 0 t i μ t i y 0 t i y 0 t i 1 then the calculation formula of the equidistant sequence is 4 x 0 i y 0 t i y 0 t i the non equidistant sequence can be transformed into an equidistant sequence x 0 x 0 1 x 0 2 x 0 n by the formulas 1 4 the first order accumulation of the non negative isometric sequence is x 1 x 1 1 x 1 2 x 1 n where 5 x 1 k i 1 k x 0 i k 1 2 n the adjacent generated sequence of sequence x 1 is z 1 z 1 2 z 1 3 z 1 n and its calculation formula is as follows 6 z 1 k 0 5 x 1 k x 1 k 1 k 2 3 n the equation x 0 k a z 1 k b is called the grey gm 1 1 model and its parameter a ˆ a b t can be estimated by using the least square method 7 a ˆ b t b 1 b t y where y and b are 8 y x 0 2 x 0 3 x 0 n b z 1 2 1 z 1 3 1 z 1 n 1 d x 1 d t a x 1 b is called the whitening differential equation of grey model x 0 k a z 1 k b then the time response sequence can be obtained by solving the albino differential equation 9 x ˆ 1 k 1 x 0 1 b a exp a k b a k 1 2 n the time response sequence is reduced to a function related to time t in the non equidistant sequence 10 x ˆ 1 t x 0 1 b a exp a t t 0 b a 11 x ˆ 0 t x 1 t x 1 t t 0 2 2 grey relational degree grey relational analysis is an important part of the grey theory system and it is a measurement method to analyze the relationship between things this method does not have high requirements on the number of samples and the clarity of sample rules the calculation amount is small the calculation method is simple and the analytical results are generally consistent with the qualitative analysis results therefore this mechanism has been widely used in the weight calculation of information fusion zhai et al 2009 fang et al 2008 ying gui et al 2013 we suppose that the behavioral sequence of the system is follows x 0 x 0 1 x 0 2 x 0 n 0 x 1 x 1 1 x 1 2 x 1 n 1 x 2 x 2 1 x 2 2 x 2 n 2 x m x m 1 x m 2 x m

and ξ 0 5 gopalsamy et al 2009 škrinjarić 2020 du et al 2020 γ x 0 x i is called the grey correlation degree of x 0 and x i note the sequence lengths for the original sequence x 0 and the reference sequence x i may not be equal at this time some measures can be taken such as deleting the excess data of the longer sequence or using the gm 1 1 model of grey system to make prediction and filling up the insufficient data of the shorter sequence si feng 2015 2 3 multi source information fusion model construction 2 3 1 first fusion we let the original non negative sequence be x 0 and the reference sequence be y 1 0 y 2 0 y n 0 the fusion model can be established only by independent and homogeneous distribution of the n 1 sequence the reference sequence y n 0 only needs to provide a reference for the prediction trend of the modeling sequence x 0 thus the sequence lengths of the two do not have to be equal if a non equidistant gm 1 1 model is established for the reference sequence y n 0 then a grey differential equation d y n 1 t d t a r n y n 1 b r n exists variable a r n is the development coefficient of the model in the grey differential equation which reflects the development trend of y ˆ n 0 moreover y n 0 is used as the reference sequence of x 0 and its development trend reflects the development trend of x 0 to a certain extent which can be regarded as the prior information of the modeling sequence a comprehensive development coefficient a r can be obtained by synthesizing the development coefficients of multiple reference sequences at this time a r represents the reflection of all reference sequences on the comprehensive trend of modeling sequences the following expression exists 14 a r ω 1 a r 1 ω 2 a r 2 ω n a r n ω i i 1 2 n represents the weight reflected by the reference sequence to the prediction trend of the modeling sequence and i 1 n ω i 1 the basic idea of grey relational analysis is to judge whether the series of curves are closely related according to the similarity of geometric shapes therefore weight ω i can be determined by the grey relational degree between the reference and the modeling sequences the relationship between the reference and the modeling sequences is close when the grey relational degree is great namely the weight ω i is great the calculation formula is as follows 15 ω i γ x 0 y i 0 i 1 n γ x 0 y i 0 after the information of the reference sequence is synthesized the comprehensive development coefficient a r can be determined and its corresponding fusion sequence is x r 0 in the fused sequence the time response sequence of the grey model is as follows 16 x ˆ r 1 k a exp a r k b given that x r 0 is unknown the sequence cannot be directly modeled however the changing trend of the fused and original modeling sequences should be basically consistent accordingly the first order accumulation sequence x 1 of the original modeling sequence can be used to approximately replace the data change trend of the fused reference sequence therefore the unknown parameters of eq 16 are fitted and calculated by the least square method juan and xiao hui 2005 li 1992 17 a b t g t g 1 g t x 1 18 g e 0 a r 1 e 1 a r 1 e n a r 1 then the reduction sequence of the time response sequence is as follows 19 x ˆ r 1 t a exp a r t t 0 b x ˆ r 0 t x ˆ r 1 t x ˆ r 1 t t 0 2 3 2 second fusion when the reference sequence is first fused by the above mentioned method the fusion prediction model x ˆ r 0 can be obtained at this time the fusion prediction model and the prediction model x ˆ 0 of the original sequence can be fused again to obtain an accurate prediction model linear regression is a statistical analytical method used to determine the relationship between two or more variables this mechanism is widely used in engineering practice xiao and lu 2012 yimin et al 2008 regression analysis can be divided into unitary linear regression multiple linear regression and nonlinear regression analysis in this study the relationship between the fitting and the real sequences of the two groups will be calculated through the idea of linear regression the model established is as follows 20 x ˆ f 0 x ˆ β ε where β is the regression coefficient vector to be estimated x ˆ is the independent variable vector and ε is the residual vector 21 x ˆ f 0 x ˆ f 0 1 x ˆ f 0 2 x ˆ f 0 n x ˆ 1 x ˆ 0 1 x ˆ m 0 1 1 x ˆ 0 2 x ˆ m 0 2 1 x ˆ 0 n x ˆ m 0 n β β 0 β 1 β 2 ε ε 0 ε 1 ε 2 where the β value can be obtained by the least squares estimate this expression is expressed as follows 22 β ˆ x ˆ t x ˆ 1 x ˆ t x ˆ f 0 3 calculation procedure and evaluation of the fusion model 3 1 computational steps of the model assuming that the original non equidistant sequence is x 0 t i x 0 t 1 x 0 t 2 x 0 t n and x 1 0 x 2 0 x n 0 is the reference sequence of sequence x 0 the modeling steps of the multi source information fusion model are as follows step 1 equidistant processing of the original modeling sequence and the reference sequence step 2 the method described in section 2 2 was used to establish the corresponding model for the n 1 group of equally spaced data the time response sequence x ˆ 1 0 of x 0 and the development coefficient a 1 a 2 a n corresponding to each group of reference sequences were calculated step 3 the method described in section 2 3 was used to calculate the grey relational degree γ 10 γ 20 γ n 0 between each reference sequence and the original sequence x 0 step 4 the grey correlation degree γ 10 γ 20 γ n 0 is fused for the first time by the method described in section 2 3 1 and the comprehensive development coefficient a r is calculated the fusion time response sequence x ˆ 2 0 of the reference sequence is fitted on the basis of this development coefficient step 5 calculate the linear regression model y t β 0 β 1 x ˆ 1 0 β 2 x ˆ 2 0 of x 0 x ˆ 1 0 x ˆ 2 0 through the linear regression method 3 2 model evaluation after the model is determined the test of its accuracy is an essential process such a task is necessary to verify whether the msigfm constructed in the article is suitable for the simulation prediction of torpedo loading reliability that is to evaluate the closeness between the actual and the estimated values this study uses the relative error test method commonly used in grey system theory cheng et al 2007 and its calculation method is as follows 23 a b s y x 0 x 0 100 24 1 n k 1 n k in the relative error test is the average relative error when 0 0 01 the model is of the first order accuracy when 0 01 0 05 the model is of second order accuracy when 0 05 0 10 the model belongs to three level accuracy when 0 10 0 20 the model is of four level accuracy when 0 20 the accuracy of the model is very poor thus it is not recommended to be used in practical engineering 4 reference information sources of torpedo loading reliability given the particularity of the torpedo loading test and the limitation of the torpedo quantity a large scale test is impossible to carry out thus the test data that can be used in torpedo loading reliability evaluation are rare in response to this situation this study proposes a grey fusion method of multisource information which comprehensively uses various types of information to simulate and predict loading reliability in this regard various pieces of prior information should be reasonably selected and used when determining the scope and source of prior information this study combined with torpedo engineering experience to determine three types of prior information fan liang et al 2014 guo qiang et al 2017 cheng gang and jiang 2016 1 given the limited number of torpedo platforms long term loading experiments of a large number of torpedoes are difficult to carry out thus a certain type of transport ship can be considered to carry out loading experiments after analysis and evaluation some experimental information that can be used for this type of torpedo can be determined 2 in addition to carrying some torpedoes warships store some torpedoes to prepare for war these stored torpedoes are well packaged and can be irregularly inspected and repaired however their storage environment is basically similar to that under loading therefore the experimental data of the packaging and storage reliability of torpedo ships can be used as reference data 3 the improved torpedo based on a variety of prototype technology has a strong inheritance with the original product in the case of insufficient loading test data of the improved products we can consider taking the loading test data of the prototype products as reference data to comprehensively evaluate the improved products to improve the evaluation accuracy 5 numerical example the modern torpedo is a complex underwater precision guided weapon which contains electronic mechanical electromechanical rubber chemical and other parts the reliability distribution types are different for each the component functional component and system nevertheless when studying the torpedo system reliability engineering problem it can still be analyzed and processed according to the exponential distribution model and satisfactory engineering results can be obtained li jian et al 2017 hai bo and qiang hui 2014 when the reliability function r t is exponentially distributed the mean time between failures is represented by θ then θ is the reciprocal of the failure rate λ and t is the cumulative loading time which can be expressed as follows 25 r t exp λ t exp t θ according to the above mentioned analysis we can know that the reliability function of torpedo can be expressed by an exponential distribution the following examples are used to illustrate the method to explain the rationality and effectiveness of the msigfm we assume that the loading failure rate of a torpedo is λ c 0 025 1 m o n t h the loading failure rate of a transport ship is λ s 0 018 1 m o n t h the loading failure rate of shipboard packaging and storage is λ w 0 020 1 m o n t h and the loading failure rate of the prototype product of this torpedo is λ c 0 028 1 m o n t h the time series of torpedo loading reliability is t 1 0 1 5 9 15 20 23 27 31 and the time sequence of ship storage reliability is t 2 0 2 4 5 8 12 15 17 the torpedo loading reliability and prototype product loading experimental data were generated by time series t 1 time series t 2 is taken to generate the data of carrier loading and ship packing and storage experiments the simulated experimental data are shown in table 1 the x in the table represents the torpedo loading experimental data and the first five data y in x are taken as the experimental set the last four data are used as the inspection set y 1 y 2 and y 3 represent prototype product loading transport ship loading and warship packaging experimental data respectively first the four groups of experimental data of y y 1 y 2 and y 3 with a non equidistant time sequence are processed with an equidistant time sequence the specific calculation method is shown in section 2 1 and the calculation results are illustrated in table 2 the fitting time functions of the original modeling and the reference sequences can be calculated respectively by using the negm and the first fusion algorithm 26 y 1 t 18 9210 exp 0 0520 0 0208 t exp 0 0208 t 27 y 2 t 11 7506 exp 0 0796 0 0212 t exp 0 0212 t the secondary fusion adopts a linear regression method to establish linear regression equations between y 1 y 2 and the original modeling sequence 28 y t 0 0296 0 3476 y 1 t 0 6819 y 2 t the linear regression equation needs to be tested for the regression effect and the specific evaluation principles of the regression effect are as follows ming 2015 when the square r 2 of the correlation coefficient is closer to one the regression equation is significant when f f α m n m 1 the regression equation is significant and it is significant when the value of f is great variable p is the probability corresponding to f when p α the regression model is successful s 2 is the residual variance and the smaller this value the higher the accuracy of the model for the calculation of the above parameters the r e g r e s s function in matlab is used in this paper the test statistics for the model are shown in table 3 when the confidence level is 0 95 that is α 0 05 the f distribution table is searched to simultaneously obtain f 0 05 2 2 19 f and p 0 05 from the above evaluation it can be known that the linear regression equation is significant and the accuracy is very high in table 4 the first four sets of data are expressed as the fitting values and errors of the model the last four sets of data are expressed as the predicted values and errors of the model the table illustrates that the maximum error and average relative error of the negm are 4 7693 and 2 0810 respectively which belong to the category of second order accuracy the maximum error and average relative error of the model after information fusion are 0 0066 and 0 0042 respectively in comparison with the negm the accuracy has been greatly improved and the accuracy level is grade i the data fitting diagram of fig 1 and the fitting prediction error diagram of fig 2 illustrate that the fitting accuracy of the model without information fusion is second order accuracy however when it predicts the follow up time the error of the model rapidly increases this factor is not suitable for medium and long term prediction of data the msigfm has a high degree of the fitting which almost coincides with the original data and the prediction error at different times is also small with the increase of prediction time its error smoothly changes which has a strong applicability to the medium and long term prediction of data 6 conclusion the grey fusion method of multisource information proposed in this study processes the original data and each group of reference data with the negm as the core and obtains the final fusion model through two fusion calculations the requirements of the model for reference information break the limitation of time and space as long as the reference information obeys the same type of distribution as the original data which enriches the source of reference information reliability information with a reference value for torpedo loading reliability is introduced via this method and a reliable data fitting prediction model is successfully established the calculation of an example shows that the model greatly improves the accuracy of simulation and prediction is suitable for medium and long term data prediction and has a certain reference function for practical engineering application credit authorship contribution statement qing wei liang

then the corresponding time sequence is t t 1 t 2 t n the average time interval is 1 t 0 1 n 1 i 1 n 1 t i 1 n 1 t n t 1 the unit time difference coefficient between the actual observation period t i and the mean time distance t 0 is 2 μ t i t i i 1 t 0 t 0 the difference between the actual observation periods is 3 y 0 t i μ t i y 0 t i y 0 t i 1 then the calculation formula of the equidistant sequence is 4 x 0 i y 0 t i y 0 t i the non equidistant sequence can be transformed into an equidistant sequence x 0 x 0 1 x 0 2 x 0 n by the formulas 1 4 the first order accumulation of the non negative isometric sequence is x 1 x 1 1 x 1 2 x 1 n where 5 x 1 k i 1 k x 0 i k 1 2 n the adjacent generated sequence of sequence x 1 is z 1 z 1 2 z 1 3 z 1 n and its calculation formula is as follows 6 z 1 k 0 5 x 1 k x 1 k 1 k 2 3 n the equation x 0 k a z 1 k b is called the grey gm 1 1 model and its parameter a ˆ a b t can be estimated by using the least square method 7 a ˆ b t b 1 b t y where y and b are 8 y x 0 2 x 0 3 x 0 n b z 1 2 1 z 1 3 1 z 1 n 1 d x 1 d t a x 1 b is called the whitening differential equation of grey model x 0 k a z 1 k b then the time response sequence can be obtained by solving the albino differential equation 9 x ˆ 1 k 1 x 0 1 b a exp a k b a k 1 2 n the time response sequence is reduced to a function related to time t in the non equidistant sequence 10 x ˆ 1 t x 0 1 b a exp a t t 0 b a 11 x ˆ 0 t x 1 t x 1 t t 0 2 2 grey relational degree grey relational analysis is an important part of the grey theory system and it is a measurement method to analyze the relationship between things this method does not have high requirements on the number of samples and the clarity of sample rules the calculation amount is small the calculation method is simple and the analytical results are generally consistent with the qualitative analysis results therefore this mechanism has been widely used in the weight calculation of information fusion zhai et al 2009 fang et al 2008 ying gui et al 2013 we suppose that the behavioral sequence of the system is follows x 0 x 0 1 x 0 2 x 0 n 0 x 1 x 1 1 x 1 2 x 1 n 1 x 2 x 2 1 x 2 2 x 2 n 2 x m x m 1 x m 2 x m

and ξ 0 5 gopalsamy et al 2009 škrinjarić 2020 du et al 2020 γ x 0 x i is called the grey correlation degree of x 0 and x i note the sequence lengths for the original sequence x 0 and the reference sequence x i may not be equal at this time some measures can be taken such as deleting the excess data of the longer sequence or using the gm 1 1 model of grey system to make prediction and filling up the insufficient data of the shorter sequence si feng 2015 2 3 multi source information fusion model construction 2 3 1 first fusion we let the original non negative sequence be x 0 and the reference sequence be y 1 0 y 2 0 y n 0 the fusion model can be established only by independent and homogeneous distribution of the n 1 sequence the reference sequence y n 0 only needs to provide a reference for the prediction trend of the modeling sequence x 0 thus the sequence lengths of the two do not have to be equal if a non equidistant gm 1 1 model is established for the reference sequence y n 0 then a grey differential equation d y n 1 t d t a r n y n 1 b r n exists variable a r n is the development coefficient of the model in the grey differential equation which reflects the development trend of y ˆ n 0 moreover y n 0 is used as the reference sequence of x 0 and its development trend reflects the development trend of x 0 to a certain extent which can be regarded as the prior information of the modeling sequence a comprehensive development coefficient a r can be obtained by synthesizing the development coefficients of multiple reference sequences at this time a r represents the reflection of all reference sequences on the comprehensive trend of modeling sequences the following expression exists 14 a r ω 1 a r 1 ω 2 a r 2 ω n a r n ω i i 1 2 n represents the weight reflected by the reference sequence to the prediction trend of the modeling sequence and i 1 n ω i 1 the basic idea of grey relational analysis is to judge whether the series of curves are closely related according to the similarity of geometric shapes therefore weight ω i can be determined by the grey relational degree between the reference and the modeling sequences the relationship between the reference and the modeling sequences is close when the grey relational degree is great namely the weight ω i is great the calculation formula is as follows 15 ω i γ x 0 y i 0 i 1 n γ x 0 y i 0 after the information of the reference sequence is synthesized the comprehensive development coefficient a r can be determined and its corresponding fusion sequence is x r 0 in the fused sequence the time response sequence of the grey model is as follows 16 x ˆ r 1 k a exp a r k b given that x r 0 is unknown the sequence cannot be directly modeled however the changing trend of the fused and original modeling sequences should be basically consistent accordingly the first order accumulation sequence x 1 of the original modeling sequence can be used to approximately replace the data change trend of the fused reference sequence therefore the unknown parameters of eq 16 are fitted and calculated by the least square method juan and xiao hui 2005 li 1992 17 a b t g t g 1 g t x 1 18 g e 0 a r 1 e 1 a r 1 e n a r 1 then the reduction sequence of the time response sequence is as follows 19 x ˆ r 1 t a exp a r t t 0 b x ˆ r 0 t x ˆ r 1 t x ˆ r 1 t t 0 2 3 2 second fusion when the reference sequence is first fused by the above mentioned method the fusion prediction model x ˆ r 0 can be obtained at this time the fusion prediction model and the prediction model x ˆ 0 of the original sequence can be fused again to obtain an accurate prediction model linear regression is a statistical analytical method used to determine the relationship between two or more variables this mechanism is widely used in engineering practice xiao and lu 2012 yimin et al 2008 regression analysis can be divided into unitary linear regression multiple linear regression and nonlinear regression analysis in this study the relationship between the fitting and the real sequences of the two groups will be calculated through the idea of linear regression the model established is as follows 20 x ˆ f 0 x ˆ β ε where β is the regression coefficient vector to be estimated x ˆ is the independent variable vector and ε is the residual vector 21 x ˆ f 0 x ˆ f 0 1 x ˆ f 0 2 x ˆ f 0 n x ˆ 1 x ˆ 0 1 x ˆ m 0 1 1 x ˆ 0 2 x ˆ m 0 2 1 x ˆ 0 n x ˆ m 0 n β β 0 β 1 β 2 ε ε 0 ε 1 ε 2 where the β value can be obtained by the least squares estimate this expression is expressed as follows 22 β ˆ x ˆ t x ˆ 1 x ˆ t x ˆ f 0 3 calculation procedure and evaluation of the fusion model 3 1 computational steps of the model assuming that the original non equidistant sequence is x 0 t i x 0 t 1 x 0 t 2 x 0 t n and x 1 0 x 2 0 x n 0 is the reference sequence of sequence x 0 the modeling steps of the multi source information fusion model are as follows step 1 equidistant processing of the original modeling sequence and the reference sequence step 2 the method described in section 2 2 was used to establish the corresponding model for the n 1 group of equally spaced data the time response sequence x ˆ 1 0 of x 0 and the development coefficient a 1 a 2 a n corresponding to each group of reference sequences were calculated step 3 the method described in section 2 3 was used to calculate the grey relational degree γ 10 γ 20 γ n 0 between each reference sequence and the original sequence x 0 step 4 the grey correlation degree γ 10 γ 20 γ n 0 is fused for the first time by the method described in section 2 3 1 and the comprehensive development coefficient a r is calculated the fusion time response sequence x ˆ 2 0 of the reference sequence is fitted on the basis of this development coefficient step 5 calculate the linear regression model y t β 0 β 1 x ˆ 1 0 β 2 x ˆ 2 0 of x 0 x ˆ 1 0 x ˆ 2 0 through the linear regression method 3 2 model evaluation after the model is determined the test of its accuracy is an essential process such a task is necessary to verify whether the msigfm constructed in the article is suitable for the simulation prediction of torpedo loading reliability that is to evaluate the closeness between the actual and the estimated values this study uses the relative error test method commonly used in grey system theory cheng et al 2007 and its calculation method is as follows 23 a b s y x 0 x 0 100 24 1 n k 1 n k in the relative error test is the average relative error when 0 0 01 the model is of the first order accuracy when 0 01 0 05 the model is of second order accuracy when 0 05 0 10 the model belongs to three level accuracy when 0 10 0 20 the model is of four level accuracy when 0 20 the accuracy of the model is very poor thus it is not recommended to be used in practical engineering 4 reference information sources of torpedo loading reliability given the particularity of the torpedo loading test and the limitation of the torpedo quantity a large scale test is impossible to carry out thus the test data that can be used in torpedo loading reliability evaluation are rare in response to this situation this study proposes a grey fusion method of multisource information which comprehensively uses various types of information to simulate and predict loading reliability in this regard various pieces of prior information should be reasonably selected and used when determining the scope and source of prior information this study combined with torpedo engineering experience to determine three types of prior information fan liang et al 2014 guo qiang et al 2017 cheng gang and jiang 2016 1 given the limited number of torpedo platforms long term loading experiments of a large number of torpedoes are difficult to carry out thus a certain type of transport ship can be considered to carry out loading experiments after analysis and evaluation some experimental information that can be used for this type of torpedo can be determined 2 in addition to carrying some torpedoes warships store some torpedoes to prepare for war these stored torpedoes are well packaged and can be irregularly inspected and repaired however their storage environment is basically similar to that under loading therefore the experimental data of the packaging and storage reliability of torpedo ships can be used as reference data 3 the improved torpedo based on a variety of prototype technology has a strong inheritance with the original product in the case of insufficient loading test data of the improved products we can consider taking the loading test data of the prototype products as reference data to comprehensively evaluate the improved products to improve the evaluation accuracy 5 numerical example the modern torpedo is a complex underwater precision guided weapon which contains electronic mechanical electromechanical rubber chemical and other parts the reliability distribution types are different for each the component functional component and system nevertheless when studying the torpedo system reliability engineering problem it can still be analyzed and processed according to the exponential distribution model and satisfactory engineering results can be obtained li jian et al 2017 hai bo and qiang hui 2014 when the reliability function r t is exponentially distributed the mean time between failures is represented by θ then θ is the reciprocal of the failure rate λ and t is the cumulative loading time which can be expressed as follows 25 r t exp λ t exp t θ according to the above mentioned analysis we can know that the reliability function of torpedo can be expressed by an exponential distribution the following examples are used to illustrate the method to explain the rationality and effectiveness of the msigfm we assume that the loading failure rate of a torpedo is λ c 0 025 1 m o n t h the loading failure rate of a transport ship is λ s 0 018 1 m o n t h the loading failure rate of shipboard packaging and storage is λ w 0 020 1 m o n t h and the loading failure rate of the prototype product of this torpedo is λ c 0 028 1 m o n t h the time series of torpedo loading reliability is t 1 0 1 5 9 15 20 23 27 31 and the time sequence of ship storage reliability is t 2 0 2 4 5 8 12 15 17 the torpedo loading reliability and prototype product loading experimental data were generated by time series t 1 time series t 2 is taken to generate the data of carrier loading and ship packing and storage experiments the simulated experimental data are shown in table 1 the x in the table represents the torpedo loading experimental data and the first five data y in x are taken as the experimental set the last four data are used as the inspection set y 1 y 2 and y 3 represent prototype product loading transport ship loading and warship packaging experimental data respectively first the four groups of experimental data of y y 1 y 2 and y 3 with a non equidistant time sequence are processed with an equidistant time sequence the specific calculation method is shown in section 2 1 and the calculation results are illustrated in table 2 the fitting time functions of the original modeling and the reference sequences can be calculated respectively by using the negm and the first fusion algorithm 26 y 1 t 18 9210 exp 0 0520 0 0208 t exp 0 0208 t 27 y 2 t 11 7506 exp 0 0796 0 0212 t exp 0 0212 t the secondary fusion adopts a linear regression method to establish linear regression equations between y 1 y 2 and the original modeling sequence 28 y t 0 0296 0 3476 y 1 t 0 6819 y 2 t the linear regression equation needs to be tested for the regression effect and the specific evaluation principles of the regression effect are as follows ming 2015 when the square r 2 of the correlation coefficient is closer to one the regression equation is significant when f f α m n m 1 the regression equation is significant and it is significant when the value of f is great variable p is the probability corresponding to f when p α the regression model is successful s 2 is the residual variance and the smaller this value the higher the accuracy of the model for the calculation of the above parameters the r e g r e s s function in matlab is used in this paper the test statistics for the model are shown in table 3 when the confidence level is 0 95 that is α 0 05 the f distribution table is searched to simultaneously obtain f 0 05 2 2 19 f and p 0 05 from the above evaluation it can be known that the linear regression equation is significant and the accuracy is very high in table 4 the first four sets of data are expressed as the fitting values and errors of the model the last four sets of data are expressed as the predicted values and errors of the model the table illustrates that the maximum error and average relative error of the negm are 4 7693 and 2 0810 respectively which belong to the category of second order accuracy the maximum error and average relative error of the model after information fusion are 0 0066 and 0 0042 respectively in comparison with the negm the accuracy has been greatly improved and the accuracy level is grade i the data fitting diagram of fig 1 and the fitting prediction error diagram of fig 2 illustrate that the fitting accuracy of the model without information fusion is second order accuracy however when it predicts the follow up time the error of the model rapidly increases this factor is not suitable for medium and long term prediction of data the msigfm has a high degree of the fitting which almost coincides with the original data and the prediction error at different times is also small with the increase of prediction time its error smoothly changes which has a strong applicability to the medium and long term prediction of data 6 conclusion the grey fusion method of multisource information proposed in this study processes the original data and each group of reference data with the negm as the core and obtains the final fusion model through two fusion calculations the requirements of the model for reference information break the limitation of time and space as long as the reference information obeys the same type of distribution as the original data which enriches the source of reference information reliability information with a reference value for torpedo loading reliability is introduced via this method and a reliable data fitting prediction model is successfully established the calculation of an example shows that the model greatly improves the accuracy of simulation and prediction is suitable for medium and long term data prediction and has a certain reference function for practical engineering application credit authorship contribution statement qing wei liang

20588,the objective of the present study is to investigate the dynamic motions and impact loads of twin barge float over installation with the model tests which involve multi body interactions between wave induced vessel motions and constraint components a particular contribution of the model tests is that a novel remote rapid de ballasting system based on an intelligent algorithm is provided to change the draft of transportation and installation barges continuously and the load transfer process of twin barge float over installation can be simulated in a continuous manner in addition several shock absorbers with adjustable constraint components including the deck support units dsus leg mating units lmus surge and sway fenders are carefully designed to smooth the continuous load transfer process the impact loads between topside barges and substructure can be captured accurately and efficiently two typical cases in the mating phase of twin barge float over installation namely case b2b where the topside is transferred from transportation barge to installation barges and case b2j where the topside is transferred from installation barges to pre installed jacket are simulated in the model tests results indicate that the impact loads on the dsus of transportation barge increase and those on the dsus of installation barges decrease continuously as the draft of transportation barge increases in case b2b furthermore the impact loads on the dsus of installation barges decrease and the impact loads on the lums of jacket increase continuously as the draft of installation barges increases in case b2j the relative motions and impact loads between the topside barges and jacket are within an acceptable limit in the investigated conditions in addition two particular phenomena are captured in the model tests one is that the load transfer rate of the topside is closely related to the trim angle of the transportation barge and another one is that the separations between stabbing pins of topside and receptor cones of dsus are asynchronous these phenomena have never been observed in conventional simulation methods keywords float over installation continuous load transfer process relative motion impact load de ballasting system model test 1 introduction with the rapid development of hydrocarbon exploration the topside of offshore platform gets huger and heavier the mega topside is usually welded and commissioned onshore and installed as an integrated unit at sea however the integrated topside installation becomes a significant challenge due to their massive weight especially in areas where the harsh environments are often encountered chen et al 2017 generally two installation methods are widely used for these integrated topsides the heavy lifting installation and the float over installation geba et al 2017 the heavy lifting installation utilizes a heavy lifting vessel to lift the integrated topside from the transportation barge and lower it to the substructure this method usually entails a long time for topside hook up and commissioning and is constrained by the capacity and availability of heavy lifting vessel o neill et al 2000 therefore the cost and capacity make the heavy lifting installation a less attractive option for the mega topside installation different from the heavy lifting installation the float over installation uses a transportation barge to support the integrated topside and transfer it from barge to substructure with the rapid ballasting system in a short time therefore the float over installation possesses the advantages of high capacity low cost and short operation time making the float over installation a more attractive and competitive method in the mega topside installation bai et al 2020a according to the number of barges involved in the operation the float over installation falls into two categories the single barge float over installation and the twin barge float over installation wang et al 2010 generally the entire procedure involves six phases in the single barge float over installation including the loadout phase transportation phase standby phase entry phase mating phase and exiting phase in the loadout and transportation phases the integrated topside is loaded onboard and transported from yard to installation site with a single transportation barge in the standby phase the transportation barge is positioned near the substructure with mooring lines and tether lines waiting for a suitable weather window in the entry phase the barge carrying the topside enters the substructure through the designed slot to make the topside legs align with substructure tops with the help of mooring lines tether lines fenders and winches the topside load is gradually transferred from barge to substructure as the barge ballasting in the mating phase finally the barge separates from the topside and withdraws through the substructure it should be mentioned that there is another transition procedure in twin barge float over installation in which the topside load is transferred from the transportation barge to the installation barges the continuous load transfer process in mating operation is the most critical task for float over installation due to the small gaps in the float over system the relative motions and impact loads between topside barges and substructure should be strictly controlled hu et al 2017 therefore more attention should be paid to the dynamic motions and impact loads in the load transfer process by considering the multi body interaction effect the dynamic responses in mating phase of the float over system can be estimated through numerical simulations model tests and field measurements significant efforts have been taken on simulating multi body interaction in float over installation operation and several numerical models have been developed based on the linear potential flow theory and impulse theory such as the models adopted in dnv sesam and ansys aqwa software dnv 2010 song et al 2019 in the numerical model the topside and barges are usually simplified as rigid bodies with six degree of freedoms dofs and the mooring system is usually simulated with the slender beam theory the constraint components in the float over system such as lmus dsus and fenders are usually modeled as linear or nonlinear springs xu et al 2015 chen et al 2017 hu et al 2017 the coupling effect such as the impact loads between topside barges constraint components and mooring system can be considered in these numerical models however the shielding effect and gap resonance between barges cannot be simulated accurately based on the linear potential flow theory zhao et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 in addition the effect of the barge ballasting process cannot be considered in these numerical models and the mating phase is usually divided into several individual stages in the numerical simulation the dynamic motions and impact loads in the float over installation are not easily predicted with the numerical simulation due to the complex coupling system therefore the model tests are suggested to estimate the dynamic motions and impact loads in the float over installation operation the model tests can investigate the dynamic characteristics of the float over system by considering the nonlinearities inherent in the system in a straightforward manner and provide a powerful tool to verify the feasibility of the float over installation and the effectiveness of the numerical simulation results tahar et al 2006 kurian et al 2012 plenty of model tests have been carried out to investigate the dynamic motions and impact loads in mating phase for different offshore platforms such as jacket platform semi submersible platform and spar platform koo et al 2010 xu et al 2012 magee et al 2014 kim et al 2019 bai et al 2020b recently some novel technologies have been introduced into the model tests to improve the efficiency and accuracy of experiments the automatic control technology had been introduced into the float over installation by jin et al 2018 a series of model tests on the semi submersible platform with the dynamic positioning system was carried out to investigate the performance of the float over installation method the rapid transfer technology with hydraulic jacking system was incorporated into the float over installation method by bai et al 2020a to simulate the load transfer process in mating phase the dynamic motions of topside and barges and the impact loads on dsus and lmus were investigated and some exciting phenomena had been found based on the model test results although extensive studies had been carried out for float over installation in mating phase almost all of them separate the continuous load transfer process into several individual steady stages to simplify the model test procedure which is different from the field measurements luo et al 2015 tian et al 2018 therefore the dynamic motions and impact loads in the float over installation operation cannot be simulated accurately with the conventional model tests and the simulation of float over installation in a continuous manner is still a challenge the main objective of this paper is to investigate the continuous load transfer process in mating phase of twin barge float over installation with the scaled model tests in the model tests the integrated topside is first supported by a transportation barge and further transferred from the transportation barge to the installation barges in a side by side configuration the integrated topside is eventually transferred from the installation barges to the fixed jacket substructure to simulate the continuous load transfer process accurately a remote rapid de ballasting system based on an intelligent algorithm is provided to change the ballast status of barges continuously and automatically besides several adjustable shock absorbers including the dsus lmus surge fenders and sway fenders are carefully designed to smooth the continuous load transfer process the dynamic motions of topside and barges and the impact loads between them are measured during the model tests to this end this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the procedures of twin barge float over installation and the main particulars of the models are given section 3 presents the details of the continuous load transfer simulation method section 4 provides the experimental configuration and the environmental conditions in sections 5 and 6 the results and discussion of the model tests are given finally the conclusions drawn from this study are summarized in section 7 2 experimental description 2 1 twin barge float over installation twin barge float over installation is usually applied to the offshore platform without a slot designed on the substructure top in this study the target topside is assumed to be installed on the six leg jacket with one transportation barge and two installation barges as illustrated in fig 1 a as aforementioned the twin barge float over installation involves the continuous load transfer process twice several shock absorbers including six dsus on transportation barge three dsus on each installation barge and six lmus on the jacket are adopted to mitigate the impact loads in the continuous load transfer process for the first transfer procedure the topside is supported by the dsus on the transportation barge positioned with five mooring lines then the installation barges approach to the transportation barge from its portside and starboard simultaneously and the dsus on the installation barges are aligned with the support points of topside with the aid of the tether lines surge fenders and sway fenders after that the transportation barge increases its draft through the ballasting operation to transfer the topside to the installation barges while the drafts of the installation barges remain constant via the de ballasting operation and the transferred weight of the topside is neutralized with the de ballasting water finally the topside is fully supported by the installation barges and the transportation barge is towed away after the dsus separating from the stabbing pins of topside with adequate clearances this continuous load transfer process is referred to as case b2b in this paper as illustrated in fig 1 b for the second transfer procedure the installation barges carrying the topside approach to the pre installed jacket from two sides with the help of the mooring lines tether lines and winches the stabbing pins of topside are aligned with the lums on the jacket then the topside weight is gradually transferred from the installation barges to the fixed jacket with the barge ballasting operation finally the topside is installed on the jacket and the installation barges are towed away from the jacket when the clearances between the support points and dsus are large enough this continuous load transfer process is referred to as case b2j in this paper as shown in fig 1 c it should be mentioned that the gaps between the transportation barge installation barges and jacket are not larger than 1 0 m in these two cases as illustrated in fig 2 in case b2b the clearances between the support points of topside and the dsus on installation barges are only 1 0 m in the pre mating stage in case b2j the clearances between the stabbing pins of topside and lmus on the jacket are only 0 7 m in the pre mating stage the impact loads between the topside barges and jacket are remarkable and the relative motion response of topside and barges may beyond the capture range of the dsus and lmus therefore the clearances between the support points stabbing pins dsus and lmus are critical for the float over installation the model tests should be carefully designed to capture the dynamic motions of the topside and barges and the impact loads on the dsus and lmus accurately to validate the feasibility of the twin barge float over installation the relative motions of topside and barges in the pre mating stage and the dynamic response of the float over system in the mating and post mating stages are investigated in the model tests for the dynamic response of the large scaled structure usually governed by the gravitational effect and inertia forces froude s and strouhal s laws are employed to relate the model to the prototype the scale of 1 40 is selected by considering the dimension of the jacket platform barges gaps and wave basin 2 2 topside and jacket the jacket platform adopted in this study is assumed to service at sea area with a depth of 25 0 m the topside weighs 10 000 tons with three decks and it is 81 0 m in length 50 0 m in breadth and 21 35 m in height the topside is supported by six legs used for mating with the dsus on transportation barge and the lmus on fixed jacket in the twin barge float over installation operation in addition six support points exist outside the legs adopted to mating with the dsus on installation barges it should be mentioned that the longitudinal center of gravity cog of the topside is 5 0 m away from its mid section due to the existence of the helicopter deck and this may cause different impact loads on various dsus and lmus in the continuous load transfer process the jacket is 32 0 m in length 30 2 m in breadth and 33 4 m in height the sketch diagrams of the topside and jacket are presented in fig 3 and the main particulars of the topside are summarized in table 1 2 3 transportation and installation barges the transportation barge adopted in the model tests is a t shaped barge whose breath at the bow is smaller than that at the stern the t shaped barge is 180 0 m in length 36 0 m in breadth at the bow 52 5 m in breadth at the stern and 12 75 m in depth as illustrated in fig 4 a the installation barges are two semi submersible barges with a length of 153 2 m a breadth of 38 0 m and a depth of 9 0 m as presented in fig 4 b for case b2b the draft of the transportation barge and installation barges are 8 55 m and 5 0 m in the pre mating stage where the transportation barge fully supports the topside the draft of the transportation barge increases with the help of the rapid ballasting system while the drafts of the installation barges remain constant with the aid of the rapid de ballasting system and the topside weight is transferred from the transportation barge to the installation barges gradually the draft of the transportation barge and installation barges will reach to 11 5 m and 5 0 m in the post mating stage of case b2b where the topside is fully supported by the installation barges for case b2j the drafts of the installation barges are 5 0 m in the pre mating stage and it increases to 6 85 m in the post mating stage the main particulars of the transportation and installation barges in the pre mating and post mating stages are listed in table 2 2 4 mooring system the mooring system is first designed based on the authors experience and then calibrated and optimized through the numerical simulation the lengths and diameters of mooring lines and tethers can be determined in the optimization process and other parameters can be derived using the empirical relationships provided by the manufacturer in case b2b the transportation barge is positioned with one mooring chain and four mooring wires as illustrated in fig 5 a the mooring chain m3 is along with the x axis and the mooring wires m1 and m2 are symmetrical with the mooring wires m5 and m4 respectively the angle between mooring wire m1 and x axis is 135 while the angle between mooring wire m2 and x axis is 90 the installation barges connect to the transportation barge with four tether lines t1 t4 as illustrated in fig 5 a the tether lines adopted in the model tests are high modulus polyethylene ropes in case b2j the installation barges are positioned with six spreading mooring wires and they are connected to the fixed jacket with four tether lines t5 t8 as illustrated in fig 5 b the layout of mooring system is symmetrical about x axis and the angles between mooring wires m6 m7 m8 and x axis are 148 112 and 67 respectively table 3 provides the main particulars of the mooring system the tether lines provide restoring force mainly through their material elasticity as shown in fig 6 a a linear spring is attached to the top end of tether line to make the axial stiffness of tether line model identical to those of prototype ones equivalently for ensuring the hydrodynamic loads on the mooring line models are equivalently identical to those on the prototype ones the diameter of mooring line is determined according to the prototype one firstly then a linear spring is attached to the top end of mooring line to make the axial stiffness of the mooring line model identical to those of the prototype ones equivalently furthermore a series of small weights are attached along the mooring lines evenly to make the dry weight of the mooring lines to be identical to the target ones as illustrated in fig 6 b before carrying out the model tests in the wave basin the characteristics of mooring line models should be calibrated first the mooring line models were installed according to the design radius with an azimuth angle equal to zero then the top end of the mooring line was moved horizontally along x direction to different positions such as 0 025 m in the model scale the top tension horizontal displacement curve of mooring line model can be obtained by repeating the same procedures fig 7 provides the comparison results of the characteristics of mooring line models and target ones one can find that the characteristics of mooring line models are in good agreement with the target ones which indicates that the mooring line models satisfy the requirement of experiments and the simulation results are accurate 3 continuous load transfer simulation method in the twin barge float over installation the topside weight is first transferred from the transportation barge to installation barges gradually as the draft of transportation barge increases and it is then transferred from the installation barges to fixed jacket as the drafts of installation barges increase thus the load transfer procedure is definitely a continuous process however this continuous process is usually divided into several individual stages in the numerical simulations and model tests because it is difficult to simulate therefore it is worried that the conventional simulation methods might not demonstrate all the complex behaviors of twin barge float over installation in this paper a remote rapid de ballasting system based on the intelligent algorithm is provided to change the ballasting status of the transportation and installation barges continuously and automatically so that the load transfer process can be simulated in a continuous manner in addition several shock absorbers with adjustable horizontal and vertical constraint components including the dsus lmus surge fenders and sway fenders are carefully designed to simulate the interactions in the float over system accurately and smooth the continuous load transfer process 3 1 remote rapid de ballasting system the remote rapid de ballasting system comprises two subsystems a de ballasting subsystem and a remote control subsystem the de ballasting subsystem consists of tanks small pumps pipelines and flow sensors as presented in fig 8 in the model tests twelve tanks are provided in transportation barge and six tanks are provided in installation barges the tanks in the transportation barge are deployed symmetrically and the tanks in symmetrical positions are connected with a pipeline to avoid the transverse cog of barge to apart away from its mid section there are six ballasting pumps placed at the bottom of the transportation barge and connected with the tanks through pipelines for the drafts of installation barges remain constant as the topside is transferred from the transportation barge to installation barges in case b2b three individual tanks are placed in each installation barge with three de ballasting pumps inside to drain the ballast water in these tanks besides another three ballasting pumps are placed outside the installation barges to fill these tanks with ballasting water to increase its drafts in case b2j for getting the information of de ballasting water volume in time twelve flow sensors are attached to the pipelines near the de ballasting pumps the remote control subsystem consists of a remote control terminal a microcomputer an electromagnetic relay and a wireless network as illustrated in fig 9 the remote control terminal and microcomputer are adopted to control the whole system and the electromagnetic relay is utilized to control the switch of de ballasting pumps the microcomputer and electromagnetic relay are connected by cables and placed in the cabin of the transportation barge while the remote control terminal is placed outside of the wave basin and connected with the microcomputer through the wireless network the de ballasting scheme code is first compiled in the remote control terminal and then the related results are sent to the microcomputer the electromagnetic relay receives signals from the microcomputer and switches on or shuts down the pumps simultaneously the feedback information of the flow sensors is sent to the remote control terminal in real time and the de ballasting scheme will be changed according to the ballasting status of the transportation and installation barges in case b2b the draft of transportation barge increases from 0 21 m to 0 29 m in model scale and the corresponding ballast water is 516 0 kg the topside weighs 152 44 kg and is fully supported by the installation barges in the post mating stage to maintain the draft of installation barges the de ballasting water of each installation barge should reach 76 2 kg in case b2j the drafts of installation barges increase from 0 13 m to 0 17 m in model scale and the corresponding ballasting water is 218 0 kg which is beyond the maximum capacity of the designed tanks in the installation barges therefore only part of the load transfer process is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the continuous load transfer simulation method in case b2j the details of the de ballasting tanks are documented in table 4 3 2 dsus and lmus with adjustable constraint components the dsu is the equipment mounted on the barge deck to support the topside and the lmu is the equipment installed on the jacket to mate with the stabbing pins of topside all of them are designed as shock absorbers to mitigate the impact loads between the topside and barges or jacket and limit the vertical and horizontal motions of the topside during the float over installation generally the lmu consists of a steel structure incorporated horizontal and vertical elastomers to achieve a specific spring rate and damping the dsu mounted on the installation barge has similar components to the lmu while the horizontal elastomer of dsu fixed on the transportation barge are replaced with the friction material in the receptor cone chen et al 2017 the schematic diagrams of prototype and physical model of the lmu and dsu adopted in model tests are illustrated in fig 10 in this study the dimensions of dsu and lmu are identical to those of dsu and lmu adopted in the float over installation practice of liwan 3 1 mega topside in the south china sea while the stiffnesses of the vertical elastomers in dsu and lmu are determined based on the weight of topside and stroke of dsu and lmu the weight of topside is 9 8 10 7 n and it is supported by six dsus and lmus according to the engineering practice the vertical elastomer in dsu will be fully compressed if the load on dsu is over 30 weight of topside and the vertical elastomer in lmu will be fully compressed if the load on lmu is over 70 weight of topside in the paper the vertical stroke of dsu and lmu is 0 30 m therefore the average stiffness of the vertical elastomers in dsu and lmu should be identical to 1 63 10 7 n m and 3 81 10 7 n m respectively however the longitudinal cog of the topside is 5 0 m away from its mid section and the weight of topside supported by different dsus and lmus is various to make sure the compressed value of vertical elastomer consistent for different dsus and lmus the stiffnesses of vertical elastomer in dsu d3 d6 d2 d5 and d1 d4 are set to 2 53 10 7 n m 1 60 10 7 n m and 7 75 10 6 n m and the stiffnesses of vertical elastomer in lmu j1 j6 j2 j5 and j3 j4 are set to 5 90 10 7 n m 3 37 10 7 n m and 1 71 10 6 n m respectively the dimensions of the dsu and lmu models are scaled from the prototype ones directly the vertical elastomers of the dsu and lmu are simulated with the vertical linear springs and the horizontal elastomers of the lmu are simulated with four horizontal linear springs it should be mentioned that the strokes of the dsu and lmu and the gaps between the stabbing pins and receptor cones are vital important for the impact loads in this paper an adjustable base assembled with vertical spring and receptor cone of dsu and lmu is provided to make the stroke and the gap identical to the target ones accurately as illustrated in fig 10 the main particulars of the dsus and lmus are listed in table 5 before carrying out the model tests in the wave basin the equivalent stiffnesses of the vertical elastomers in dsus and lmus were calibrated in advance the dsus and lmus were mounted on the flat ground and a series of standard weights were put on the top of the dsus and lmus and the vertical displacement of the receptor cones was measured the force and vertical displacement curves of the dsus and lmus were obtained and compared with the target ones the corresponding comparison results are presented in fig 11 from the figure one can find that the characteristics of the dsus agree well with the target ones and the characteristics of the lmus are in reasonable agreement with the target ones although it deviates from the target ones slightly this deviation results from the friction between the horizontal springs and the receptor cones see fig 10 b the results indicate that the dsu and lmu models satisfy the experimental requirements and the impact loads on the dsus and lmus can be simulated accurately 3 3 surge and sway fenders as presented in fig 5 a the installation barges tend to move towards the transportation barge due to the tether line forces in case b2b in the model tests two surge fenders s1 and s2 and eight sway fenders f1 f8 are installed between the transportation and installation barges to limit the relative motions and smooth the continuous load transfer process as illustrated in fig 12 in case b2j the relative motions between the installation barges and topside are constrained by the mooring lines and tether lines the characteristics of the surge fenders and sway fenders are documented in table 6 the diameter of the fender is determined based on the gap between transportation and installation barges and its stiffness is obtained from the rubber fender design manual the surge fender presented in fig 13 a consists of three components an axial load cell a linear spring and two threaded rods the axial load cell is used to measure the impact loads and the linear spring is utilized to simulate the stiffness of fender and the threaded rod is adapted to adjust the pre tension the surge fender is mounted on the deck of the transportation barge with a vertical plate and a horizontal plate and it contacts with another vertical plate fixed on the deck of installation barge as illustrated in fig 13 a the position of the surge fender can be adjusted according to the relative locations of these vertical plates the sway fenders are mounted on the sides of transportation barge to record the impact loads between the transportation and installation barges in the model tests the stiffness of the sway fender is simulated with six small linear springs rather than one large spring to enhance its stability as illustrated in fig 13 b in addition four positioning rods are provided between the installation plates to make the linear springs deform horizontally the stiffnesses of surge fenders and sway fenders in the model scale are measured and compared with the target ones the corresponding results are illustrated in fig 14 from the figure one can see that the measured stiffnesses of the surge fenders and sway fenders are in perfect agreement with the target ones which indicates that the surge and sway fenders satisfy the experimental requirement and the simulation results are accurate 4 experimental configuration 4 1 model set up the model tests are carried out in the wave basin of shandong provincial key laboratory of ocean engineering ocean university of china china the wave basin is 60 0 m in length 36 0 m in breadth 1 50 m in depth and the water depth is 0 625 m in the model tests the wavemaker is installed at one side of wave basin and it is capable of generating regular and irregular waves with wave height range from 0 02 m to 0 25 m and wave period range from 0 5 s to 2 5 s opposite to the wavemaker a wave absorbing beach is installed to reduce the wave reflection as illustrated in fig 15 the physical models were placed at the center of wave basin and the bows of the barges faced the wavemaker the top end of mooring line was connected to the barge decks with a short flexible wire to adjust its pre tension and another end of the mooring line was fixed to the wave basin bed at the designated location the tether line was connected to the barge decks with a short flexible wire to adjust its pre tension the adjustable shock absorbers including the dsus lmus surge fenders and sway fenders were mounted on the barges at the designed location with bolts or glue in case b2b the remote control subsystem was placed on the transportation barge and it was placed on the topside in case b2j the remote control terminal was placed outside of the wave basin together with the data acquisition system 4 2 measuring variables and devices in the model tests the wave elevations structures dynamic motions mooring lines tensions and impact loads in twin barge float over installation operation were measured simultaneously with four different experimental devices the wave elevations were recorded with three wave gauges installed at 9 0 m 18 0 m and 45 0 m away from the wavemaker the motion responses of the topside transportation and installation barges in 6 dofs were captured simultaneously with an ndi optical motion tracking system placed at 4 0 m behind the transportation barge the mooring line tensions were measured with eighteen axial load cells located at the fairlead of the transportation and installation barges besides the impact loads on the surge and sway fenders were recorded with ten axial load cells while the impact loads on the dsus and lmus were measured with eight triaxial load cells which were mounted at the front and back rows of the stabbing pins and support points of topside i e d1 d6 d3 d4 l1 l6 l3 l4 j1 j6 j3 j4 beneath the lowest deck of the topside two micro wireless cameras were glued to monitor the relative motions between the stabbing pins and receptor cones these experimental devices were calibrated before carrying out the model tests in the wave basin 4 3 environmental conditions for fully investigating the hydrodynamic performance and dynamic response of the float over system both the regular and irregular waves were simulated in the model tests the regular waves were adopted to calibrate the motion response amplitude operators raos of the transportation and installation barges and the amplitude of these regular waves was set to 1 0 m in the full scale and the corresponding periods range from 4 0 s to 12 0 s at 0 25 s intervals in the full scale the irregular waves were adopted to investigate the dynamic responses of the float over system and validate the effectiveness of the twin barge float over installation the jonswap spectrum was utilized to depict the wave energy distribution of irregular waves and the significant wave heights and spectral peak periods of the target irregular waves are summarized in table 7 it should be mentioned that only the wave is of concern and the influence of wind and current are disregarded in this study generally the significant wave height in the float over installation should be small enough to ensure its safety such as 1 0 m for head wave 0 75 m for quarter wave and 0 5 m for beam wave in the present experiment the significant wave height was set to 1 5 m for the head wave to examine the feasibility of the twin barge float over installation the regular and irregular waves were calibrated before carrying out the model tests the measured wave elevation and spectrum were compared with the target ones and the results are plotted in fig 16 it can be observed that the measured wave elevations agree well with the target ones for the regular waves and the spectrum of the measured stochastic wave elevation is in good agreement with the target spectrum therefore the regular and irregular waves were simulated accurately and can be adopted to investigate the hydrodynamic performance and dynamic response of the float over system 5 pre testing results 5 1 free decay tests in calm water the free decay tests were carried out in calm water for heave roll and pitch modes to validate the inertia moment and obtain the viscous damping since the displacement of transportation and installation barges are very large the initial offsets in heave and pitch modes are very small and they decay to zero in a very short time therefore only the free decay curves of transportation and installation barges in roll mode are presented in fig 17 based on the free decay results one can obtain the natural period of the transportation and installation barge in roll mode which are 10 0 s and 6 4 s respectively in addition the motion response of the transportation and installation barges under a set of regular waves with unit amplitude and various periods are numerically investigated via the dnv sesam software and the natural period of the transportation and installation barges are calculated the numerical results show that the natural periods of barges in roll mode are 9 8 s and 6 5 m which are very close to the values obtained from the free decay results and these indicate that the inertia moments of the physical models match well with the target ones the non dimensional damping coefficients of the transportation and installation barges in roll mode are 0 062 and 0 141 which can be applied to the hydrodynamic analysis and coupled dynamic analysis in numerical simulations 5 2 raos tests in regular waves to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of the transportation and installation barges the transportation barge with four horizontal springs was first deployed in the wave basin alone and its motion responses under a set of regular waves with unit amplitude and various periods were measured with the ndi optical motion tracking system after that the installation barge a with four horizontal springs was further deployed in the wave basin alone and its motion responses under a set of regular waves with unit amplitude and various periods were measured with the same devices the motion raos of the transportation and installation barges in six dofs were obtained based on their motion responses the motion responses of transportation and installation barges were investigated separately and thus the shielding effect and gap resonance caused by multi barge do not exist for comparison purposes the motion raos of transportation barge was first investigated alone with the dnv sesam software then the motion raos of installation barge a were further investigated alone via the commercial software in the numerical simulation the three dimension radiation diffraction theory assuming an ideal fluid is adopted to evaluate the hydrodynamic loads on the free floating structure and the damping characteristics obtained from free decay tests are included in the numerical simulation to consider the damping effect of fluid the motion raos of structure can be calculated using the motion equation of structure if the hydrodynamic loads are readily computed the roll raos in beam regular wave and the pitch raos in head regular wave resulted from numerical simulation and model tests are illustrated in figs 18 and 19 respectively it should be mentioned that the forward speed effects of barge are not considered when the motion raos are calculated if barge s forward speed is considered the motion amplitude of barge in heave and pitch modes will increase as the speed increases while the motion amplitude of barge in roll mode will decrease as the speed increases in addition the frequency of barge motion response will be the encounter frequency which is closely related to barge s speed from the figures one can find that the motion raos of the transportation and installation barges resulted from the model tests are in satisfactory agreement with those resulted from the numerical simulation since both of them do not consider the shielding effect and gap resonance caused by multi body therefore the physical models of the transportation barge and installation barges were fabricated accurately and satisfied the requirement of experiments 6 dynamic response and impact loads under irregular waves in the model tests two typical cases related to the continuous load transfer process were investigated one is case b2b where the topside is transferred from the transportation barge to installation barges and another one is case b2j where the topside is transferred from the installation barges to pre installed jacket at the beginning of pre mating stage of case b2b and b2j the relative motion between the support points stabbing pins of topside and the receptor cones of dsus lmus were investigated firstly to check the support points stabbing pins within the capture range of the receptor cones or not as illustrated in fig 20 a at the pre mating mating and post mating stage of case b2b and b2j the dynamic motions and the impact loads of the float over system were measured to further investigate the dynamic responses in the continuous load transfer process of the twin barge float over installation and also to verify the effectiveness of the continuous load transfer simulation method proposed in this study as illustrated in fig 20 b 6 1 relative motions in the pre mating stage 6 1 1 dynamic motions of topside and barges in the pre mating stage the relative motions between the support points stabbing pins of topside and the receptor cones of dsus and lmus are the most significant parameters for the mating operation in float over installation which are usually obtained based on the measured cog motion responses of topside and barges with the help of coordinate transformation technology the coordinate transformation technology is the theorem of relative motions in 6 dofs which can be adapted to calculate the motion response of arbitrary points of the structure based on the cog motion response of structure the cog motion responses and the corresponding power spectral densities psds of topside and transportation barge in surge sway and yaw modes are first investigated and the comparison results are illustrated in fig 21 from the figure one can find that the motion responses of topside and transportation barge in surge and yaw modes are in two distinct frequency regimes namely wave frequency response and low frequency response the nonlinear low frequency motion response of transportation barge is the resonance response caused by second order wave force and it has large amplitude and long period compared to the wave frequency motion response in addition one can also find that the dynamic motions of topside in surge and yaw modes have similar variation trends with those of transportation barge which indicates that the topside moves synchronously with the transportation barge both in amplitude and phase however the dynamic motions of topside in sway mode show different variation trends with those of transportation barge and the motion psd of topside in sway mode has three peaks in low frequency regime after careful comparison between motion psds of topside and transportation barge in the surge sway and yaw modes one can find that the first peak of topside motion psd in sway mode occurs at the 0 02 rad s which is identical to the resonance frequency of transportation barge in yaw mode the second peak of topside motion psd in sway mode occurs at 0 059 rad s which is identical to the resonance frequency of transportation barge in surge mode and the third peak of topside motion psd occurs at 0 074 rad s which corresponds to the resonance frequency of transportation barge in sway mode this is because that the topside is placed at the bow of transportation barge in the model tests see fig 5 a and the surge and yaw motions of transportation barge have a significant influence on the motions of topside it should be mentioned that the sway motion of topside is much larger than that of transportation barge due to the nonlinear resonance between the sway motion of topside and the yaw motion of transportation barge the nonlinearities in the motion response of topside and transportation barge may increase the relative motion response between the stabbing pins of topside and the dsus on transportation barge which is adverse for the mating operation for the topside and installation barge the cog motion responses and the corresponding psds of installation barges in the surge sway and yaw modes are further investigated and the comparison results are illustrated in fig 22 in this paper the installation barge at the port side of transportation barge is referred as installation barge a and another installation barge is referred as installation barge b see fig 5 it can be seen from the figure that the motion responses of installation barges are the co existence of wave frequency and low frequency motion response where the wave frequency motion response is related to first order wave force but the low frequency motion response is related to the low frequency motion response of transportation barge this is because that the installation barges connect to the transportation barge with the tether lines and fenders and the motion response of transportation barge have significant influence on the motion response of installation barges in addition the tether lines and fenders between the transportation barge and installation barges can shift the horizontal natural period of installation barge from dominated period of second order wave force and the low frequency resonance response caused by the second order wave force can be avoided furthermore the motion psds of installation barge show that the peaks of motion psds in the surge sway and yaw modes occur at 0 02 rad s which is identical to the resonance frequency of transportation barge in yaw mode therefore one can conclude that the low frequency motion responses of installation barges result from the low frequency motion response of transportation barge the figure shows that the motion responses of installation barge a in the surge sway and yaw modes have similar variation trends with those of installation barge b this indicates that the motion response of installation barges in surge sway and yaw modes almost remain synchronized under head irregular wave as illustrated in fig 5 a the installation barges locate at the bow of transportation barge and hence the yaw motion of transportation barge has a significant influence on the sway motion responses of installation barges generally the motion response of the installation barge in sway mode is much larger than that of the transportation barge which is adverse for the mating of the support points and receptor cones in the continuous load transfer process in addition the nonlinear interaction between the topside transportation barge and installation barges make the motion responses of topside and installation barges asynchronous which may lead to the failure of the mating process between topside and installation barge 6 1 2 relative motions of supporting points and receptor cones based on the cog motion response of topside and installation barges the motion response of support points of topside and the receptor cones of dsus on installation barges are calculated with the aid of coordinate transformation technology the motion responses of support point 1 of topside and dsu l1 on installation barge are illustrated in fig 23 from the figure one can see that the low frequency motion responses of support point 1 in the surge and sway modes are almost identical to those of dsu l1 but some discrepancies are observed between the wave frequency motion responses of support point 1 and dsu l1 in surge and sway modes therefore one can deduce that the horizontal relative motion response of support point 1 and dsu l1 is mainly caused by the discrepancies of wave frequency motion response the relative motion responses of support point 1 and dsu l1 are further calculated based on the motion responses of support point 1 and dsu l1 in surge and sway modes and the results are presented in fig 24 from the figure one can find that the relative motion responses of support point 1 and dsu l1 in surge and sway modes are tri modal non gaussian processes the first peak of the relative motion response psd occurs at 0 059 rad s which is related to the low frequency motion response of transportation barge the second peak of relative motion response psd occurs at 0 247 rad s which is caused by the nonlinear interaction between the transportation and installation barges the third peak of relative motion response psd occurs at 0 948 rad s which is the wave frequency component related to the input stochastic input wave one can also find that the relative motion response is dominated by its wave frequency components and the maximum relative motion response between support point 1 and dsu l1 is smaller than 0 35 m which is less than the capture range of the receptor cone as expected similar variation trends can be found for the relative motion responses between supports points and dsus and the results are not shown here due to the space limitations to investigate the feasible of the pre mating stage of twin barge float over installation the maximum value and exceedance probabilities of horizontal relative motion response between the support points of topside and dsus on installation barge in case b2b are illustrated in fig 25 in the figure the symbol max refers to the maximum value of horizontal relative motion response and the symbol pe refers to the exceedance probability of horizontal relative motion response above the threshold of 0 35 m which is corresponding to the radius of dsu s receptor cone as can be seen from the figure that the horizontal relative motion responses are very sensitive to the spectral peak period of irregular waves the maximum values of horizontal relative motion response under the irregular wave with spectral peak period of 8 0 s are smaller than those under the irregular wave with spectral peak period of 7 0 s but they are much larger than those under the irregular wave with spectral period of 6 0 s the exceedance probabilities of the horizontal relative motion response above the threshold of 0 35 m are smaller than 0 02 0 53 and 0 43 under the irregular wave with spectral period of 6 0 s 7 0 s and 8 0 s respectively this means that most of the horizontal relative motion responses between the support points of topside and the dsus on installation barge are smaller than the radius of dsus receptor cone and the horizontal relative motion response are within an acceptable limit in the investigated conditions although the maximum value over the threshold the maximum values of horizontal relative motion response between the stabbing pins of topside and lmus on the jacket in case b2j are provided in fig 26 from the figure one can find that the maximum values of the horizontal relative motion associated with different lmus for case b2j are about 0 4 m which are much smaller than those related to the dsus for case b2b therefore the mating process of stabbing pins of topside and receptor cones of lmus becomes more accessible due to the fixed lmus to fully investigate the effects of wave direction deviations on the relative motions response the dynamic responses of the float over system under head wave are first numerically investigated and the maximum horizontal relative motions resulted from the numerical simulation are compared with those resulted from model tests the comparison results are illustrated in fig 27 a and b it can be seen from the figure that the maximum horizontal relative motions resulted from the numerical simulation are close to those resulted from the model tests for case b2b and case b2j this means that the numerical model adopted in this study can predict the dynamic response of the float over system accurately the dynamic motion responses of the float over system under the quarter and beam waves are further numerical investigated the significant wave height and spectral period of the quarter wave are 1 0 m and 6 0 s while the significant wave height and spectral period of the beam wave are 0 50 m and 6 0 s respectively the maximum horizontal relative motions under the head quarter and beam waves are compared and the results are presented in fig 27 c and d from the figure one can find that the wave direction has significantly influences on the maximum horizontal relative motion for case b2b the maximum horizontal relative motion between support points of topside and dsus on installation barge under the head wave is much smaller than those under the quarter wave and both of them are much smaller than those under beam wave the reason is that the sway and roll motion responses of transportation and installation barges under the beam wave are much larger than those under quarter and beam waves furthermore the larger sway and roll motion response can cause severe nonlinear interaction between the topside transportation barge and installation barges which may increase the horizontal relative motion significantly for case b2j the maximum horizontal relative motion between the stabbing pins of topside and lmus on jacket under the head wave is smaller than those under the beam wave while both of them are much smaller than those under the quarter wave this is because that the topside is fully supported by the installation barge in case b2j and the topside and installation barges are motion together like one rigid body in surge and sway modes the sway and roll motion responses of topside and installation barge under the beam wave are larger than those under the head wave but they are much smaller than those under the quarter wave due to the changing of float over system s resistance therefore the maximum horizontal relative motions under beam wave are much larger than those under the head wave but they are much smaller than those under the quarter wave 6 2 dynamic motions and impact loads in continuous load transfer process 6 2 1 heave dynamic motions of topside and barges generally the duration of the process with the topside weight transferring is about 2 5 h of which the continuous load transfer process is about 1 5 h in case b2b the draft of transportation barge increases with the help of the remote rapid ballasting system and the draft of the installation barges remain constant with the aid of the remote rapid de ballasting system and the topside is transferred from the transportation barge onto the installation barges gradually fig 28 provides the heave dynamic motion responses of the topside transportation barge and installation barges in the continuous load transfer process in case b2b in the figure the upper middle and lower figure plates are the heave dynamic motion responses of the transportation barge topside and installation barges under the head irregular wave with the spectral peak period of 6 0 s 7 0 s and 8 0 s respectively there are five features worthy of attention in this figure first the mean values of heave dynamic motion response of transportation barge and topside decrease continuously as the remote rapid ballasting system working while the mean value of heave dynamic motion responses of installation barges remain constant as the remote repaid de ballasting system working this indicates that the draft of transportation barge can increase continuously and the draft of installation barges can remain constant through the remote rapid de ballasting system and the load transfer process can be simulated in a continuous manner in the model tests second the ballasting rates of transportation barge are different at various times the ballasting rate during the first 2000 s is larger than that in the following 4000 s while the ballasting rate drops to zero in the post mating stage where the stabbing pins of topside separate entirely from the receptor cones of dsus on the transportation barge third the mean value of the heave dynamic motion responses of the transportation barge is designed to gradually increase its draft by 1 95 m from 9 55 m to 11 5 m during the continuous load transfer process in the model tests the mean values of heave dynamic motion responses of the transportation barge decrease from 0 m to 2 16 m 2 19 m and 2 12 m within 6000s under an irregular wave with spectral peak periods of 6 0s 7 0s and 8 0s respectively in another word the draft of transportation barge increases about 2 16 m 2 19 m and 2 12 m respectively the discrepancies of the designed values and model test values are about 0 005 m 0 006 m and 0 004 m in model scale and both of them are within the allowable error of the experiment fourth the decreasing variation trend of the heave dynamic motion response of the topside disappears around 5000 s of the continuous load transfer process and this means that the topside is fully supported by the dsus on installation barges it should be mentioned that the vertical stroke of the dsus on installation barge is 0 3 m and the depth of the receptor cones is about 0 35 m in the model tests the topside is lowered about 0 72 m 0 66 m and 0 75 m under the irregular wave with spectral peak periods of 6 0s 7 0s and 8 0s respectively the difference between the designed values and model test values are about 0 002 m 0 001 m and 0 003 m in model scale and both of them are within the admissible values fifth one can find that the amplitude of the heave dynamic motion of the transportation barge topside and installation barge increases as irregular wave spectral peak periods increase this means that the input wave has a significant influence on the heave dynamic motion response of the float over system 6 2 2 pitch dynamic motions of topside and barges to make the support points of topside to mate with the receptor cones of dsus on installation barges as soon as possible in case b2b the de ballasting schemes are carefully designed to make the transportation barge tilt to its bow the pitch motion responses of topside and barges in the continuous load transfer process are illustrated in fig 29 in the figure the upper middle and lower figure plates are the pitch dynamic motion responses of the transportation barge topside and installation barges under head irregular wave with spectral peak periods of 6 0 s 7 0 s and 8 0 s respectively from the figure one can find that the transportation barge tilts to its bow and the installation barge tilts to its stern gradually as the rapid ballasting system working the mean pitch motion responses of transportation barge reach 0 40 0 38 and 0 42 at around 2000 s of the continuous load transfer process and then remains constant under the irregular wave with spectral peak periods of 6 0 s 7 0 s and 8 0s in addition different from the pitch dynamic motion response of the transportation barge the mean pitch motion responses of the installation barges reach 0 47 0 41 and 0 39 at around 5000 s of the continuous load transfer process under the irregular wave with spectral peak periods of 6 0s 7 0s and 8 0s which is corresponding to moment that the topside is fully supported by the installation barges furthermore the pitch motion responses of the topside reach 0 97 1 05 and 0 58 at around 5000s of the continuous load transfer process under the irregular wave with periods of 6 0s 7 0s and 8 0s therefore the pitch motion responses of transportation barge topside and installation barges are very small and both of them are within the admissible values it should be mentioned that the pitch motion responses of transportation and installation barge are definitely the nonlinear motion responses and the nonlinearities in the motion responses can lead to different impact loads on various dsus in addition the stabbing bins of topside separate from the dsus on transportation barge at different moments due to the nonlinear motion response of transportation and installation barges in pitch mode and this may cause the collision between the stabbing pins and dsus 6 2 3 vertical impact loads on the dsus and lmus in the continuous load transfer process of case b2b the support points of topside will contact with the receptor cones of dsus on installation barges and the stabbing pins of topside will separate from the receptor cones of dsus on transportation barge therefore the impact loads between the support points stabbing pins and dsus are inevitable among the impact loads the vertical impact load is the most important for it is related to the transferred weight of the topside fig 30 illustrates the vertical impact loads on the dsus of transportation barge and installation barges in case b2b in the figure the upper middle and lower figure plates are the vertical impact loads on dsus of transportation and installation barges under head irregular waves with spectral peak periods of 6 0 s 7 0 s and 8 0 s respectively as illustrated in the figure the vertical impact loads on dsus of transportation barge decrease as the draft of transportation barge increases while the vertical impact loads on the dsus of installation barges show the opposite variation trends these indicate that the topside weight is transferred from transportation barge to installation barge gradually the vertical impact loads on the dsus of transportation barge approach to zeros and those on the dsus of installation barges reach their maximum value at around 6000s in the continuous load transfer process this means that the load transfer process is complete and the topside is fully supported by the dsus on installation barges it is worth noting that the impact loads on the dsus of transportation barge at the beginning of load transfer process and the impact loads on the dsus of installation barge at the ending of load transfer process are different for various dsus because the longitudinal cog of the topside is 5 0 m away from its mid section however the vertical impact loads on the dsus deployed in symmetric locations have similar variation trends taking the dsus d3 and d4 as an example the impact loads on dsus d3 and d4 are increases synchronous as the draft of the transportation barge increases interestingly the separation of the stabbing pins of topside and the receptor cones of dsus is asynchronous and the dsu with smaller initial vertical impact loads separates first one can find that there also exists a turning point at about 2000 s of the continuous load transfer process which attributes to the bow trimmed of the transportation barge as illustrated in fig 29 in addition the spectral peak periods of input irregular waves have a significant influence on the vertical impact loads on the dsus and the amplitude of vertical impact loads on the dsus changes dramatically in the early stage of the continuous load transfer process the maximum impact loads on dsus under the different irregular waves are extracted and the results are presented in fig 31 from the figure one can find that the maximum values of the impact load on dsus of transportation barge are 2 07 10 7 n 2 23 10 7 n and 2 36 10 7 n under the irregular wave with spectral peak periods of 6 0s 7 0s and 8 0s respectively while the maximum values of impact load on the dsus of installation barges are 2 20 10 7 n 2 16 10 7 n and 2 20 10 7 n under the irregular wave with spectral peak periods of 6 0s 7 0s and 8 0s respectively the dsus and lmus adopted in this study are identical to those adopted in the float over installation practice of liwan 3 1 mega topside in the south china sea except for the stiffnesses and the ultimate strength of the dsu and lmu in this practice is about 4 107 n the ratio of ultimate strength to maximum impact load is about 1 70 which is much larger than the safety factor 1 20 specified by the design code therefore the impact loads on dsus and lmus are within the admissible values in the continuous load transfer process of case b2j the stabbing pins of the topside will contact the receptor cones of the lmus on jacket and the support points of the topside will separate from the receptor cones of the dsus on installation barge the vertical impact loads on dsus and lmus are measured and the results are presented in fig 32 as described in section 3 1 the draft of the installation barge will increase from 0 13 m to 0 17 m in the model scale and the corresponding ballast water is 218 0 kg which is beyond the maximum capacity of the designed tanks in the installation barges therefore only part of the load transfer process is carried out in the model tests the drafts of the installation barges at the beginning of the continuous load transfer process are adjusted to the designed ones with the solid ballasting material and hence the initial vertical impact loads on the lmus and the final vertical impact loads on dsus are not identical to zero from the figure one can find that the vertical impact loads on the dsus decrease continuously as the drafts of installation barges increase while the vertical impact loads on the lmus increase continuously as the drafts of the installation barges increase the initial vertical impact loads on the dsus are identical to the final vertical impact loads on the lmus this means that the weight of topside is transferred from the installation barges to the pre installed jacket gradually and the load transfer process can be simulated in a continuous manner with the method proposed in this paper the most important feature is that there exists remarkable collision between the stabbing pins of topside and the receptor cones of the lmus in the continuous load transfer process which are not captured in case b2b therefore more attention should be paid to multi body interaction in the twin barge float over installation operation by considering the continuous load transfer effect 7 conclusions in this paper the dynamic motion responses and impact loads in the continuous load transfer process of the twin barge float over installation are investigated with the scaled model tests the key features of the model tests are that a remote rapid de ballasting system is proposed to change the ballasting status of transportation barge and installation barges automatically and continuously and several adjustable shock absorbers are provided to mitigate the impact loads and smooth the continuous load transfer process two typical continuous load transfer processes in the twin barge float over installation operation are simulated in the model tests and the dynamic motion responses and impact loads of the float over system are measured and investigated according to the study of this paper some main conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the dynamic motion response of the topside transportation barge and installation barges are multi modal non gaussian response and there exists significant yaw surge yaw sway coupling effects between the transportation barge and installation barges the relative motions between the support points stabbing pins and the dsus lmus are within an acceptable limit for all the investigated conditions 2 the mean value of heave dynamic motion response of the topside and transportation barge increases continuously while the mean value of dynamic motion response of the topside remains constant as the remote rapid de ballasting system working the proposed method is a useful tool for simulation of the continuous load transfer process in the twin barge float over installation operation 3 the vertical impact loads on the dsus of transportation barge increase continuously and the vertical impact loads on the dsus of installation barge decrease continuously as the draft of the transportation barge increases in case b2b while the vertical impact loads on the dsus of installation barges decrease continuously and the vertical impact loads on the lmus of jacket increase continuously as the draft of installation barges increase in case b2j 4 it is interesting that the topside load transfer rate is closely related to the trim angle of the transportation barge and the load transfer gets faster and the vertical impact loads get larger as the trim angle increases in addition the separation between the stabbing pins of topside and the receptor cones of dsus is asynchronous and the dsus with smaller initial vertical impact loads separate first credit authorship contribution statement wei tao conceptualization methodology software validation writing original draft writing review editing shuqing wang validation

20588,the objective of the present study is to investigate the dynamic motions and impact loads of twin barge float over installation with the model tests which involve multi body interactions between wave induced vessel motions and constraint components a particular contribution of the model tests is that a novel remote rapid de ballasting system based on an intelligent algorithm is provided to change the draft of transportation and installation barges continuously and the load transfer process of twin barge float over installation can be simulated in a continuous manner in addition several shock absorbers with adjustable constraint components including the deck support units dsus leg mating units lmus surge and sway fenders are carefully designed to smooth the continuous load transfer process the impact loads between topside barges and substructure can be captured accurately and efficiently two typical cases in the mating phase of twin barge float over installation namely case b2b where the topside is transferred from transportation barge to installation barges and case b2j where the topside is transferred from installation barges to pre installed jacket are simulated in the model tests results indicate that the impact loads on the dsus of transportation barge increase and those on the dsus of installation barges decrease continuously as the draft of transportation barge increases in case b2b furthermore the impact loads on the dsus of installation barges decrease and the impact loads on the lums of jacket increase continuously as the draft of installation barges increases in case b2j the relative motions and impact loads between the topside barges and jacket are within an acceptable limit in the investigated conditions in addition two particular phenomena are captured in the model tests one is that the load transfer rate of the topside is closely related to the trim angle of the transportation barge and another one is that the separations between stabbing pins of topside and receptor cones of dsus are asynchronous these phenomena have never been observed in conventional simulation methods keywords float over installation continuous load transfer process relative motion impact load de ballasting system model test 1 introduction with the rapid development of hydrocarbon exploration the topside of offshore platform gets huger and heavier the mega topside is usually welded and commissioned onshore and installed as an integrated unit at sea however the integrated topside installation becomes a significant challenge due to their massive weight especially in areas where the harsh environments are often encountered chen et al 2017 generally two installation methods are widely used for these integrated topsides the heavy lifting installation and the float over installation geba et al 2017 the heavy lifting installation utilizes a heavy lifting vessel to lift the integrated topside from the transportation barge and lower it to the substructure this method usually entails a long time for topside hook up and commissioning and is constrained by the capacity and availability of heavy lifting vessel o neill et al 2000 therefore the cost and capacity make the heavy lifting installation a less attractive option for the mega topside installation different from the heavy lifting installation the float over installation uses a transportation barge to support the integrated topside and transfer it from barge to substructure with the rapid ballasting system in a short time therefore the float over installation possesses the advantages of high capacity low cost and short operation time making the float over installation a more attractive and competitive method in the mega topside installation bai et al 2020a according to the number of barges involved in the operation the float over installation falls into two categories the single barge float over installation and the twin barge float over installation wang et al 2010 generally the entire procedure involves six phases in the single barge float over installation including the loadout phase transportation phase standby phase entry phase mating phase and exiting phase in the loadout and transportation phases the integrated topside is loaded onboard and transported from yard to installation site with a single transportation barge in the standby phase the transportation barge is positioned near the substructure with mooring lines and tether lines waiting for a suitable weather window in the entry phase the barge carrying the topside enters the substructure through the designed slot to make the topside legs align with substructure tops with the help of mooring lines tether lines fenders and winches the topside load is gradually transferred from barge to substructure as the barge ballasting in the mating phase finally the barge separates from the topside and withdraws through the substructure it should be mentioned that there is another transition procedure in twin barge float over installation in which the topside load is transferred from the transportation barge to the installation barges the continuous load transfer process in mating operation is the most critical task for float over installation due to the small gaps in the float over system the relative motions and impact loads between topside barges and substructure should be strictly controlled hu et al 2017 therefore more attention should be paid to the dynamic motions and impact loads in the load transfer process by considering the multi body interaction effect the dynamic responses in mating phase of the float over system can be estimated through numerical simulations model tests and field measurements significant efforts have been taken on simulating multi body interaction in float over installation operation and several numerical models have been developed based on the linear potential flow theory and impulse theory such as the models adopted in dnv sesam and ansys aqwa software dnv 2010 song et al 2019 in the numerical model the topside and barges are usually simplified as rigid bodies with six degree of freedoms dofs and the mooring system is usually simulated with the slender beam theory the constraint components in the float over system such as lmus dsus and fenders are usually modeled as linear or nonlinear springs xu et al 2015 chen et al 2017 hu et al 2017 the coupling effect such as the impact loads between topside barges constraint components and mooring system can be considered in these numerical models however the shielding effect and gap resonance between barges cannot be simulated accurately based on the linear potential flow theory zhao et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 in addition the effect of the barge ballasting process cannot be considered in these numerical models and the mating phase is usually divided into several individual stages in the numerical simulation the dynamic motions and impact loads in the float over installation are not easily predicted with the numerical simulation due to the complex coupling system therefore the model tests are suggested to estimate the dynamic motions and impact loads in the float over installation operation the model tests can investigate the dynamic characteristics of the float over system by considering the nonlinearities inherent in the system in a straightforward manner and provide a powerful tool to verify the feasibility of the float over installation and the effectiveness of the numerical simulation results tahar et al 2006 kurian et al 2012 plenty of model tests have been carried out to investigate the dynamic motions and impact loads in mating phase for different offshore platforms such as jacket platform semi submersible platform and spar platform koo et al 2010 xu et al 2012 magee et al 2014 kim et al 2019 bai et al 2020b recently some novel technologies have been introduced into the model tests to improve the efficiency and accuracy of experiments the automatic control technology had been introduced into the float over installation by jin et al 2018 a series of model tests on the semi submersible platform with the dynamic positioning system was carried out to investigate the performance of the float over installation method the rapid transfer technology with hydraulic jacking system was incorporated into the float over installation method by bai et al 2020a to simulate the load transfer process in mating phase the dynamic motions of topside and barges and the impact loads on dsus and lmus were investigated and some exciting phenomena had been found based on the model test results although extensive studies had been carried out for float over installation in mating phase almost all of them separate the continuous load transfer process into several individual steady stages to simplify the model test procedure which is different from the field measurements luo et al 2015 tian et al 2018 therefore the dynamic motions and impact loads in the float over installation operation cannot be simulated accurately with the conventional model tests and the simulation of float over installation in a continuous manner is still a challenge the main objective of this paper is to investigate the continuous load transfer process in mating phase of twin barge float over installation with the scaled model tests in the model tests the integrated topside is first supported by a transportation barge and further transferred from the transportation barge to the installation barges in a side by side configuration the integrated topside is eventually transferred from the installation barges to the fixed jacket substructure to simulate the continuous load transfer process accurately a remote rapid de ballasting system based on an intelligent algorithm is provided to change the ballast status of barges continuously and automatically besides several adjustable shock absorbers including the dsus lmus surge fenders and sway fenders are carefully designed to smooth the continuous load transfer process the dynamic motions of topside and barges and the impact loads between them are measured during the model tests to this end this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the procedures of twin barge float over installation and the main particulars of the models are given section 3 presents the details of the continuous load transfer simulation method section 4 provides the experimental configuration and the environmental conditions in sections 5 and 6 the results and discussion of the model tests are given finally the conclusions drawn from this study are summarized in section 7 2 experimental description 2 1 twin barge float over installation twin barge float over installation is usually applied to the offshore platform without a slot designed on the substructure top in this study the target topside is assumed to be installed on the six leg jacket with one transportation barge and two installation barges as illustrated in fig 1 a as aforementioned the twin barge float over installation involves the continuous load transfer process twice several shock absorbers including six dsus on transportation barge three dsus on each installation barge and six lmus on the jacket are adopted to mitigate the impact loads in the continuous load transfer process for the first transfer procedure the topside is supported by the dsus on the transportation barge positioned with five mooring lines then the installation barges approach to the transportation barge from its portside and starboard simultaneously and the dsus on the installation barges are aligned with the support points of topside with the aid of the tether lines surge fenders and sway fenders after that the transportation barge increases its draft through the ballasting operation to transfer the topside to the installation barges while the drafts of the installation barges remain constant via the de ballasting operation and the transferred weight of the topside is neutralized with the de ballasting water finally the topside is fully supported by the installation barges and the transportation barge is towed away after the dsus separating from the stabbing pins of topside with adequate clearances this continuous load transfer process is referred to as case b2b in this paper as illustrated in fig 1 b for the second transfer procedure the installation barges carrying the topside approach to the pre installed jacket from two sides with the help of the mooring lines tether lines and winches the stabbing pins of topside are aligned with the lums on the jacket then the topside weight is gradually transferred from the installation barges to the fixed jacket with the barge ballasting operation finally the topside is installed on the jacket and the installation barges are towed away from the jacket when the clearances between the support points and dsus are large enough this continuous load transfer process is referred to as case b2j in this paper as shown in fig 1 c it should be mentioned that the gaps between the transportation barge installation barges and jacket are not larger than 1 0 m in these two cases as illustrated in fig 2 in case b2b the clearances between the support points of topside and the dsus on installation barges are only 1 0 m in the pre mating stage in case b2j the clearances between the stabbing pins of topside and lmus on the jacket are only 0 7 m in the pre mating stage the impact loads between the topside barges and jacket are remarkable and the relative motion response of topside and barges may beyond the capture range of the dsus and lmus therefore the clearances between the support points stabbing pins dsus and lmus are critical for the float over installation the model tests should be carefully designed to capture the dynamic motions of the topside and barges and the impact loads on the dsus and lmus accurately to validate the feasibility of the twin barge float over installation the relative motions of topside and barges in the pre mating stage and the dynamic response of the float over system in the mating and post mating stages are investigated in the model tests for the dynamic response of the large scaled structure usually governed by the gravitational effect and inertia forces froude s and strouhal s laws are employed to relate the model to the prototype the scale of 1 40 is selected by considering the dimension of the jacket platform barges gaps and wave basin 2 2 topside and jacket the jacket platform adopted in this study is assumed to service at sea area with a depth of 25 0 m the topside weighs 10 000 tons with three decks and it is 81 0 m in length 50 0 m in breadth and 21 35 m in height the topside is supported by six legs used for mating with the dsus on transportation barge and the lmus on fixed jacket in the twin barge float over installation operation in addition six support points exist outside the legs adopted to mating with the dsus on installation barges it should be mentioned that the longitudinal center of gravity cog of the topside is 5 0 m away from its mid section due to the existence of the helicopter deck and this may cause different impact loads on various dsus and lmus in the continuous load transfer process the jacket is 32 0 m in length 30 2 m in breadth and 33 4 m in height the sketch diagrams of the topside and jacket are presented in fig 3 and the main particulars of the topside are summarized in table 1 2 3 transportation and installation barges the transportation barge adopted in the model tests is a t shaped barge whose breath at the bow is smaller than that at the stern the t shaped barge is 180 0 m in length 36 0 m in breadth at the bow 52 5 m in breadth at the stern and 12 75 m in depth as illustrated in fig 4 a the installation barges are two semi submersible barges with a length of 153 2 m a breadth of 38 0 m and a depth of 9 0 m as presented in fig 4 b for case b2b the draft of the transportation barge and installation barges are 8 55 m and 5 0 m in the pre mating stage where the transportation barge fully supports the topside the draft of the transportation barge increases with the help of the rapid ballasting system while the drafts of the installation barges remain constant with the aid of the rapid de ballasting system and the topside weight is transferred from the transportation barge to the installation barges gradually the draft of the transportation barge and installation barges will reach to 11 5 m and 5 0 m in the post mating stage of case b2b where the topside is fully supported by the installation barges for case b2j the drafts of the installation barges are 5 0 m in the pre mating stage and it increases to 6 85 m in the post mating stage the main particulars of the transportation and installation barges in the pre mating and post mating stages are listed in table 2 2 4 mooring system the mooring system is first designed based on the authors experience and then calibrated and optimized through the numerical simulation the lengths and diameters of mooring lines and tethers can be determined in the optimization process and other parameters can be derived using the empirical relationships provided by the manufacturer in case b2b the transportation barge is positioned with one mooring chain and four mooring wires as illustrated in fig 5 a the mooring chain m3 is along with the x axis and the mooring wires m1 and m2 are symmetrical with the mooring wires m5 and m4 respectively the angle between mooring wire m1 and x axis is 135 while the angle between mooring wire m2 and x axis is 90 the installation barges connect to the transportation barge with four tether lines t1 t4 as illustrated in fig 5 a the tether lines adopted in the model tests are high modulus polyethylene ropes in case b2j the installation barges are positioned with six spreading mooring wires and they are connected to the fixed jacket with four tether lines t5 t8 as illustrated in fig 5 b the layout of mooring system is symmetrical about x axis and the angles between mooring wires m6 m7 m8 and x axis are 148 112 and 67 respectively table 3 provides the main particulars of the mooring system the tether lines provide restoring force mainly through their material elasticity as shown in fig 6 a a linear spring is attached to the top end of tether line to make the axial stiffness of tether line model identical to those of prototype ones equivalently for ensuring the hydrodynamic loads on the mooring line models are equivalently identical to those on the prototype ones the diameter of mooring line is determined according to the prototype one firstly then a linear spring is attached to the top end of mooring line to make the axial stiffness of the mooring line model identical to those of the prototype ones equivalently furthermore a series of small weights are attached along the mooring lines evenly to make the dry weight of the mooring lines to be identical to the target ones as illustrated in fig 6 b before carrying out the model tests in the wave basin the characteristics of mooring line models should be calibrated first the mooring line models were installed according to the design radius with an azimuth angle equal to zero then the top end of the mooring line was moved horizontally along x direction to different positions such as 0 025 m in the model scale the top tension horizontal displacement curve of mooring line model can be obtained by repeating the same procedures fig 7 provides the comparison results of the characteristics of mooring line models and target ones one can find that the characteristics of mooring line models are in good agreement with the target ones which indicates that the mooring line models satisfy the requirement of experiments and the simulation results are accurate 3 continuous load transfer simulation method in the twin barge float over installation the topside weight is first transferred from the transportation barge to installation barges gradually as the draft of transportation barge increases and it is then transferred from the installation barges to fixed jacket as the drafts of installation barges increase thus the load transfer procedure is definitely a continuous process however this continuous process is usually divided into several individual stages in the numerical simulations and model tests because it is difficult to simulate therefore it is worried that the conventional simulation methods might not demonstrate all the complex behaviors of twin barge float over installation in this paper a remote rapid de ballasting system based on the intelligent algorithm is provided to change the ballasting status of the transportation and installation barges continuously and automatically so that the load transfer process can be simulated in a continuous manner in addition several shock absorbers with adjustable horizontal and vertical constraint components including the dsus lmus surge fenders and sway fenders are carefully designed to simulate the interactions in the float over system accurately and smooth the continuous load transfer process 3 1 remote rapid de ballasting system the remote rapid de ballasting system comprises two subsystems a de ballasting subsystem and a remote control subsystem the de ballasting subsystem consists of tanks small pumps pipelines and flow sensors as presented in fig 8 in the model tests twelve tanks are provided in transportation barge and six tanks are provided in installation barges the tanks in the transportation barge are deployed symmetrically and the tanks in symmetrical positions are connected with a pipeline to avoid the transverse cog of barge to apart away from its mid section there are six ballasting pumps placed at the bottom of the transportation barge and connected with the tanks through pipelines for the drafts of installation barges remain constant as the topside is transferred from the transportation barge to installation barges in case b2b three individual tanks are placed in each installation barge with three de ballasting pumps inside to drain the ballast water in these tanks besides another three ballasting pumps are placed outside the installation barges to fill these tanks with ballasting water to increase its drafts in case b2j for getting the information of de ballasting water volume in time twelve flow sensors are attached to the pipelines near the de ballasting pumps the remote control subsystem consists of a remote control terminal a microcomputer an electromagnetic relay and a wireless network as illustrated in fig 9 the remote control terminal and microcomputer are adopted to control the whole system and the electromagnetic relay is utilized to control the switch of de ballasting pumps the microcomputer and electromagnetic relay are connected by cables and placed in the cabin of the transportation barge while the remote control terminal is placed outside of the wave basin and connected with the microcomputer through the wireless network the de ballasting scheme code is first compiled in the remote control terminal and then the related results are sent to the microcomputer the electromagnetic relay receives signals from the microcomputer and switches on or shuts down the pumps simultaneously the feedback information of the flow sensors is sent to the remote control terminal in real time and the de ballasting scheme will be changed according to the ballasting status of the transportation and installation barges in case b2b the draft of transportation barge increases from 0 21 m to 0 29 m in model scale and the corresponding ballast water is 516 0 kg the topside weighs 152 44 kg and is fully supported by the installation barges in the post mating stage to maintain the draft of installation barges the de ballasting water of each installation barge should reach 76 2 kg in case b2j the drafts of installation barges increase from 0 13 m to 0 17 m in model scale and the corresponding ballasting water is 218 0 kg which is beyond the maximum capacity of the designed tanks in the installation barges therefore only part of the load transfer process is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the continuous load transfer simulation method in case b2j the details of the de ballasting tanks are documented in table 4 3 2 dsus and lmus with adjustable constraint components the dsu is the equipment mounted on the barge deck to support the topside and the lmu is the equipment installed on the jacket to mate with the stabbing pins of topside all of them are designed as shock absorbers to mitigate the impact loads between the topside and barges or jacket and limit the vertical and horizontal motions of the topside during the float over installation generally the lmu consists of a steel structure incorporated horizontal and vertical elastomers to achieve a specific spring rate and damping the dsu mounted on the installation barge has similar components to the lmu while the horizontal elastomer of dsu fixed on the transportation barge are replaced with the friction material in the receptor cone chen et al 2017 the schematic diagrams of prototype and physical model of the lmu and dsu adopted in model tests are illustrated in fig 10 in this study the dimensions of dsu and lmu are identical to those of dsu and lmu adopted in the float over installation practice of liwan 3 1 mega topside in the south china sea while the stiffnesses of the vertical elastomers in dsu and lmu are determined based on the weight of topside and stroke of dsu and lmu the weight of topside is 9 8 10 7 n and it is supported by six dsus and lmus according to the engineering practice the vertical elastomer in dsu will be fully compressed if the load on dsu is over 30 weight of topside and the vertical elastomer in lmu will be fully compressed if the load on lmu is over 70 weight of topside in the paper the vertical stroke of dsu and lmu is 0 30 m therefore the average stiffness of the vertical elastomers in dsu and lmu should be identical to 1 63 10 7 n m and 3 81 10 7 n m respectively however the longitudinal cog of the topside is 5 0 m away from its mid section and the weight of topside supported by different dsus and lmus is various to make sure the compressed value of vertical elastomer consistent for different dsus and lmus the stiffnesses of vertical elastomer in dsu d3 d6 d2 d5 and d1 d4 are set to 2 53 10 7 n m 1 60 10 7 n m and 7 75 10 6 n m and the stiffnesses of vertical elastomer in lmu j1 j6 j2 j5 and j3 j4 are set to 5 90 10 7 n m 3 37 10 7 n m and 1 71 10 6 n m respectively the dimensions of the dsu and lmu models are scaled from the prototype ones directly the vertical elastomers of the dsu and lmu are simulated with the vertical linear springs and the horizontal elastomers of the lmu are simulated with four horizontal linear springs it should be mentioned that the strokes of the dsu and lmu and the gaps between the stabbing pins and receptor cones are vital important for the impact loads in this paper an adjustable base assembled with vertical spring and receptor cone of dsu and lmu is provided to make the stroke and the gap identical to the target ones accurately as illustrated in fig 10 the main particulars of the dsus and lmus are listed in table 5 before carrying out the model tests in the wave basin the equivalent stiffnesses of the vertical elastomers in dsus and lmus were calibrated in advance the dsus and lmus were mounted on the flat ground and a series of standard weights were put on the top of the dsus and lmus and the vertical displacement of the receptor cones was measured the force and vertical displacement curves of the dsus and lmus were obtained and compared with the target ones the corresponding comparison results are presented in fig 11 from the figure one can find that the characteristics of the dsus agree well with the target ones and the characteristics of the lmus are in reasonable agreement with the target ones although it deviates from the target ones slightly this deviation results from the friction between the horizontal springs and the receptor cones see fig 10 b the results indicate that the dsu and lmu models satisfy the experimental requirements and the impact loads on the dsus and lmus can be simulated accurately 3 3 surge and sway fenders as presented in fig 5 a the installation barges tend to move towards the transportation barge due to the tether line forces in case b2b in the model tests two surge fenders s1 and s2 and eight sway fenders f1 f8 are installed between the transportation and installation barges to limit the relative motions and smooth the continuous load transfer process as illustrated in fig 12 in case b2j the relative motions between the installation barges and topside are constrained by the mooring lines and tether lines the characteristics of the surge fenders and sway fenders are documented in table 6 the diameter of the fender is determined based on the gap between transportation and installation barges and its stiffness is obtained from the rubber fender design manual the surge fender presented in fig 13 a consists of three components an axial load cell a linear spring and two threaded rods the axial load cell is used to measure the impact loads and the linear spring is utilized to simulate the stiffness of fender and the threaded rod is adapted to adjust the pre tension the surge fender is mounted on the deck of the transportation barge with a vertical plate and a horizontal plate and it contacts with another vertical plate fixed on the deck of installation barge as illustrated in fig 13 a the position of the surge fender can be adjusted according to the relative locations of these vertical plates the sway fenders are mounted on the sides of transportation barge to record the impact loads between the transportation and installation barges in the model tests the stiffness of the sway fender is simulated with six small linear springs rather than one large spring to enhance its stability as illustrated in fig 13 b in addition four positioning rods are provided between the installation plates to make the linear springs deform horizontally the stiffnesses of surge fenders and sway fenders in the model scale are measured and compared with the target ones the corresponding results are illustrated in fig 14 from the figure one can see that the measured stiffnesses of the surge fenders and sway fenders are in perfect agreement with the target ones which indicates that the surge and sway fenders satisfy the experimental requirement and the simulation results are accurate 4 experimental configuration 4 1 model set up the model tests are carried out in the wave basin of shandong provincial key laboratory of ocean engineering ocean university of china china the wave basin is 60 0 m in length 36 0 m in breadth 1 50 m in depth and the water depth is 0 625 m in the model tests the wavemaker is installed at one side of wave basin and it is capable of generating regular and irregular waves with wave height range from 0 02 m to 0 25 m and wave period range from 0 5 s to 2 5 s opposite to the wavemaker a wave absorbing beach is installed to reduce the wave reflection as illustrated in fig 15 the physical models were placed at the center of wave basin and the bows of the barges faced the wavemaker the top end of mooring line was connected to the barge decks with a short flexible wire to adjust its pre tension and another end of the mooring line was fixed to the wave basin bed at the designated location the tether line was connected to the barge decks with a short flexible wire to adjust its pre tension the adjustable shock absorbers including the dsus lmus surge fenders and sway fenders were mounted on the barges at the designed location with bolts or glue in case b2b the remote control subsystem was placed on the transportation barge and it was placed on the topside in case b2j the remote control terminal was placed outside of the wave basin together with the data acquisition system 4 2 measuring variables and devices in the model tests the wave elevations structures dynamic motions mooring lines tensions and impact loads in twin barge float over installation operation were measured simultaneously with four different experimental devices the wave elevations were recorded with three wave gauges installed at 9 0 m 18 0 m and 45 0 m away from the wavemaker the motion responses of the topside transportation and installation barges in 6 dofs were captured simultaneously with an ndi optical motion tracking system placed at 4 0 m behind the transportation barge the mooring line tensions were measured with eighteen axial load cells located at the fairlead of the transportation and installation barges besides the impact loads on the surge and sway fenders were recorded with ten axial load cells while the impact loads on the dsus and lmus were measured with eight triaxial load cells which were mounted at the front and back rows of the stabbing pins and support points of topside i e d1 d6 d3 d4 l1 l6 l3 l4 j1 j6 j3 j4 beneath the lowest deck of the topside two micro wireless cameras were glued to monitor the relative motions between the stabbing pins and receptor cones these experimental devices were calibrated before carrying out the model tests in the wave basin 4 3 environmental conditions for fully investigating the hydrodynamic performance and dynamic response of the float over system both the regular and irregular waves were simulated in the model tests the regular waves were adopted to calibrate the motion response amplitude operators raos of the transportation and installation barges and the amplitude of these regular waves was set to 1 0 m in the full scale and the corresponding periods range from 4 0 s to 12 0 s at 0 25 s intervals in the full scale the irregular waves were adopted to investigate the dynamic responses of the float over system and validate the effectiveness of the twin barge float over installation the jonswap spectrum was utilized to depict the wave energy distribution of irregular waves and the significant wave heights and spectral peak periods of the target irregular waves are summarized in table 7 it should be mentioned that only the wave is of concern and the influence of wind and current are disregarded in this study generally the significant wave height in the float over installation should be small enough to ensure its safety such as 1 0 m for head wave 0 75 m for quarter wave and 0 5 m for beam wave in the present experiment the significant wave height was set to 1 5 m for the head wave to examine the feasibility of the twin barge float over installation the regular and irregular waves were calibrated before carrying out the model tests the measured wave elevation and spectrum were compared with the target ones and the results are plotted in fig 16 it can be observed that the measured wave elevations agree well with the target ones for the regular waves and the spectrum of the measured stochastic wave elevation is in good agreement with the target spectrum therefore the regular and irregular waves were simulated accurately and can be adopted to investigate the hydrodynamic performance and dynamic response of the float over system 5 pre testing results 5 1 free decay tests in calm water the free decay tests were carried out in calm water for heave roll and pitch modes to validate the inertia moment and obtain the viscous damping since the displacement of transportation and installation barges are very large the initial offsets in heave and pitch modes are very small and they decay to zero in a very short time therefore only the free decay curves of transportation and installation barges in roll mode are presented in fig 17 based on the free decay results one can obtain the natural period of the transportation and installation barge in roll mode which are 10 0 s and 6 4 s respectively in addition the motion response of the transportation and installation barges under a set of regular waves with unit amplitude and various periods are numerically investigated via the dnv sesam software and the natural period of the transportation and installation barges are calculated the numerical results show that the natural periods of barges in roll mode are 9 8 s and 6 5 m which are very close to the values obtained from the free decay results and these indicate that the inertia moments of the physical models match well with the target ones the non dimensional damping coefficients of the transportation and installation barges in roll mode are 0 062 and 0 141 which can be applied to the hydrodynamic analysis and coupled dynamic analysis in numerical simulations 5 2 raos tests in regular waves to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of the transportation and installation barges the transportation barge with four horizontal springs was first deployed in the wave basin alone and its motion responses under a set of regular waves with unit amplitude and various periods were measured with the ndi optical motion tracking system after that the installation barge a with four horizontal springs was further deployed in the wave basin alone and its motion responses under a set of regular waves with unit amplitude and various periods were measured with the same devices the motion raos of the transportation and installation barges in six dofs were obtained based on their motion responses the motion responses of transportation and installation barges were investigated separately and thus the shielding effect and gap resonance caused by multi barge do not exist for comparison purposes the motion raos of transportation barge was first investigated alone with the dnv sesam software then the motion raos of installation barge a were further investigated alone via the commercial software in the numerical simulation the three dimension radiation diffraction theory assuming an ideal fluid is adopted to evaluate the hydrodynamic loads on the free floating structure and the damping characteristics obtained from free decay tests are included in the numerical simulation to consider the damping effect of fluid the motion raos of structure can be calculated using the motion equation of structure if the hydrodynamic loads are readily computed the roll raos in beam regular wave and the pitch raos in head regular wave resulted from numerical simulation and model tests are illustrated in figs 18 and 19 respectively it should be mentioned that the forward speed effects of barge are not considered when the motion raos are calculated if barge s forward speed is considered the motion amplitude of barge in heave and pitch modes will increase as the speed increases while the motion amplitude of barge in roll mode will decrease as the speed increases in addition the frequency of barge motion response will be the encounter frequency which is closely related to barge s speed from the figures one can find that the motion raos of the transportation and installation barges resulted from the model tests are in satisfactory agreement with those resulted from the numerical simulation since both of them do not consider the shielding effect and gap resonance caused by multi body therefore the physical models of the transportation barge and installation barges were fabricated accurately and satisfied the requirement of experiments 6 dynamic response and impact loads under irregular waves in the model tests two typical cases related to the continuous load transfer process were investigated one is case b2b where the topside is transferred from the transportation barge to installation barges and another one is case b2j where the topside is transferred from the installation barges to pre installed jacket at the beginning of pre mating stage of case b2b and b2j the relative motion between the support points stabbing pins of topside and the receptor cones of dsus lmus were investigated firstly to check the support points stabbing pins within the capture range of the receptor cones or not as illustrated in fig 20 a at the pre mating mating and post mating stage of case b2b and b2j the dynamic motions and the impact loads of the float over system were measured to further investigate the dynamic responses in the continuous load transfer process of the twin barge float over installation and also to verify the effectiveness of the continuous load transfer simulation method proposed in this study as illustrated in fig 20 b 6 1 relative motions in the pre mating stage 6 1 1 dynamic motions of topside and barges in the pre mating stage the relative motions between the support points stabbing pins of topside and the receptor cones of dsus and lmus are the most significant parameters for the mating operation in float over installation which are usually obtained based on the measured cog motion responses of topside and barges with the help of coordinate transformation technology the coordinate transformation technology is the theorem of relative motions in 6 dofs which can be adapted to calculate the motion response of arbitrary points of the structure based on the cog motion response of structure the cog motion responses and the corresponding power spectral densities psds of topside and transportation barge in surge sway and yaw modes are first investigated and the comparison results are illustrated in fig 21 from the figure one can find that the motion responses of topside and transportation barge in surge and yaw modes are in two distinct frequency regimes namely wave frequency response and low frequency response the nonlinear low frequency motion response of transportation barge is the resonance response caused by second order wave force and it has large amplitude and long period compared to the wave frequency motion response in addition one can also find that the dynamic motions of topside in surge and yaw modes have similar variation trends with those of transportation barge which indicates that the topside moves synchronously with the transportation barge both in amplitude and phase however the dynamic motions of topside in sway mode show different variation trends with those of transportation barge and the motion psd of topside in sway mode has three peaks in low frequency regime after careful comparison between motion psds of topside and transportation barge in the surge sway and yaw modes one can find that the first peak of topside motion psd in sway mode occurs at the 0 02 rad s which is identical to the resonance frequency of transportation barge in yaw mode the second peak of topside motion psd in sway mode occurs at 0 059 rad s which is identical to the resonance frequency of transportation barge in surge mode and the third peak of topside motion psd occurs at 0 074 rad s which corresponds to the resonance frequency of transportation barge in sway mode this is because that the topside is placed at the bow of transportation barge in the model tests see fig 5 a and the surge and yaw motions of transportation barge have a significant influence on the motions of topside it should be mentioned that the sway motion of topside is much larger than that of transportation barge due to the nonlinear resonance between the sway motion of topside and the yaw motion of transportation barge the nonlinearities in the motion response of topside and transportation barge may increase the relative motion response between the stabbing pins of topside and the dsus on transportation barge which is adverse for the mating operation for the topside and installation barge the cog motion responses and the corresponding psds of installation barges in the surge sway and yaw modes are further investigated and the comparison results are illustrated in fig 22 in this paper the installation barge at the port side of transportation barge is referred as installation barge a and another installation barge is referred as installation barge b see fig 5 it can be seen from the figure that the motion responses of installation barges are the co existence of wave frequency and low frequency motion response where the wave frequency motion response is related to first order wave force but the low frequency motion response is related to the low frequency motion response of transportation barge this is because that the installation barges connect to the transportation barge with the tether lines and fenders and the motion response of transportation barge have significant influence on the motion response of installation barges in addition the tether lines and fenders between the transportation barge and installation barges can shift the horizontal natural period of installation barge from dominated period of second order wave force and the low frequency resonance response caused by the second order wave force can be avoided furthermore the motion psds of installation barge show that the peaks of motion psds in the surge sway and yaw modes occur at 0 02 rad s which is identical to the resonance frequency of transportation barge in yaw mode therefore one can conclude that the low frequency motion responses of installation barges result from the low frequency motion response of transportation barge the figure shows that the motion responses of installation barge a in the surge sway and yaw modes have similar variation trends with those of installation barge b this indicates that the motion response of installation barges in surge sway and yaw modes almost remain synchronized under head irregular wave as illustrated in fig 5 a the installation barges locate at the bow of transportation barge and hence the yaw motion of transportation barge has a significant influence on the sway motion responses of installation barges generally the motion response of the installation barge in sway mode is much larger than that of the transportation barge which is adverse for the mating of the support points and receptor cones in the continuous load transfer process in addition the nonlinear interaction between the topside transportation barge and installation barges make the motion responses of topside and installation barges asynchronous which may lead to the failure of the mating process between topside and installation barge 6 1 2 relative motions of supporting points and receptor cones based on the cog motion response of topside and installation barges the motion response of support points of topside and the receptor cones of dsus on installation barges are calculated with the aid of coordinate transformation technology the motion responses of support point 1 of topside and dsu l1 on installation barge are illustrated in fig 23 from the figure one can see that the low frequency motion responses of support point 1 in the surge and sway modes are almost identical to those of dsu l1 but some discrepancies are observed between the wave frequency motion responses of support point 1 and dsu l1 in surge and sway modes therefore one can deduce that the horizontal relative motion response of support point 1 and dsu l1 is mainly caused by the discrepancies of wave frequency motion response the relative motion responses of support point 1 and dsu l1 are further calculated based on the motion responses of support point 1 and dsu l1 in surge and sway modes and the results are presented in fig 24 from the figure one can find that the relative motion responses of support point 1 and dsu l1 in surge and sway modes are tri modal non gaussian processes the first peak of the relative motion response psd occurs at 0 059 rad s which is related to the low frequency motion response of transportation barge the second peak of relative motion response psd occurs at 0 247 rad s which is caused by the nonlinear interaction between the transportation and installation barges the third peak of relative motion response psd occurs at 0 948 rad s which is the wave frequency component related to the input stochastic input wave one can also find that the relative motion response is dominated by its wave frequency components and the maximum relative motion response between support point 1 and dsu l1 is smaller than 0 35 m which is less than the capture range of the receptor cone as expected similar variation trends can be found for the relative motion responses between supports points and dsus and the results are not shown here due to the space limitations to investigate the feasible of the pre mating stage of twin barge float over installation the maximum value and exceedance probabilities of horizontal relative motion response between the support points of topside and dsus on installation barge in case b2b are illustrated in fig 25 in the figure the symbol max refers to the maximum value of horizontal relative motion response and the symbol pe refers to the exceedance probability of horizontal relative motion response above the threshold of 0 35 m which is corresponding to the radius of dsu s receptor cone as can be seen from the figure that the horizontal relative motion responses are very sensitive to the spectral peak period of irregular waves the maximum values of horizontal relative motion response under the irregular wave with spectral peak period of 8 0 s are smaller than those under the irregular wave with spectral peak period of 7 0 s but they are much larger than those under the irregular wave with spectral period of 6 0 s the exceedance probabilities of the horizontal relative motion response above the threshold of 0 35 m are smaller than 0 02 0 53 and 0 43 under the irregular wave with spectral period of 6 0 s 7 0 s and 8 0 s respectively this means that most of the horizontal relative motion responses between the support points of topside and the dsus on installation barge are smaller than the radius of dsus receptor cone and the horizontal relative motion response are within an acceptable limit in the investigated conditions although the maximum value over the threshold the maximum values of horizontal relative motion response between the stabbing pins of topside and lmus on the jacket in case b2j are provided in fig 26 from the figure one can find that the maximum values of the horizontal relative motion associated with different lmus for case b2j are about 0 4 m which are much smaller than those related to the dsus for case b2b therefore the mating process of stabbing pins of topside and receptor cones of lmus becomes more accessible due to the fixed lmus to fully investigate the effects of wave direction deviations on the relative motions response the dynamic responses of the float over system under head wave are first numerically investigated and the maximum horizontal relative motions resulted from the numerical simulation are compared with those resulted from model tests the comparison results are illustrated in fig 27 a and b it can be seen from the figure that the maximum horizontal relative motions resulted from the numerical simulation are close to those resulted from the model tests for case b2b and case b2j this means that the numerical model adopted in this study can predict the dynamic response of the float over system accurately the dynamic motion responses of the float over system under the quarter and beam waves are further numerical investigated the significant wave height and spectral period of the quarter wave are 1 0 m and 6 0 s while the significant wave height and spectral period of the beam wave are 0 50 m and 6 0 s respectively the maximum horizontal relative motions under the head quarter and beam waves are compared and the results are presented in fig 27 c and d from the figure one can find that the wave direction has significantly influences on the maximum horizontal relative motion for case b2b the maximum horizontal relative motion between support points of topside and dsus on installation barge under the head wave is much smaller than those under the quarter wave and both of them are much smaller than those under beam wave the reason is that the sway and roll motion responses of transportation and installation barges under the beam wave are much larger than those under quarter and beam waves furthermore the larger sway and roll motion response can cause severe nonlinear interaction between the topside transportation barge and installation barges which may increase the horizontal relative motion significantly for case b2j the maximum horizontal relative motion between the stabbing pins of topside and lmus on jacket under the head wave is smaller than those under the beam wave while both of them are much smaller than those under the quarter wave this is because that the topside is fully supported by the installation barge in case b2j and the topside and installation barges are motion together like one rigid body in surge and sway modes the sway and roll motion responses of topside and installation barge under the beam wave are larger than those under the head wave but they are much smaller than those under the quarter wave due to the changing of float over system s resistance therefore the maximum horizontal relative motions under beam wave are much larger than those under the head wave but they are much smaller than those under the quarter wave 6 2 dynamic motions and impact loads in continuous load transfer process 6 2 1 heave dynamic motions of topside and barges generally the duration of the process with the topside weight transferring is about 2 5 h of which the continuous load transfer process is about 1 5 h in case b2b the draft of transportation barge increases with the help of the remote rapid ballasting system and the draft of the installation barges remain constant with the aid of the remote rapid de ballasting system and the topside is transferred from the transportation barge onto the installation barges gradually fig 28 provides the heave dynamic motion responses of the topside transportation barge and installation barges in the continuous load transfer process in case b2b in the figure the upper middle and lower figure plates are the heave dynamic motion responses of the transportation barge topside and installation barges under the head irregular wave with the spectral peak period of 6 0 s 7 0 s and 8 0 s respectively there are five features worthy of attention in this figure first the mean values of heave dynamic motion response of transportation barge and topside decrease continuously as the remote rapid ballasting system working while the mean value of heave dynamic motion responses of installation barges remain constant as the remote repaid de ballasting system working this indicates that the draft of transportation barge can increase continuously and the draft of installation barges can remain constant through the remote rapid de ballasting system and the load transfer process can be simulated in a continuous manner in the model tests second the ballasting rates of transportation barge are different at various times the ballasting rate during the first 2000 s is larger than that in the following 4000 s while the ballasting rate drops to zero in the post mating stage where the stabbing pins of topside separate entirely from the receptor cones of dsus on the transportation barge third the mean value of the heave dynamic motion responses of the transportation barge is designed to gradually increase its draft by 1 95 m from 9 55 m to 11 5 m during the continuous load transfer process in the model tests the mean values of heave dynamic motion responses of the transportation barge decrease from 0 m to 2 16 m 2 19 m and 2 12 m within 6000s under an irregular wave with spectral peak periods of 6 0s 7 0s and 8 0s respectively in another word the draft of transportation barge increases about 2 16 m 2 19 m and 2 12 m respectively the discrepancies of the designed values and model test values are about 0 005 m 0 006 m and 0 004 m in model scale and both of them are within the allowable error of the experiment fourth the decreasing variation trend of the heave dynamic motion response of the topside disappears around 5000 s of the continuous load transfer process and this means that the topside is fully supported by the dsus on installation barges it should be mentioned that the vertical stroke of the dsus on installation barge is 0 3 m and the depth of the receptor cones is about 0 35 m in the model tests the topside is lowered about 0 72 m 0 66 m and 0 75 m under the irregular wave with spectral peak periods of 6 0s 7 0s and 8 0s respectively the difference between the designed values and model test values are about 0 002 m 0 001 m and 0 003 m in model scale and both of them are within the admissible values fifth one can find that the amplitude of the heave dynamic motion of the transportation barge topside and installation barge increases as irregular wave spectral peak periods increase this means that the input wave has a significant influence on the heave dynamic motion response of the float over system 6 2 2 pitch dynamic motions of topside and barges to make the support points of topside to mate with the receptor cones of dsus on installation barges as soon as possible in case b2b the de ballasting schemes are carefully designed to make the transportation barge tilt to its bow the pitch motion responses of topside and barges in the continuous load transfer process are illustrated in fig 29 in the figure the upper middle and lower figure plates are the pitch dynamic motion responses of the transportation barge topside and installation barges under head irregular wave with spectral peak periods of 6 0 s 7 0 s and 8 0 s respectively from the figure one can find that the transportation barge tilts to its bow and the installation barge tilts to its stern gradually as the rapid ballasting system working the mean pitch motion responses of transportation barge reach 0 40 0 38 and 0 42 at around 2000 s of the continuous load transfer process and then remains constant under the irregular wave with spectral peak periods of 6 0 s 7 0 s and 8 0s in addition different from the pitch dynamic motion response of the transportation barge the mean pitch motion responses of the installation barges reach 0 47 0 41 and 0 39 at around 5000 s of the continuous load transfer process under the irregular wave with spectral peak periods of 6 0s 7 0s and 8 0s which is corresponding to moment that the topside is fully supported by the installation barges furthermore the pitch motion responses of the topside reach 0 97 1 05 and 0 58 at around 5000s of the continuous load transfer process under the irregular wave with periods of 6 0s 7 0s and 8 0s therefore the pitch motion responses of transportation barge topside and installation barges are very small and both of them are within the admissible values it should be mentioned that the pitch motion responses of transportation and installation barge are definitely the nonlinear motion responses and the nonlinearities in the motion responses can lead to different impact loads on various dsus in addition the stabbing bins of topside separate from the dsus on transportation barge at different moments due to the nonlinear motion response of transportation and installation barges in pitch mode and this may cause the collision between the stabbing pins and dsus 6 2 3 vertical impact loads on the dsus and lmus in the continuous load transfer process of case b2b the support points of topside will contact with the receptor cones of dsus on installation barges and the stabbing pins of topside will separate from the receptor cones of dsus on transportation barge therefore the impact loads between the support points stabbing pins and dsus are inevitable among the impact loads the vertical impact load is the most important for it is related to the transferred weight of the topside fig 30 illustrates the vertical impact loads on the dsus of transportation barge and installation barges in case b2b in the figure the upper middle and lower figure plates are the vertical impact loads on dsus of transportation and installation barges under head irregular waves with spectral peak periods of 6 0 s 7 0 s and 8 0 s respectively as illustrated in the figure the vertical impact loads on dsus of transportation barge decrease as the draft of transportation barge increases while the vertical impact loads on the dsus of installation barges show the opposite variation trends these indicate that the topside weight is transferred from transportation barge to installation barge gradually the vertical impact loads on the dsus of transportation barge approach to zeros and those on the dsus of installation barges reach their maximum value at around 6000s in the continuous load transfer process this means that the load transfer process is complete and the topside is fully supported by the dsus on installation barges it is worth noting that the impact loads on the dsus of transportation barge at the beginning of load transfer process and the impact loads on the dsus of installation barge at the ending of load transfer process are different for various dsus because the longitudinal cog of the topside is 5 0 m away from its mid section however the vertical impact loads on the dsus deployed in symmetric locations have similar variation trends taking the dsus d3 and d4 as an example the impact loads on dsus d3 and d4 are increases synchronous as the draft of the transportation barge increases interestingly the separation of the stabbing pins of topside and the receptor cones of dsus is asynchronous and the dsu with smaller initial vertical impact loads separates first one can find that there also exists a turning point at about 2000 s of the continuous load transfer process which attributes to the bow trimmed of the transportation barge as illustrated in fig 29 in addition the spectral peak periods of input irregular waves have a significant influence on the vertical impact loads on the dsus and the amplitude of vertical impact loads on the dsus changes dramatically in the early stage of the continuous load transfer process the maximum impact loads on dsus under the different irregular waves are extracted and the results are presented in fig 31 from the figure one can find that the maximum values of the impact load on dsus of transportation barge are 2 07 10 7 n 2 23 10 7 n and 2 36 10 7 n under the irregular wave with spectral peak periods of 6 0s 7 0s and 8 0s respectively while the maximum values of impact load on the dsus of installation barges are 2 20 10 7 n 2 16 10 7 n and 2 20 10 7 n under the irregular wave with spectral peak periods of 6 0s 7 0s and 8 0s respectively the dsus and lmus adopted in this study are identical to those adopted in the float over installation practice of liwan 3 1 mega topside in the south china sea except for the stiffnesses and the ultimate strength of the dsu and lmu in this practice is about 4 107 n the ratio of ultimate strength to maximum impact load is about 1 70 which is much larger than the safety factor 1 20 specified by the design code therefore the impact loads on dsus and lmus are within the admissible values in the continuous load transfer process of case b2j the stabbing pins of the topside will contact the receptor cones of the lmus on jacket and the support points of the topside will separate from the receptor cones of the dsus on installation barge the vertical impact loads on dsus and lmus are measured and the results are presented in fig 32 as described in section 3 1 the draft of the installation barge will increase from 0 13 m to 0 17 m in the model scale and the corresponding ballast water is 218 0 kg which is beyond the maximum capacity of the designed tanks in the installation barges therefore only part of the load transfer process is carried out in the model tests the drafts of the installation barges at the beginning of the continuous load transfer process are adjusted to the designed ones with the solid ballasting material and hence the initial vertical impact loads on the lmus and the final vertical impact loads on dsus are not identical to zero from the figure one can find that the vertical impact loads on the dsus decrease continuously as the drafts of installation barges increase while the vertical impact loads on the lmus increase continuously as the drafts of the installation barges increase the initial vertical impact loads on the dsus are identical to the final vertical impact loads on the lmus this means that the weight of topside is transferred from the installation barges to the pre installed jacket gradually and the load transfer process can be simulated in a continuous manner with the method proposed in this paper the most important feature is that there exists remarkable collision between the stabbing pins of topside and the receptor cones of the lmus in the continuous load transfer process which are not captured in case b2b therefore more attention should be paid to multi body interaction in the twin barge float over installation operation by considering the continuous load transfer effect 7 conclusions in this paper the dynamic motion responses and impact loads in the continuous load transfer process of the twin barge float over installation are investigated with the scaled model tests the key features of the model tests are that a remote rapid de ballasting system is proposed to change the ballasting status of transportation barge and installation barges automatically and continuously and several adjustable shock absorbers are provided to mitigate the impact loads and smooth the continuous load transfer process two typical continuous load transfer processes in the twin barge float over installation operation are simulated in the model tests and the dynamic motion responses and impact loads of the float over system are measured and investigated according to the study of this paper some main conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the dynamic motion response of the topside transportation barge and installation barges are multi modal non gaussian response and there exists significant yaw surge yaw sway coupling effects between the transportation barge and installation barges the relative motions between the support points stabbing pins and the dsus lmus are within an acceptable limit for all the investigated conditions 2 the mean value of heave dynamic motion response of the topside and transportation barge increases continuously while the mean value of dynamic motion response of the topside remains constant as the remote rapid de ballasting system working the proposed method is a useful tool for simulation of the continuous load transfer process in the twin barge float over installation operation 3 the vertical impact loads on the dsus of transportation barge increase continuously and the vertical impact loads on the dsus of installation barge decrease continuously as the draft of the transportation barge increases in case b2b while the vertical impact loads on the dsus of installation barges decrease continuously and the vertical impact loads on the lmus of jacket increase continuously as the draft of installation barges increase in case b2j 4 it is interesting that the topside load transfer rate is closely related to the trim angle of the transportation barge and the load transfer gets faster and the vertical impact loads get larger as the trim angle increases in addition the separation between the stabbing pins of topside and the receptor cones of dsus is asynchronous and the dsus with smaller initial vertical impact loads separate first credit authorship contribution statement wei tao conceptualization methodology software validation writing original draft writing review editing shuqing wang validation

20589,the wave induced dynamic pressures under the deck and the global wave forces and moments on an offshore platform model were measured for three different model orientations and for partial and full green water conditions in random wave fields of different energy levels it is found that for partial and full green water conditions the global vertical wave force dominates when compared to horizontal wave forces the orientation of the structure to wave direction has some effect only for 22 5 orientation of the deck to wave direction shoreward maximum wave force can reach 3 times the maximum seaward wave force for zero air gap condition the highest value of normalized peak vertical force can reach a value of 42 which is 5 times higher than the normalized significant uplift force value the normalized downward peak force value can reach as high as 8 for full green water condition due to the weight of overrunning water staying on the top of deck slab for zero air gap condition

structure will avoid the partial or full green water condition during extreme wave activity and the associated failures of the structure components and loss of human life it is reported that during 2004 2005 126 offshore structures were destroyed due to severe wave impacts and more than 183 other marine structures were severely damaged within the gulf of mexico due to hurricanes ivan katrina and rita kaiser et al 2009 the world has seen many failures of different offshore drilling platforms due to green water conditions kvitrud and løland 2018 according to api 2002 the minimum air gap of 1 5 m between the crest of 100 year return period wave height and the bottom of the lowest deck of the platform is required to prevent wave impact under the deck it is however suggested by raaij 2005 that 1 5 m air gap recommended by api rp 2a is inconsistent when considering the reliability of the offshore structures this has resulted in selection of higher air gaps for design waves of 10 000 year return periods scharnke et al 2014 the air gap of an offshore platform may reduce compared to the actual design value because of subsidence of the structure due to reservoir compaction broughton and horn 1987 and iwanowski et al 2002 sea level rise and vertical thermal expansion of sea surface due to increased global warming similar reduction of air gap is possible for floating offshore structures due to unexpected increase in weight of operational logistics or flooding of compartments due to possible damage during operation winsor 2002 the air gap reduction happens even for tlp platforms due to local subsidence of foundation and rising sea level in such situation the impact load under the deck will result in significant increase in tension on the tether lines and significant reduction in tension due to downward force this oscillatory vertical motion with significant upward and downward force change on the tether lines may lead to its failures it is also important not to provide high air gap value since it will unnecessarily increase the total cost of the offshore platforms though a large number of studies were carried out on wave forces on offshore platforms very few studies were reported on wave interaction by abnormal wave conditions some of the promising studies on this area since 1967 are by goda 1967 wang 1970 el ghamry 1971 guo and cai 1980 wang et al 1998 ren and wang 2002 2003 2005 zhou and chen 2004 ding et al 2008 iwanowski et al 2009 kendom et al 2010 and hirdaris et al 2014 the important outcomes of some of the promising literatures are revealed here based on theoretical and experimental studies wang 1970 has suggested simple rules to estimate the uplift pressure under the flat plate for different types of waves based on experimental studies elghamry 1971 revealed that the peak pressures acting under the deck slab follow gaussian distribution and the peak uplift force follows rayleigh distribution the theoretical analysis of wave impact forces on the deck of offshore platform for large waves are compared with measurements by kaplan et al 1995 and fair comparisons were reported murray et al 1997 have measured vertical and horizontal wave forces as well as moment about the transverse direction of a model of a jacket platform with a horizontal deck the deck was shaped as a rectangular box zero crossing analysis was carried out on the measured data and results are reported theoretical and experimental investigations on wave impact loads on horizontal decks of a platform model were carried out by baarholm and faltinsen 2004 wagner based method as well as boundary element methods bem is used it is found that the bem method compared well for the measured impact pressure on the structure wang and ren 1997 and ren and wang 1999 2004 have developed numerical models based on improved volume of fluid method and simulated the wave impact pressures on marine structures colleter 2007 has assessed the breaking wave induced uplift load on the model of the horizontal deck of a wharf using physical and cfd based numerical modeling and reasonable comparisons were reported korobkin 2007 assessed the wave impact forces on a stiff horizontal plate based on the second order wagner theory of wave impact a satisfactory comparison between the theory and the available experimental results was reported the effect of air gap as well as the effect of wave direction on a three dimensional structure were studied by ding et al 2008 and the change in wave impact under the deck is reported for a small air gap condition under the deck of a three legged jack up platform model schellin et al 2011 assessed the loads for unusual wave conditions using a cfd code by solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations scharnke et al 2014 revealed that the level of the deck bottom of many offshore platforms built in the norwegian continental shelf before 2000 have experienced a negative air gap for 10 000 year return period wave crest height a numerical model study and 1 60 scaled physical model study was carried out to assess the wave in deck impact loads it is revealed that measured loads and the simplified load prediction model based on the usage of stokes 5th order wave theory misjudge the measured horizontal deck loads abdussamie et al 2014 assessed the vertical impact loading under a deck based on kaplan s method and cfd and found that cfd is better for evaluating the impulsive upward force lee et al 2016 have conducted experimental studies to find out the effect of different shaped protectors like rectangular trapezoidal and round shaped protectors to reduce the impact wave pressures on the deck of platforms abdussamie et al 2017 further measured the local and global wave impact loads on a fixed platform deck using a model it is found that small reductions of 20 mm in the original deck clearance can double the horizontal force and the vertical upward force on the structure the effect of different level of immersion on the wave forces on a modeled coastal structure was measured by park et al 2017 by keeping a constant water depth and for different incident wave periods and wave heights it was found that the horizontal force increased as the model was more deeply immersed and diminished as the model was lifted to larger air gaps above the still water level a detailed numerical study of nonlinear freak wave impact underneath a fixed horizontal deck in 2 d space was carried out by qin et al 2017 the nonlinear freak wave induced impact is investigated with different values of deck clearance above the mean free water surface kvitrud and løland 2018 based on the wave study on norwegian semi submersible and tlp decks reported that upward wave actions have caused many adverse effects like damage to gratings production equipment drilling and lifesaving equipment they have recommended that the design and operation of semi submersible must include considerations of both horizontal and vertical wave actions on decks recently sun et al 2019 investigated on the suction effect during freak wave slamming on a fixed platform deck and found that the suction effect at the bottom of the structure causes strong negative pressure this gravity force pulls the structure down and increases the risk of structural damage based on experiments duong et al 2019 measured wave impact pressure distribution under the deck and global vertical force on fixed offshore structure model for the action of regular waves the velocity fields were also measured under the deck using particle image velocimetry and the results were presented to understand the wave impact phenomena yan et al 2019 investigated on impact pressures due to plunging waves at the front and bottom of a box shaped model structure the experimental investigation was compared to a numerical model and the comparisons were found to be satisfactory stansberg 2020 investigated the effect of wave front steepness and its impact on the horizontal deck impact loads the results show that although there is great random scatter in the measured impact forces especially in the local slamming forces but also in the global forces there is a close relation to the rise velocity ma and swan 2020 have carried out an experimental study of wave in deck loading and its dependence on the properties of incident waves recently fontes et al 2021 carried out a detailed study to understand the evolution of different types of green water events recently dnv has issued revised guidelines such as otg 13 2019 for prediction of air gap for column stabilized units and otg 14 2019 to assess the horizontal wave impact loads for column stabilized units the importance of environmental conditions and environmental loads is further emphasized in the recent dnvgl s rp c205 2019 it is found from these recommendations that standard industry tools are still not capable of predicting the effect of changing the air gap level and the associated local and global wave impact loads on offshore structures the detailed review of literature reveals that the variation of total global wave forces and moments in all three directions inline transverse and vertical and the impact pressures under the deck of offshore platform for different water level conditions a water level well below the deck bottom b still water at the bottom level of deck and c top of deck immersed completely as well as the effect of orientation of the deck to wave direction needs more detailed study hence in the present study an effort is made to fulfill this knowledge gap a model of a typical offshore drilling platform is fabricated and the experiments were conducted to measure the wave impact pressures under the deck as well as the global inline transverse and vertical forces for three different orientations of the offshore platform and for three different water depths still water level well below the deck bottom water level at the deck bottom partial green water condition and water level with full submergence of deck level full green water condition the experiments are carried out for random wave fields of jonswap spectrum of ten different wave energy conditions by appropriate selection of significant wave heights and peak wave periods the results of this study is expected to provide more clear knowledge and understanding of random wave interaction on offshore platforms for partial and full green water conditions and is useful for its optimized design 2 methodology 2 1 general the present work is a typical wave structure interaction problem waves interacting with offshore drilling platform for partial and full green water condition are a complicated physical process the parameters which are essential for cost effective design of offshore drilling platforms are the global wave forces and moments in all three directions wave force in the direction of wave propagation transverse wave force vertical wave force and the 3 moments and the wave induced impact pressures under the deck slab when water level is well below in line with the deck partial green water condition and for complete submergence of the deck full green water condition the offshore drilling platform experiences torsional moments due to changes in wave directions in the laboratory experiments the effect of wave direction can be achieved by rotating the model about its vertical direction the investigation is carried out in the concrete wave flume facility available in the coastal engineering and hydraulic laboratory located in kuwait institute for scientific research kuwait 2 2 model setup fig 1 shows the offshore platform model with four legs and is fabricated using pvc pipes of 11 cm outer diameter and 1 8 mm wall

moments the deck is 110 cm 110 cm x 10 cm thick 10 cm thick slab of the deck is considered as representative for the infrastructures available on the real deck slab of the offshore jacket platform in the field the bottom of the deck is fixed at 150 cm from the flume bottom which represents 30 m water depth in the field three different water depths viz 140 cm deck bottom is 10 cm above still water

are fixed under the deck slab and the location details are provided in this figure three different wave directions 0 22 5 and 45 are used wave directions are achieved by rotating the structure and refixing it firmly with the force sensor 2 3 instrumentation three different instruments are used for measurements in this research work they are wave probes six component force sensor and dynamic

m only five units of underwater pressure transducers each of 0 5 bar capacity were used these sensors were purchased from hr wallingford uk mounted with a flush diaphragm this pressure sensor is suitable to measure wave impact pressures under the deck of structures the diaphragm is 19 mm diameter and output signal is from 0 to 10 v 2 4 calibration wave probes pressure sensors and force sensors are periodically calibrated and the calibration constants were found repeating within 1 2 5 wave flume facility the experimental investigations were carried out in the concrete wave flume facility at the coastal and hydraulic laboratory of coastal management program kuwait institute for scientific research shuwaikh campus the wave flume is as shown in fig 4 the wave flume is 40 0 m long x 2 0 m high x 2 4 m wide it has a bottom hinged flap type wave maker controlled by the wave synthesizer control and data acquisition system of danish hydraulic institute denmark the wave maker has active wave absorption system and is wet back the flume end has an efficient parabolic beach built using rubbles with reflection coefficients less than 2 5 for a wide range of wave periods 2 6 incident wave conditions jonswap spectrum with significant wave heights hs of 5 and 10 cm and peak wave periods tp of 1 0 s 1 5 s 2 0 s 2 5 s and 3 0 s was used for each significant wave height the wavelength lp corresponds to the peak wave period is estimated using the dispersion equation lp 1 56 tp2 tanh 2πd lp the normalized input parameters such as relative wave height hs d incident wave steepness hs lp relative water depth d lp or kpd where kp is the wave number k 2π lp relative pile diameter d lp ursell parameter ur ur hslp 2 d3 and keulegan carpenter number kc kc umax tp d are estimated where umax is the maximum horizontal water particle velocity at free surface level for the selected significant wave height peak period and water depth the present work covers relative wave height hs d from 0 031 to 0 071 the incident wave steepness hs lp from 0 005 to 0 064 moderate to steep waves the relative water depth d lp from 0 141 to 1 034 intermediate water depth to deep water

application conditions can be visualized from these normalized range of input parameters 2 7 wave data collection details the standard data collection duration in the field was 20 min with 1 20 scale the corresponding data collection duration in the lab for random wave was 4 47 min however data was collected for a duration of 6 min for each run the speed of data collection is 100 samples sec for forces and moments and 200 samples sec for wave pressures under the deck to capture the wave impact pressures under the deck the wave data collection was started after crossing of four to five waves at the model section clean incident wave condition without any reflection effect from the model is needed for normalizing all the measured outputs such as dynamic pressures wave forces and moments for this purpose experimental runs were carried out without the model in the wave flume a total of 90 random wave runs were used to cover the effect of wave height wave period structure orientation and water depth effects on wave impact pressures under the deck and the global wave forces and moments on the platform model 2 8 data analysis the dhi wave synthesizer analysis software mikezero was used for data analysis the data measured using wave probe wp1 measured in the absence of the model in the flume were used as incident wave input and the incident wave height hs was determined from these data spectral analysis is used the area under the spectrum i e the zeroth moment of the spectrum mo is used for getting the value of hs using the formula hs 4 mo 1 2 similar procedure is adopted for estimating the wave forces moments and dynamic pressures the significant amplitudes of responses namely significant wave pressures forces and moments is estimated using the following formulas 1 pis 2 mo of dynamic pressure 1 2 where i 1 2 3 4 5 refers to the five pressure transducers under the deck 2 fxs 2 mo of inline force 1 2 3 fys 2 mo of transverse force 1 2 4 fzs 2 mo of vertical force 1 2 5 mxs 2 mo of moment about the y axis 1 2 6 mys 2 mo of moment about the x axis 1 2 7 mzs 2 mo of moment about the z axis 1 2 it is worth to note that mxs is mainly due to the fy and mys is mainly contributed by fx time domain wave up crossing analysis is also carried out on wave pressures forces and moments to select the peak positive as well as negative values the results of this analysis is used to understand how the shoreward and seaward forces differ how the upward and downward force vary and how the vertical upward impact pressure differ from negative downward pressures during wave drawdown from the deck which creates suction activities under the deck as observed by sun et al 2019 this analysis is also used to visualize how much the value of peak pressures and peak impact forces can reach when compared to the significant wave pressures and significant vertical forces especially when the still water level is at the bottom of the deck which is the critical water level condition for wave slamming under the deck 2 9 dimensional analysis for discussion of results and its direct application to the field conditions dimensional analysis is required the inputs are significant wave height hs peak wave period tp water depth d the distance between the still water level and deck bottom s pile diameter d deck dimensions width breadth and thickness and wave direction or structure orientation θ apart from these gravity g fluid density ρ viscosity μ play its role in this wave structure interaction problem the outputs are significant wave forces fxs fys and fzs significant moments mxs mys and msz and significant dynamic pressures p1s p2s p3s p4s and p5s the outputs also are the maximum positive and negatives values of the impact pressures forces and moments the value of s is 10 cm when swl is 10 cm below the deck s 0 when the swl is at deck bottom and s 10 cm when swl is 10 cm above the deck bottom let us carryout the dimensional analysis for one output say fxs which can be extended for all other outputs both for significant values as well as peak values 8 fxs f hs tp d d s deck dimension g ρ μ θ in the present study the significant wave height and peak periods were varied to cover wide range of wave energy levels so that the results can be used for a wide range of sea states using the principle of dimensional analysis the inline significant force coefficient can be expressed in the form 9 fxs ρ g hs a f d lp hs d hs lp d lp s hs θ where a is the cross sectional area of the piles for the model there are four piles each with outer diameter d of 0 11 m hence a 4 π d2 the measured inline force is divided with a weight equal to weight of water displaced by four piles of total cross sectional area a and height hi the above equation can be used for fys and fzs it is not appropriate to use d lp since the study is not for a single pile the normalized moment on the x axis can be expressed as 10 mxs ρ g hs a d f d lp hs d hs lp d lp s hs θ similar equation can be used for mys and mzs for dynamic pressures the results of the analysis yields 11 pis 1 2 ρ g hs f d lp hs d hs lp d lp s hs θ similar equations can be used to study the peak impact pressures under the deck global forces and moments on the structure 3 results and discussions the results on significant and peak wave forces moments and dynamic pressures under the deck of offshore platform due to random waves are presented an attempt is made to answer the following questions what is the effect of different green water conditions on the significant as well as peak global wave forces and moments and the local wave induced dynamic pressures under the deck what is the effect of changing the wave periods on these output parameters what is the effect of change in wave direction or structure orientation on all these output parameters first the results are presented on the significant global wave forces and moments followed by peak wave forces and moments then the results on significant wave pressures under the deck is presented followed by peak wave pressures 3 1 significant wave forces and moments on the offshore platform in this section first typical time series of measured inline and vertical wave forces for a particular input wave condition for different water level is discussed then the effect of different level of green water conditions on global inline transverse and vertical significant wave forces and moments are discussed for a typical short and long waves and for 0 orientation 3 1 1 typical wave force and moment time series it is necessary to visualize the time series of the outcomes of experimental investigation for a fundamental understanding of the problem hence typical time series of wave forces are presented fig 5 a b and 5c shows typical measured inline wave force time series for hs 10 cm tp 2 0 s 0 orientation and for d 140 150 and 160 cm respectively though the data were collected for 360 s the time series plot is provided only for 60 s for more clarity it is found that the inline wave force is the highest for fully submerged deck condition due to maximum exposure of the structure and deck for wave action and is minimum when the deck is well above the water level due to minimum exposure of the deck of the structure for wave interaction the magnitude of the transverse wave force for 0 orientation is much less than 10 of the inline force and hence not provided fig 6 a b and 6c shows the measured vertical wave force time series for the similar input conditions as discussed above the vertical wave force is minimum when the water surface is 10 cm below the bottom of the deck since the waves do not interact with the deck bottom frequently when the bottom of the deck is at water level the uplift force is high and reached about 1300 n for the random wave fields with hs 10 cm mostly the forces are in the upward direction due to lifting and vertical impact effect when waves pass around the deck when the deck is fully immersed in water the measured vertical force is predominantly downward this happens because of green water flooding over the deck which acts downward the uplift force when deck bottom is at water level is almost two times higher than the downward force when the deck is fully submerged the uplift force would transfer to the piles as tension load while the downward force would transfer as compression these stress reversal needs to be considered for appropriate design of the piles as well as for the assessment of depth of penetration into the soil for stability 3 1 2 in line transverse and vertical significant wave forces and moments the relative importance it is important to know the relative importance of the magnitude of the wave forces on three different directions inline fx transverse fy and vertical fz and the moments on the x y and z axis fig 7 a shows the normalized significant wave forces and moments on the model for 00 orientation for three different water levels represented by the relative level of deck bottom s hs 1 0 and 1 for hs 10 cm and tp 1 0 s short period wave represented by deep water wave steepness hs lop 0 064 where lop is the deep water wave length and is equal to gtp 2 2 π it is found from this plot that the normalized significant wave forces fxs or fys or fzs ρ g hs a and normalized significant bending moments mxs or mys or mzs ρ g hs a d are the lowest when the swl is well below the bottom of the deck i e for s hs 1 the inline wave force has doubled and more than tripled for partial green water s hs 0 and full green water s hs 1 conditions among the wave forces the transverse force fys is the smallest and among the moments the moment induced by this force mxs and the torsional moment mzs are the least hence for 00 model orientation it is worth focusing only on fxs fzs and mys the highest value of the significant uplift force coefficient on the deck is closer to 3 0 and occurs when the still water level is at the deck bottom fig 7b is similar plot for long peak wave period of 3 0 s hs lop 0 0071 comparing the magnitude of normalized significant forces and moments between fig 7a and b it is found that the vertical wave force has significantly increased when long period waves acts on the structure for s hs 0 and 1 0 comparing fig 7a and b the vertical wave force coefficient on the deck has increased from 2 8 to 6 2 for s hs 0 and has increased from 2 6 to 10 6 for s hs 1 0 the main reason for such a high increase in significant vertical wave force is that for long waves the complete crest part of the wave acts on the full deck bottom simultaneously whereas for the short wave only a part of the wave crest is found to act on the deck bottom during wave interaction hence enough attention is needed to consider the value of design wave period and its effect on the uplift force on the deck during green water condition it is found that with increase in peak wave period the change in the magnitude of fxs and mys are marginal from fig 7a and b it is found that the value of fy mx and mz is much smaller when compared to fx fz and my hence further discussions are focused only on fx fz and my 3 1 3 effect of orientation of the structure and different green water conditions the effect of orientation of the structure as well as different green water conditions on the significant wave forces and moments are descried in this section first the effect of no green water condition is explored followed by partial green water condition and then the full green water condition 3 1 3 1 no green water condition the bottom of the deck above the free water surface s hs 1 the effect of orientation of the structure on the normalized global significant wave forces and moments for a wide range of relative water depth d lp were studied fig 8 a shows how the global inline significant wave force varies when d lp is changed from 0 14 to 0 90 when the bottom of the deck is above swl with s hs 1 and for hs 10 0 cm i e hs d 0 91 it is found that the normalized global significant inline force is higher for intermediate water depth conditions d lp values of 0 15 0 4 and reduced significantly for d lp of 0 9 the maximum value of the normalized significant in line force is about 0 7 the measured global in line wave force is due to the sum of wave forces on each pile and on the deck the phase of wave on each pile governs the total wave force for example during wave propagation for a particular wave length if the wave crest is on the front pile and wave trough is on the rear pile then the wave force will be subtractive and hence the instantaneous global inline force would be very less on the other hand if wave crest is on the front leg as well as on the rear leg of the platform which happens when a very long wave interacts with the offshore structure then the wave force will be additive and would be high it is found that the orientation of the structure has less influence for lower d lp and is significant for d lp of 0 9 which is due to significant phase lag of waves acting on different piles when they are acted by short waves the plot for the normalized vertical global significant wave force is provided in fig 8b the highest value of the force coefficient is 0 5 which is equivalent to change in buoyancy for wave run up on the piles for s hs 1 the waves do not interact with the deck bottom and hence there is no upward force contribution from the deck it is also found that the orientation has no effect on the vertical wave force from fig 8a and b it is clear that the in line force is about 40 higher compared to vertical force hence for offshore drilling platforms with free water surface much below the deck with sufficient air gap the inline wave force is the main design wave force fig 8c shows the variation of normalized wave induced moment against d lp short period wave has noticeable effect on this moment for different orientation it is found that this wave induced moment is high for 0 orientation and is minimum for 22 5 orientation especially for large value of relative water depth where the effect of phase lag of wave plays an important role 3 1 3 2 partial green water condition the bottom of the deck at free water surface s hs 0 fig 9 a to c are similar to fig 8a to c but for s hs 0 the bottom of deck is at free water level and for hs 10 cm it is found that the vertical wave force is dominating and has significantly increased when compared to the s hs 1 condition the normalized global significant inline wave force coefficient has reached a value of 1 0 fig 9a when compared to a value of 0 7 for s hs 1 fig 8a the normalized global significant vertical wave force coefficient has reached a value of 8 0 fig 9b when compared to a value of 0 5 for s hs 1 fig 8b for the same input wave condition the normalized in line bending moment value also increased to 1 4 fig 9c when compared to 0 4 when s hs 1 fig 8c from fig 9b and c it is found that orientation has some effect on fz and my to an extent of 10 30 3 1 3 3 full green water condition the top of deck at free water surface s hs 1 fig 10 a to c are similar to fig 9a to c but for s hs 1 i e for full green water condition it is important to keep in mind that the thickness of the deck is equal to the incident significant wave height of 10 cm it is found that the peak value of the global in line significant force coefficient has reached a value of 3 0 which is almost three times higher when compared to the case when the swl is at the deck bottom fig 9a the global vertical significant wave force is also dominating when compared to the results with s hs 1 and 0 the normalized vertical significant wave force value has reached a value of 10 5 especially for long waves smaller d lp of 0 15 when compared to a value of 0 5 for s hs 1 and 8 0 for s hs 0 the bending moment value has increase to 3 0 when compared to 0 4 for s hs 1 from these figures it is also found that the orientation has almost no effect on the significant in line vertical wave forces and moments for full green water condition hence it can be concluded that when the deck is fully submerged there is insignificant effect on wave forces and moments due to the change in wave direction on the structure from fig 10b it is found that the significant vertical wave force is the highest for long waves and reduces as wavelength is reduced this is due to the fact that when long wave is acting on the structure almost the whole deck is simultaneously lifted from the leading to trailing edge when the wavelength reduces there are phase lags and elevation difference of the wave from leading to trailing end which exerts varying degree of uplift pressures simultaneously on the deck which in turn results in reduced uplift wave forces a detailed analysis of fig 10c shows that the global significant moment increases with increase in d lp up to certain value and then reduces with further increase in d lp since this moment is mainly contributed by the wave forces in the direction of wave propagation the cumulative force on the deck and legs and the associated phase lag by the wave profile at the deck play the critical role for example when d lp 0 46 the corresponding value of the ratio between the width of the deck in the wave propagation direction to the wave length is 1 1 3 49 0 315 for such condition when the wave crest is at the leading edge of the deck the rear side deck is near the zero crossing level of the wave hence the structure experience high inline force and associated bending moment the overall scientific findings from the study of significant wave forces and moments are when the deck of the structure is not acted upon by propagating waves the inline wave force and the associated bending moment dominate its design the orientation of the structure to wave direction has some noticeable effect on wave forces and moments for 22 5 orientation and not for zero and 45 even for 22 5 orientation the effect is noticed mainly for short period waves to an extent of 10 30 when the still water level is at the bottom of the deck or when the deck is completely submerged in seawater the main dominating global wave force is the vertical force with normalized significant force value of 8 0 and 10 5 respectively for the above two water level conditions the main bending moment is due to in line force and the normalized inline significant global moment values can reach about 1 4 and 3 0 respectively 3 2 wave impact forces on the offshore platform the results and discussions up to fig 10 were based on significant values of wave forces and moments however it is essential to understand the magnitude of the impact forces and moments the highest positive and negative values of the measured wave forces and moments for each random wave experiment is selected and is normalized as per equations 9 11 by keeping the denominator as shown in those equations the effect of orientation is discussed and then the effect of different green water condition is analyzed 3 2 1 effect of orientation of the structure on wave impact forces and moments no green water conditions since the in line wave force and the associated moment governs the design of offshore platforms when the deck level is well above the still water level with sufficient air gap such that the waves would not interact with deck and deck structures i e no green water condition a typical plot showing the effect of d lp and structure orientation on the peak inline wave force is depicted in fig 11 the input wave conditions are same as the one used for fig 8a i e s hs 1 and hs 10 0 cm since the result is based on time domain analysis both the peak shoreward as well as seaward wave force values are provided comparing fig 8a for normalized significant inline force and fig 11 for normalized peak inline force it is found that the peak value of normalized in line wave force value reached about 1 7 when compared to a value of 0 7 for normalized significant inline force value it is also clear from fig 11 that the peak shoreward wave force dictates the design and not the peak seaward force the normalized peak seaward inline force values are shown in the ve y axis it is again confirmed that the change in orientation from 0 to 45 has no effect except short period waves act on the structure i e for d lp 0 9 3 2 2 effect of different green water conditions on wave impact forces and moments from the previous discussions figs 8 10 it was found that the change in relative level of deck s hs is very sensitive on wave forces when compared to the orientation of the structure hence fig 12 a is provided to visualize how changing s hs from 1 no green water condition to 0 partial green water condition and then to 1 full green water condition affects the peak inline wave forces it is found that full green water condition dictates the peak inline force the measured highest normalized value in the shoreward direction is 5 2 which is almost two times higher when compared to the normalized significant inline wave force value from fig 10a for s hs 1 and the highest seaward direction is 1 8 for the same input condition the measured peak vertical wave force variation is depicted in fig 12b it is noticed that the severest condition is when the water level is at the deck bottom s hs 0 the highest value of normalized peak upward wave force from the measurement is 42 which is almost 5 times higher when compared to the highest significant uplift force value as observed in fig 9 for the same condition it is also important to notice higher value of normalized downward peak force of about 8 for full green water condition due to the weight of the moving water mass on the top of the deck for this condition fig 12c is provided to visualize the peak wave induced moment in the direction of wave propagation on the transverse axis y the full green water condition mostly dictates the design of the offshore platform against bending moment only for the short wave d lp 0 9 the partial green water condition dictates which could be due to higher lever arm coupled with high peak inline forces contributed by the leading side vertical deck face all these critical information will be useful for the optimal design of offshore structures 3 3 wave induced dynamic pressures under the deck the dynamic pressures were measured at five different locations refer fig 3 for locations p1 p2 p3 p4 and p5 under the deck slab the effect of all the input parameters on the normalized significant as well as the peak dynamic pressures is studied some important findings of this study are revealed in this section 3 3 1 dynamic pressure time series it is important to visualize how the wave impact pressure under the deck varies for various green water conditions fig 13 a and b are the typical measured dynamic pressures at location p1 and p5 when the still water level is at deck bottom s hs 0 for peak wave period of 2 0 s and hs 10 cm and for 0 orientation of the deck the measured dynamic pressures at p1 shows that the impact pressure reaches as high as 25 cm 5 times the wave amplitude for incident significant wave height of 10 cm it is noticed that location p5 rear side of the deck experienced more frequent wave impact with pressure values of 40 cm 8 times the wave amplitude water column due to wave diffraction and wave focusing effect at the rear bottom side of the deck yan et al 2019 also measured similar order of impact pressures under the deck in their experiment the deck size is 0 5 m breath x 1 95 m width x 0 12 m high in a 2 m wide wave flume abdussamie 2017 has carried out measurement of wave impact pressures under the box shaped deck with external dimensions of length l 608 mm breadth b 608 mm and height 210 mm 16 pressure sensors at different locations under the deck has measured impact pressures upto 35 cm of water column which is similar to the results shown in fig 13 a and b it is noticed that the dynamic pressures are mainly by vertical impact and hence positive values are high the negative pressures of 5 cm 8 cm water column are due to suction effect of water when it falls down from the deck bottom which is similar to the results provided by sun et al 2019 fig 14 a and b are the measured dynamic pressures at p1 and p5 when the water level is at the top of the deck with s hs 1 for tp 2 0 s and hs 10 cm for 0 orientation of the deck at both the locations it is found that the maximum value measured upward and downward dynamic pressures are about 5 cm water column only from the time series plots of dynamic pressures it is clear that the relative level of the deck bottom with respect to still water level is the main parameter for the wave impact pressures under the deck the swl at bottom of the deck is the critical condition which can result in impact pressure magnitudes of 8 times the water column due to incident significant wave amplitude 3 3 2 significant wave pressure under the deck the results on normalized significant wave pressures are discussed in the following section 3 3 2 1 effect of pressure sensor location and relative level of deck bottom on the normalized significant wave pressures fig 15 a shows the comparison of normalized significant dynamic pressure under the deck of the model for 0 orientation for three different water levels s hs 1 0 and 1 for hs 10 cm and tp 1 0 s short period wave represented by deep water wave steepness hs lop 0 064 figs 15b and c are similar plot but for 22 50 and 450 orientations it is found that when the deck is well above the water level s hs 1 the pressures are due to air pressure changes in between the bottom of the deck and water surface and is almost same value at all locations the value of the normalized significant pressure is less than 0 1 and hence negligible for all the three orientations the highest significant wave pressure under the deck happens when the bottom of the deck is at still water level s hs 0 the maximum value of the measured normalized significant pressure is about 0 5 it is to be remembered that the normalized significant dynamic pressure is obtained by multiplying the square root of the zeroth moment of dynamic pressure spectrum by 2 0 for all pressure measuring locations and deck orientations when the deck is fully submerged in water s hs 1 the values of the normalized significant dynamic pressures under the deck is found to reduce when compared to the normalized dynamic pressures when the deck bottom is at still water level when the deck orientation is zero it is found that the normalized dynamic pressure near the leading edge of the structure is maximum 0 5 and it reduces systematically to 0 2 for locations near the trailing edge the change in orientation has effect to an extent of 10 30 fig 16 shows the comparison of normalized significant dynamic pressure under the deck for same condition discussed for fig 15 but for tp 3 0 s long period waves represented by intermediate water wave steepness hs lop 0 0071 and 0 orientation for long wave condition the wave induced pressure under the deck is not the highest for s hs 0 but for s hs 1 the full green water condition the highest normalized significant dynamic pressure value is 0 7 it is found that changing the pressure sensor location under the deck is less sensitive on changing the dynamic pressure value for long waves unlike short period wave interactions fig 15a 3 3 2 2 effect of wave period and orientation of structure on wave induced significant pressures under the deck when bottom of deck is at free water surface s hs 0 the effect of wave period and orientation of the structure on wave induced significant dynamic pressures under the deck at location p1 for s hs 0 is shown in fig 17 a for hs 10 0 cm when the platform is rotated for 22 50 and 450 the x y position of all the pressure sensors change accordingly the normalized significant pressure value changed from 0 4 to 0 6 under the deck at p1 when the d lp is changed from 0 15 to 0 97 the change in orientation results in change in dynamic pressure to an extent of 10 20 a similar plot for pressure sensor location p5 is provided in fig 17b the effect of variation of wave period and orientation are very significant for this pressure sensor location the wave diffraction and focusing effect has caused significant fluctuations in the wave pressures the normalized significant wave pressure reached 0 78 for d lp of 0 26 for short wave with d lp of 0 96 the normalized pressure has dropped down to 0 18 overall it is found that the normalized significant wave pressure under the deck can reach as high as 0 8 when s hs 0 the change in wave period has significant effect on the normalized wave pressures under the deck the orientation of the deck to the wave direction also has noticeable effect on the normalized pressure especially at the lee side of the deck bottom 3 3 2 3 effect of wave period and orientation of structure on wave induced pressures under the deck when bottom of deck is above the free water surface with s hs 1 the effect of wave period and orientation of the structure to wave direction on wave induced significant dynamic pressures under the deck at location p1 when the deck is fully submerged s hs 1 is shown in fig 18 a for hs 10 0 cm the normalized significant pressure value varied from 0 4 to 0 72 under the deck at p1 when the d lp is changed from 0 15 to 1 02 the change in orientation results in change of dynamic pressure to an extent of 10 15 mainly for the short period waves only the highest normalized significant wave pressure of 0 73 occurs when d lp is about 0 27 which corresponds to w lp 0 4 this is mainly contributed by focusing effect of diffracting wave by the deck similar plots for the location p5 is provided in fig 18b the effect of wave periods are similar as noticed in the previous plot however the significant pressure magnitude at p5 has reduced to an extent of 20 compared to location p1 overall it is found that the value of normalized significant wave pressure under the deck can reach as high as 0 8 when the deck is fully submerged with s hs 1 the maximum value of the significant wave pressure occurs when w lp is about 0 4 3 4 wave impact pressure under the deck for the design of deck slab for extreme wave conditions with partial or full green water condition it is important to understand the values of impact wave pressures a typical plot showing the effect of relative deck level s hs on the normalized impact pressure for 0 orientation hs 10 cm at p1 is provided in fig 19 a the impact pressure is the highest positive pressure recorded during the wave interaction the highest negative pressure value is also provided to visualize the suction effects under the deck which is similar to the report by sun et al 2019 it is found that the normalized impact pressure value is higher when the bottom of the deck slab is at still water level i e s hs 0 0 the measured normalized peak pressure value has reached as high as 13 2 for full green water condition s hs 1 0 the normalized peak pressure value is closer to 2 0 similar plot for the same input conditions is provided in fig 19b for location p5 the maximum normalized impact pressure value recorded is 21 5 for d lp of 0 246 this is due to the slamming of waves under the deck combined with diffraction and wave focusing effects hence it is clear that for the design of deck bottom the normalized impact pressure values can reach as high as 20 to 25 times when compared to the normalized significant pressure values for zero air gap condition 4 conclusions detailed experimental investigations were carried out with random waves on a typical model of an offshore jacket type platform in this study a wide range of peak periods were used the wave induced global forces and moments and the dynamic pressures under the deck were measured the experiments were carried out for 0 22 5 and 45 orientation of the model and for three different water depths one with deck bottom well above the water surface one with still water surface at bottom of deck partial green water condition and one with water surface at the top of deck full green water condition the important conclusions derived from this study are as follows 4 1 global wave forces and moments when the deck bottom of the structure is not interacting with the propagating waves the global inline wave force and the associated bending moment dominate its design for such condition for the type of structure configuration for the pile diameter and spacing used for the present study the value of the significant in line wave force coefficient is 0 7 and the significant inline wave force induced moment coefficient is 0 43 the orientation of the structure to wave direction has noticeable effect to the order of 10 50 on wave forces and moments for 22 50 orientation and not much influence for zero and 45 even for 22 50 orientation the effect is mainly for short period waves when the still water level is at bottom of the deck partial green water condition or when the deck is completely submerged in water full green water condition the main dominating global wave force is the vertical force with normalized significant force coefficient value of 8 0 and 10 5 respectively for the partial and full green water conditions the main moment is due to in line force and the normalized significant inline moment coefficient values can reach about 1 4 and 3 0 respectively for full green water condition the highest normalized shoreward force coefficient can be as high as 5 2 which is two times higher than the normalized significant inline force value for the same condition shoreward maximum force can reach 3 times the maximum seaward wave force and design of offshore platform should consider this critical non linear aspect for zero air gap condition between the bottom of the deck and still water level the highest value of normalized peak vertical force under the deck can reach a value of 42 which can be almost 5 times higher than the normalized significant uplift force value it is important to note that the normalized downward peak force value can reach as high as 8 for full green water condition due to the weight staying on the deck top slab 4 2 wave induced dynamic pressures under the deck the wave induced upward impact pressure under the deck can reach as high as 8 times the water column due to the significant wave amplitude of the incident wave when the deck bottom is at still water level this is the worst scenario for the wave impact under the deck the maximum value of normalized significant dynamic pressure based on frequency domain analysis under the deck can reach 0 8 when the deck is fully submerged in water the deck bottom at the leeward side receives more impact 10 20 more than the deck bottom near the seaward side due to diffraction of wave by deck and further wave focusing effects the wave pressure under the deck is maximum when the ratio of deck width to wavelength is about 0 4 for zero air gap between the deck bottom and free water surface the normalized peak impact pressure under the deck can reach as high as 13 2 and 21 5 near the leading and trailing side of the deck the high impact pressure under the rear side bottom of the deck happens due to diffraction and focusing effect of wave the results of this study will be useful

20589,the wave induced dynamic pressures under the deck and the global wave forces and moments on an offshore platform model were measured for three different model orientations and for partial and full green water conditions in random wave fields of different energy levels it is found that for partial and full green water conditions the global vertical wave force dominates when compared to horizontal wave forces the orientation of the structure to wave direction has some effect only for 22 5 orientation of the deck to wave direction shoreward maximum wave force can reach 3 times the maximum seaward wave force for zero air gap condition the highest value of normalized peak vertical force can reach a value of 42 which is 5 times higher than the normalized significant uplift force value the normalized downward peak force value can reach as high as 8 for full green water condition due to the weight of overrunning water staying on the top of deck slab for zero air gap condition the normalized peak impact pressure under the deck can reach as high as 13 2 and 21 5 near the leading and trailing bottom side of the deck keywords offshore drilling platforms global wave forces and moments local wave impact pressures green water condition random waves platform orientation 1 introduction as the crude oil reserve in the land area of the earth is slowly depleting more offshore oil drilling companies are venturing to install more offshore platforms one important parameter in the design of offshore platform is the selection of appropriate bottom level of the deck to make sure the structure will avoid the partial or full green water condition during extreme wave activity and the associated failures of the structure components and loss of human life it is reported that during 2004 2005 126 offshore structures were destroyed due to severe wave impacts and more than 183 other marine structures were severely damaged within the gulf of mexico due to hurricanes ivan katrina and rita kaiser et al 2009 the world has seen many failures of different offshore drilling platforms due to green water conditions kvitrud and løland 2018 according to api 2002 the minimum air gap of 1 5 m between the crest of 100 year return period wave height and the bottom of the lowest deck of the platform is required to prevent wave impact under the deck it is however suggested by raaij 2005 that 1 5 m air gap recommended by api rp 2a is inconsistent when considering the reliability of the offshore structures this has resulted in selection of higher air gaps for design waves of 10 000 year return periods scharnke et al 2014 the air gap of an offshore platform may reduce compared to the actual design value because of subsidence of the structure due to reservoir compaction broughton and horn 1987 and iwanowski et al 2002 sea level rise and vertical thermal expansion of sea surface due to increased global warming similar reduction of air gap is possible for floating offshore structures due to unexpected increase in weight of operational logistics or flooding of compartments due to possible damage during operation winsor 2002 the air gap reduction happens even for tlp platforms due to local subsidence of foundation and rising sea level in such situation the impact load under the deck will result in significant increase in tension on the tether lines and significant reduction in tension due to downward force this oscillatory vertical motion with significant upward and downward force change on the tether lines may lead to its failures it is also important not to provide high air gap value since it will unnecessarily increase the total cost of the offshore platforms though a large number of studies were carried out on wave forces on offshore platforms very few studies were reported on wave interaction by abnormal wave conditions some of the promising studies on this area since 1967 are by goda 1967 wang 1970 el ghamry 1971 guo and cai 1980 wang et al 1998 ren and wang 2002 2003 2005 zhou and chen 2004 ding et al 2008 iwanowski et al 2009 kendom et al 2010 and hirdaris et al 2014 the important outcomes of some of the promising literatures are revealed here based on theoretical and experimental studies wang 1970 has suggested simple rules to estimate the uplift pressure under the flat plate for different types of waves based on experimental studies elghamry 1971 revealed that the peak pressures acting under the deck slab follow gaussian distribution and the peak uplift force follows rayleigh distribution the theoretical analysis of wave impact forces on the deck of offshore platform for large waves are compared with measurements by kaplan et al 1995 and fair comparisons were reported murray et al 1997 have measured vertical and horizontal wave forces as well as moment about the transverse direction of a model of a jacket platform with a horizontal deck the deck was shaped as a rectangular box zero crossing analysis was carried out on the measured data and results are reported theoretical and experimental investigations on wave impact loads on horizontal decks of a platform model were carried out by baarholm and faltinsen 2004 wagner based method as well as boundary element methods bem is used it is found that the bem method compared well for the measured impact pressure on the structure wang and ren 1997 and ren and wang 1999 2004 have developed numerical models based on improved volume of fluid method and simulated the wave impact pressures on marine structures colleter 2007 has assessed the breaking wave induced uplift load on the model of the horizontal deck of a wharf using physical and cfd based numerical modeling and reasonable comparisons were reported korobkin 2007 assessed the wave impact forces on a stiff horizontal plate based on the second order wagner theory of wave impact a satisfactory comparison between the theory and the available experimental results was reported the effect of air gap as well as the effect of wave direction on a three dimensional structure were studied by ding et al 2008 and the change in wave impact under the deck is reported for a small air gap condition under the deck of a three legged jack up platform model schellin et al 2011 assessed the loads for unusual wave conditions using a cfd code by solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations scharnke et al 2014 revealed that the level of the deck bottom of many offshore platforms built in the norwegian continental shelf before 2000 have experienced a negative air gap for 10 000 year return period wave crest height a numerical model study and 1 60 scaled physical model study was carried out to assess the wave in deck impact loads it is revealed that measured loads and the simplified load prediction model based on the usage of stokes 5th order wave theory misjudge the measured horizontal deck loads abdussamie et al 2014 assessed the vertical impact loading under a deck based on kaplan s method and cfd and found that cfd is better for evaluating the impulsive upward force lee et al 2016 have conducted experimental studies to find out the effect of different shaped protectors like rectangular trapezoidal and round shaped protectors to reduce the impact wave pressures on the deck of platforms abdussamie et al 2017 further measured the local and global wave impact loads on a fixed platform deck using a model it is found that small reductions of 20 mm in the original deck clearance can double the horizontal force and the vertical upward force on the structure the effect of different level of immersion on the wave forces on a modeled coastal structure was measured by park et al 2017 by keeping a constant water depth and for different incident wave periods and wave heights it was found that the horizontal force increased as the model was more deeply immersed and diminished as the model was lifted to larger air gaps above the still water level a detailed numerical study of nonlinear freak wave impact underneath a fixed horizontal deck in 2 d space was carried out by qin et al 2017 the nonlinear freak wave induced impact is investigated with different values of deck clearance above the mean free water surface kvitrud and løland 2018 based on the wave study on norwegian semi submersible and tlp decks reported that upward wave actions have caused many adverse effects like damage to gratings production equipment drilling and lifesaving equipment they have recommended that the design and operation of semi submersible must include considerations of both horizontal and vertical wave actions on decks recently sun et al 2019 investigated on the suction effect during freak wave slamming on a fixed platform deck and found that the suction effect at the bottom of the structure causes strong negative pressure this gravity force pulls the structure down and increases the risk of structural damage based on experiments duong et al 2019 measured wave impact pressure distribution under the deck and global vertical force on fixed offshore structure model for the action of regular waves the velocity fields were also measured under the deck using particle image velocimetry and the results were presented to understand the wave impact phenomena yan et al 2019 investigated on impact pressures due to plunging waves at the front and bottom of a box shaped model structure the experimental investigation was compared to a numerical model and the comparisons were found to be satisfactory stansberg 2020 investigated the effect of wave front steepness and its impact on the horizontal deck impact loads the results show that although there is great random scatter in the measured impact forces especially in the local slamming forces but also in the global forces there is a close relation to the rise velocity ma and swan 2020 have carried out an experimental study of wave in deck loading and its dependence on the properties of incident waves recently fontes et al 2021 carried out a detailed study to understand the evolution of different types of green water events recently dnv has issued revised guidelines such as otg 13 2019 for prediction of air gap for column stabilized units and otg 14 2019 to assess the horizontal wave impact loads for column stabilized units the importance of environmental conditions and environmental loads is further emphasized in the recent dnvgl s rp c205 2019 it is found from these recommendations that standard industry tools are still not capable of predicting the effect of changing the air gap level and the associated local and global wave impact loads on offshore structures the detailed review of literature reveals that the variation of total global wave forces and moments in all three directions inline transverse and vertical and the impact pressures under the deck of offshore platform for different water level conditions a water level well below the deck bottom b still water at the bottom level of deck and c top of deck immersed completely as well as the effect of orientation of the deck to wave direction needs more detailed study hence in the present study an effort is made to fulfill this knowledge gap a model of a typical offshore drilling platform is fabricated and the experiments were conducted to measure the wave impact pressures under the deck as well as the global inline transverse and vertical forces for three different orientations of the offshore platform and for three different water depths still water level well below the deck bottom water level at the deck bottom partial green water condition and water level with full submergence of deck level full green water condition the experiments are carried out for random wave fields of jonswap spectrum of ten different wave energy conditions by appropriate selection of significant wave heights and peak wave periods the results of this study is expected to provide more clear knowledge and understanding of random wave interaction on offshore platforms for partial and full green water conditions and is useful for its optimized design 2 methodology 2 1 general the present work is a typical wave structure interaction problem waves interacting with offshore drilling platform for partial and full green water condition are a complicated physical process the parameters which are essential for cost effective design of offshore drilling platforms are the global wave forces and moments in all three directions wave force in the direction of wave propagation transverse wave force vertical wave force and the 3 moments and the wave induced impact pressures under the deck slab when water level is well below in line with the deck partial green water condition and for complete submergence of the deck full green water condition the offshore drilling platform experiences torsional moments due to changes in wave directions in the laboratory experiments the effect of wave direction can be achieved by rotating the model about its vertical direction the investigation is carried out in the concrete wave flume facility available in the coastal engineering and hydraulic laboratory located in kuwait institute for scientific research kuwait 2 2 model setup fig 1 shows the offshore platform model with four legs and is fabricated using pvc pipes of 11 cm outer diameter and 1 8 mm wall

sectional view of the model in the wave flume is provided in fig 2 the model is rigidly fixed on a six component force sensor to measure inline transverse and vertical forces as well as the three moments the deck is 110 cm 110 cm x 10 cm thick 10 cm thick slab of the deck is considered as representative for the infrastructures available on the real deck slab of the offshore jacket platform in the field the bottom of the deck is fixed at 150 cm from the flume bottom which represents 30 m water depth in the field three different water depths viz 140 cm deck bottom is 10 cm above still water level swl 150 cm deck bottom at swl and 160 cm deck is fully submerged are used the complete elevation details are shown in fig 2 the plan view of the deck is as shown in fig 3 five pressure sensors are fixed under the deck slab and the location details are provided in this figure three different wave directions 0 22 5 and 45 are used wave directions are achieved by rotating the structure and refixing it firmly with the force sensor 2 3 instrumentation three different instruments are used for measurements in this research work they are wave probes six component force sensor and dynamic

m only five units of underwater pressure transducers each of 0 5 bar capacity were used these sensors were purchased from hr wallingford uk mounted with a flush diaphragm this pressure sensor is suitable to measure wave impact pressures under the deck of structures the diaphragm is 19 mm diameter and output signal is from 0 to 10 v 2 4 calibration wave probes pressure sensors and force sensors are periodically calibrated and the calibration constants were found repeating within 1 2 5 wave flume facility the experimental investigations were carried out in the concrete wave flume facility at the coastal and hydraulic laboratory of coastal management program kuwait institute for scientific research shuwaikh campus the wave flume is as shown in fig 4 the wave flume is 40 0 m

has active wave absorption system and is wet back the flume end has an efficient parabolic beach built using rubbles with reflection coefficients less than 2 5 for a wide range of wave periods 2 6 incident wave conditions jonswap spectrum with significant wave heights hs of 5 and 10 cm and peak wave periods tp of 1 0 s 1 5 s 2 0 s 2 5 s and 3 0 s was used for each significant wave height the wavelength lp corresponds to the peak wave period is estimated using the dispersion equation lp 1 56 tp2 tanh 2πd lp the normalized input parameters such as relative wave height hs d incident wave

application conditions can be visualized from these normalized range of input parameters 2 7 wave data collection details the standard data collection duration in the field was 20 min with 1 20 scale the corresponding data collection duration in the lab for random wave was 4 47 min however data was collected for a duration of 6 min for each run the speed of data collection is 100 samples sec for forces and moments and 200 samples sec for wave pressures under the deck to capture the wave impact pressures under the deck the wave data collection was started after crossing of four to five waves at the model section clean incident wave condition without any reflection effect from the model is needed for normalizing all the measured outputs such as dynamic pressures wave forces and moments for this purpose experimental runs were carried out without the model in the wave flume a total of 90 random wave runs were used to cover the effect of wave height wave period structure orientation and water depth effects on wave impact pressures under the deck and the global wave forces and moments on the platform model 2 8 data analysis the dhi wave synthesizer analysis software mikezero was used for data analysis the data measured using wave probe wp1 measured in the absence of the model in the flume were used as incident wave input and the incident wave height hs was determined from these data spectral analysis is used the area under the spectrum i e the zeroth moment of the spectrum mo is used for getting the value of hs using the formula hs 4 mo 1 2 similar procedure is adopted for estimating the wave forces moments and dynamic pressures the significant amplitudes of responses namely significant wave pressures forces and moments is estimated using the following formulas 1 pis 2 mo of dynamic pressure 1 2 where i 1 2 3 4 5 refers to the five pressure transducers under the deck 2 fxs 2 mo of inline force 1 2 3 fys 2 mo of transverse force 1 2 4 fzs 2 mo of vertical force 1 2 5 mxs 2 mo of moment about the y axis 1 2 6 mys 2 mo of moment about the x axis 1 2 7 mzs 2 mo of moment about the z axis 1 2 it is worth to note that mxs is mainly due to the fy and mys is mainly contributed by fx time domain wave up crossing analysis is also carried out on wave pressures forces and moments to select the peak positive as well as negative values the results of this analysis is used to understand how the shoreward and seaward forces differ how the upward and downward force vary and how the vertical upward impact pressure differ from negative downward pressures during wave drawdown from the deck which creates suction activities under the deck as observed by sun et al 2019 this analysis is also used to visualize how much the value of peak pressures and peak impact forces can reach when compared to the significant wave pressures and significant vertical forces especially when the still water level is at the bottom of the deck which is the critical water level condition for wave slamming under the deck 2 9 dimensional analysis for discussion of results and its direct application to the field conditions dimensional analysis is required the inputs are significant wave height hs peak wave period tp water depth d the distance between the still water level and deck bottom s pile diameter d deck dimensions width breadth and thickness and wave direction or structure orientation θ apart from these gravity g fluid density ρ viscosity μ play its role in this wave structure interaction problem the outputs are significant wave forces fxs fys and fzs significant moments mxs mys and msz and significant dynamic pressures p1s p2s p3s p4s and p5s the outputs also are the maximum positive and negatives values of the impact pressures forces and moments the value of s is 10 cm when swl is 10 cm below the deck s 0 when the swl is at deck bottom and s 10 cm when swl is 10 cm above the deck bottom let us carryout the dimensional analysis for one output say fxs which can be extended for all other outputs both for significant values as well as peak values 8 fxs f hs tp d d s deck dimension g ρ μ θ in the present study the significant wave height and peak periods were varied to cover wide range of wave energy levels so that the results can be used for a wide range of sea states using the principle of dimensional analysis the inline significant force coefficient can be expressed in the form 9 fxs ρ g hs a f d lp hs d hs lp d lp s hs θ where a is the cross sectional area of the piles for the model there are four piles each with outer diameter d of 0 11 m hence a 4 π d2 the measured inline force is divided with a weight equal to weight of water displaced by four piles of total cross sectional area a and height hi the above equation can be used for fys and fzs it is not appropriate to use d lp since the study is not for a single pile the normalized moment on the x axis can be expressed as 10 mxs ρ g hs a d f d lp hs d hs lp d lp s hs θ similar equation can be used for mys and mzs for dynamic pressures the results of the analysis yields 11 pis 1 2 ρ g hs f d lp hs d hs lp d lp s hs θ similar equations can be used to study the peak impact pressures under the deck global forces and moments on the structure 3 results and discussions the results on significant and peak wave forces moments and dynamic pressures under the deck of offshore platform due to random waves are presented an attempt is made to answer the following questions what is the effect of different green water conditions on the significant as well as peak global wave forces and moments and the local wave induced dynamic pressures under the deck what is the effect of changing the wave periods on these output parameters what is the effect of change in wave direction or structure orientation on all these output parameters first the results are presented on the significant global wave forces and moments followed by peak wave forces and moments then the results on significant wave pressures under the deck is presented followed by peak wave pressures 3 1 significant wave forces and moments on the offshore platform in this section first typical time series of measured inline and vertical wave forces for a particular input wave condition for different water level is discussed then the effect of different level of green water conditions on global inline transverse and vertical significant wave forces and moments are discussed for a typical short and long waves and for 0 orientation 3 1 1 typical wave force and moment time series it is necessary to visualize the time series of the outcomes of experimental investigation for a fundamental understanding of the problem hence typical time series of wave forces are presented fig 5 a b and 5c shows typical measured inline wave force time series for hs 10 cm tp 2 0 s 0 orientation and for d 140 150 and 160 cm respectively though the data were collected for 360 s the time series plot is provided only for 60 s for more clarity it is found that the inline wave force is the highest for fully submerged deck condition due to maximum exposure of the structure and deck for wave action and is minimum when the deck is well above the water level due to minimum exposure of the deck of the structure for wave interaction the magnitude of the transverse wave force for 0 orientation is much less than 10 of the inline force and hence not provided fig 6 a b and 6c shows the measured vertical wave force time series for the similar input conditions as discussed above the vertical wave force is minimum when the water surface is 10 cm below the bottom of the deck since the waves do not interact with the deck bottom frequently when the bottom of the deck is at water level the uplift force is high and reached about 1300 n for the random wave fields with hs 10 cm mostly the forces are in the upward direction due to lifting and vertical impact effect when waves pass around the deck when the deck is fully immersed in water the measured vertical force is predominantly downward this happens because of green water flooding over the deck which acts downward the uplift force when deck bottom is at water level is almost two times higher than the downward force when the deck is fully submerged the uplift force would transfer to the piles as tension load while the downward force would transfer as compression these stress reversal needs to be considered for appropriate design of the piles as well as for the assessment of depth of penetration into the soil for stability 3 1 2 in line transverse and vertical significant wave forces and moments the relative importance it is important to know the relative importance of the magnitude of the wave forces on three different directions inline fx transverse fy and vertical fz and the moments on the x y and z axis fig 7 a shows the normalized significant wave forces and moments on the model for 00 orientation for three different water levels represented by the relative level of deck bottom s hs 1 0 and 1 for hs 10 cm and tp 1 0 s short period wave represented by deep water wave steepness hs lop 0 064 where lop is the deep water wave length and is equal to gtp 2 2 π it is found from this plot that the normalized significant wave forces fxs or fys or fzs ρ g hs a and normalized significant bending moments mxs or mys or mzs ρ g hs a d are the lowest when the swl is well below the bottom of the deck i e for s hs 1 the inline wave force has doubled and more than tripled for partial green water s hs 0 and full green water s hs 1 conditions among the wave forces the transverse force fys is the smallest and among the moments the moment induced by this force mxs and the torsional moment mzs are the least hence for 00 model orientation it is worth focusing only on fxs fzs and mys the highest value of the significant uplift force coefficient on the deck is closer to 3 0 and occurs when the still water level is at the deck bottom fig 7b is similar plot for long peak wave period of 3 0 s hs lop 0 0071 comparing the magnitude of normalized significant forces and moments between fig 7a and b it is found that the vertical wave force has significantly increased when long period waves acts on the structure for s hs 0 and 1 0 comparing fig 7a and b the vertical wave force coefficient on the deck has increased from 2 8 to 6 2 for s hs 0 and has increased from 2 6 to 10 6 for s hs 1 0 the main reason for such a high increase in significant vertical wave force is that for long waves the complete crest part of the wave acts on the full deck bottom simultaneously whereas for the short wave only a part of the wave crest is found to act on the deck bottom during wave interaction hence enough attention is needed to consider the value of design wave period and its effect on the uplift force on the deck during green water condition it is found that with increase in peak wave period the change in the magnitude of fxs and mys are marginal from fig 7a and b it is found that the value of fy mx and mz is much smaller when compared to fx fz and my hence further discussions are focused only on fx fz and my 3 1 3 effect of orientation of the structure and different green water conditions the effect of orientation of the structure as well as different green water conditions on the significant wave forces and moments are descried in this section first the effect of no green water condition is explored followed by partial green water condition and then the full green water condition 3 1 3 1 no green water condition the bottom of the deck above the free water surface s hs 1 the effect of orientation of the structure on the normalized global significant wave forces and moments for a wide range of relative water depth d lp were studied fig 8 a shows how the global inline significant wave force varies when d lp is changed from 0 14 to 0 90 when the bottom of the deck is above swl with s hs 1 and for hs 10 0 cm i e hs d 0 91 it is found that the normalized global significant inline force is higher for intermediate water depth conditions d lp values of 0 15 0 4 and reduced significantly for d lp of 0 9 the maximum value of the normalized significant in line force is about 0 7 the measured global in line wave force is due to the sum of wave forces on each pile and on the deck the phase of wave on each pile governs the total wave force for example during wave propagation for a particular wave length if the wave crest is on the front pile and wave trough is on the rear pile then the wave force will be subtractive and hence the instantaneous global inline force would be very less on the other hand if wave crest is on the front leg as well as on the rear leg of the platform which happens when a very long wave interacts with the offshore structure then the wave force will be additive and would be high it is found that the orientation of the structure has less influence for lower d lp and is significant for d lp of 0 9 which is due to significant phase lag of waves acting on different piles when they are acted by short waves the plot for the normalized vertical global significant wave force is provided in fig 8b the highest value of the force coefficient is 0 5 which is equivalent to change in buoyancy for wave run up on the piles for s hs 1 the waves do not interact with the deck bottom and hence there is no upward force contribution from the deck it is also found that the orientation has no effect on the vertical wave force from fig 8a and b it is clear that the in line force is about 40 higher compared to vertical force hence for offshore drilling platforms with free water surface much below the deck with sufficient air gap the inline wave force is the main design wave force fig 8c shows the variation of normalized wave induced moment against d lp short period wave has noticeable effect on this moment for different orientation it is found that this wave induced moment is high for 0 orientation and is minimum for 22 5 orientation especially for large value of relative water depth where the effect of phase lag of wave plays an important role 3 1 3 2 partial green water condition the bottom of the deck at free water surface s hs 0 fig 9 a to c are similar to fig 8a to c but for s hs 0 the bottom of deck is at free water level and for hs 10 cm it is found that the vertical wave force is dominating and has significantly increased when compared to the s hs 1 condition the normalized global significant inline wave force coefficient has reached a value of 1 0 fig 9a when compared to a value of 0 7 for s hs 1 fig 8a the normalized global significant vertical wave force coefficient has reached a value of 8 0 fig 9b when compared to a value of 0 5 for s hs 1 fig 8b for the same input wave condition the normalized in line bending moment value also increased to 1 4 fig 9c when compared to 0 4 when s hs 1 fig 8c from fig 9b and c it is found that orientation has some effect on fz and my to an extent of 10 30 3 1 3 3 full green water condition the top of deck at free water surface s hs 1 fig 10 a to c are similar to fig 9a to c but for s hs 1 i e for full green water condition it is important to keep in mind that the thickness of the deck is equal to the incident significant wave height of 10 cm it is found that the peak value of the global in line significant force coefficient has reached a value of 3 0 which is almost three times higher when compared to the case when the swl is at the deck bottom fig 9a the global vertical significant wave force is also dominating when compared to the results with s hs 1 and 0 the normalized vertical significant wave force value has reached a value of 10 5 especially for long waves smaller d lp of 0 15 when compared to a value of 0 5 for s hs 1 and 8 0 for s hs 0 the bending moment value has increase to 3 0 when compared to 0 4 for s hs 1 from these figures it is also found that the orientation has almost no effect on the significant in line vertical wave forces and moments for full green water condition hence it can be concluded that when the deck is fully submerged there is insignificant effect on wave forces and moments due to the change in wave direction on the structure from fig 10b it is found that the significant vertical wave force is the highest for long waves and reduces as wavelength is reduced this is due to the fact that when long wave is acting on the structure almost the whole deck is simultaneously lifted from the leading to trailing edge when the wavelength reduces there are phase lags and elevation difference of the wave from leading to trailing end which exerts varying degree of uplift pressures simultaneously on the deck which in turn results in reduced uplift wave forces a detailed analysis of fig 10c shows that the global significant moment increases with increase in d lp up to certain value and then reduces with further increase in d lp since this moment is mainly contributed by the wave forces in the direction of wave propagation the cumulative force on the deck and legs and the associated phase lag by the wave profile at the deck play the critical role for example when d lp 0 46 the corresponding value of the ratio between the width of the deck in the wave propagation direction to the wave length is 1 1 3 49 0 315 for such condition when the wave crest is at the leading edge of the deck the rear side deck is near the zero crossing level of the wave hence the structure experience high inline force and associated bending moment the overall scientific findings from the study of significant wave forces and moments are when the deck of the structure is not acted upon by propagating waves the inline wave force and the associated bending moment dominate its design the orientation of the structure to wave direction has some noticeable effect on wave forces and moments for 22 5 orientation and not for zero and 45 even for 22 5 orientation the effect is noticed mainly for short period waves to an extent of 10 30 when the still water level is at the bottom of the deck or when the deck is completely submerged in seawater the main dominating global wave force is the vertical force with normalized significant force value of 8 0 and 10 5 respectively for the above two water level conditions the main bending moment is due to in line force and the normalized inline significant global moment values can reach about 1 4 and 3 0 respectively 3 2 wave impact forces on the offshore platform the results and discussions up to fig 10 were based on significant values of wave forces and moments however it is essential to understand the magnitude of the impact forces and moments the highest positive and negative values of the measured wave forces and moments for each random wave experiment is selected and is normalized as per equations 9 11 by keeping the denominator as shown in those equations the effect of orientation is discussed and then the effect of different green water condition is analyzed 3 2 1 effect of orientation of the structure on wave impact forces and moments no green water conditions since the in line wave force and the associated moment governs the design of offshore platforms when the deck level is well above the still water level with sufficient air gap such that the waves would not interact with deck and deck structures i e no green water condition a typical plot showing the effect of d lp and structure orientation on the peak inline wave force is depicted in fig 11 the input wave conditions are same as the one used for fig 8a i e s hs 1 and hs 10 0 cm since the result is based on time domain analysis both the peak shoreward as well as seaward wave force values are provided comparing fig 8a for normalized significant inline force and fig 11 for normalized peak inline force it is found that the peak value of normalized in line wave force value reached about 1 7 when compared to a value of 0 7 for normalized significant inline force value it is also clear from fig 11 that the peak shoreward wave force dictates the design and not the peak seaward force the normalized peak seaward inline force values are shown in the ve y axis it is again confirmed that the change in orientation from 0 to 45 has no effect except short period waves act on the structure i e for d lp 0 9 3 2 2 effect of different green water conditions on wave impact forces and moments from the previous discussions figs 8 10 it was found that the change in relative level of deck s hs is very sensitive on wave forces when compared to the orientation of the structure hence fig 12 a is provided to visualize how changing s hs from 1 no green water condition to 0 partial green water condition and then to 1 full green water condition affects the peak inline wave forces it is found that full green water condition dictates the peak inline force the measured highest normalized value in the shoreward direction is 5 2 which is almost two times higher when compared to the normalized significant inline wave force value from fig 10a for s hs 1 and the highest seaward direction is 1 8 for the same input condition the measured peak vertical wave force variation is depicted in fig 12b it is noticed that the severest condition is when the water level is at the deck bottom s hs 0 the highest value of normalized peak upward wave force from the measurement is 42 which is almost 5 times higher when compared to the highest significant uplift force value as observed in fig 9 for the same condition it is also important to notice higher value of normalized downward peak force of about 8 for full green water condition due to the weight of the moving water mass on the top of the deck for this condition fig 12c is provided to visualize the peak wave induced moment in the direction of wave propagation on the transverse axis y the full green water condition mostly dictates the design of the offshore platform against bending moment only for the short wave d lp 0 9 the partial green water condition dictates which could be due to higher lever arm coupled with high peak inline forces contributed by the leading side vertical deck face all these critical information will be useful for the optimal design of offshore structures 3 3 wave induced dynamic pressures under the deck the dynamic pressures were measured at five different locations refer fig 3 for locations p1 p2 p3 p4 and p5 under the deck slab the effect of all the input parameters on the normalized significant as well as the peak dynamic pressures is studied some important findings of this study are revealed in this section 3 3 1 dynamic pressure time series it is important to visualize how the wave impact pressure under the deck varies for various green water conditions fig 13 a and b are the typical measured dynamic pressures at location p1 and p5 when the still water level is at deck bottom s hs 0 for peak wave period of 2 0 s and hs 10 cm and for 0 orientation of the deck the measured dynamic pressures at p1 shows that the impact pressure reaches as high as 25 cm 5 times the wave amplitude for incident significant wave height of 10 cm it is noticed that location p5 rear side of the deck experienced more frequent wave impact with pressure values of 40 cm 8 times the wave amplitude water column due to wave diffraction and wave focusing effect at the rear bottom side of the deck yan et al 2019 also measured similar order of impact pressures under the deck in their experiment the deck size is 0 5 m breath x 1 95 m width x 0 12 m high in a 2 m wide wave flume abdussamie 2017 has carried out measurement of wave impact pressures under the box shaped deck with external dimensions of length l 608 mm breadth b 608 mm and height 210 mm 16 pressure sensors at different locations under the deck has measured impact pressures upto 35 cm of water column which is similar to the results shown in fig 13 a and b it is noticed that the dynamic pressures are mainly by vertical impact and hence positive values are high the negative pressures of 5 cm 8 cm water column are due to suction effect of water when it falls down from the deck bottom which is similar to the results provided by sun et al 2019 fig 14 a and b are the measured dynamic pressures at p1 and p5 when the water level is at the top of the deck with s hs 1 for tp 2 0 s and hs 10 cm for 0 orientation of the deck at both the locations it is found that the maximum value measured upward and downward dynamic pressures are about 5 cm water column only from the time series plots of dynamic pressures it is clear that the relative level of the deck bottom with respect to still water level is the main parameter for the wave impact pressures under the deck the swl at bottom of the deck is the critical condition which can result in impact pressure magnitudes of 8 times the water column due to incident significant wave amplitude 3 3 2 significant wave pressure under the deck the results on normalized significant wave pressures are discussed in the following section 3 3 2 1 effect of pressure sensor location and relative level of deck bottom on the normalized significant wave pressures fig 15 a shows the comparison of normalized significant dynamic pressure under the deck of the model for 0 orientation for three different water levels s hs 1 0 and 1 for hs 10 cm and tp 1 0 s short period wave represented by deep water wave steepness hs lop 0 064 figs 15b and c are similar plot but for 22 50 and 450 orientations it is found that when the deck is well above the water level s hs 1 the pressures are due to air pressure changes in between the bottom of the deck and water surface and is almost same value at all locations the value of the normalized significant pressure is less than 0 1 and hence negligible for all the three orientations the highest significant wave pressure under the deck happens when the bottom of the deck is at still water level s hs 0 the maximum value of the measured normalized significant pressure is about 0 5 it is to be remembered that the normalized significant dynamic pressure is obtained by multiplying the square root of the zeroth moment of dynamic pressure spectrum by 2 0 for all pressure measuring locations and deck orientations when the deck is fully submerged in water s hs 1 the values of the normalized significant dynamic pressures under the deck is found to reduce when compared to the normalized dynamic pressures when the deck bottom is at still water level when the deck orientation is zero it is found that the normalized dynamic pressure near the leading edge of the structure is maximum 0 5 and it reduces systematically to 0 2 for locations near the trailing edge the change in orientation has effect to an extent of 10 30 fig 16 shows the comparison of normalized significant dynamic pressure under the deck for same condition discussed for fig 15 but for tp 3 0 s long period waves represented by intermediate water wave steepness hs lop 0 0071 and 0 orientation for long wave condition the wave induced pressure under the deck is not the highest for s hs 0 but for s hs 1 the full green water condition the highest normalized significant dynamic pressure value is 0 7 it is found that changing the pressure sensor location under the deck is less sensitive on changing the dynamic pressure value for long waves unlike short period wave interactions fig 15a 3 3 2 2 effect of wave period and orientation of structure on wave induced significant pressures under the deck when bottom of deck is at free water surface s hs 0 the effect of wave period and orientation of the structure on wave induced significant dynamic pressures under the deck at location p1 for s hs 0 is shown in fig 17 a for hs 10 0 cm when the platform is rotated for 22 50 and 450 the x y position of all the pressure sensors change accordingly the normalized significant pressure value changed from 0 4 to 0 6 under the deck at p1 when the d lp is changed from 0 15 to 0 97 the change in orientation results in change in dynamic pressure to an extent of 10 20 a similar plot for pressure sensor location p5 is provided in fig 17b the effect of variation of wave period and orientation are very significant for this pressure sensor location the wave diffraction and focusing effect has caused significant fluctuations in the wave pressures the normalized significant wave pressure reached 0 78 for d lp of 0 26 for short wave with d lp of 0 96 the normalized pressure has dropped down to 0 18 overall it is found that the normalized significant wave pressure under the deck can reach as high as 0 8 when s hs 0 the change in wave period has significant effect on the normalized wave pressures under the deck the orientation of the deck to the wave direction also has noticeable effect on the normalized pressure especially at the lee side of the deck bottom 3 3 2 3 effect of wave period and orientation of structure on wave induced pressures under the deck when bottom of deck is above the free water surface with s hs 1 the effect of wave period and orientation of the structure to wave direction on wave induced significant dynamic pressures under the deck at location p1 when the deck is fully submerged s hs 1 is shown in fig 18 a for hs 10 0 cm the normalized significant pressure value varied from 0 4 to 0 72 under the deck at p1 when the d lp is changed from 0 15 to 1 02 the change in orientation results in change of dynamic pressure to an extent of 10 15 mainly for the short period waves only the highest normalized significant wave pressure of 0 73 occurs when d lp is about 0 27 which corresponds to w lp 0 4 this is mainly contributed by focusing effect of diffracting wave by the deck similar plots for the location p5 is provided in fig 18b the effect of wave periods are similar as noticed in the previous plot however the significant pressure magnitude at p5 has reduced to an extent of 20 compared to location p1 overall it is found that the value of normalized significant wave pressure under the deck can reach as high as 0 8 when the deck is fully submerged with s hs 1 the maximum value of the significant wave pressure occurs when w lp is about 0 4 3 4 wave impact pressure under the deck for the design of deck slab for extreme wave conditions with partial or full green water condition it is important to understand the values of impact wave pressures a typical plot showing the effect of relative deck level s hs on the normalized impact pressure for 0 orientation hs 10 cm at p1 is provided in fig 19 a the impact pressure is the highest positive pressure recorded during the wave interaction the highest negative pressure value is also provided to visualize the suction effects under the deck which is similar to the report by sun et al 2019 it is found that the normalized impact pressure value is higher when the bottom of the deck slab is at still water level i e s hs 0 0 the measured normalized peak pressure value has reached as high as 13 2 for full green water condition s hs 1 0 the normalized peak pressure value is closer to 2 0 similar plot for the same input conditions is provided in fig 19b for location p5 the maximum normalized impact pressure value recorded is 21 5 for d lp of 0 246 this is due to the slamming of waves under the deck combined with diffraction and wave focusing effects hence it is clear that for the design of deck bottom the normalized impact pressure values can reach as high as 20 to 25 times when compared to the normalized significant pressure values for zero air gap condition 4 conclusions detailed experimental investigations were carried out with random waves on a typical model of an offshore jacket type platform in this study a wide range of peak periods were used the wave induced global forces and moments and the dynamic pressures under the deck were measured the experiments were carried out for 0 22 5 and 45 orientation of the model and for three different water depths one with deck bottom well above the water surface one with still water surface at bottom of deck partial green water condition and one with water surface at the top of deck full green water condition the important conclusions derived from this study are as follows 4 1 global wave forces and moments when the deck bottom of the structure is not interacting with the propagating waves the global inline wave force and the associated bending moment dominate its design for such condition for the type of structure configuration for the pile diameter and spacing used for the present study the value of the significant in line wave force coefficient is 0 7 and the significant inline wave force induced moment coefficient is 0 43 the orientation of the structure to wave direction has noticeable effect to the order of 10 50 on wave forces and moments for 22 50 orientation and not much influence for zero and 45 even for 22 50 orientation the effect is mainly for short period waves when the still water level is at bottom of the deck partial green water condition or when the deck is completely submerged in water full green water condition the main dominating global wave force is the vertical force with normalized significant force coefficient value of 8 0 and 10 5 respectively for the partial and full green water conditions the main moment is due to in line force and the normalized significant inline moment coefficient values can reach about 1 4 and 3 0 respectively for full green water condition the highest normalized shoreward force coefficient can be as high as 5 2 which is two times higher than the normalized significant inline force value for the same condition shoreward maximum force can reach 3 times the maximum seaward wave force and design of offshore platform should consider this critical non linear aspect for zero air gap condition between the bottom of the deck and still water level the highest value of normalized peak vertical force under the deck can reach a value of 42 which can be almost 5 times higher than the normalized significant uplift force value it is important to note that the normalized downward peak force value can reach as high as 8 for full green water condition due to the weight staying on the deck top slab 4 2 wave induced dynamic pressures under the deck the wave induced upward impact pressure under the deck can reach as high as 8 times the water column due to the significant wave amplitude of the incident wave when the deck bottom is at still water level this is the worst scenario for the wave impact under the deck the maximum value of normalized significant dynamic pressure based on frequency domain analysis under the deck can reach 0 8 when the deck is fully submerged in water the deck bottom at the leeward side receives more impact 10 20 more than the deck bottom near the seaward side due to diffraction of wave by deck and further wave focusing effects the wave pressure under the deck is maximum when the ratio of deck width to wavelength is about 0 4 for zero air gap between the deck bottom and free water surface the normalized peak impact pressure under the deck can reach as high as 13 2 and 21 5 near the leading and trailing side of the deck the high impact pressure under the rear side bottom of the deck happens due to diffraction and focusing effect of wave the results of this study will be useful
