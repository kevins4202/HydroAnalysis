22450,the radial sand ridges in china s southern yellow sea are famous for their fan shaped pattern with complex channel shoals the area s large tidal range results in waves propagating onshore when most ridges are submerged at high tide while that process is limited by the exposure of sand ridges at low tide we investigated these processes using the wrf arw and mike21 models to assess the different spatiotemporal distributions of storm waves during normal spring tide tswr and the tidal conditions present during the passage of typhoon muifa tmwr in august 2011 spatial analysis showed that wave directions had few changes at high tide but changed significantly at low tide owing to the sheltering effects of sand ridges in the central and southern parts of the area differences in water level wld and significant wave height hsd between tswr and tmwr were high in the central and southern parts where maximum values were twice those further north temporal analysis showed that wld and hsd at twelve observation points within the sand ridges were significantly correlated our results show how employing wld and hsd data can be used to improve the science based prediction and

role in sediment movement within coastal areas edwards 1951 young 1988 hall 2011 zhang et al 2017 with expanding marine development storm waves increasingly affect terrain stability and threaten nearshore infrastructure and navigation consequently many studies have investigated the spatiotemporal variability of storm waves under the influences of complex terrain and tides one example of such

characteristics of the rsrs based on the mean water level finding that the contours of wave heights were distributed in an arc with jianggang at the center hou et al 2013 used comparative analysis of significant wave heights with and without tidal effects in this area to show that storm wave simulations could be improved by considering changes in tidal water level the rsr region is characterized by a typical monsoon climate with clear seasonal variations typhoons are frequent many being very strong and capable of heavily damaging both terrain and infrastructure from 1949 to 2007 76 typhoons influenced the jiangsu coast more than half of which moved northward through the east china sea without making landfall xu et al 2016 on july 28 2011 a developing system was upgraded to tropical storm status and named muifa becoming the ninth named storm of that year s pacific typhoon season on july 31 muifa had strengthened to a super typhoon with peak winds reaching 55 m s though it weakened to a strong typhoon later in the day it entered the rsr region on august 7 during the neap tide affecting the area for several days overall typhoon muifa was a large strong and persistent storm that caused serious damage making it the focus of subsequent research on storm disasters tang et al 2015 found that during typhoon muifa wave height and period in the rsr region were significantly affected by tides and weakly affected by currents during the storm dai et al 2016 found the northern and central parts of the rsr region were dominated by swells whereas the southern areas were more affected by wind blown waves although the characteristics of storm surges and waves in this region have been investigated based on different wind hydrodynamic and wave models past research has conducted simulations assuming constant tidal levels or continuous tidal processes during the typhoon however energy dissipation has a negative correlation with depth that varies with tidal modulation kim et al 2008 wave height is larger at high astronomical tide than at low astronomical tide because of the lower energy dissipation induced by the bottom bosboom and stive 2011 feser et al 2015 therefore it is necessary to compare storm waves induced by different types of tides within a single typhoon event especially for the rsr region with its macrotidal range in this study we investigated the spatiotemporal effects of tides on storm waves affected by the rsrs morphology using forecasting and hydrodynamic models to simulate two idealized cases with the same wind field tidal conditions during typhoon muifa tmwr and normal spring tides tswr 2 study area the rsrs are a unique and complex marine sand ridge morphology located along the central jiangsu coast fig 1 a and b bordered by the yangtze river estuary to the south and the old yellow river delta to the north ren 1986 tidal and terrain characteristics define two main sand ridges tiaozini and jiangjiasha that roughly divide the area into two geomorphic units zhu et al 1998 xu et al 2016 the northern and southern channel shore systems ncs and scs respectively fig 1c the ridges in the ncs have an average width of 15 km and extend offshore from southwest northeast as far as 35 m water depth in comparison most of the ridges and channels in the scs are shorter and straighter with two main channels huangshayang and lanshayang having depths of 10 20 m this system evolved from an ancient radial tidal sand ridge system formed during the holocene regression by the interaction of a progressive tidal wave system propagating from the east china sea and a rotational tidal wave system approaching from the southern yellow sea chen et al 2012 2019 xing et al 2012 the tidal ranges of the ncs and scs are large especially along the coast near jianggang where conditions are macrotidal bosboom and stive 2011 tang et al 2015 the mean tidal range near the old yellow river is lowest 2 m gradually increasing toward the region s center to a maximum of 4 57 m then gradually decreasing to 3 m in the xiaomiaohong channel chen et al 2019 the mean and gradient of the tidal range in the scs is larger than that in the ncs fig 1c the large tidal range means that most of the sand ridges are periodically submerged and exposed during tidal cycles wang et al 1999 making the tidal wave systems more complicated fig 2 3 methodology 3 1 coupling of wind tidal and current wave modeling 3 1 1 wrf modeling the weather research and forecast wrf arw model is one of the most advanced meteorological models available with widely proven reliability mori et al 2014 fierro et al 2015 lakshmi et al 2017 we configured this model to use a two way interactive nested domain fig 1 covering 145 h from august 3 2011 0 00 utc to august 9 2011 0 00 utc with an outer d1 and inner d2 domain table 1 3 1 2 hydrodynamic and wave model as the simulation area mainly comprised a continental shelf environment where current changes are predominantly horizontal we used the two dimensional hydrodynamic mike21 flow model mike21 fm to simulate variables flow and tides we further applied the widely used mike21 spectral wave sw module for wave calculations thomas and dwarakish 2015 venugopal and nemalidinne 2015 both models use one way nesting the outer domain ranged from 119 2 to 127 e and 28 4 37 4 n with 49036 grids sized from 2000 to 5000 m while the inner domain ranged from 120 3 to 123 4 e and 31 7 34 8 n with 158291 grids sized from 100 to 2000 m fig 1 the resolution of the bathymetry data used in these models was high reaching 50 m in the nearshore areas the boundaries of the hydraulic model were obtained from the east china sea model established by chen et al 2012 according to the seabed sediment and depth characteristics the bed resistance normally ranged from 25 to 83 m1 3 s as a result of the close correlation between storm surge and wave accuracy the wind friction factor was specified by an empirical formula that has proven to be reliable smith 1980 yu et al 2013 according to a model parameter sensitivity analysis of mike21 sw most calibration parameters other than the white capping parameter such as the bottom friction and breaking parameters were not very effective the white capping parameter is vital to the accuracy of storm wave simulations higher values of wave height periods produce smaller white capping coefficient values that give more realistic results güner et al 2013 therefore we set the white capping coefficient as 0 5 and retained the default values for other parameters all boundary conditions for the inner domain were sourced from the outer domain 3 2 model validation challenging issues in typhoon prediction include the accuracy of parameters such as track and intensity of sustained wind speed lakshmi et al 2017 a comparison of typhoon muifa s wrf fnl simulated track and japan meteorological agency jma best track estimates showed that displacement errors were initially minimal but increased gradually with the storm s northward movement fig 1a compared with previous studies yu et al 2013 lakshmi et al 2017 the maximum error was 90 km meaning that the consistency of maxima minima in the displacement errors at different stages of typhoon muifa s progression were simulated by wrf reasonably well we compared the observed wind speed from four measurement stations with the wrf results datangdianchang dtdc xuwei xw taiyangdao tyd and dafeng df table 2 fig 3 the data from df and xw were sourced from lin et al 2015 all stations had similar trends in wind speed for typhoon muifa with most deviations 5 m s quantitative comparisons by computing the root mean square error rmse normalized bias nbi and scatter index si were also performed to validate the model because these error metrics are not always associated with the best performance of a numerical model reproducing natural processes such as atmospheric dynamics ocean circulation or wave generation and propagation the symmetrically normalized root mean square error hh was introduced to improve the evaluation mentaschi et al 2013 the error metrics were calculated as follows 1 r m s e 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 2 n b i 1 n i 1 n s i o i 1 n i 1 n o i 3 s i 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 1 n i 1 n o i 4 h h i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n o i s i where s is the modeled series o is the observed series and n is the total number of data in the series the metrics are summarized in table 3 although the si and nbi errors at the df station were larger than those in other wind studies mori et al 2014 draxl et al 2015 wang et al 2019 the rmse was just 3 32 m and the simulation had trends similar to those of the measurement the nbi si and hh errors at other stations showed that the wrf could simulate typhoon muifa with high levels of accuracy with mean absolute values of 0 14 0 38 and 0 31 m respectively therefore the wrf simulated wind field for typhoon muifa was judged to be more than sufficient for use as the wind input for the hydrodynamic and wave models the accuracy of the hydrodynamic model mike21 fm was a crucial precondition for wave simulation as this was used to provide depth and current conditions as an input to mike21 sw although the accuracy of the storm surge was more difficult to validate because of insufficient data mori et al 2014 we were able to use two temporary tide gauge stations dtdc and tzn that monitored the water level during typhoon muifa contrasting the observed storm surge with result simulated by mike21 fm showed that the simulated water level at tzn accurately revealed the trend of tidal processes table 3 fig 4 however although the simulated high tide at dtdc matched the observed data with 20 cm deviation the low tide was lower than the observed data before typhoon muifa arrived while the opposite occurred after the storm moved on at the dtdc station this may have been because the dtdc station was located in a shoal area where the simulated wind and pressure were severely affected by terrain hou et al 2013 further the simulated and observed water levels are comparable to those of other studies kim et al 2008 musinguzi et al 2019 with mean absolute values of rmse nbi si and hh at 0 25 0 15 0 37 and 0 32 m respectively nevertheless the accuracy of the spatial distribution of the storm surge calculated by mike21 fm was sufficient for our purposes it is more difficult to validate a wave model in shallow waters because of the scarcity of nearshore measurement data dietrich et al 2011 to verify the wave model we compared the significant wave height calculated by mike21 sw with the observation data from three measurement stations as shown in fig 5 the results simulated by mike21 sw at all stations matched well with the observation data with most of the deviations 0 25 m compared with the results simulated by other models dietrich et al 2011 bi et al 2015 mentaschi et al 2015 the error metrics at all stations showed that the mike21 sw model was reliable and accurate table 3 and could accurately reflect dynamic changes in actual wave processes in the nearshore shallow water area consequently the wave model could effectively provide an accurate description of wave generation and propagation 3 3 experimental conditions to evaluate the effects of tidal variations on storm waves we conducted two experiments based on actual astronomical tide during typhoon muifa and spring tide under the same wind condition table 4 the tidal phases of both were nearly synchronous processes fig 6 the water level was defined as the sum of wind set up and astronomical tide by the coupling of wind tide and waves to define the maximum differences in tidal amplitudes at high and low tide two typical time points t1 and t2 respectively were selected from the distribution of tidal phases in the huangshayang channel fig 6 during spring tide the mean tidal range reached 5 99 m with a maximum water level of 4 09 m while during typhoon muifa the mean tidal range was 3 24 m and the maximum water level was only 2 78 m the differences in water levels between tswr and tmwr were 1 45 m and 1 88 m respectively and the maximum and minimum water levels of the latter were 68 and 55 of the former to assess the temporal variability of water level and storm waves obtained for tmwr and tswr we selected six large channels and extracted two observation points per channel fig 1c table 5 excluding the effect of wave breaking the depth of the inner and outer points was 10 m and 15 m respectively according to the distribution of the surf zone yang and feng 2010 the xiyang chenjiawu and kushuiyang channels were located in the ncs while the others were located in the scs 4 results previous studies have shown that wave height has a significant relationship with tides kim et al 2008 hou et al 2013 tang et al 2015 to investigate this in the above cases we assessed the spatial and temporal differences in storm waves 4 1 spatial variability of storm waves to directly compare and analyze the differences in hs we used gis spatial analysis to calculate the differences in water level wld and hs hsd between both cases as 5 w l d η t s w r η t m w r 6 h s d h s t s w r h s t m w r where η t s w r and h s t s w r are the total water level which is the sum of storm surge and astronomical tide and hs in tswr and η t m w r and h s t m w r are in tmwr during t1 the wave directions in both cases changed little because most sand ridges were submerged fig 7 a by contrast the wld was susceptible to tides in the central and southern parts especially in the xiaomiaohong channel where this reached 1 8 m fig 7b the maximum hsd was situated near the hengsha and lengjiasha ridges in the scs exceeding 0 8 m fig 7c the depth of the 0 4 m hsd contours was 5 m in the ncs and 12 m in the scs during t2 the wave directions in both cases showed obvious changes especially between the tiaozini and lengjiasha ridges in the scs with few changes in the ncs fig 7d because many large sand ridges were exposed at low tide tswr had a maximum wld value of 2 m fig 7e as the directions and magnitudes of storm waves were deeply affected by the complex terrain the 0 4 m hsd contour was further from the coast than in t1 0 4 m hsd contour and the maximum hsd was nearly 0 8 m fig 7f in summary whether at highest or lowest tide both the magnitudes of wld and hsd were larger in the central and southern parts of the area with maximum values of 2 m and 0 75 m respectively 4 2 temporal variability of storm waves the time series results from august 7 0 00 utc to august 7 23 00 utc of hs wld and hsd at twelve observation points were obtained to compare the inner and outer points with different depths in the same channel and investigate the differences in these factors at points in different channels at the same depth table 6 fig 8 in the ncs both xy1 and xy2 xiyang channel had hsd and wld values significantly smaller than those at other points with the maximum values being below 0 01 m and 0 1 m respectively however in the chenjiawu channel the hsd and wld had a higher increase at the inner point c1 than at the outer point c2 at k1 and k2 kushuiyang channel the maximum hsds of both points increased by 0 1 m against comparable points with the same depth in other channels although the maximum wld at k1 increased by only 0 1 m compared with c1 k2 had a noticeable rise of nearly 0 6 m compared with c2 the hsd and wld values were significantly larger in the scs than in the ncs in the huangshayang and lanshayang channels the maximum hsds and wlds at the inner points h1 and l1 slightly increased by around 0 05 m and 0 1 m respectively against those in the kushuiyang channel but the hsds at the outer points h2 and l2 obviously increased by more than 0 1 m in the xiaomiaohong channel the maximum hsds had a dramatic increase over any other point especially at the inner point x1 0 3 m however the maximum wlds decreased rather than increased when compared with nearby channels overall for the points in the same channel the maximum hsd and wld were significantly larger at the inner point than at the outer one at points with the same depth in different channels the maximum hsds gradually increased from north to the south reaching 0 79 m and 0 5 m at the inner and outer points respectively waves are significantly affected by the strength of typhoons smith 1980 lakshmi et al 2017 during the passage of typhoon muifa the wind speed recorded at the four stations first increased and then decreased fig 3 for wind blown waves the dominant wave pattern during typhoon muifa dai et al 2016 the hs had a similar trend with wind fig 8 for example at h2 with a maximum wind speed of 36 m s the hs for both tswr and tmwr was 6 5 m table 6 under similar wind speed conditions the greater the water depth the larger the hs in the same channel wld and hsd had similar trends fig 8 to investigate the relationship between wld and hsd we calculated the pearson correlation coefficient using the statistical package for the social sciences spss v 24 the two factors were significantly correlated at the 0 01 confidence interval for all observation points except xy1 and xy2 which had a mean pearson correlation coefficient of 0 92 table 7 moreover the variations in the two factors agreed well with one another except in the xiyang channel therefore the hsd peaks occurred at the highest or lowest tides in most parts of the rsr region the field measured data for wave height and water level during typhoon winnie regarded as a similarly serious tropical cyclone in the rsr region confirmed that the hs was significantly affected by tidal water level in the taiyangsha area near the lanshayang channel lu and dou 2011 our findings were in general agreement with but expanded upon that result 5 discussion for modeling storm waves topography and tidal variation are vital factors regardless of the model used kim et al 2008 dietrich et al 2011 gorrell et al 2011 because of the complexities of the tidal system and terrain in rsr region it is difficult to simulate the tidal waves there chen et al 2012 2019 dai et al 2016 the error statistics of the simulated and observed wind water level and significant wave height were compared with values previously calculated for regions where the terrain and tide are simpler dietrich et al 2011 musinguzi et al 2019 further the coupling results for wrf mike fm and mike sw could reflect the effects of tidal variation on storm waves based on the high resolution of bathymetry and reliable bottom friction as waves propagate into shallower water their transformations are susceptible to variations in bathymetry and tide holthuijsen 2007 lu and dou 2011 previous studies have shown that shoaling results in increasing wave height until breaking occurs when the water depth becomes less than roughly half the wavelength nelson and gonsalves 1992 bosboom and stive 2011 according to the wave dispersion equation guo 2002 the wavelength in the study area was 90 m during typhoon muifa therefore storm waves over depths 35 m were affected by the seabed through processes such as refraction shoaling bottom friction and wave breaking greater water depths induced by tides resulted in less wave energy being dissipated tolman 1991 kim et al 2008 feng et al 2018 this explains why the wld and hsd were both high in the scs and low in the ncs at both high and low tide in particular the hsd in the area between the subtidal zone the area only infrequently exposed during extreme low tide and the supratidal zone only submerged by spring tide or storm surge around the sand ridges was more sensitive with regard to wld because the m2 and s2 tidal constituents dominated in the rsr region the tidal range was mainly determined by their amplitudes and phases according to co tidal maps of m2 and s2 yanagi et al 1997 the distributions of their amplitudes are similar unlike the tidal range the wld was mainly determined by tidal constituents other than m2 especially s2 therefore the distribution of wld was similar to the s2 tidal constituent because of the significant correlation between hsd and wld the hsd was large in the ncs and small in the scs as the xiyang and chenjiawu channels are close to the amphidromic points of the above tidal constituents xu et al 2016 the hsds of xy1 xy2 and c2 were less than 0 15 m due to the smaller wld when the constituent amplitudes became significantly larger in the central and southern parts of the area the hsd of every point increased sharply according to the spatial distribution of wave direction and previous studies lin et al 2015 dai et al 2016 waves from the north were dominant during typhoon muifa zhang et al 1999 found that for ne waves induced by a wind speed of 26 7 m s the hs in the xiaomiaohong channel was more sensitive to tidal variation than those in other channels with the same water depth which is consistent with our results as the wld was easier to obtain from tidal data it could be used to preliminarily determine areas sensitive to storm waves with tidal variation rather than calculating hsd overall the sheltering effects of the sand ridges on wind blown waves during typhoon passage were clear the main determinants of wave height were wind and water depth which varied with tide consequently the central and southern parts of the rsr region should be considered key areas for storm disaster prevention for similar studies on storm waves tidal level should be considered a vital factor behind deriving accurate results 6 conclusions the complex terrain and tidal wave systems in the rsr region make it difficult to estimate the effects of tidal variations on storm waves we coupled advanced meteorological hydrodynamic and wave models to simulate and analyze the characteristics of water levels and waves under two different astronomical tide processes based on a case study for typhoon muifa which had an enormous influence on local wave patterns and geomorphology spatial analysis for the highest and lowest tidal conditions showed that when waves propagated from north to south the effects of tidal variations on wave direction and height were concentrated in the nearshore area of the scs as the ridges sheltering effect varied with changes in tidal water level to further describe the effects of tidal variations on storm waves we introduced new indices wld and hsd the wld was high in the central and southern parts induced by the amplitudes of the m2 and s2 tidal constituents the hsd varied similarly and was highest in the area between the subtidal and supratidal zones because of the significant relationship between wld and hsd the former can be used to preliminarily assess the locations of areas sensitive to storm waves with tidal variation rather than calculating hsd our results provide an important reference for coastal managers to make more informed decisions regarding storm disaster management in this region however as this study is site specific owing to the area s unique geomorphology further research is needed to explore the relationship between wld and hsd during typhoons in other settings acknowledgements this work was supported by the national key r d program of china grant number 2018yfc0407501

follows 1 r m s e 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 2 n b i 1 n i 1 n s i o i 1 n i 1 n o i 3 s i 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 1 n i 1 n o i 4 h h i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n o i s i where s is the modeled series o is the observed series and n is the total number of data in the series the metrics are summarized in table 3 although the si and nbi errors at the df station were larger than those in other wind studies mori et al 2014 draxl et al 2015 wang et al 2019 the rmse was just 3 32 m and the simulation had trends similar to those of the measurement the nbi si and hh errors at other stations showed that the wrf could simulate typhoon muifa with high levels of accuracy with mean absolute values of 0 14 0 38 and 0 31 m respectively therefore the wrf simulated wind field for typhoon muifa was judged to be more than sufficient for use as the wind input for the hydrodynamic and wave models the accuracy of the hydrodynamic model mike21 fm was a crucial precondition for wave simulation as this was used to provide depth and current conditions as an input to mike21 sw although the accuracy of the storm surge was more difficult to validate because of insufficient data mori et al 2014 we were able to use two temporary tide gauge stations dtdc and tzn that monitored the water level during typhoon muifa contrasting the observed storm surge with result simulated by mike21 fm showed that the simulated water level at tzn accurately revealed the trend of tidal processes table 3 fig 4 however although the simulated high tide at dtdc matched the observed data with 20 cm deviation the low tide was lower than the observed data before typhoon muifa arrived while the opposite occurred after the storm moved on at the dtdc station this may have been because the dtdc station was located in a shoal area where the simulated wind and pressure were severely affected by terrain hou et al 2013 further the simulated and observed water levels are comparable to those of other studies kim et al 2008 musinguzi et al 2019 with mean absolute values of rmse nbi si and hh at 0 25 0 15 0 37 and 0 32 m respectively nevertheless the accuracy of the spatial distribution of the storm surge calculated by mike21 fm was sufficient for our purposes it is more difficult to validate a wave model in shallow waters because of the scarcity of nearshore measurement data dietrich et al 2011 to verify the wave model we compared the significant wave height calculated by mike21 sw with the observation data from three measurement stations as shown in fig 5 the results simulated by mike21 sw at all stations matched well with the observation data with most of the deviations 0 25 m compared with the results simulated by other models dietrich et al 2011 bi et al 2015 mentaschi et al 2015 the error metrics at all stations showed that the mike21 sw model was reliable and accurate table 3 and could accurately reflect dynamic changes in actual wave processes in the nearshore shallow water area consequently the wave model could effectively provide an accurate description of wave generation and propagation 3 3 experimental conditions to evaluate the effects of tidal variations on storm waves we conducted two experiments based on actual astronomical tide during typhoon muifa and spring tide under the same wind condition table 4 the tidal phases of both were nearly synchronous processes fig 6 the water level was defined as the sum of wind set up and astronomical tide by the coupling of wind tide and waves to define the maximum differences in tidal amplitudes at high and low tide two typical time points t1 and t2 respectively were selected from the distribution of tidal phases in the huangshayang channel fig 6 during spring tide the mean tidal range reached 5 99 m with a maximum water level of 4 09 m while during typhoon muifa the mean tidal range was 3 24 m and the maximum water level was only 2 78 m the differences in water levels between tswr and tmwr were 1 45 m and 1 88 m respectively and the maximum and minimum water levels of the latter were 68 and 55 of the former to assess the temporal variability of water level and storm waves obtained for tmwr and tswr we selected six large channels and extracted two observation points per channel fig 1c table 5 excluding the effect of wave breaking the depth of the inner and outer points was 10 m and 15 m respectively according to the distribution of the surf zone yang and feng 2010 the xiyang chenjiawu and kushuiyang channels were located in the ncs while the others were located in the scs 4 results previous studies have shown that wave height has a significant relationship with tides kim et al 2008 hou et al 2013 tang et al 2015 to investigate this in the above cases we assessed the spatial and temporal differences in storm waves 4 1 spatial variability of storm waves to directly compare and analyze the differences in hs we used gis spatial analysis to calculate the differences in water level wld and hs hsd between both cases as 5 w l d η t s w r η t m w r 6 h s d h s t s w r h s t m w r where η t s w r and h s t s w r are the total water level which is the sum of storm surge and astronomical tide and hs in tswr and η t m w r and h s t m w r are in tmwr during t1 the wave directions in both cases changed little because most sand ridges were submerged fig 7 a by contrast the wld was susceptible to tides in the central and southern parts especially in the xiaomiaohong channel where this reached 1 8 m fig 7b the maximum hsd was situated near the hengsha and lengjiasha ridges in the scs exceeding 0 8 m fig 7c the depth of the 0 4 m hsd contours was 5 m in the ncs and 12 m in the scs during t2 the wave directions in both cases showed obvious changes especially between the tiaozini and lengjiasha ridges in the scs with few changes in the ncs fig 7d because many large sand ridges were exposed at low tide tswr had a maximum wld value of 2 m fig 7e as the directions and magnitudes of storm waves were deeply affected by the complex terrain the 0 4 m hsd contour was further from the coast than in t1 0 4 m hsd contour and the maximum hsd was nearly 0 8 m fig 7f in summary whether at highest or lowest tide both the magnitudes of wld and hsd were larger in the central and southern parts of the area with maximum values of 2 m and 0 75 m respectively 4 2 temporal variability of storm waves the time series results from august 7 0 00 utc to august 7 23 00 utc of hs wld and hsd at twelve observation points were obtained to compare the inner and outer points with different depths in the same channel and investigate the differences in these factors at points in different channels at the same depth table 6 fig 8 in the ncs both xy1 and xy2 xiyang channel had hsd and wld values significantly smaller than those at other points with the maximum values being below 0 01 m and 0 1 m respectively however in the chenjiawu channel the hsd and wld had a higher increase at the inner point c1 than at the outer point c2 at k1 and k2 kushuiyang channel the maximum hsds of both points increased by 0 1 m against comparable points with the same depth in other channels although the maximum wld at k1 increased by only 0 1 m compared with c1 k2 had a noticeable rise of nearly 0 6 m compared with c2 the hsd and wld values were significantly larger in the scs than in the ncs in the huangshayang and lanshayang channels the maximum hsds and wlds at the inner points h1 and l1 slightly increased by around 0 05 m and 0 1 m respectively against those in the kushuiyang channel but the hsds at the outer points h2 and l2 obviously increased by more than 0 1 m in the xiaomiaohong channel the maximum hsds had a dramatic increase over any other point especially at the inner point x1 0 3 m however the maximum wlds decreased rather than increased when compared with nearby channels overall for the points in the same channel the maximum hsd and wld were significantly larger at the inner point than at the outer one at points with the same depth in different channels the maximum hsds gradually increased from north to the south reaching 0 79 m and 0 5 m at the inner and outer points respectively waves are significantly affected by the strength of typhoons smith 1980 lakshmi et al 2017 during the passage of typhoon muifa the wind speed recorded at the four stations first increased and then decreased fig 3 for wind blown waves the dominant wave pattern during typhoon muifa dai et al 2016 the hs had a similar trend with wind fig 8 for example at h2 with a maximum wind speed of 36 m s the hs for both tswr and tmwr was 6 5 m table 6 under similar wind speed conditions the greater the water depth the larger the hs in the same channel wld and hsd had similar trends fig 8 to investigate the relationship between wld and hsd we calculated the pearson correlation coefficient using the statistical package for the social sciences spss v 24 the two factors were significantly correlated at the 0 01 confidence interval for all observation points except xy1 and xy2 which had a mean pearson correlation coefficient of 0 92 table 7 moreover the variations in the two factors agreed well with one another except in the xiyang channel therefore the hsd peaks occurred at the highest or lowest tides in most parts of the rsr region the field measured data for wave height and water level during typhoon winnie regarded as a similarly serious tropical cyclone in the rsr region confirmed that the hs was significantly affected by tidal water level in the taiyangsha area near the lanshayang channel lu and dou 2011 our findings were in general agreement with but expanded upon that result 5 discussion for modeling storm waves topography and tidal variation are vital factors regardless of the model used kim et al 2008 dietrich et al 2011 gorrell et al 2011 because of the complexities of the tidal system and terrain in rsr region it is difficult to simulate the tidal waves there chen et al 2012 2019 dai et al 2016 the error statistics of the simulated and observed wind water level and significant wave height were compared with values previously calculated for regions where the terrain and tide are simpler dietrich et al 2011 musinguzi et al 2019 further the coupling results for wrf mike fm and mike sw could reflect the effects of tidal variation on storm waves based on the high resolution of bathymetry and reliable bottom friction as waves propagate into shallower water their transformations are susceptible to variations in bathymetry and tide holthuijsen 2007 lu and dou 2011 previous studies have shown that shoaling results in increasing wave height until breaking occurs when the water depth becomes less than roughly half the wavelength nelson and gonsalves 1992 bosboom and stive 2011 according to the wave dispersion equation guo 2002 the wavelength in the study area was 90 m during typhoon muifa therefore storm waves over depths 35 m were affected by the seabed through processes such as refraction shoaling bottom friction and wave breaking greater water depths induced by tides resulted in less wave energy being dissipated tolman 1991 kim et al 2008 feng et al 2018 this explains why the wld and hsd were both high in the scs and low in the ncs at both high and low tide in particular the hsd in the area between the subtidal zone the area only infrequently exposed during extreme low tide and the supratidal zone only submerged by spring tide or storm surge around the sand ridges was more sensitive with regard to wld because the m2 and s2 tidal constituents dominated in the rsr region the tidal range was mainly determined by their amplitudes and phases according to co tidal maps of m2 and s2 yanagi et al 1997 the distributions of their amplitudes are similar unlike the tidal range the wld was mainly determined by tidal constituents other than m2 especially s2 therefore the distribution of wld was similar to the s2 tidal constituent because of the significant correlation between hsd and wld the hsd was large in the ncs and small in the scs as the xiyang and chenjiawu channels are close to the amphidromic points of the above tidal constituents xu et al 2016 the hsds of xy1 xy2 and c2 were less than 0 15 m due to the smaller wld when the constituent amplitudes became significantly larger in the central and southern parts of the area the hsd of every point increased sharply according to the spatial distribution of wave direction and previous studies lin et al 2015 dai et al 2016 waves from the north were dominant during typhoon muifa zhang et al 1999 found that for ne waves induced by a wind speed of 26 7 m s the hs in the xiaomiaohong channel was more sensitive to tidal variation than those in other channels with the same water depth which is consistent with our results as the wld was easier to obtain from tidal data it could be used to preliminarily determine areas sensitive to storm waves with tidal variation rather than calculating hsd overall the sheltering effects of the sand ridges on wind blown waves during typhoon passage were clear the main determinants of wave height were wind and water depth which varied with tide consequently the central and southern parts of the rsr region should be considered key areas for storm disaster prevention for similar studies on storm waves tidal level should be considered a vital factor behind deriving accurate results 6 conclusions the complex terrain and tidal wave systems in the rsr region make it difficult to estimate the effects of tidal variations on storm waves we coupled advanced meteorological hydrodynamic and wave models to simulate and analyze the characteristics of water levels and waves under two different astronomical tide processes based on a case study for typhoon muifa which had an enormous influence on local wave patterns and geomorphology spatial analysis for the highest and lowest tidal conditions showed that when waves propagated from north to south the effects of tidal variations on wave direction and height were concentrated in the nearshore area of the scs as the ridges sheltering effect varied with changes in tidal water level to further describe the effects of tidal variations on storm waves we introduced new indices wld and hsd the wld was high in the central and southern parts induced by the amplitudes of the m2 and s2 tidal constituents the hsd varied similarly and was highest in the area between the subtidal and supratidal zones because of the significant relationship between wld and hsd the former can be used to preliminarily assess the locations of areas sensitive to storm waves with tidal variation rather than calculating hsd our results provide an important reference for coastal managers to make more informed decisions regarding storm disaster management in this region however as this study is site specific owing to the area s unique geomorphology further research is needed to explore the relationship between wld and hsd during typhoons in other settings acknowledgements this work was supported by the national key r d program of china grant number 2018yfc0407501

various parts such as leaf spring bumpers panel bodies and doors kaw 2005 the use of frp composites in the construction of high speed boats mine countermeasure vessels and in various subparts of large naval vessels is well known frp composite materials are also used in the construction of submerged pressure hulls due to their high strength to weight ratio as compared to other metals and alloys

fabric fiber s orientations and reference direction are defined using rosettes and oriented selection sets of acp the plies for each laminate s layer are defined in modeling groups of acp 2 2 boundary and loading conditions boundary conditions are applied to both ends of the pressure hull the displacement in the x y z and rotation in the x directions is fixed at the aft end the pressure hull similarly the displacement in the y and z directions is fixed at the forward end of the pressure hull these boundary conditions are consistent with previously used boundary conditions for similar pressure hull craven et al 2016 a uniform pressure of 3 mpa is applied to the outer surface of the pressure hull the boundary and loading conditions on the pressure hull are shown in fig 1 b 2 3 finite element model solution procedure composite modeling of the pressure hull is carried out using the acp component of ansys workbench the model is then transferred to the static structural analysis system of ansys workbench for carrying out static structural analysis and the factors of safety for tsai wu and tsai hill failure criteria are calculated for carrying out buckling analysis the data is then transferred to eigenvalue buckling analysis system and the linear buckling strength factor is determined the static structure and buckling analysis performed in this study are both linear elastic analysis this analysis is quick and easy to conduct and can be used for preliminary design considerations linear elastic analysis has also been considered in the conceptual design and

design optimization study 3 design optimization of composite pressure hull for optimization of the composite submersible pressure hull ga in the direct design optimization component of ansys workbench is used the ga used in this study is a variant of nsga ii which is based on controlled elitism and finds the global optimum it supports single and multiple objectives and constraints it uses cross over and mutation for the generation of new population cross over produces offspring by combining two parents chromosomes if the best properties from each of the parents are taken then the offspring new chromosomes can be better than both of the parents the mutation changes one or more gene values in a chromosome from its initial value with the addition of new gene values the algorithm can give better value than previously determined mutation helps prevent the population from stagnating at local optima both cross over and mutation occur during evolution according to user defined probability the optimization process flow chart is shown in fig 2 3 1 objective of optimization the objective function of optimization is to minimize the buoyancy factor b f of the pressure hull under constraints

22452,few years after the introduction of the first global regulation covering the energy efficiency of ships this article analyzes status quo of the industry based on the interplay of different technical measures such as ship age size propulsion speed and consumption as well as the policy benchmark of energy efficiency design index eedi this paper is one of the first to introduce a combined technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis and hierarchical agglomerative clustering hac approach the analysis shows that the average vessel age of the most energy efficient cluster of 7 years correlates with the time period since eedi introduction thus indicating policy driven environmental progress at the same time results suggest that further action is required higher stated energy efficiency is rather exhibited by a smaller part of the world fleet and by vessels characterized by higher commercial value two action fields are highlighted by the analysis firstly the elevated role of know how transfer by promoting role models and first movers secondly the need for alternative financing models due to significant upfront investments required by the industry to implement green technology and the long time periods between policy introduction and environmental results keywords decarbonization eedi marpol annex iv air emissions from ships topsis hierarchical agglomerative clustering 1 introduction shipping contributed on average 3 1 of global co2 emission between 2007 and 2012 smith et al 2014 at the same time a reduction from 1100 mt in 2007 3 5 of global ghg emissions to 938 mt in 2012 2 6 of global ghg emissions could be realized smith et al 2014 this reduction emphasizes the progress policy makers and industry stakeholders could achieve over the last years through research efforts as well as identification and implementation of energy efficiency measures buhaug et al 2009 on the policy side the imo has addressed the issue of decarbonizing the maritime industry by amending the annex vi of the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships marpol with effect january 2013 imo 2011 and presenting the first regulation covering the energy efficiency of ships by introducing inter alia the energy efficiency design index eedi imo 2012a on the side of specific actions broad research has been presented in the literature on the impact of energy efficiency measures the literature spans from work focusing on the energy efficiency impact of changes in ship characteristics as well as the drivers of energy efficiency within different vessel segments or the world fleet as a whole several studies highlight the importance of growing ship size for emission reductions tillig et al 2015 gucwa and schäfer 2013 faber et al 2011 particularly through economies of scale bughaug et al 2009 notteboom and vernimmen 2009 as well as cullinanae and khanna 2000 focused on a specific vessel segment by presenting examinations of different ship sizes for container vessels in addition speed optimization has been identified as driver for emission reductions by corbett et al 2009 lin 2012 lindstad et al 2011 miola et al 2011 as well as sea at risk and ce delft 2010 the impact of hull shape such as dimensions and form improvements through more slender design is presented in lindstad and eskeland 2015 using the example of oil tankers while stott and wright 2011 lindstad et al 2013b and lindstad et al 2014 focus on hull designs in the dry bulk carrier segment furthermore the area of power and propulsion also shows significant potential for emission reductions heitmann and peterson 2014 hoffmann et al 2012 alvik et al 2010 notwithstanding the progress in a business as usual scenario emissions could increase by 50 250 by 2050 from 2012 levels smith et al 2014 undermining the objectives of the paris agreement unfccc 2015 furthermore the emission reduction potential varies significantly across measures and studies e g for vessel size between 4 and 83 lindstad 2013 faber et al 2011 gilbert et al 2014 tillig et al 2015 wang et al 2010 miola et al 2011 wärtsila 2009 stott and wright 2011 lindstad et al 2012 2016 gucwa and schäfer 2013 lindstad and eskeland 2015 halfdanarson and snare 2015 pauli 2016 zöllner 2009 the above non exhaustive literature review demonstrated the wide spectrum of conducted research at the same time more holistic approaches are required such as identifying feasible combinations of measures as no single measure is solely sufficient to achieve meaningful emission reductions across the maritime industries bouman et al 2017 smith et al 2013 emphasize that more research needs to be done on the development of shipping s energy efficiency over time for designing evidence based policies that limit economical industry impact furthermore studies concerning technical energy efficiency of ships often lack methodological rigor suggesting further work with alternative methods to validate research findings and to achieve a holistic view of emissions from shipping rehmatulla et al 2017 in this regard the first aim of this paper is to draw conclusions from clusters of ships broken down per estimated eedi along with individual ship particulars results are extracted from a substantial sample size of 497 vessels of different age classes and across main shipping segments the long term effect of eedi regulation on the industry will only be observable in the long run hasan 2011 and benefits will evolve only incrementally once new ships replace the existing fleet given the expected vessel life span of 25 35 years icct 2011 this poses a common challenge on policy makers across industries as decision making about capital intense measures with significant economic implications for the specific industry is required today while environmental effects will only realize years ahead in the future underdahl 2010 the analysis of macro trends within vessel segments is therefore helpful for adding new knowledge on the status quo of energy efficiency in maritime transport and for identifying areas of further action to make better use of the industry s energy efficiency potential smith et al 2016 show that the existence of eedi compared to a scenario in which there is no eedi only amounts to a difference in ghg emissions of 3 until 2050 cames et al 2015 highlight that despite the existing eedi regulations the industry s share of emissions from around 2 of global co2 emissions could increase to approximately 17 in 2018 the imo adopted resolution mepc 304 72 on initial imo strategy on reduction of ghg emissions from ships initial imo strategy and formulated the target of reducing ghg emissions by at least 50 by 2050 compared to 2008 as well as the imo vision of phasing them out completely within this century imo vision imo 2018b this initial imo strategy forms the first milestone of the roadmap for developing a comprehensive imo strategy on reduction of ghg emissions from ships imo roadmap the aim is to develop a revised strategy revised imo strategy by 2023 imo 2016a which includes additional short mid and long term measures for ghg emission reductions as per resolution mepc 278 70 a new data collection system imo dcs for fuel oil consumption of ships including proxies for transport work was adopted imo 2016b the introduction of the imo dcs forms the first in a three step approach of analyzing collected data as a basis for future policy development and discussion imo 2016a at the regional level the eu recently adopted the regulation on the monitoring reporting and verification of shipping emissions eu mrv which will provide further data on co2 emissions and other related information european commission 2019 a comparison of eu mrv and imo dcs could be found in lonsdale et al 2019 and dnv gl 2019 lonsdale et al 2019 concluded that due to higher disclosure and information feedback the current eu mrv system could deliver 0 7 higher potential co2 emission reductions until 2040 compared to a eu mrv system equivalent to the imo dcs system lonsdale et al 2019 the second aim of this paper is thus to present a universal analytical framework which could be useful for the analysis of future data from the eu mrv as well as the imo dcs to support the three step approach of data analysis with a view to adoption of the revised imo strategy in 2023 the two research objectives of this article are summarized in fig 1 below methodologically the problem is approached as follows in a first step a topsis ranking of the vessels is carried out based on a combination of five vessel specific technical attributes in relation to age size speed propulsion and consumption afterwards a hac analysis reveals heterogeneous vessel clusters characterized by different estimated eedi taking into account the ships individual topsis ranking as well as the vessel specific eedi score the clusters are then analyzed with a view to the composition of vessels within the cluster to draw conclusions on their energy efficiency levels as per estimated eedi and technical characteristics using eedi for academic studies is an established concept in literature for example to examine the relationship between energy efficiency and time charter rates agnolucci et al 2014 to propose alternative formulations of the ship specific correction factors alisafaki and papanikolaou 2015 or eedi calculation ančić et al 2013 fleet estimates were used to form the baseline curves of the imo marpol annex vi amendment imo 2011 2012b or to form the existing vessel design index evdi rightship 2012 a detailed discussion of evdi in the academic literature is presented e g by polakis et al 2019 and psaraftis 2019 the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the dataset section 3 explains briefly topsis and hac techniques and section 4 presents the results of the analysis in section 5 results are discussed and put into the broader perspective of the world fleet while section 6 summarizes the findings and concludes this work 2 data this study is based on a sample of 497 different ships over 400 gt covering a diverse set of sub segments as summarized in table 1 as well as different age classes 299 ships aged 10 years and 198 ships aged 10 years and technical specifications the sample includes main cargo carrying ship types as well as passenger ferries and ropax vessels in order to address both the industry side which is characterized by a variety of different segments kavussanos 2010 2003 1997 1996a 1996b tsouknidis 2016 and the policy side defined by the vessel segments of the eedi scope imo 2014 bazari and longva 2011 this is supposed to allow for generalizing results and for drawing conclusions which might be representative for large parts of the industry according to unctad 2017 the world merchant fleet consisted of 93 161 vessels thus the sample used in this empirical analysis represents approximately 0 53 of the total merchant fleet for the purpose of the analysis five vessel specific variables are selected age in years size in deadweight tons propulsion in kilowatt speed in knots as well as consumption in tons per day the variables were chosen to reflect important key categories of energy efficiency measures that were presented in the introduction in addition the vessel estimated eedi score is considered it is briefly reminded that eedi is a benchmark evolved from the two imo studies on greenhouse gas emissions from ships in 2000 and 2009 buhaug et al 2009 skjolsvik et al 2000 and was adopted in mepc 203 62 as policy initiative towards decarbonizing operations by improving the unit energy requirements imo 2011 the eedi considers a single ship s energy requirements in design conditions and translates them into c o 2 emissions i e in co2 gram per unit of useful transport work expressed in ton miles in a simplified approach the formula of eedi is shown below e e d i c o 2 f r o m t h e p r o p u l s i o n c o 2 f r o m t h e a u x i l i a r y c o 2 i n n o v a t i v e t e c h n o l o g y d w t s p e e d regulation 21 of marpol annex vi considers refence lines per ship type and the eedi of every ship should be less than this reference line defined in resolution mepc 215 63 imo 2012b reference lines will gradually become stricter over time thereby stimulating continued improvements in design and power systems as well as forcing operators to increase the vessel s energy efficiency by e g reducing the use of fossil fuels per unit of transport or by using alternative technologies that reduce carbon footprint the current maximum reduction factors of 30 will become effective in 2025 bazari and longva 2011 over time several amendments to the eedi regulations have been adopted in 2014 for example resolution mepc 245 66 was adopted imo 2014 to extend the scope of eedi to lng carriers roro and ropax vessels and in 2018 resolution mepc 301 72 introduced adjustments to the reference lines for roro and ropax vessels imo 2018a lloyd s register 2018 for the purpose of this analysis it is important to evaluate the differential δ e e d i of the estimated eedi from the relevant reference line e e d i r e f this differential yields the green profile of every ship the larger the negative differential δ e e d i the less the expected carbon footprint in design terms therefore the ship is greener δ e e d i e e d i e s t i m a t e d e e d i r e f given the above formula and for the purpose of this analysis ships with a negative δ e e d i are considered to be more efficient than the reference line while ships with a positive δ e e d i are considered to be less efficient than the reference line as stated the analysis of the sample considers vessel characteristics along with the differential of δ e e d i as an effort to unify all data particulars and estimated δeedi in a common matrix it is important to highlight that there is no tautology in the data set that could cripple the findings in this regard particular variables such as size in dead weight tons dwt and speed in knots contribute in the eedi formula therefore impact the result i e the estimated eedi lindstad et al 2012 2013 2014 have extensively commented on this issue in the current analysis particulars and δeedi are considered as input the descriptive statistics of the different variables used in the dataset is summarized in table 2 it can be seen that the mean of the particulars is larger than the standard deviation implying a low probability of extreme outliers while the variable speed is characterized by the lowest dispersion among the applied set of variables for δ e e d i the opposite is true indicating a high level of dispersion furthermore data of all variables are right skewed distributed the methodology of the analysis shall be discussed in detail in the following section 3 methodology the methodology applied in this work is based on a two step combined topsis and hac analysis that takes into account the data considered in the previous sections i e particulars and δeedi per ship the aim is to identify clusters of similar δeedi levels per ship type which in turn provide objective data driven conclusions from the cluster compositions the methodological framework is summarized in fig 2 below while the following sub sections introduce the two concepts of topsis and hac analysis in the context of this study topsis serves the purpose of deriving a single dimensionless value for every of each of the 497 ships based on the five main attributes of the ships i e of age in years size in dwt speed in knots propulsion in installed kw and consumption in tons day these criteria are used in commercial transactions this dimensionless index is unique per ship and homogenizes the sample in terms of technical characteristics moreover enables the combination with the δeedi per ship and the use of hac technique 3 1 technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution at first the topsis method is applied to yield an energy efficiency ranking of the vessels based on the five vessel specific technical attributes in relation to age size speed propulsion and consumption the stepwise procedure described is based on the topsis method developed by hwang and yoon in 1981 hwang and yoon 1981 which were modified by yoon in 1987 yoon 1987 as well as hwang lai and liu in 1993 hwang et al 1993 the basic underlying concept is to find solutions from a finite set of alternatives while the chosen alternatives should have the shortest distance from the positive ideal solution pis and the farthest distance from the negative ideal solution nis topsis is a useful method for multi attribute or multi criteria decision making problems such as energy efficiency and has been successfully applied in the research field of maritime transport for example by karahalios 2017 to evaluate ballast water treatment systems by ioannis and nikitas 2013 to examine ship maintenance strategies or by schinas 2007 in the context of maritime safety assessment the model steps are as follows 1 step the decision matrix d is established with m rows and n columns representing the different alternates and evaluation criteria respectively d x 11 x 12 x 1 n x 21 x 22 x 2 n x m 1 x m 2 x m n each variable x i j in matrix d refers to the performance of alternative o i i 1 2 m with respect to the criterion c j j 1 2 n matrix d is provided as input and xij can be scaled or non scaled as per the theory 2 step the normalized decision matrix is calculated in order to transform the data into a dimensionless matrix this allows for comparison of the criteria from different sources by creating a unified unit for each variable x i j a normalized value r i j is calculated as follows r i j x i j i 1 m x i j 2 j 1 2 n 3 step the weighted normalized decision matrix is calculated by applying specific weights to the matrix generated in step 2 v i j w j r i j i 1 2 m j 1 2 n where w j is the weight of the jth criterion the vector wj is also provided as input and reveals the preferences of the decision maker as explained in section 1 the estimated impact across different energy efficiency measures varies significantly across different studies leaving uncertainty regarding the prioritization of measures which could be reflected in different weights applied to the analysis in order to follow a balanced approach and to avoid biased results by overweighting a specific measure the same weights are assigned to the five input criteria for the purpose of this analysis 4 step pis a and nis a are identified as follows a v 1 v 2 v n max i v i j j j 1 min i v i j j j 2 a v 1 v 2 v n min i v i j j j 1 max i v i j j j 2 where j 1 represent the criteria having a positive impact and j 2 represent the criteria having a negative impact 5 step separation measures are performed based on the euclidean distance from the pis d j and the nis d j of each alternative o i as follows d i j 1 n v i j v j 2 i 1 2 m d i j 1 n v i j v j 2 i 1 2 m 6 step the relative closeness s j for each alternative with respect to pis is determined s j d j d j d j j 1 2 m where 0 s j 1 7 step alternatives are ranked in descending order the solution with the largest s j should be ranked at the top as the shortest distance from the pis and the farthest distance from the nis characterize the most preferable option considering the minimum regret criterion as per the theory for the purposes of this analysis all criteria are equally weighted in order to avoid biased results 3 2 hierarchical agglomerative clustering hac following the topsis method a clustering analysis is carried out that aims to group a set of objects such as ships in the context of this work into subsets the so called clusters according to similar characteristics or properties different clustering methods exist and could be distinguished for example by the different metrics to define similarities among objects and the theoretical concepts are well described in the literature while a key advantage of clustering is that no a priori information regarding the number of clusters is required rokach and maimon 2005 kim et al 2001 fraley and raftery 1998 hartigan 1975 rand 1971 tyron and bailey 1970 in the context of maritime transport clustering methods were previously applied for example by nežerenko and koppel 2015 or rong et al 2017 this study applies a hierarchical agglomerative clustering hac by iteratively clustering the data set of vessels on the basis of the smallest distance measure across all pairwise distances between the ship s individual data points using euclidean distance and the single linkage distance metric sibson 1973 in a first step each vessel starts as a single cluster having level l 0 0 and sequence number m o in step 2 the least distance pair of clusters vessels a b is found according to d a b m i n d i j in step 3 the pair a and b is merged into a new cluster m while level of this cluster defined as l m d a b the distance between the new cluster a b and another existing cluster z is described by d z a b m i n d z a d z b the sequence is continued by incrementally merging all clusters until only one big cluster of ships is left the results of the hac process are typically summarized in a dendrogram that provides a graphical tool for choosing a meaningful actual number of clusters 4 application and results as a result of the topsis analysis described in section 3 1 a single dimensionless value for every of each of the 497 ships based on the five particulars is derived in a next step the topsis scores are combined with the likewise dimensionless δ e e d i that provides the green performance of every ship vis à vis the reference line of the regulation these are the input data for the following hac analysis in section 3 2 table 3 below summarizes the descriptive statistics of the variables and fig 3 provides a graphical overview of the available sample i e a mapping of the vessels according to each ship s individual topsis and δ e e d i scores the eedi regulation does not apply to ships built before 1 january 2013 imo 2011 given the sample data the pre eedi ships show a mean of 0 06 with standard deviation of 0 16 vis à vis the post eedi ships with mean of 0 17 and standard deviation of 0 12 the change of the sign indicate clearly the difference of the eedi i e the δ e e d i and the tendency towards less carbon per unit the mean δ e e d i of pre eedi ships being around zero indicates that eedi baseline values were created as a regression curve fit based on the pre eedi fleet 2012b the negative mean together with a lower dispersion of the post eedi ships compared to pre eedi ships reflect that δ e e d i of post eedi ships typically ranges between zero and negative as these ships have to comply with eedi whereas δ e e d i for pre eedi ships can be either positive zero or negative the hac algorithm applied in this study calculates the distance between each of the vessels by using the euclidean distance as described in section 3 2 afterwards the dissimilarity matrix is updated and clusters are merged until only one cluster is left the calculations resulted the cluster graph of fig 4 as well as the dendrogram shown in fig 5 below for reasons of clarity and comprehensibility only the merging process of the final 30 clusters is illustrated the graphical analysis shows that a meaningful number of clusters is achieved at the distance of 1 5 which includes 6 clusters that contain all of the 30 original clusters c 1 6 9 5 8 28 24 c 2 1 15 21 27 3 10 20 16 c 3 2 13 19 22 4 c 4 7 17 23 29 12 14 c 5 18 25 and c 6 11 26 30 beyond the distance of 1 5 a further merging of clusters would lead to a significant increase in index hierarchy to just below distance of 2 5 and finally 4 as well as 4 5 derived from the graphical overview of the total data set of vessels mapped according to each ship s individual topsis and δ e e d i score in fig 3 fig 6 highlights the data subset of vessels in each of the six clusters in a next step the clusters are analyzed with regards to outliers which are data points that are considerably deviating from the remainder of the dataset barnett and lewis 1994 and which might therefore have an impact on the results interpretation a broad literature exists in relation to outlier detection in the context of clustering methods jayakumar and thomas 2013 yoon et al 2007 van cutsem and gath 1993 the key assumption of outlier detection techniques based on hac methods is that outliers are isolated in very small clusters of low density and thus distant from regular and more frequent observations grouped in large and dense clusters almeida et al 2007 loureiro et al 2004 as shown by the high data concentration around topsis score of 0 3 in fig 3 the dendrogram and the graphs of fig 6 reveal that clusters 5 and 6 are characterized by a high distance from the other clusters and with only 12 respectively 7 ships also exhibit a comparably very small cluster size in conclusion clusters 5 and 6 are assumed to be outliers while these clusters will still be included in the dataset and analyzed in the discussion section in order to preserve the highest possible information content of the data sample the two clusters are excluded from the following cluster ranking process to allow for an unbiased interpretation of the energy efficiency trends revealed by the 4 groups considered as core clusters given that these include a combined number of 478 vessels and hence represent around 96 2 of the total sample data table 4 provides a breakdown of the characteristics displayed by the vessels assigned to the different clusters the comparison reveals significant differences between the compositions of the individual clusters the mean δ e e d i across vessels within the clusters indicates that the first cluster could be considered as containing the least energy efficient ships of the sample due to the mean δ e e d i of 0 234 being the highest positive δ e e d i among all four clusters in contrast based on a mean δ e e d i of 0 291 cluster 4 could be deemed as representing the cluster with vessels of highest energy efficiency within the sample following the topsis score which represents a dimensionless indicator for each ship s individual combination of the technical attributes shown in fig 3 cluster 3 ranks best with the highest mean score of 0 493 while cluster 1 again ranks lowest with mean topsis score of 0 314 based on the results of table 4 table 5 is derived where the ranking of δ e e d i and topsis score are only considered ranking scores are assigned to each cluster for both dimensions and clusters are subsequently ranked according to their total ranking score whereby the cluster with the lowest ranking score is ranked first and the cluster showing the highest ranking score ranked last the cluster ranking process is summarized in table 5 below while cluster 1 ranks lowest in both mean δ e e d i and topsis score leading to a total ranking score of 8 cluster 4 is considered the best ranked cluster given its highest rank in relation to mean δ e e d i and second highest rank in respect to topsis score leading to a total ranking score of 3 furthermore cluster 4 is the only cluster exhibiting a negative mean δ e e d i among the four clusters in conclusion clusters 1 and 4 represent the lower and upper end of the energy efficiency cluster range while cluster 2 and 3 are located within this range the following discussion will therefore use clusters 1 and 4 as reference clusters for drawing conclusions from the composition of the two clusters containing the on average most and least efficient vessels of the ranking sample 5 discussion 5 1 energy performance carbon footprint in a first step the composition of the two clusters 1 and 4 are considered with a view to the resulted δeedi the following results are derived 1 it is shown from the results that with a mean vessel age of 16 years ships in cluster 1 are on average more than twice as old as compared to cluster 4 which exhibits mean age of only 7 years in view of the introduction of eedi more than 6 years ago results suggest a positive regulatory impact on energy efficiency over time at the same time other factors impacting the energy performance of ships were identified by academic studies such as the effect of fuel prices on investment decisions in energy efficiency measures rehmatulla 2015 the potential prioritization of sulphur reduction over energy efficiency investments in the context of the imo regulations on sulphur emissions imo 2008 freight market conditions lindstad et al 2013 or the panama canal expansion lindstad et al 2013 to which extent the technical innovation was driven by regulations related to the energy efficiency of ships or other external factors could be a topic for further research results of this work show significant efficiency differences between the clusters in combination with the mean age of the efficient cluster being approximately in line with the time period since eedi became effective in conclusion a positive energy efficiency effect of the regulatory measures appears to be reasonably assumable 2 the mean vessel size of cluster 4 being around 64 000 dwt is almost twice as large as in cluster 1 with approximately 32 736 dwt confirming the economies of scale effect on energy efficiency as presented by various researchers and discussed in section 1 findings support that economies of scale in combination with reduced ship speed are key drivers for reduction of greenhouse gas ghg emissions as shown e g with reference to the period 2007 to 2012 in relation to size increase of average cargo ships from 22 500 dwt to 30 500 dwt confirming the results of smith et al 2014 3 moreover while the average ship size of the more efficient cluster is significantly higher the difference in consumption is only moderate approximately 26 between cluster 4 and cluster 1 it is noteworthy that the mean ship size of cluster 3 being ranked second in terms of energy efficiency is by factor of 4 59 larger than cluster 1 compared to the consumption mean increasing by factor of 2 39 adding to the improved energy performance of larger ships in terms of absolute fuel consumption the two outlier clusters 5 and 6 broadly support these three trends but also highlight limitations cluster 6 exhibits the highest and thus most inefficient δ e e d i in combination with the lowest mean ship size and highest mean ship age of all clusters which is in line with the identified trends for comparison purposes the 7 ships included in cluster 6 are on average only 26 78 of the mean vessel size of cluster 4 but require almost the same level of fuel consumption the 12 vessels of cluster 5 exhibit the highest mean topsis score in combination with a young mean ship age as well as the lowest consumption level relative to mean ship size of all clusters but at the same time show a mean δ e e d i which is above the levels of clusters 4 3 and 2 while this supports the three findings in terms of mean topsis score it also emphasizes the limitation that the identified trends might not be representative on a single ship basis as shown by the comparably lower energy efficiency levels of the 12 vessels in terms of δ e e d i 4 furthermore following the size reference of ships in cluster 4 being on average approximately double the size of vessels in cluster 1 the difference in installed propulsion power of 30 7 as well as the increase in design speed of 11 1 appear to be moderate too in conclusion in relation to the technical features despite the fact that all five variables show comparable dispersions as shown by the descriptive statistics of the applied variables in section 2 the variables age and size prove to be the two most distinct factors when distinguishing between the different stated energy performance clusters in the context of this work 5 2 vessel segments analysis in a second step the composition of vessel types within the clusters is analyzed results from section 4 are mapped against the world fleet using three different measures to draw conclusions and to identify potential areas for future actions firstly the market share in dwt thus representing the cargo carrying capacity and being the traditional market share indicator to account for the relevance of maritime transport for global trade volumes unctad 2017 secondly the share of co2 emissions to account for the vessel type s carbon footprint within the world fleet as per the third imo ghg study smith et al 2014 thirdly a different perspective is added to the analysis by considering the commercial value of the fleet in terms of the typically usd dollar value unctad 2017 in this context ships of higher commercial value are characterized by higher construction cost and are often used to transport cargo of higher unit value unctad 2017 5 2 1 container ships tankers dry bulk carriers firstly the aggregated share of the three main cargo ship types being container dry bulk and tankers is of interest while these three vessel segments make up 69 7 of cluster 1 the share among cluster 4 is only 28 9 considering that these three segments together clearly dominate the world fleet in terms of dwt with a combined total share of approximately 84 7 unctad 2017 the figures emphasize that despite the progress achieved the potential for increasing energy efficiency in maritime transport is still very high with regards to the single segment shares it is noteworthy that out of these three vessel segments container vessels represent the highest share within cluster 4 indicating the environmental friendly progress that could be achieved for container ships this finding is in line with market evidence from the container market where retail business stakeholder are increasingly collaborating with ship owners e g in the clean cargo working group to improve the environmental footprint of the segment clean cargo working group ccwg 2016 taking into account that container vessels exhibit the highest share of co2 emission of all ship types smith et al 2014 due to their typically higher speed compared to tankers and dry bulk carriers psaraftis 2009 this represents a positive development despite their share of the world fleet with 13 5 being the lowest among the three segments compared to dry bulk carriers accounting for 43 2 and tankers for 28 unctad 2017 while only two tankers are included in cluster 4 no dry bulk carriers are within this group indicating the need for further improvement this has been recognized by the industry too as shown recently by the first oil tanker new buildings operating on lng fuel shell 2017 or the design study for lng fueled dry bulk carriers presented by the green corridor joint industry group for improving the environmental performance of the iron ore trades between australia and china dnv gl 2017 it is interesting to note that containers are characterized by the highest commercial value share in relation to dwt share i e 9 in terms of commercial value compared to 13 5 in terms of dwt for tankers the relation is 14 6 in terms of commercial value compared to 28 in terms of dwt as well as for dry bulk carriers 17 2 in terms of commercial value compared to 43 2 in terms of dwt linking this with the results of the analysis it could be concluded that higher stated energy performance is displayed more often by vessels belonging to a vessel segment of higher commercial value relative to dwt market share this finding could contribute to a better understanding of energy efficiency trends across the wider industry and consequently the selection of appropriate measures to reduce the industry s energy efficiency gap in this context it might be useful to consider lessons learnt from other industries to explore how technology transfer is experienced in other fields an interesting case within transport related industries is for example the electrical vehicle market where cost considerations are likewise an important element of academic analyses nykvist et al 2019 rezvani et al 2015 jensen et al 2013 musti and kockelmann 2011 the electrical vehicle market has commercially emerged only over several decades and in different cycles from the 1970s onwards udaeta et al 2015 it has become popular on a large scale only recently through industry newcomers such as tesla the tesla approach diverted from strategies of industry incumbents by targeting the highest market segment in terms of commercial value and afterwards incrementally moving down the value chain towards more mainstream market segments schmidt and van der rhee 2014 this approach contradicts with classical theory of disruptive innovation as introduced by christensen 1997 in order to anticipate future technological change frohman 2015 technologies developed in segments of higher commercial value could analogously serve as role models provide the basis for cost reductions through economies of scale as well as later widespread mainstream market applications this emphasizes the importance of the economic perspective higher commercial values of ship segments also indicate the capital intense character of new environmentally friendly technologies which require significant upfront investments from the industry dnv gl 2014 bazari and longva 2011 at the same time capital for the maritime industries is constraint since the global financial crisis of 2008 as financiers have scaled back lending this resulted in financial barriers for new energy efficient technology wang et al 2010 maddox consulting 2012 rehmatulla et al 2015 and created the need for exploring alternative financing models for green shipping technology such as export credit schemes schinas et al 2018 pay as you save models schinas and metzger 2019 or third party financing models stulgis et al 2014 5 2 2 ro ro ro pax ferries and gas carriers it is obvious from the cluster allocation shown in table 3 that both the ship types roro ropax ferries as well as gas carriers make up for the highest share of ships allocated to cluster 4 with 33 3 and 37 8 respectively the case of roro ropax ferries is particularly interesting as these ship types are likewise accounting for a significant share of cluster 1 being 22 3 and thus being the only ship segments in the context of this analysis that are almost equally distributed between cluster 1 and cluster 4 in terms of absolute numbers of vessels with 17 ships being allocated to cluster 1 and 15 ships to cluster 4 this indicates a heterogeneous distribution of energy efficiency levels which could in turn be explained by the age characteristics and fleet renewal dynamics within this industry rehmatulla and tibbles 2014 show that in europe which is historically one of the largest ferry markets wergeland 2012 the average fleet age of publicly owned ferry companies is around 20 years as well as approximately seventeen years for privately owned ferry operators given that vessel age seems to be a strong factor for drawing conclusions about the energy efficiency status quo of the fleet as shown in section 5 1 the high share of ships allocated to cluster 1 could potentially be explained by fleet age at the same time in recent years the ferry segment played a pioneering role within maritime industries in relation to adoption of innovative and environmentally friendly fuel technology such as shown by the first marine vessel entirely operated on batteries skjong et al 2015 in addition to implementation of liquefied natural gas schinas and butler 2016 or the exploration of methanol as ship fuel lundgren and wachsmann 2014 stena 2013 fleet renewal activities gathered pace in light of increasing regulatory requirements the number of vessels built with new propulsion systems using lng multi fuel electric hybrid or all gas increased during the period 2006 2015 brambilla and martino 2016 and additional investments in new and efficient ships are announced by industry stakeholders moore 2018 in summary findings from the cluster analysis suggest that these segments are characterized by a significantly old fleet part exhibiting low energy efficiency and high potential for further efficiency gains as well as a state of the art new fleet part operating on innovative fuel technologies to improve the environmental footprint on side of gas carriers a large fleet growth took place in recent years as demand for lng transportation capacity picked up significantly driven by a doubling in global lng shipments between 2004 and 2014 unctad 2005 and 2015 which stimulated technological innovations and expansion in shipbuilding capacity raju et al 2016 as the cluster analysis indicates gas carriers represent the highest share of single vessel types in the energy efficient cluster 4 while their share of cluster 1 is only around 7 9 being in line with the findings from the market analysis with respect to high share of young and modern vessels while both the roro ropax ferries and gas carrier segments are small in terms of dwt market share i e 0 3 for ropax ferries 4 2 for roro as part of general cargo ships as well as 3 0 for gas carriers the segments commercial value shares are significant being 11 8 5 0 and 9 4 respectively considering also co2 emissions by ship type between 2007 and 2012 smith et al 2014 despite the small dwt market share the ship types vehicle ro ro and ferry ropax accounted for combined emissions of around 81 million tonnes co2 and liquefied gas tankers of around 46 million tonnes co2 compared to for example 124 million tonnes for oil tankers which market share in terms of dwt is much higher with 28 0 this underlines the potential positive impact of the regulation on decarbonization on a global scale and the importance of fostering know how transfer between maritime industries as proposed by goal 9 of the united nations agenda for sustainable development united nations 2015 build resilient infrastructure promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation the case of lng as marine fuel for example shows how the adoption of this technology by early adopters who carried the burden of innovative technology s investment premium helped to streamline development and manufacturing processes in order to incrementally move toward solutions for future broader market usage this is demonstrated by the examples of oil tankers operating on lng and thus pioneering the technology s expansion into segments which are not tied to fixed routes as for example the ferry industry and thus helping to cope with the initial challenges of fueling infrastructure while lng as marine fuel is mostly regarded as transitional fuel in the literature e g council of economic advisers 2014 gasterra 2009 alternative and ultimately greener energy sources could benefit from this learning curve across vessel segments 6 conclusions the combined topsis and hac analysis presented in this study allows for empirically supported inferences on the trends of energy efficiency as per eedi benchmark across main shipping segments and enables further policy support as well as decision making regarding to decarbonization by various stakeholders recent research notes that eedi regulations have been weak due to lack of information disclosure and weak stringency of regulation rehmatulla et al 2017 this could to some extent potentially be addressed by the new requirements of data collection under imo dcs and eu mrv as well as recently approved amendments to strengthen existing mandatory requirements for energy efficiency of ships in mepc 74 session imo 2019 eedi is included in the list of short term measures of the initial imo strategy imo 2018b for further action regarding reduction of ghg emissions related mid term measures inter alia include potential market based measures three out of ten market based measure proposals initially submitted to the imo incorporated eedi into the model 1 leveraged incentive scheme 2 ship efficiency and credit trading 3 vessel efficiency system psaraftis 2012 eedi is therefore likely to continue playing a role in future policy discussions and the methodology presented in this article could support related future analyses with a view to adoption of the revised imo strategy in 2023 the analysis presented in this work reveals the two attributes vessel size and age as most distinct in relation to energy performance in relation to age the average vessel age of the most energy efficient cluster of 7 years is close to the 6 year time period since eedi introduction thus despite limitations indicating a positive impact of the regulatory initiatives at the same time the segment analysis reveals that potential for further improvements in terms of decarbonizing the maritime industry is still very high therefore calling for further action firstly results suggest increasing know how transfer between shipping segments given the historically conservative and risk averse culture of the shipping industry and the reluctance of industry stakeholders to be a first mover in relation to new technologies rojon and dieperink 2014 policy makers could aim at supporting first movers in green technologies this could help building role models for the specific segment and stimulate development of innovative technological solutions which could consequently also be applied to other segments within the shipping industry and finally benefit economies of scale furthermore the relevance of ship segment specific policies as practiced in the case of roro and ropax ships where adjustments to the reference lines cater the peculiarities of this maritime sub segment imo 2018a is emphasized secondly higher stated energy performance seems to be displayed more often by vessels of higher commercial value relative to dwt market share significant upfront investment in new technology seems to be required from the industry while at the same time financial barriers and capital constraints exist additional research on developing financing models for green shipping as well as on the impact of energy performance on economic factors such as freight rates or vessel prices could hence be beneficial given that the share of ships which were built after 2013 is growing over time a future analysis focusing only on post eedi ships could potentially yield additional insights on industry trends the emission figures of the main merchant shipping segments with the highest combined market share in relation to dwt illustrated in section 5 2 1 highlight that it could particularly be worth exploring solutions for the mass market application of initially more expensive low carbon technologies considering potentially similar developments in other industries such as the electrical vehicle market future research in the financial sphere could focus on exploring the interplay of financing models across different industries to identify new approaches for the maritime industry while the conclusions might not be representative at the single ship level the holistic analysis emphasizes empirically supported trends resulting from the interplay of different measures across larger fleet clusters supporting an ongoing discussion between industry stakeholders and the policy side could stimulate the development of evidence based policies that are likely to show high acceptance by the industry and that could help achieving emission reductions which are in line with the paris agreement and the imo vision 
22452,few years after the introduction of the first global regulation covering the energy efficiency of ships this article analyzes status quo of the industry based on the interplay of different technical measures such as ship age size propulsion speed and consumption as well as the policy benchmark of energy efficiency design index eedi this paper is one of the first to introduce a combined technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis and hierarchical agglomerative clustering hac approach the analysis shows that the average vessel age of the most energy efficient cluster of 7 years correlates with the time period since eedi introduction thus indicating policy driven environmental progress at the same time results suggest that further action is required higher stated energy efficiency is rather exhibited by a smaller part of the world fleet and by vessels characterized by higher commercial value two action fields are highlighted by the analysis firstly the elevated role of know how transfer by promoting role models and first movers secondly the need for alternative financing models due to significant upfront investments required by the industry to implement green technology and the long time periods between policy introduction and environmental results keywords decarbonization eedi marpol annex iv air emissions from ships topsis hierarchical agglomerative clustering 1 introduction shipping contributed on average 3 1 of global co2 emission between 2007 and 2012 smith et al 2014 at the same time a reduction from 1100 mt in 2007 3 5 of global ghg emissions to 938 mt in 2012 2 6 of global ghg emissions could be realized smith et al 2014 this reduction emphasizes the progress policy makers and industry stakeholders could achieve over the last years through research efforts as well as identification and implementation of energy efficiency measures buhaug et al 2009 on the policy side the imo has addressed the issue of decarbonizing the maritime industry by amending the annex vi of the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships marpol with effect january 2013 imo 2011 and presenting the first regulation covering the energy efficiency of ships by introducing inter alia the energy efficiency design index eedi imo 2012a on the side of specific actions broad research has been presented in the literature on the impact of energy efficiency measures the literature spans from work focusing on the energy efficiency impact of changes in ship characteristics as well as the drivers of energy efficiency within different vessel segments or the world fleet as a whole several studies highlight the importance of growing ship size for emission reductions tillig et al 2015 gucwa and schäfer 2013 faber et al 2011 particularly through economies of scale bughaug et al 2009 notteboom and vernimmen 2009 as well as cullinanae and khanna 2000 focused on a specific vessel segment by presenting examinations of different ship sizes for container vessels in addition speed optimization has been identified as driver for emission reductions by corbett et al 2009 lin 2012 lindstad et al 2011 miola et al 2011 as well as sea at risk and ce delft 2010 the impact of hull shape such as dimensions and form improvements through more slender design is presented in lindstad and eskeland 2015 using the example of oil tankers while stott and wright 2011 lindstad et al 2013b and lindstad et al 2014 focus on hull designs in the dry bulk carrier segment furthermore the area of power and propulsion also shows significant potential for emission reductions heitmann and peterson 2014 hoffmann et al 2012 alvik et al 2010 notwithstanding the progress in a business as usual scenario emissions could increase by 50 250 by 2050 from 2012 levels smith et al 2014 undermining the objectives of the paris agreement unfccc 2015 furthermore the emission reduction potential varies significantly across measures and studies e g for vessel size between 4 and 83 lindstad 2013 faber et al 2011 gilbert et al 2014 tillig et al 2015 wang et al 2010 miola et al 2011 wärtsila 2009 stott and wright 2011 lindstad et al 2012 2016 gucwa and schäfer 2013 lindstad and eskeland 2015 halfdanarson and snare 2015 pauli 2016 zöllner 2009 the above non exhaustive literature review demonstrated the wide spectrum of conducted research at the same time more holistic approaches are required such as identifying feasible combinations of measures as no single measure is solely sufficient to achieve meaningful emission reductions across the maritime industries bouman et al 2017 smith et al 2013 emphasize that more research needs to be done on the development of shipping s energy efficiency over time for designing evidence based policies that limit economical industry impact furthermore studies concerning technical energy efficiency of ships often lack methodological rigor suggesting further work with alternative methods to validate research findings and to achieve a holistic view of emissions from shipping rehmatulla et al 2017 in this regard the first aim of this paper is to draw conclusions from clusters of ships broken down per estimated eedi along with individual ship particulars results are extracted from a substantial sample size of 497 vessels of different age classes and across main shipping segments the long term effect of eedi regulation on the industry will only be observable in the long run hasan 2011 and benefits will evolve only incrementally once new ships replace the existing fleet given the expected vessel life span of 25 35 years icct 2011 this poses a common challenge on policy makers across industries as decision making about capital intense measures with significant economic implications for the specific industry is required today while environmental effects will only realize years ahead in the future underdahl 2010 the analysis of macro trends within vessel segments is therefore helpful for adding new knowledge on the status quo of energy efficiency in maritime transport and for identifying areas of further action to make better use of the industry s energy efficiency potential smith et al 2016 show that the existence of eedi compared to a scenario in which there is no eedi only amounts to a difference in ghg emissions of 3 until 2050 cames et al 2015 highlight that despite the existing eedi regulations the industry s share of emissions from around 2 of global co2 emissions could increase to approximately 17 in 2018 the imo adopted resolution mepc 304 72 on initial imo strategy on reduction of ghg emissions from ships initial imo strategy and formulated the target of reducing ghg emissions by at least 50 by 2050 compared to 2008 as well as the imo vision of phasing them out completely within this century imo vision imo 2018b this initial imo strategy forms the first milestone of the roadmap for developing a comprehensive imo strategy on reduction of ghg emissions from ships imo roadmap the aim is to develop a revised strategy revised imo strategy by 2023 imo 2016a which includes additional short mid and long term measures for ghg emission reductions as per resolution mepc 278 70 a new data collection system imo dcs for fuel oil consumption of ships including proxies for transport work was adopted imo 2016b the introduction of the imo dcs forms the first in a three step approach of analyzing collected data as a basis for future policy development and discussion imo 2016a at the regional level the eu recently adopted the regulation on the monitoring reporting and verification of shipping emissions eu mrv which will provide further data on co2 emissions and other related information european commission 2019 a comparison of eu mrv and imo dcs could be found in lonsdale et al 2019 and dnv gl 2019 lonsdale et al 2019 concluded that due to higher disclosure and information feedback the current eu mrv system could deliver 0 7 higher potential co2 emission reductions until 2040 compared to a eu mrv system equivalent to the imo dcs system lonsdale et al 2019 the second aim of this paper is thus to present a universal analytical framework which could be useful for the analysis of future data from the eu mrv as well as the imo dcs to support the three step approach of data analysis with a view to adoption of the revised imo strategy in 2023 the two research objectives of this article are summarized in fig 1 below methodologically the problem is approached as follows in a first step a topsis ranking of the vessels is carried out based on a combination of five vessel specific technical attributes in relation to age size speed propulsion and consumption afterwards a hac analysis reveals heterogeneous vessel clusters characterized by different estimated eedi taking into account the ships individual topsis ranking as well as the vessel specific eedi score the clusters are then analyzed with a view to the composition of vessels within the cluster to draw conclusions on their energy efficiency levels as per estimated eedi and technical characteristics using eedi for academic studies is an established concept in literature for example to examine the relationship between energy efficiency and time charter rates agnolucci et al 2014 to propose alternative formulations of the ship specific correction factors alisafaki and papanikolaou 2015 or eedi calculation ančić et al 2013 fleet estimates were used to form the baseline curves of the imo marpol annex vi amendment imo 2011 2012b or to form the existing vessel design index evdi rightship 2012 a detailed discussion of evdi in the academic literature is presented e g by polakis et al 2019 and psaraftis 2019 the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the dataset section 3 explains briefly topsis and hac techniques and section 4 presents the results of the analysis in section 5 results are discussed and put into the broader perspective of the world fleet while section 6 summarizes the findings and concludes this work 2 data this study is based on a sample of 497 different ships over 400 gt covering a diverse set of sub segments as summarized in table 1 as well as different age classes 299 ships aged 10 years and 198 ships aged 10 years and technical specifications the sample includes main cargo carrying ship types as well as passenger ferries and ropax vessels in order to address both the industry side which is characterized by a variety of different segments kavussanos 2010 2003 1997 1996a 1996b tsouknidis 2016 and the policy side defined by the vessel segments of the eedi scope imo 2014 bazari and longva 2011 this is supposed to allow for generalizing results and for drawing conclusions which might be representative for large parts of the industry according to unctad 2017 the world merchant fleet consisted of 93 161 vessels thus the sample used in this empirical analysis represents approximately 0 53 of the total merchant fleet for the purpose of the analysis five vessel specific variables are selected age in years size in deadweight tons propulsion in kilowatt speed in knots as well as consumption in tons per day the variables were chosen to reflect important key categories of energy efficiency measures that were presented in the introduction in addition the vessel estimated eedi score is considered it is briefly reminded that eedi is a benchmark evolved from the two imo studies on greenhouse gas emissions from ships in 2000 and 2009 buhaug et al 2009 skjolsvik et al 2000 and was adopted in mepc 203 62 as policy initiative towards decarbonizing operations by improving the unit energy requirements imo 2011 the eedi considers a single ship s energy requirements in design conditions and translates them into c o 2 emissions i e in co2 gram per unit of useful transport work expressed in ton miles in a simplified approach the formula of eedi is shown below e e d i c o 2 f r o m t h e p r o p u l s i o n c o 2 f r o m t h e a u x i l i a r y c o 2 i n n o v a t i v e t e c h n o l o g y d w t s p e e d regulation 21 of marpol annex vi considers refence lines per ship type and the eedi of every ship should be less than this reference line defined in resolution mepc 215 63 imo 2012b reference lines will gradually become stricter over time thereby stimulating continued improvements in design and power systems as well as forcing operators to increase the vessel s energy efficiency by e g reducing the use of fossil fuels per unit of transport or by using alternative technologies that reduce carbon footprint the current maximum reduction factors of 30 will become effective in 2025 bazari and longva 2011 over time several amendments to the eedi regulations have been adopted in 2014 for example resolution mepc 245 66 was adopted imo 2014 to extend the scope of eedi to lng carriers roro and ropax vessels and in 2018 resolution mepc 301 72 introduced adjustments to the reference lines for roro and ropax vessels imo 2018a lloyd s register 2018 for the purpose of this analysis it is important to evaluate the differential δ e e d i of the estimated eedi from the relevant reference line e e d i r e f this differential yields the green profile of every ship the larger the negative differential δ e e d i the less the expected carbon footprint in design terms therefore the ship is greener δ e e d i e e d i e s t i m a t e d e e d i r e f given the above formula and for the purpose of this analysis ships with a negative δ e e d i are considered to be more efficient than the reference line while ships with a positive δ e e d i are considered to be less efficient than the reference line as stated the analysis of the sample considers vessel characteristics along with the differential of δ e e d i as an effort to unify all data particulars and estimated δeedi in a common matrix it is important to highlight that there is no tautology in the data set that could cripple the findings in this regard particular variables such as size in dead weight tons dwt and speed in knots contribute in the eedi formula therefore impact the result i e the estimated eedi lindstad et al 2012 2013 2014 have extensively commented on this issue in the current analysis particulars and δeedi are considered as input the descriptive statistics of the different variables used in the dataset is summarized in table 2 it can be seen that the mean of the particulars is larger than the standard deviation implying a low probability of extreme outliers while the variable speed is characterized by the lowest dispersion among the applied set of variables for δ e e d i the opposite is true indicating a high level of dispersion furthermore data of all variables are right skewed distributed the methodology of the analysis shall be discussed in detail in the following section 3 methodology the methodology applied in this work is based on a two step combined topsis and hac analysis that takes into account the data considered in the previous sections i e particulars and δeedi per ship the aim is to identify clusters of similar δeedi levels per ship type which in turn provide objective data driven conclusions from the cluster compositions the methodological framework is summarized in fig 2 below while the following sub sections introduce the two concepts of topsis and hac analysis in the context of this study topsis serves the purpose of deriving a single dimensionless value for every of each of the 497 ships based on the five main attributes of the ships i e of age in years size in dwt speed in knots propulsion in installed kw and consumption in tons day these criteria are used in commercial transactions this dimensionless index is unique per ship and homogenizes the sample in terms of technical characteristics moreover enables the combination with the δeedi per ship and the use of hac technique 3 1 technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution at first the topsis method is applied to yield an energy efficiency ranking of the vessels based on the five vessel specific technical attributes in relation to age size speed propulsion and consumption the stepwise procedure described is based on the topsis method developed by hwang and yoon in 1981 hwang and yoon 1981 which were modified by yoon in 1987 yoon 1987 as well as hwang lai and liu in 1993 hwang et al 1993 the basic underlying concept is to find solutions from a finite set of alternatives while the chosen alternatives should have the shortest distance from the positive ideal solution pis and the farthest distance from the negative ideal solution nis topsis is a useful method for multi attribute or multi criteria decision making problems such as energy efficiency and has been successfully applied in the research field of maritime transport for example by karahalios 2017 to evaluate ballast water treatment systems by ioannis and nikitas 2013 to examine ship maintenance strategies or by schinas 2007 in the context of maritime safety assessment the model steps are as follows 1 step the decision matrix d is established with m rows and n columns representing the different alternates and evaluation criteria respectively d x 11 x 12 x 1 n x 21 x 22 x 2 n x m 1 x m 2 x m n each variable x i j in matrix d refers to the performance of alternative o i i 1 2 m with respect to the criterion c j j 1 2 n matrix d is provided as input and xij can be scaled or non scaled as per the theory 2 step the normalized decision matrix is calculated in order to transform the data into a dimensionless matrix this allows for comparison of the criteria from different sources by creating a unified unit for each variable x i j a normalized value r i j is calculated as follows r i j x i j i 1 m x i j 2 j 1 2 n 3 step the weighted normalized decision matrix is calculated by applying specific weights to the matrix generated in step 2 v i j w j r i j i 1 2 m j 1 2 n where w j is the weight of the jth criterion the vector wj is also provided as input and reveals the preferences of the decision maker as explained in section 1 the estimated impact across different energy efficiency measures varies significantly across different studies leaving uncertainty regarding the prioritization of measures which could be reflected in different weights applied to the analysis in order to follow a balanced approach and to avoid biased results by overweighting a specific measure the same weights are assigned to the five input criteria for the purpose of this analysis 4 step pis a and nis a are identified as follows a v 1 v 2 v n max i v i j j j 1 min i v i j j j 2 a v 1 v 2 v n min i v i j j j 1 max i v i j j j 2 where j 1 represent the criteria having a positive impact and j 2 represent the criteria having a negative impact 5 step separation measures are performed based on the euclidean distance from the pis d j and the nis d j of each alternative o i as follows d i j 1 n v i j v j 2 i 1 2 m d i j 1 n v i j v j 2 i 1 2 m 6 step the relative closeness s j for each alternative with respect to pis is determined s j d j d j d j j 1 2 m where 0 s j 1 7 step alternatives are ranked in descending order the solution with the largest s j should be ranked at the top as the shortest distance from the pis and the farthest distance from the nis characterize the most preferable option considering the minimum regret criterion as per the theory for the purposes of this analysis all criteria are equally weighted in order to avoid biased results 3 2 hierarchical agglomerative clustering hac following the topsis method a clustering analysis is carried out that aims to group a set of objects such as ships in the context of this work into subsets the so called clusters according to similar characteristics or properties different clustering methods exist and could be distinguished for example by the different metrics to define similarities among objects and the theoretical concepts are well described in the literature while a key advantage of clustering is that no a priori information regarding the number of clusters is required rokach and maimon 2005 kim et al 2001 fraley and raftery 1998 hartigan 1975 rand 1971 tyron and bailey 1970 in the context of maritime transport clustering methods were previously applied for example by nežerenko and koppel 2015 or rong et al 2017 this study applies a hierarchical agglomerative clustering hac by iteratively clustering the data set of vessels on the basis of the smallest distance measure across all pairwise distances between the ship s individual data points using euclidean distance and the single linkage distance metric sibson 1973 in a first step each vessel starts as a single cluster having level l 0 0 and sequence number m o in step 2 the least distance pair of clusters vessels a b is found according to d a b m i n d i j in step 3 the pair a and b is merged into a new cluster m while level of this cluster defined as l m d a b the distance between the new cluster a b and another existing cluster z is described by d z a b m i n d z a d z b the sequence is continued by incrementally merging all clusters until only one big cluster of ships is left the results of the hac process are typically summarized in a dendrogram that provides a graphical tool for choosing a meaningful actual number of clusters 4 application and results as a result of the topsis analysis described in section 3 1 a single dimensionless value for every of each of the 497 ships based on the five particulars is derived in a next step the topsis scores are combined with the likewise dimensionless δ e e d i that provides the green performance of every ship vis à vis the reference line of the regulation these are the input data for the following hac analysis in section 3 2 table 3 below summarizes the descriptive statistics of the variables and fig 3 provides a graphical overview of the available sample i e a mapping of the vessels according to each ship s individual topsis and δ e e d i scores the eedi regulation does not apply to ships built before 1 january 2013 imo 2011 given the sample data the pre eedi ships show a mean of 0 06 with standard deviation of 0 16 vis à vis the post eedi ships with mean of 0 17 and standard deviation of 0 12 the change of the sign indicate clearly the difference of the eedi i e the δ e e d i and the tendency towards less carbon per unit the mean δ e e d i of pre eedi ships being around zero indicates that eedi baseline values were created as a regression curve fit based on the pre eedi fleet 2012b the negative mean together with a lower dispersion of the post eedi ships compared to pre eedi ships reflect that δ e e d i of post eedi ships typically ranges between zero and negative as these ships have to comply with eedi whereas δ e e d i for pre eedi ships can be either positive zero or negative the hac algorithm applied in this study calculates the distance between each of the vessels by using the euclidean distance as described in section 3 2 afterwards the dissimilarity matrix is updated and clusters are merged until only one cluster is left the calculations resulted the cluster graph of fig 4 as well as the dendrogram shown in fig 5 below for reasons of clarity and comprehensibility only the merging process of the final 30 clusters is illustrated the graphical analysis shows that a meaningful number of clusters is achieved at the distance of 1 5 which includes 6 clusters that contain all of the 30 original clusters c 1 6 9 5 8 28 24 c 2 1 15 21 27 3 10 20 16 c 3 2 13 19 22 4 c 4 7 17 23 29 12 14 c 5 18 25 and c 6 11 26 30 beyond the distance of 1 5 a further merging of clusters would lead to a significant increase in index hierarchy to just below distance of 2 5 and finally 4 as well as 4 5 derived from the graphical overview of the total data set of vessels mapped according to each ship s individual topsis and δ e e d i score in fig 3 fig 6 highlights the data subset of vessels in each of the six clusters in a next step the clusters are analyzed with regards to outliers which are data points that are considerably deviating from the remainder of the dataset barnett and lewis 1994 and which might therefore have an impact on the results interpretation a broad literature exists in relation to outlier detection in the context of clustering methods jayakumar and thomas 2013 yoon et al 2007 van cutsem and gath 1993 the key assumption of outlier detection techniques based on hac methods is that outliers are isolated in very small clusters of low density and thus distant from regular and more frequent observations grouped in large and dense clusters almeida et al 2007 loureiro et al 2004 as shown by the high data concentration around topsis score of 0 3 in fig 3 the dendrogram and the graphs of fig 6 reveal that clusters 5 and 6 are characterized by a high distance from the other clusters and with only 12 respectively 7 ships also exhibit a comparably very small cluster size in conclusion clusters 5 and 6 are assumed to be outliers while these clusters will still be included in the dataset and analyzed in the discussion section in order to preserve the highest possible information content of the data sample the two clusters are excluded from the following cluster ranking process to allow for an unbiased interpretation of the energy efficiency trends revealed by the 4 groups considered as core clusters given that these include a combined number of 478 vessels and hence represent around 96 2 of the total sample data table 4 provides a breakdown of the characteristics displayed by the vessels assigned to the different clusters the comparison reveals significant differences between the compositions of the individual clusters the mean δ e e d i across vessels within the clusters indicates that the first cluster could be considered as containing the least energy efficient ships of the sample due to the mean δ e e d i of 0 234 being the highest positive δ e e d i among all four clusters in contrast based on a mean δ e e d i of 0 291 cluster 4 could be deemed as representing the cluster with vessels of highest energy efficiency within the sample following the topsis score which represents a dimensionless indicator for each ship s individual combination of the technical attributes shown in fig 3 cluster 3 ranks best with the highest mean score of 0 493 while cluster 1 again ranks lowest with mean topsis score of 0 314 based on the results of table 4 table 5 is derived where the ranking of δ e e d i and topsis score are only considered ranking scores are assigned to each cluster for both dimensions and clusters are subsequently ranked according to their total ranking score whereby the cluster with the lowest ranking score is ranked first and the cluster showing the highest ranking score ranked last the cluster ranking process is summarized in table 5 below while cluster 1 ranks lowest in both mean δ e e d i and topsis score leading to a total ranking score of 8 cluster 4 is considered the best ranked cluster given its highest rank in relation to mean δ e e d i and second highest rank in respect to topsis score leading to a total ranking score of 3 furthermore cluster 4 is the only cluster exhibiting a negative mean δ e e d i among the four clusters in conclusion clusters 1 and 4 represent the lower and upper end of the energy efficiency cluster range while cluster 2 and 3 are located within this range the following discussion will therefore use clusters 1 and 4 as reference clusters for drawing conclusions from the composition of the two clusters containing the on average most and least efficient vessels of the ranking sample 5 discussion 5 1 energy performance carbon footprint in a first step the composition of the two clusters 1 and 4 are considered with a view to the resulted δeedi the following results are derived 1 it is shown from the results that with a mean vessel age of 16 years ships in cluster 1 are on average more than twice as old as compared to cluster 4 which exhibits mean age of only 7 years in view of the introduction of eedi more than 6 years ago results suggest a positive regulatory impact on energy efficiency over time at the same time other factors impacting the energy performance of ships were identified by academic studies such as the effect of fuel prices on investment decisions in energy efficiency measures rehmatulla 2015 the potential prioritization of sulphur reduction over energy efficiency investments in the context of the imo regulations on sulphur emissions imo 2008 freight market conditions lindstad et al 2013 or the panama canal expansion lindstad et al 2013 to which extent the technical innovation was driven by regulations related to the energy efficiency of ships or other external factors could be a topic for further research results of this work show significant efficiency differences between the clusters in combination with the mean age of the efficient cluster being approximately in line with the time period since eedi became effective in conclusion a positive energy efficiency effect of the regulatory measures appears to be reasonably assumable 2 the mean vessel size of cluster 4 being around 64 000 dwt is almost twice as large as in cluster 1 with approximately 32 736 dwt confirming the economies of scale effect on energy efficiency as presented by various researchers and discussed in section 1 findings support that economies of scale in combination with reduced ship speed are key drivers for reduction of greenhouse gas ghg emissions as shown e g with reference to the period 2007 to 2012 in relation to size increase of average cargo ships from 22 500 dwt to 30 500 dwt confirming the results of smith et al 2014 3 moreover while the average ship size of the more efficient cluster is significantly higher the difference in consumption is only moderate approximately 26 between cluster 4 and cluster 1 it is noteworthy that the mean ship size of cluster 3 being ranked second in terms of energy efficiency is by factor of 4 59 larger than cluster 1 compared to the consumption mean increasing by factor of 2 39 adding to the improved energy performance of larger ships in terms of absolute fuel consumption the two outlier clusters 5 and 6 broadly support these three trends but also highlight limitations cluster 6 exhibits the highest and thus most inefficient δ e e d i in combination with the lowest mean ship size and highest mean ship age of all clusters which is in line with the identified trends for comparison purposes the 7 ships included in cluster 6 are on average only 26 78 of the mean vessel size of cluster 4 but require almost the same level of fuel consumption the 12 vessels of cluster 5 exhibit the highest mean topsis score in combination with a young mean ship age as well as the lowest consumption level relative to mean ship size of all clusters but at the same time show a mean δ e e d i which is above the levels of clusters 4 3 and 2 while this supports the three findings in terms of mean topsis score it also emphasizes the limitation that the identified trends might not be representative on a single ship basis as shown by the comparably lower energy efficiency levels of the 12 vessels in terms of δ e e d i 4 furthermore following the size reference of ships in cluster 4 being on average approximately double the size of vessels in cluster 1 the difference in installed propulsion power of 30 7 as well as the increase in design speed of 11 1 appear to be moderate too in conclusion in relation to the technical features despite the fact that all five variables show comparable dispersions as shown by the descriptive statistics of the applied variables in section 2 the variables age and size prove to be the two most distinct factors when distinguishing between the different stated energy performance clusters in the context of this work 5 2 vessel segments analysis in a second step the composition of vessel types within the clusters is analyzed results from section 4 are mapped against the world fleet using three different measures to draw conclusions and to identify potential areas for future actions firstly the market share in dwt thus representing the cargo carrying capacity and being the traditional market share indicator to account for the relevance of maritime transport for global trade volumes unctad 2017 secondly the share of co2 emissions to account for the vessel type s carbon footprint within the world fleet as per the third imo ghg study smith et al 2014 thirdly a different perspective is added to the analysis by considering the commercial value of the fleet in terms of the typically usd dollar value unctad 2017 in this context ships of higher commercial value are characterized by higher construction cost and are often used to transport cargo of higher unit value unctad 2017 5 2 1 container ships tankers dry bulk carriers firstly the aggregated share of the three main cargo ship types being container dry bulk and tankers is of interest while these three vessel segments make up 69 7 of cluster 1 the share among cluster 4 is only 28 9 considering that these three segments together clearly dominate the world fleet in terms of dwt with a combined total share of approximately 84 7 unctad 2017 the figures emphasize that despite the progress achieved the potential for increasing energy efficiency in maritime transport is still very high with regards to the single segment shares it is noteworthy that out of these three vessel segments container vessels represent the highest share within cluster 4 indicating the environmental friendly progress that could be achieved for container ships this finding is in line with market evidence from the container market where retail business stakeholder are increasingly collaborating with ship owners e g in the clean cargo working group to improve the environmental footprint of the segment clean cargo working group ccwg 2016 taking into account that container vessels exhibit the highest share of co2 emission of all ship types smith et al 2014 due to their typically higher speed compared to tankers and dry bulk carriers psaraftis 2009 this represents a positive development despite their share of the world fleet with 13 5 being the lowest among the three segments compared to dry bulk carriers accounting for 43 2 and tankers for 28 unctad 2017 while only two tankers are included in cluster 4 no dry bulk carriers are within this group indicating the need for further improvement this has been recognized by the industry too as shown recently by the first oil tanker new buildings operating on lng fuel shell 2017 or the design study for lng fueled dry bulk carriers presented by the green corridor joint industry group for improving the environmental performance of the iron ore trades between australia and china dnv gl 2017 it is interesting to note that containers are characterized by the highest commercial value share in relation to dwt share i e 9 in terms of commercial value compared to 13 5 in terms of dwt for tankers the relation is 14 6 in terms of commercial value compared to 28 in terms of dwt as well as for dry bulk carriers 17 2 in terms of commercial value compared to 43 2 in terms of dwt linking this with the results of the analysis it could be concluded that higher stated energy performance is displayed more often by vessels belonging to a vessel segment of higher commercial value relative to dwt market share this finding could contribute to a better understanding of energy efficiency trends across the wider industry and consequently the selection of appropriate measures to reduce the industry s energy efficiency gap in this context it might be useful to consider lessons learnt from other industries to explore how technology transfer is experienced in other fields an interesting case within transport related industries is for example the electrical vehicle market where cost considerations are likewise an important element of academic analyses nykvist et al 2019 rezvani et al 2015 jensen et al 2013 musti and kockelmann 2011 the electrical vehicle market has commercially emerged only over several decades and in different cycles from the 1970s onwards udaeta et al 2015 it has become popular on a large scale only recently through industry newcomers such as tesla the tesla approach diverted from strategies of industry incumbents by targeting the highest market segment in terms of commercial value and afterwards incrementally moving down the value chain towards more mainstream market segments schmidt and van der rhee 2014 this approach contradicts with classical theory of disruptive innovation as introduced by christensen 1997 in order to anticipate future technological change frohman 2015 technologies developed in segments of higher commercial value could analogously serve as role models provide the basis for cost reductions through economies of scale as well as later widespread mainstream market applications this emphasizes the importance of the economic perspective higher commercial values of ship segments also indicate the capital intense character of new environmentally friendly technologies which require significant upfront investments from the industry dnv gl 2014 bazari and longva 2011 at the same time capital for the maritime industries is constraint since the global financial crisis of 2008 as financiers have scaled back lending this resulted in financial barriers for new energy efficient technology wang et al 2010 maddox consulting 2012 rehmatulla et al 2015 and created the need for exploring alternative financing models for green shipping technology such as export credit schemes schinas et al 2018 pay as you save models schinas and metzger 2019 or third party financing models stulgis et al 2014 5 2 2 ro ro ro pax ferries and gas carriers it is obvious from the cluster allocation shown in table 3 that both the ship types roro ropax ferries as well as gas carriers make up for the highest share of ships allocated to cluster 4 with 33 3 and 37 8 respectively the case of roro ropax ferries is particularly interesting as these ship types are likewise accounting for a significant share of cluster 1 being 22 3 and thus being the only ship segments in the context of this analysis that are almost equally distributed between cluster 1 and cluster 4 in terms of absolute numbers of vessels with 17 ships being allocated to cluster 1 and 15 ships to cluster 4 this indicates a heterogeneous distribution of energy efficiency levels which could in turn be explained by the age characteristics and fleet renewal dynamics within this industry rehmatulla and tibbles 2014 show that in europe which is historically one of the largest ferry markets wergeland 2012 the average fleet age of publicly owned ferry companies is around 20 years as well as approximately seventeen years for privately owned ferry operators given that vessel age seems to be a strong factor for drawing conclusions about the energy efficiency status quo of the fleet as shown in section 5 1 the high share of ships allocated to cluster 1 could potentially be explained by fleet age at the same time in recent years the ferry segment played a pioneering role within maritime industries in relation to adoption of innovative and environmentally friendly fuel technology such as shown by the first marine vessel entirely operated on batteries skjong et al 2015 in addition to implementation of liquefied natural gas schinas and butler 2016 or the exploration of methanol as ship fuel lundgren and wachsmann 2014 stena 2013 fleet renewal activities gathered pace in light of increasing regulatory requirements the number of vessels built with new propulsion systems using lng multi fuel electric hybrid or all gas increased during the period 2006 2015 brambilla and martino 2016 and additional investments in new and efficient ships are announced by industry stakeholders moore 2018 in summary findings from the cluster analysis suggest that these segments are characterized by a significantly old fleet part exhibiting low energy efficiency and high potential for further efficiency gains as well as a state of the art new fleet part operating on innovative fuel technologies to improve the environmental footprint on side of gas carriers a large fleet growth took place in recent years as demand for lng transportation capacity picked up significantly driven by a doubling in global lng shipments between 2004 and 2014 unctad 2005 and 2015 which stimulated technological innovations and expansion in shipbuilding capacity raju et al 2016 as the cluster analysis indicates gas carriers represent the highest share of single vessel types in the energy efficient cluster 4 while their share of cluster 1 is only around 7 9 being in line with the findings from the market analysis with respect to high share of young and modern vessels while both the roro ropax ferries and gas carrier segments are small in terms of dwt market share i e 0 3 for ropax ferries 4 2 for roro as part of general cargo ships as well as 3 0 for gas carriers the segments commercial value shares are significant being 11 8 5 0 and 9 4 respectively considering also co2 emissions by ship type between 2007 and 2012 smith et al 2014 despite the small dwt market share the ship types vehicle ro ro and ferry ropax accounted for combined emissions of around 81 million tonnes co2 and liquefied gas tankers of around 46 million tonnes co2 compared to for example 124 million tonnes for oil tankers which market share in terms of dwt is much higher with 28 0 this underlines the potential positive impact of the regulation on decarbonization on a global scale and the importance of fostering know how transfer between maritime industries as proposed by goal 9 of the united nations agenda for sustainable development united nations 2015 build resilient infrastructure promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation the case of lng as marine fuel for example shows how the adoption of this technology by early adopters who carried the burden of innovative technology s investment premium helped to streamline development and manufacturing processes in order to incrementally move toward solutions for future broader market usage this is demonstrated by the examples of oil tankers operating on lng and thus pioneering the technology s expansion into segments which are not tied to fixed routes as for example the ferry industry and thus helping to cope with the initial challenges of fueling infrastructure while lng as marine fuel is mostly regarded as transitional fuel in the literature e g council of economic advisers 2014 gasterra 2009 alternative and ultimately greener energy sources could benefit from this learning curve across vessel segments 6 conclusions the combined topsis and hac analysis presented in this study allows for empirically supported inferences on the trends of energy efficiency as per eedi benchmark across main shipping segments and enables further policy support as well as decision making regarding to decarbonization by various stakeholders recent research notes that eedi regulations have been weak due to lack of information disclosure and weak stringency of regulation rehmatulla et al 2017 this could to some extent potentially be addressed by the new requirements of data collection under imo dcs and eu mrv as well as recently approved amendments to strengthen existing mandatory requirements for energy efficiency of ships in mepc 74 session imo 2019 eedi is included in the list of short term measures of the initial imo strategy imo 2018b for further action regarding reduction of ghg emissions related mid term measures inter alia include potential market based measures three out of ten market based measure proposals initially submitted to the imo incorporated eedi into the model 1 leveraged incentive scheme 2 ship efficiency and credit trading 3 vessel efficiency system psaraftis 2012 eedi is therefore likely to continue playing a role in future policy discussions and the methodology presented in this article could support related future analyses with a view to adoption of the revised imo strategy in 2023 the analysis presented in this work reveals the two attributes vessel size and age as most distinct in relation to energy performance in relation to age the average vessel age of the most energy efficient cluster of 7 years is close to the 6 year time period since eedi introduction thus despite limitations indicating a positive impact of the regulatory initiatives at the same time the segment analysis reveals that potential for further improvements in terms of decarbonizing the maritime industry is still very high therefore calling for further action firstly results suggest increasing know how transfer between shipping segments given the historically conservative and risk averse culture of the shipping industry and the reluctance of industry stakeholders to be a first mover in relation to new technologies rojon and dieperink 2014 policy makers could aim at supporting first movers in green technologies this could help building role models for the specific segment and stimulate development of innovative technological solutions which could consequently also be applied to other segments within the shipping industry and finally benefit economies of scale furthermore the relevance of ship segment specific policies as practiced in the case of roro and ropax ships where adjustments to the reference lines cater the peculiarities of this maritime sub segment imo 2018a is emphasized secondly higher stated energy performance seems to be displayed more often by vessels of higher commercial value relative to dwt market share significant upfront investment in new technology seems to be required from the industry while at the same time financial barriers and capital constraints exist additional research on developing financing models for green shipping as well as on the impact of energy performance on economic factors such as freight rates or vessel prices could hence be beneficial given that the share of ships which were built after 2013 is growing over time a future analysis focusing only on post eedi ships could potentially yield additional insights on industry trends the emission figures of the main merchant shipping segments with the highest combined market share in relation to dwt illustrated in section 5 2 1 highlight that it could particularly be worth exploring solutions for the mass market application of initially more expensive low carbon technologies considering potentially similar developments in other industries such as the electrical vehicle market future research in the financial sphere could focus on exploring the interplay of financing models across different industries to identify new approaches for the maritime industry while the conclusions might not be representative at the single ship level the holistic analysis emphasizes empirically supported trends resulting from the interplay of different measures across larger fleet clusters supporting an ongoing discussion between industry stakeholders and the policy side could stimulate the development of evidence based policies that are likely to show high acceptance by the industry and that could help achieving emission reductions which are in line with the paris agreement and the imo vision 
22453,steel plates forming process as an important component of the ship production process is presented in this paper with the main intention to address the influence of different assumed stress strain relationships to the analysis of the elastic plastic forming process particularly regarding bending moments bending forces and energy required to achieve desired steel plate plastic deformations applicability of the simplified one dimensional analytical models and different stress strain relationships is successfully verified against the experiment as well as by comparing the obtained results to more complex 2d plate theory in cases of four different steel grades s235 s355 s420 s460 for the plate thicknesses up to 50 mm influence of bending radius the distance between rollers and roller radius is analyzed further on and aspects of plate spring back effects i e residual stress and permanent curvature are addressed finally the importance of the present research in cases of ship production and ship structural analysis and design is pointed out keywords ship production steel plates forming plastic deformations experimental work roller bending machine residual stress 1 introduction the ship production process is composed of numerous different demanding and interdependent technological processes usually labeled as fabrication and assembly operations yielding complex and expensive products like ships and offshore structures one particularly important fabrication operation is forming of steel plates and sections becoming structural components like bilge fore and aft peaks stiffeners or corrugated bulkheads however while other operations like steel shop priming or plate and stiffener cutting became highly automated steel plates and sections forming remained strongly relied on experienced craftsmen and their skills nevertheless the steel plates forming process became an important issue to a great extent especially if modern ship structural design and optimization are taken into account this is particularly valid in cases of complex and added value ships of high esthetic stealth and structural demands like cruise ships warships car carriers lng liquefied natural gas and lpg liquefied petroleum gas tankers senjanović et al 2009 besides ship production although smaller in scale plate forming is typically exploited in other industries like civil engineering tunnels tubular sections wind energy harvesting mechanical engineering boilers cylindrical tanks heat exchangers reactors and small household products etc himanshu et al 2007 it is therefore of particular interest to manufacturers and ship production professionals to investigate this rather complex problem in order to arrive at a simple fast understandable and acceptably accurate mathematical model suitable for daily application within the harsh industrial environment a thorough literature survey reveals that the analysis and model development of the plate forming process regardless of its importance remained quite sparse and is mainly driven by the sophisticated finite element models and roller bending machine design pioneering work on this topic can be tracked down to general plasticity theory development e g chakrabarty 2006 lubliner 2013 representing the sole essence of the further forming process research elementary mechanics considering three roller bending machine is developed in musafija 1979 and the application of the elastic ideally plastic stress strain relationship is investigated however no comparison to more sophisticated models was provided the plate forming process using four rollers bending machine is presented in detail by hua 1986 where elementary process mechanics is revisited with the main focus to the development of the roller deflection analysis model although the obtained results are verified against experimental data the research is mainly focused on four rollers bending machine design in a similar way a methodology for the three rollers bending machine design is presented in deore et al 2015 emphasizing the influence of the roller bending forces to roller deflections spur gears sprockets and power gear a simulation methodology of the dynamic plate forming process using radioss explicit solver is briefly presented in srivastav and shinde 2010 emphasizing the importance of such an approach particularly in the case of time varying forces analysis a more sophisticated approach to realistic loading modeling taking into account roller deflections is presented in hu and wang 2001 suggesting a new forming methodology based on segmented top and bottom rollers an important aspect of the problem is addressed in himanshu et al 2007 where bendability analysis in the case of c mn steel plates is presented the main focus of the challenging bendability analysis is the maximization of the roller bending width in order to reduce assembly and welding costs finally analytical modeling and numerical simulation for three roller bending forming of sheet metal are addressed in fu et al 2013 rigid linearly plastic stress strain relationship is used while the adopted one dimensional beam approach is validated using two dimensional finite element analysis and experimental results in the case of weldox 900 material and u shaped cross section a comparison of the obtained results demonstrates that the discrepancies are within acceptable engineering tolerances of about 1 the addressed papers although representative lack a thorough approach to the problem particularly as none of them addresses the influence of different assumed stress strain relationships to the applicability of the simplified models nor they consider residual stress influence to the structural strength problems completely except that the influence of the forming process parameters like a different material plate thickness curvature radius and bending span to the bending moment forces and finally energy consumption and process costs are not addressed completely it is therefore the purpose of this paper to present a simple plate forming analysis methodology and to determine the range of its applicability taking into account parameters like plate thickness steel grade and the assumed stress strain relationships enabling in such a way advanced process planning production cost analysis and more reliable structural design generally speaking the metal forming process is based on purposely imposed external load yielding plastic deformations permanently reshaping the workpiece without influencing other material properties therefore in the case of ship production and working pieces of large scale steel forming operations are associated with very high loads as well as robust large and expensive machinery capable of taking over significant stress levels indeed usual metal forming categorization is based on the desired workpiece form and machinery used the first group of forming operations is characterized as axis symmetric forming of cylindrical or conical shapes using roller bending machines the second group is composed of operations involved in general shapes forming using different kinds of press machines storch et al 1995 another characterization approach often used in the literature is based on the scale of deformations in case when a ratio between curvature radius and the plate thickness is above 5 the plate is considered to experience elastic plastic bending the major assumptions of elastic plastic bending are that the stress level in the plate is always below the ultimate strength and that one portion of the cross section exhibits elastic deformations while the remaining cross section portion experiences permanent plastic deformations on the other hand when a ratio between the radius of curvature and plate thickness is below 5 the plate is considered to experience plastic bending completely while stress levels can reach above ultimate strength musafija 1979 hu and wang 2001 accordingly the research presented in this paper is focused on the analysis of elastic plastic bending of large scale thin plate sheets using a three roller bending machine in a shipyard throughout the paper it is assumed that hu and wang 2001 fu et al 2013 the plate material is isotropic and without imperfections no initial curvatures are present the plate is initially ideally plain the thickness of the plate does not change during the process neutral line is assumed to be coincident with the middle plate surface and bauschinger effect is considered negligible i e neutral line does not shift toward the concave surface of the bent plate influence of counter bending moment due to plate self weight as well as the influence of inertial forces are negligible contact surfaces between plate and rollers as well as plate loading are equally distributed over the roller bending rollers are considered to be infinitely rigid there is no slip between rollers and plate the temperature of plate and rollers is assumed to be at a room level and constant throughout the process the forming process is composed only of one sequence achieving the desired form without repeating the process each portion of the plate behaves like a one dimensional beam during the forming process further assumptions are related to stress strain relationships and are presented in more detail later on given the assumptions a simple mathematical model is developed yielding bending moment roller bending forces and energy required to achieve the desired curvature radius the derived bending moments differ with respect to the assumed stress strain relationships four different cases are considered i e elastic ideally plastic elastic linearly plastic elastic multi linearly plastic and elastic nonlinearly plastic the developed models are benchmarked against the experimental data as well as using more complex 2d plate plastic deformation theory chakrabarty 2006 in that way applicability of the simplified model is confirmed the developed one dimensional theory is further applied in cases of different materials in order to investigate the influence of process parameters on the technology of large scale plate forming in a shipyard particularly related to residual stresses and elastic recovery the remainder of the paper is structured as follows in the following section a brief review of the forming process in a shipyard is outlined the mechanics of the plate forming is presented in details in the third section while addressing each of the considered stress strain assumed relationships and 2d plate theory independently spring back effects during the process are analyzed in section 4 experimental setup and measured results are provided in section 5 the developed theory is further applied in the 6th section where numerical examples and influence of different process parameters and spring back effects are presented finally section 7 contains main conclusions and recommendations for further research of this challenging topic 2 the shipyard s elastic plastic forming process the elastic plastic forming of plates can be performed using 3 or 4 roller bending machines where each roller has at least two degrees of freedom i e rotation about the longitudinal axis and horizontal or vertical translation each roller bending machine is equipped with a working platform hydraulic cylinders and auxiliary holding on equipment used to reduce plate self weight influence to the forming process the forming process is usually initiated by plate edge pre bending as efficient edge bending cannot be achieved using standard forming procedures once pre bending is completed the process continues using upper and lower rollers arranged in a symmetrical fashion as compared to the 3 rollers bending machine a machine with 4 rollers provides more flexible properties of the process covering wider forming capabilities like forming of apple like and pear like shapes as well as simpler material handling and conical shapes forming 3 mathematical models of elastic plastic bending 3 1 stress strain relationships analysis of material plastic forming process is based on the theory of plasticity dealing with stresses and strains induced in ductile material due to the action of purposely imposed external forces resulting in permanent deformations lubliner 2013 as plasticity problem is of incremental nature mathematical models have to be formulated based on experimental data in order to obtain sets of the true stress strain relationships valid for particular cases while assuming isotropic property of the material throughout the cold working deformation process chakrabarty 2006 a number of empirical stress strain relationships suitable for an analytical approach to the problem can be found in the literature most of them in the form of power law taking into account various combinations of influencing factors like yield strength tensile strength elongation contraction initial geometric properties and empirical constants musafija 1979 some of the well known empirical stress strain relationships are the ludwik power law ludwik 1909 generalized power law swift 1952 the voce equation voce 1948 the ramberg osgood equation ramberg and osgood 1943 the modified ludwik equation chakrabarty 2006 the musafia equation musafija 1979 the gubkin power law kolmogorov 1997 the körber equation hill 1948 etc each one of them is formulated assuming specific material properties labeled as rigid ideally plastic rigid linearly plastic rigid nonlinearly plastic elastic ideally plastic elastic linearly plastic and elastic nonlinearly plastic in the case of plastic forming of metals the latter three stress strain assumptions are of particular interest taking into account elastic stiffness permanent plastic deformations and elastic recovery a simple and convenient stress strain relationship suitable for the analysis of plastic forming of metals is the modified ludwik equation valid for the elastic and plastic zone and assuming a definite yield point musafija 1979 i e 1 σ e ε ε r e e r e e ε r e n ε r e e where e is young s modulus ε is a strain r e is yield strength and n is an empirical coefficient generally less than 1 2 in case when n 0 modified ludwik equation yields an elastic ideally plastic model while in cases of 0 n 0 5 the model becomes elastic nonlinearly plastic elastic linearly plastic behavior of a material can be formulated by replacing the second term in eq 1 with the equation of the linearly distributed strain hardening i e 2 σ e ε ε r e e e ε r e 1 e e ε r e e where e is the hardening modulus the elastic linearly plastic model can be additionally refined involving multiple hardening moduli valid for a particular plastic strain range a typical example of such approach to the problem is formulated by the european standards en 10025 det norske veritas 2013 involving three different hardening moduli valid between the proportionality limit the yield point the second yield point and the tensile strength i e 3 σ e ε ε r p e e 1 ε ε p r p r p e ε r e e e 2 ε ε e r e r e e ε r e 2 e e 3 ε ε e 2 r e 2 r e 2 e ε r m e where r p is the proportionality limit r e 2 is the second yield point r m is the tensile strength e i i 1 2 3 are pertaining hardening moduli and ε p ε e and ε e 2 are strains in points of proportionality yield and the second yield four different modeling approaches i e elastic ideally plastic eq 1 elastic linearly plastic eq 2 elastic multi linearly plastic eq 3 and elastic nonlinearly plastic eq 1 are qualitatively and comparatively presented in fig 1 and will be further exploited in the paper in order to determine external loads and energy required to conduct a technological process of plates forming using three rollers bending machine the stress strain relationship in compression is assumed to be anti symmetric to the stress strain relationship in tension 3 2 analysis of plate deformations and external loads plate deformations and external loads analysis in case of plastic forming of metal plates can be analyzed using different mathematical models starting from classical euler bernoulli and timoshenko 1d beam theories up to the more sophisticated 2d plate theories modified timoshenko plate theories and finite element models fem taking into account various effects like bending deflections shear deformations cross section rotations shear locking boundary conditions openings etc senjanović et al 2013 2014 2014a 2015 however the application of the 1d euler bernoulli theory in case of the elastic plastic plate forming analysis is of particular interest as it is the simplest one and the most suitable for purposes of fast analysis of required external loading and energy consumption during the process therefore bending moments and required energy will be determined by assuming the beam like behavior of the simply supported plate using different stress strain relationships the derived expressions will be verified later on against experimental data and a more sophisticated plate theory deformation of a plate during the elastic plastic forming process at the three roller bending machine is presented in fig 2 where plate particulars i e plate thickness t breadth b and length l are pointed out bending moment m is induced as external load due to action of upper and lower machine rolls and the plate segment is formed into the cylindrical form of the neutral line radius r n in the case of the euler bernoulli theory the characteristic sections of the plate differential element d x fig 2 ab and a b remain perpendicular to the neutral line nn during plate deformations forming in such a way an angle d φ while fibers above and below nn are shortened respectively extended according to fig 2 the length nn remains unchanged and is equal to 4 nn d x r n d φ while the strain of the arbitrary fiber is equal to 5 ε cc cd nn δ d x nn according to fig 2 variation δ d x is equal to z d φ that after introducing eq 4 into eq 5 yields 6 ε z r n eq 6 is of great significance and is used to determine cross section zones exhibiting elastic or plastic deformations as external loads have to be equilibrated by internal stress it follows that bending moment m is equal to fig 3 7 m a σ z z d a where σ z is stress distribution and d a is the differential cross section area eq 7 is valid in case of an arbitrary plate section with a normal vector collinear to the x axis the considered three roller bending system in work is presented in fig 4 where reaction forces f a in lower rollers are induced due to action of the upper roller force f in order to form the metal plates to cylindrical form of the radius r lower rollers of the radius r are placed in a symmetrical position at the distance l while reaction forces form an angle φ according to fig 4 it follows that the reacting force is equal to 8 f a f 2 cos φ 2 while in case of the bending moment it follows that 9 m f a x where x r n sin φ 2 and sin φ 2 l 2 r r by inserting eq 8 into eq 9 it follows for the force f that 10 f 2 m r n tan φ 2 finally the energy required to induce plastic deformations of a plate segment in the considered case is equal to 11 e s m φ m l r n that in case of a plate total length l gives 12 e m l r n it follows from eqs 7 12 that the process of particular metal plates forming is completely determined in case of a given curvature radius r upper roller force f and distance between lower rollers l therefore the presented theory will be further considered in cases of different assumed stress strain relationships resulting with different stress distribution functions σ z across the plate cross section 3 3 elastic ideally plastic model according to eq 1 the modified ludwik equation in case of n 0 yields the elastic ideally plastic model resulting in linear stress distribution in the elastic zone for 0 z z 0 and constant stress value in the plastic zone z 0 z t 2 for the considered cross section fig 5 a according to eq 6 the characteristic coordinate z 0 is governed by the condition ε ε e and is equal to 13 z 0 r n r e e the bending moment is determined using eq 7 by integrating the stress distribution along the z axis fig 5a that yields 14 m 2 b 0 z 0 r e z 0 z 2 d z 2 b z 0 t 2 r e z d z after some algebraic manipulation it follows that the external moment in case of the elastic ideally plastic model is equal to 15 m r e w s where w and s are the section modulus and the static momentum of the cross section area in elastic respectively plastic zone 3 4 elastic linearly plastic model in the case of the elastic linearly plastic model eq 2 the resulting stress distribution function σ z is composed of linearly distributed stress within the elastic zone 0 z z 0 and linearly distributed stress in the plastic zone z 0 z t 2 for the considered cross section where the characteristic coordinate z 0 is determined using eq 13 fig 5b the unknown stress σ t 2 can be determined using eq 6 in case of z t 2 as boundary cross section fibers are plastically deformed it follows from eqs 2 and 6 that the total strain is equal to 16 r e e σ t 2 r e e t 2 r n yielding the unknown stress as 17 σ t 2 e t 2 r n r e 1 e e eq 17 is identical to the second expression of eq 2 in case that ε t 2 r n the unknown hardening modulus e can be determined based on the material property data as a ratio 18 e r m r e ε m ε e where ε m is a strain in the tensile point of the true stress strain relationship by integrating the stress distribution along the z axis using eq 7 it follows that the external moment is composed of four integrals and is equal to 19 m 2 b 0 z 0 r e z 0 z 2 d z 2 b z 0 t 2 σ t 2 r e t 2 z 0 z 2 d z 2 b z 0 t 2 σ t 2 r e t 2 z 0 z 0 zd z 2 b z 0 t 2 r e zd z it can be seen that the first and the last integrals are identical to those obtained using the elastic ideally plastic model eq 14 while the second and third integrals represent additional corrective section modulus and static momentum of the cross section plastic zone after some algebraic manipulation it follows that the external moment in case of the elastic linearly plastic model is equal to 20 m r e w s σ t 2 r e w 1 s 1 where w and s are the section modulus and the static momentum of the cross section area in the elastic respectively plastic zone while w 1 and s 1 are defined as 21 w 1 2 b 1 t 2 z 0 z 0 t 2 z 2 d z s 1 2 b z 0 t 2 z 0 z 0 t 2 z 0 zd z 3 5 elastic multi linearly plastic model en 10025 in a similar fashion the resulting stress distribution function σ z fig 5c in case of the elastic multi linearly plastic model eq 3 is composed of linearly distributed stresses within elastic zones for 0 z z 0 z 0 z z 1 and z 1 z z 2 and linearly distributed stress in the plastic zone for z 2 z t 2 where characteristic coordinates z 0 z 1 and z 2 are equal to eq 13 22 z 0 r n ε p z 1 r n ε e z 2 r n ε e 2 again the unknown stress σ t 2 can be determined using eq 6 in case of z t 2 yielding 23 σ t 2 e 3 t 2 r n ε el r e 2 by integrating the stress distribution along the z axis using eq 7 it follows that the external moment takes more complex form composed of four integration zones i e 24 m 2 b 0 z 0 σ z zd z z 0 z 1 σ z zd z z 1 z 2 σ z zd z z 2 t 2 σ z zd z similar to previous cases eq 24 can be further decomposed into section moduli and static moments of the considered cross sections 3 6 elastic nonlinearly plastic model as compared to the elastic multi linearly plastic model the elastic nonlinearly plastic model is composed only of two relevant zones namely elastic for 0 z z 0 and plastic in case of z 0 z t 2 however a nonlinear stress distribution function σ z in the plastic zone can be assumed as a polynomial function of unknown coefficients therefore it follows that the assumed stress distribution function in case of the elastic nonlinearly plastic model is equal to fig 5d 25 σ z r e z 0 z 0 z z 0 a z 2 b z c z 0 z t 2 the unknown coefficients can be determined based on the boundary conditions at z z 0 and z t 2 i e 26 a z 0 2 b z 0 c r e a t 2 2 b t 2 c σ t 2 d d z a z 2 b z c t 2 0 the unknown stress σ t 2 follows from the lubliner power law distribution eq 1 and is equal to 27 σ t 2 e r e 1 n t 2 r n r e e 1 n the unknown coefficients of the polynomial function follow from the system of equations 26 and 27 and are equal to 28 a 4 r e a b b 4 t r e a b c r e t 2 4 a z 0 z 0 t b where 29 a r e n 1 e t 2 r e r n 2 r n 1 n b t 2 z 0 2 finally by introducing eq 25 into eq 7 it follows that the external moment is equal to 30 m 2 b r e z 0 0 z 0 z 2 d z z 0 t 2 a z 2 b z c zd z 3 7 2d plate theory a more sophisticated approach to the problem is briefly presented here for clarity without going into further details which are available in the literature e g chakrabarty 2006 the elastic plastic bending of wide sheets including strain hardening effects a progressive decrease of the plate thickness and bauschinger effect is formulated in cylindrical coordinates using radial σ r and circumferential σ θ stress distributions chakrabarty 2006 similarly to eq 7 the external loads have to be equilibrated by internal stress distributions i e it follows that the bending moment in the considered case is equal to 31 m 1 2 a b f r θ r d r where a and b are internal respectively external plate radii with respect to the instantaneous center of curvature fig 6 the function f r θ introduced in eq 31 is called the yield criterion and is equal to 32 f r θ σ θ σ r 2 k 1 m 1 r α n r 0 r b 2 k 1 m 1 r α n a r c 2 k 1 m a 1 r 0 α n c r r 0 where m and n are empirical constants k is the initial yield stress and 33 r 0 a 2 b 2 2 c a b α 2 a b a ln r c ln r 0 c by introducing eqs 32 and 33 into eq 31 after integration it follows that the external moment is equal to 34 m k ρ 2 1 c 2 ρ 2 ξ 2 1 m m 4 1 η 1 ξ 2 n ln ρ c 1 ξ 2 m η 2 n

dimensional beam approach the outlined 2d plate theory is rather complex particularly due to considered bauschinger effect along with that it relies on empirical constants which have to be determined using the experimental approach or sophisticated finite element modeling therefore it is not suitable for daily factory floor applications where quick estimates on required loading and production costs are required however as an advanced model it can be successfully applied as a benchmark verifying simpler models like the 1d beam approach the empirical constants m and n in eq 34 originate from the exponential assumption of the stress strain relationship both constants influence the material hardening rate by increasing or decreasing the slope of the curve in case when one of them is equal to 0 a material is considered to be nonhardening and behaves like ideally plastic material for purposes of the analysis presented further in the paper it will be assumed that empirical constants m and n are equal to 1 5 respectively 4 and that the difference between the initial and final plate thickness is negligible i e η 1 such an assumption is recommended by chakrabarty 2006 in cases of analysis of the work hardening metal sheets 4 residual stress and elastic recovery once the required plate form is obtained external bending moments diminish completely inducing a material spring back effect its importance is reflected in residual stress induction and plate elastic recovery chakrabarty 2006 recovery of residual stresses due to the elastic plastic plate forming process is quite important particularly as annealing is usually omitted from the manufacturing process consequently residual stresses form the very basis for the superposition of stresses induced during the lifetime of the ship structure influencing in such a way fatigue life structural redundancy and all other ship structural design aspects it is usually assumed that the spring back effect is governed by the elastic stress strain relationship therefore the induced stresses are of the opposite direction as compared to the bending induced stresses and are equal to chakrabarty 2006 36 σ spr z m i z where σ spr is stress induced due to the spring back effect and i moment of inertia the external moment m is determined using eqs 14 19 24 and 30 or 34 depending on the considered stress strain relationship and model accuracy the residual stress distribution across the plate cross section σ res z is therefore equal to 37 σ res z σ z σ spr z on the other hand elastic recovery affects the final form taken by the plate undergoing an elastic plastic forming process it can be demonstrated that the final permanent curvature of the plate 1 r perm is equal to chakrabarty 2006 38 1 r perm 1 r n m e i besides the spring back effect plastic deformations induce orthotropicity of the plates however that topic is beyond the scope of the present paper 5 experimental work basic parameters of steel plate forming process like upper roller force deformation work or stress distribution schemes have to be verified using experimental work particularly as a number of physical and geometrical simplifications are introduced by the theoretical work lin et al 2014 however the determination of the required parameters by experimental research in real factory floor conditions is rarely possible particularly in cases like large scale steel sheets forming it is therefore inevitably to apply the conditions of the similarity laws and to perform the experimental work using small scale models based on strain compatibility of two bodies of different sizes i e by applying geometric and physical similarities altan et al 1970 povrzanović 1996 krishnamurthy et al 2017 the geometric similarity of the model m and the actual body ab subsists if a relation between length l breadth b and thickness t of the model and the actual body 39 l a b l m b a b b m t a b t m n holds where n denotes similarity constant in fulfillment of the geometric similarity condition surface relations are equal to the square and volumes to the cube of the similarity constant therefore in the modeling of the metal forming process these relations must exist from the beginning to the end of the process the physical resemblance will exist if four basic conditions are met 1 the materials of the model and the actual body must be the same at any time of the deformation process including equal chemical composition phase state microstructure macrostructure and mechanical properties 2 temperature regimes of the forming process must be identical throughout the process 3 the strain and strain rate must be the same for the model and the actual body throughout the process 4 the friction and the tool contact surface must be identical consequently the following relations regarding bending stress σ upper roller force f and deformation work w are valid 40 σ a b η σ m f a b η n 2 f m w a b η n 3 w m where η is the divergence coefficient capturing all partial deviations of similarities in materials friction strain rate and temperature its value has to be determined using extensive experimental work and is therefore available in the specialized literature musafija 1979 boer et al 1986 povrzanović 1996 the divergence coefficient taken into account in the present study is equal to 10 13 due to losses like internal machine friction imperfect material the existence of the bauschinger effect localized contact surface etc musafija 1979 5 1 experimental setup and measurement results an experimental setup of bending process similar to fig 4 has been created according to the real production in order to provide upper roller force measurement and suitable verification of the numerical models using s355 material table 1 for the actual plate thickness of 50 mm actual distance between bottom support equal to 700 mm and actual roller radius equal to 200 mm the geometrical similarity is obtained by scaling using similarity constant equal to 10 while the sheet width was limited to 20 mm due to bending machine constraints the physical similarity is achieved by performing a forming process at room temperature in this way all problems related to temperature regimes phase states microstructural changes etc are avoided measurements are performed in the force direction in cases of three different bending radii and three equal workpieces as presented in table 2 an example of one workpiece after the completed experiment is presented in fig 7 a comparison between experimental and numerical data obtained using developed one dimensional beam approach assuming elastic ideally plastic ip elastic linearly plastic lp elastic multi linearly plastic mlp and elastic nonlinearly plastic nlp stress strain relationships and more sophisticated 2d plate theory pt is presented in table 2 it can be seen that all of the considered numerical models agree quite well with experimental data particularly in the range of lower curvature with reasonable discrepancies due to the assumed stress distributions the largest identified discrepancy is associated with the ip model in case of the smallest curvature radius and is equal to 7 5 while the 2d plate theory results with the smallest differences as compared to the experimental data therefore based on the experimental validation it can be concluded that all of the considered numerical methodologies are readily applicable in case of steel sheet forming process analysis which is considered in more detail in the following section 6 numerical examples the developed procedure of elastic plastic forming process analysis is further illustrated in the case of a typical plate of dimensions b 12 m and l 3 m usually used in shipyards during the manufacturing process bending moments forces and energy requirements are analyzed in cases of four different steel grades namely s235 s355 s420 and s460 table 1 and figs 8 11 for plate thicknesses between 10 and 50 mm the assumed roller radius and distance between lower rollers are r 200 mm and l 700 mm bending moment m is determined using eqs 14 20 24 and 30 assuming elastic ideally plastic ip elastic linearly plastic lp elastic multi linearly plastic mlp and elastic nonlinearly plastic nlp stress strain relationships in each case the upper roller force f and energy required to induce plastic deformations are calculated using eq 10 respectively 12 the obtained results for r 1000 mm presented in tables 3 6 are compared to loading and energy requirements determined using plate theory pt eq 34 it can be seen that quite good agreement is found between all of the considered elastic plastic plate forming models particularly as discrepancies do not exceed 5 as compared to the more sophisticated plate theory based on that comparison it can be concluded that the euler bernoulli beam theory is applicable within acceptable engineering accuracy range particularly in cases such as fast energy and production costs analysis for different ship structural components or product types like liquefied gas tanks special purpose ships offshore platforms etc along with that the simplified analytical models can also be applied for purposes of roller bending machine design and construction concerning different assumed stress strain relationships elastic ideally plastic ip and elastic linearly plastic lp models can be recommended for further application as the simples models based on usually available input data on the other hand elastic multi linearly plastic mlp requires more detailed input of material properties which may not be available in all cases while elastic nonlinearly plastic np model remains very sensitive to the assumed empirical coefficient n based on the above results the influence of bending radius r to bending moment forces and energy is analyzed in the case of s235 steel using an elastic ideally plastic ip model as presented in fig 12 it can be seen that energy required to induce plastic deformations is very sensitive to bending radius amplification while bending moments and forces remain almost constant except in the range of large respectively small radii the same effect can also be found in cases of s355 s420 and s460 material according to eqs 7 12 impact of other process parameters i e distance between rollers l and roller radius r is reflected only in case of bending forces leading to the logical conclusion that amplification of roller radius and distance between rollers results with lower forces required to induce the same bending moment it can finally very important aspects of the elastic plastic forming problem are residual stresses and permanent curvature due to the plate spring back effect influencing further ship structural analysis and design as well as the final form taken by the plate being formed distribution of the residual stress across the plate cross section was determined using eq 37 and taking into account all of the considered stress strain assumptions in cases of material s235 s355 s420 and s460 for plate thicknesses between 10 and 50 mm also permanent curvature was determined in the same cases using eq 38 as no significant differences could be found between considered stress strain relationships the obtained results are presented in case of the simplest approach using the elastic ideally plastic model in fig 13 the obtained residual stresses are presented in the form of a ratio σ resmax r e where σ resmax is the maximum value of the σ z along the plate cross section the permanent curvature is presented in the same fashion as the ratio r perm r n it can be seen that spring back effects due to residual stress and permanent curvature approach unit value from below respectively above with the amplification of the plate thickness while the influence of material type is evident especially in the range below t 20 mm 7 conclusion steel plates forming process is an important component of the ship production process particularly during fabrication of ship structure elements like bilge fore and aft peak and corrugated bulkheads yet due to its complexity it strongly relies on experienced craftsmen and their skills a thorough literature review presented in this paper reveals that research on the elastic plastic forming of steel plates remained quite sparse and that it is mainly driven by the application of fem in order to arrive at the optimal roller bending machine properties given such circumstances the main intention of the presented research is to address the influence of different assumed stress strain relationships to the analysis of the elastic plastic forming process particularly regarding bending moments bending forces and energy required to achieve desired plastic deformations applicability of the simplified one dimensional analytical models and different stress strain relationships is successfully verified by comparing the obtained results to the acquired experimental data as well as to more complex 2d plate theory in cases of four different steel grades for the plate thickness range between 10 and 50 mm as no significant discrepancies between different models were identified the application of the simplest elastic ideally plastic and elastic linearly plastic models are recommended for further application influence of bending radius amplification to the bending moments forces and energy is investigated pointing to the energy requirements as the most sensitive parameter particularly in the range of bending radii below 4000 mm along with that it is pointed out that the distance between rollers and roller radius determines an important aspect of the machine bendability range finally an important aspect of the plate spring back effect is analyzed in cases of four different materials in order to address residual stress recovery and permanent curvature as the final form taken by the plate being formed analysis of the ratio between maximum induced residual stress and yield strength as well as between permanent curvature and plate curvature during the process reveals particular sensitivity of the parameters for plate thicknesses below 20 mm however both parameters approach unit value as the plate thickness is amplified the importance of the presented research is reflected in the field of ship production technology as well as in the field of ship structural analysis and design in the former case the outlined methodology enables ship production engineers and researchers with simple and powerful method that can be successfully used as analytical tool for forming process planning ship production cost analysis bendability analysis and design of roller bending machines in order to achieve more reliable energy consumption control better product quality less fallout material and higher production rate in the latter case it contributes to the ship structural analysis and design as the residual stress distribution forms the very basis for further hull strength vibration fatigue and ultimate strength analysis that are crucial for the improvement of the lifelong ship service it is therefore of particular importance to further develop the presented theory in cases of four roller bending machines plate conical shapes elastic plastic forming of sections and plastic forming of plates and sections acknowledgment this research is supported by the university of rijeka support project improving the methodology of designing the shipbuilding process no 13 09 1 1 06 and by the

22453,steel plates forming process as an important component of the ship production process is presented in this paper with the main intention to address the influence of different assumed stress strain relationships to the analysis of the elastic plastic forming process particularly regarding bending moments bending forces and energy required to achieve desired steel plate plastic deformations applicability of the simplified one dimensional analytical models and different stress strain relationships is successfully verified against the experiment as well as by comparing the obtained results to more complex 2d plate theory in cases of four different steel grades s235 s355 s420 s460 for the plate thicknesses up to 50 mm influence of bending radius the distance between rollers and roller radius is analyzed further on and aspects of plate spring back effects i e residual stress and permanent curvature are addressed finally the importance of the present research in cases of ship production and ship structural analysis and design is pointed out keywords ship production steel plates forming plastic deformations experimental work roller bending machine residual stress 1 introduction the ship production process is composed of numerous different demanding and interdependent technological processes usually labeled as fabrication and assembly operations yielding complex and expensive products like ships and offshore structures one particularly important fabrication operation is forming of steel plates and sections becoming structural components like bilge fore and aft peaks stiffeners or corrugated bulkheads however while other operations like steel shop priming or plate and stiffener cutting became highly automated steel plates and sections forming remained strongly relied on experienced craftsmen and their skills nevertheless the steel plates forming process became an important issue to a great extent especially if modern ship structural design and optimization are taken into account this is particularly valid in cases of complex and added value ships of high esthetic stealth and structural demands like cruise ships warships car carriers lng liquefied natural gas and lpg liquefied petroleum gas tankers senjanović et al 2009 besides ship production although smaller in scale plate forming is typically exploited in other industries like civil engineering tunnels tubular sections wind energy harvesting mechanical engineering boilers cylindrical tanks heat exchangers reactors and small household products etc himanshu et al 2007 it is therefore of particular interest to manufacturers and ship production professionals to investigate this rather complex problem in order to arrive at a simple fast understandable and acceptably accurate mathematical model suitable for daily application within the harsh industrial environment a thorough literature survey reveals that the analysis and model development of the plate forming process regardless of its importance remained quite sparse and is mainly driven by the sophisticated finite element models and roller bending machine design pioneering work on this topic can be tracked down to general plasticity theory development e g chakrabarty 2006 lubliner 2013 representing the sole essence of the further forming process research elementary mechanics considering three roller bending machine is developed in musafija 1979 and the application of the elastic ideally plastic stress strain relationship is investigated however no comparison to more sophisticated models was provided the plate forming process using four rollers bending machine is presented in detail by hua 1986 where elementary process mechanics is revisited with the main focus to the development of the roller deflection analysis model although the obtained results are verified against experimental data the research is mainly focused on four rollers bending machine design in a similar way a methodology for the three rollers bending machine design is presented in deore et al 2015 emphasizing the influence of the roller bending forces to roller deflections spur gears sprockets and power gear a simulation methodology of the dynamic plate forming process using radioss explicit solver is briefly presented in srivastav and shinde 2010 emphasizing the importance of such an approach particularly in the case of time varying forces analysis a more sophisticated approach to realistic loading modeling taking into account roller deflections is presented in hu and wang 2001 suggesting a new forming methodology based on segmented top and bottom rollers an important aspect of the problem is addressed in himanshu et al 2007 where bendability analysis in the case of c mn steel plates is presented the main focus of the challenging bendability analysis is the maximization of the roller bending width in order to reduce assembly and welding costs finally analytical modeling and numerical simulation for three roller bending forming of sheet metal are addressed in fu et al 2013 rigid linearly plastic stress strain relationship is used while the adopted one dimensional beam approach is validated using two dimensional finite element analysis and experimental results in the case of weldox 900 material and u shaped cross section a comparison of the obtained results demonstrates that the discrepancies are within acceptable engineering tolerances of about 1 the addressed papers although representative lack a thorough approach to the problem particularly as none of them addresses the influence of different assumed stress strain relationships to the applicability of the simplified models nor they consider residual stress influence to the structural strength problems completely except that the influence of the forming process parameters like a different material plate thickness curvature radius and bending span to the bending moment forces and finally energy consumption and process costs are not addressed completely it is therefore the purpose of this paper to present a simple plate forming analysis methodology and to determine the range of its applicability taking into account parameters like plate thickness steel grade and the assumed stress strain relationships enabling in such a way advanced process planning production cost analysis and more reliable structural design generally speaking the metal forming process is based on purposely imposed external load yielding plastic deformations permanently reshaping the workpiece without influencing other material properties therefore in the case of ship production and working pieces of large scale steel forming operations are associated with very high loads as well as robust large and expensive machinery capable of taking over significant stress levels indeed usual metal forming categorization is based on the desired workpiece form and machinery used the first group of forming operations is characterized as axis symmetric forming of cylindrical or conical shapes using roller bending machines the second group is composed of operations involved in general shapes forming using different kinds of press machines storch et al 1995 another characterization approach often used in the literature is based on the scale of deformations in case when a ratio between curvature radius and the plate thickness is above 5 the plate is considered to experience elastic plastic bending the major assumptions of elastic plastic bending are that the stress level in the plate is always below the ultimate strength and that one portion of the cross section exhibits elastic deformations while the remaining cross section portion experiences permanent plastic deformations on the other hand when a ratio between the radius of curvature and plate thickness is below 5 the plate is considered to experience plastic bending completely while stress levels can reach above ultimate strength musafija 1979 hu and wang 2001 accordingly the research presented in this paper is focused on the analysis of elastic plastic bending of large scale thin plate sheets using a three roller bending machine in a shipyard throughout the paper it is assumed that hu and wang 2001 fu et al 2013 the plate material is isotropic and without imperfections no initial curvatures are present the plate is initially ideally plain the thickness of the plate does not change during the process neutral line is assumed to be coincident with the middle plate surface and bauschinger effect is considered negligible i e neutral line does not shift toward the concave surface of the bent plate influence of counter bending moment due to plate self weight as well as the influence of inertial forces are negligible contact surfaces between plate and rollers as well as plate loading are equally distributed over the roller bending rollers are considered to be infinitely rigid there is no slip between rollers and plate the temperature of plate and rollers is assumed to be at a room level and constant throughout the process the forming process is composed only of one sequence achieving the desired form without repeating the process each portion of the plate behaves like a one dimensional beam during the forming process further assumptions are related to stress strain relationships and are presented in more detail later on given the assumptions a simple mathematical model is developed yielding bending moment roller bending forces and energy required to achieve the desired curvature radius the derived bending moments differ with respect to the assumed stress strain relationships four different cases are considered i e elastic ideally plastic elastic linearly plastic elastic multi linearly plastic and elastic nonlinearly plastic the developed models are benchmarked against the experimental data as well as using more complex 2d plate plastic deformation theory chakrabarty 2006 in that way applicability of the simplified model is confirmed the developed one dimensional theory is further applied in cases of different materials in order to investigate the influence of process parameters on the technology of large scale plate forming in a shipyard particularly related to residual stresses and elastic recovery the remainder of the paper is structured as follows in the following section a brief review of the forming process in a shipyard is outlined the mechanics of the plate forming is presented in details in the third section while addressing each of the considered stress strain assumed relationships and 2d plate theory independently spring back effects during the process are analyzed in section 4 experimental setup and measured results are provided in section 5 the developed theory is further applied in the 6th section where numerical examples and influence of different process parameters and spring back effects are presented finally section 7 contains main conclusions and recommendations for further research of this challenging topic 2 the shipyard s elastic plastic forming process the elastic plastic forming of plates can be performed using 3 or 4 roller bending machines where each roller has at least two degrees of freedom i e rotation about the longitudinal axis and horizontal or vertical translation each roller bending machine is equipped with a working platform hydraulic cylinders and auxiliary holding on equipment used to reduce plate self weight influence to the forming process the forming process is usually initiated by plate edge pre bending as efficient edge bending cannot be achieved using standard forming procedures once pre bending is completed the process continues using upper and lower rollers arranged in a symmetrical fashion as compared to the 3 rollers bending machine a machine with 4 rollers provides more flexible properties of the process covering wider forming capabilities like forming of apple like and pear like shapes as well as simpler material handling and conical shapes forming 3 mathematical models of elastic plastic bending 3 1 stress strain relationships analysis of material plastic forming process is based on the theory of plasticity dealing with stresses and strains induced in ductile material due to the action of purposely imposed external forces resulting in permanent deformations lubliner 2013 as plasticity problem is of incremental nature mathematical models have to be formulated based on experimental data in order to obtain sets of the true stress strain relationships valid for particular cases while assuming isotropic property of the material throughout the cold working deformation process chakrabarty 2006 a number of empirical stress strain relationships suitable for an analytical approach to the problem can be found in the literature most of them in the form of power law taking into account various combinations of influencing factors like yield strength tensile strength elongation contraction initial geometric properties and empirical constants musafija 1979 some of the well known empirical stress strain relationships are the ludwik power law ludwik 1909 generalized power law swift 1952 the voce equation voce 1948 the ramberg osgood equation ramberg and osgood 1943 the modified ludwik equation chakrabarty 2006 the musafia equation musafija 1979 the gubkin power law kolmogorov 1997 the körber equation hill 1948 etc each one of them is formulated assuming specific material properties labeled as rigid ideally plastic rigid linearly plastic rigid nonlinearly plastic elastic ideally plastic elastic linearly plastic and elastic nonlinearly plastic in the case of plastic forming of metals the latter three stress strain assumptions are of particular interest taking into account elastic stiffness permanent plastic deformations and elastic recovery a simple and convenient stress strain relationship suitable for the analysis of plastic forming of metals is the modified ludwik equation valid for the elastic and plastic zone and assuming a definite yield point musafija 1979 i e 1 σ e ε ε r e e r e e ε r e n ε r e e where e is young s modulus ε is a strain r e is yield strength and n is an empirical coefficient generally less than 1 2 in case when n 0 modified ludwik equation yields an elastic ideally plastic model while in cases of 0 n 0 5 the model becomes elastic nonlinearly plastic elastic linearly plastic behavior of a material can be formulated by replacing the second term in eq 1 with the equation of the linearly distributed strain hardening i e 2 σ e ε ε r e e e ε r e 1 e e ε r e e where e is the hardening modulus the elastic linearly plastic model can be additionally refined involving multiple hardening moduli valid for a particular plastic strain range a typical example of such approach to the problem is formulated by the european standards en 10025 det norske veritas 2013 involving three different hardening moduli valid between the proportionality limit the yield point the second yield point and the tensile strength i e 3 σ e ε ε r p e e 1 ε ε p r p r p e ε r e e e 2 ε

and ε p ε e and ε e 2 are strains in points of proportionality yield and the second yield four different modeling approaches i e elastic ideally plastic eq 1 elastic linearly plastic eq 2 elastic multi linearly plastic eq 3 and elastic nonlinearly plastic eq 1 are qualitatively and comparatively presented in fig 1 and will be further exploited in the paper in order to determine external loads and energy required to conduct a technological process of plates forming using three rollers bending machine the stress strain relationship in compression is assumed to be anti symmetric to the stress strain relationship in tension 3 2 analysis of plate deformations and external loads plate deformations and external loads analysis in case of plastic forming of metal plates can be analyzed using different mathematical models starting from classical euler bernoulli and timoshenko 1d beam theories up to the more sophisticated 2d plate theories modified timoshenko plate theories and finite element models fem taking into account various effects like bending deflections shear deformations cross section rotations shear locking boundary conditions openings etc senjanović et al 2013 2014 2014a 2015 however the application of the 1d euler bernoulli theory in case of the elastic plastic plate forming analysis is of particular interest as it is the simplest one and the most suitable for purposes of fast analysis of required external loading and energy consumption during the process therefore bending moments and required energy will be determined by assuming the beam like behavior of the simply supported plate using different stress strain relationships the derived expressions will be verified later on against experimental data and a more sophisticated plate theory deformation of a plate during the elastic plastic forming process at the three roller bending machine is presented in fig 2 where plate particulars i e plate thickness t breadth b and length l are pointed out bending moment m is induced as external load due to action of upper and lower machine rolls and the plate segment is formed into the cylindrical form of the neutral line radius r n in the case of the euler bernoulli theory the characteristic sections of the plate differential element d x fig 2 ab and a b remain perpendicular to the neutral line nn during plate deformations forming in such a way an angle d φ while fibers above and below nn are shortened respectively extended according to fig 2 the length nn remains unchanged and is equal to 4 nn d x r n d φ while the strain of the arbitrary fiber is equal to 5 ε cc cd nn δ d x nn according to fig 2 variation δ d x is equal to z d φ that after introducing eq 4 into eq 5 yields 6 ε z r n eq 6 is of great significance and is used to determine cross section zones exhibiting elastic or plastic deformations as external loads have to be equilibrated by internal stress it follows that bending moment m is equal to fig 3 7 m a σ z z d a where σ z is stress distribution and d a is the differential cross section area eq 7 is valid in case of an arbitrary plate section with a normal vector collinear to the x axis the considered three roller bending system in work is presented in fig 4 where reaction forces f a in lower rollers are induced due to action of the upper roller force f in order to form the metal plates to cylindrical form of the radius r lower rollers of the radius r are placed in a symmetrical position at the distance l while reaction forces form an angle φ according to fig 4 it follows that the reacting force is equal to 8 f a f 2 cos φ 2 while in case of the bending moment it follows that 9 m f a x where x r n sin φ 2 and sin φ 2 l 2 r r by inserting eq 8 into eq 9 it follows for the force f that 10 f 2 m r n tan φ 2 finally the energy required to induce plastic deformations of a plate segment in the considered case is equal to 11 e s m φ m l r n that in case of a plate total length l gives 12 e m l r n it follows from eqs 7 12 that the process of particular metal plates forming is completely determined in case of a given curvature radius r upper roller force f and distance between lower rollers l therefore the presented theory will be further considered in cases of different assumed stress strain relationships resulting with different stress distribution functions σ z across the plate cross section 3 3 elastic ideally plastic model according to eq 1 the modified ludwik equation in case of n 0 yields the elastic ideally plastic model resulting in linear stress distribution in the elastic zone for 0 z z 0 and constant stress value in the plastic zone z 0 z t 2 for the considered cross section fig 5 a according to eq 6 the characteristic coordinate z 0 is governed by the condition ε ε e and is equal to 13 z 0 r n r e e the bending moment is determined using eq 7 by integrating the stress distribution along the z axis fig 5a that yields 14 m 2 b 0 z 0 r e z 0 z 2 d z 2 b z 0 t 2 r e z d z after some algebraic manipulation it follows that the external moment in case of the elastic ideally plastic model is equal to 15 m r e w s where w and s are the section modulus and the static momentum of the cross section area in elastic respectively plastic zone 3 4 elastic linearly plastic model in the case of the elastic linearly plastic model eq 2 the resulting stress distribution function σ z is composed of linearly distributed stress within the elastic zone 0 z z 0 and linearly distributed stress in the plastic zone z 0 z t 2 for the considered cross section where the characteristic coordinate z 0 is determined using eq 13 fig 5b the unknown stress σ t 2 can be determined using eq 6 in case of z t 2 as boundary cross section fibers are plastically deformed it follows from eqs 2 and 6 that the total strain is equal to 16 r e e σ t 2 r e e t 2 r n yielding the unknown stress as 17 σ t 2 e t 2 r n r e 1 e e eq 17 is identical to the second expression of eq 2 in case that ε t 2 r n the unknown hardening modulus e can be determined based on the material property data as a ratio 18 e r m r e ε m ε e where ε m is a strain in the tensile point of the true stress strain relationship by integrating the stress distribution along the z axis using eq 7 it follows that the external moment is composed of four integrals and is equal to 19 m 2 b 0 z 0 r e z 0 z 2 d z 2 b z 0 t 2 σ t 2 r e t 2 z 0 z 2 d z 2 b z 0 t 2 σ t 2 r e t 2 z 0 z 0 zd z 2 b z 0 t 2 r e zd z it can be seen that the first and the last integrals are identical to those obtained using the elastic ideally plastic model eq 14 while the second and third integrals represent additional corrective section modulus and static momentum of the cross section plastic zone after some algebraic manipulation it follows that the external moment in case of the elastic linearly plastic model is equal to 20 m r e w s σ t 2 r e w 1 s 1 where w and s are the section modulus and the static momentum of the cross section area in the elastic respectively plastic zone while w 1 and s 1 are defined as 21 w 1 2 b 1 t 2 z 0 z 0 t 2 z 2 d z s 1 2 b z 0 t 2 z 0 z 0 t 2 z 0 zd z 3 5 elastic multi linearly plastic model en 10025 in a similar fashion the resulting stress distribution function σ z fig 5c in case of the elastic multi linearly plastic model eq 3 is composed of linearly distributed stresses within elastic zones for 0 z z 0 z 0 z z 1 and z 1 z z 2 and linearly distributed stress in the plastic zone for z 2 z t 2 where characteristic coordinates z 0 z 1 and z 2 are equal to eq 13 22 z 0 r n ε p z 1 r n ε e z 2 r n ε e 2 again the unknown stress σ t 2 can be determined using eq 6 in case of z t 2 yielding 23 σ t 2 e 3 t 2 r n ε el r e 2 by integrating the stress distribution along the z axis using eq 7 it follows that the external moment takes more complex form composed of four integration zones i e 24 m 2 b 0 z 0 σ z zd z z 0 z 1 σ z zd z z 1 z 2 σ z zd z z 2 t 2 σ z zd z similar to previous cases eq 24 can be further decomposed into section moduli and static moments of the considered cross sections 3 6 elastic nonlinearly plastic model as compared to the elastic multi linearly plastic model the elastic nonlinearly plastic model is composed only of two relevant zones namely elastic for 0 z z 0 and plastic in case of z 0 z t 2 however a nonlinear stress distribution function σ z in the plastic zone can be assumed as a polynomial function of unknown coefficients therefore it follows that the assumed stress distribution function in case of the elastic nonlinearly plastic model is equal to fig 5d 25 σ z r e z 0 z 0 z z 0 a z 2 b z c z 0 z t 2 the unknown coefficients can be determined based on the boundary conditions at z z 0 and z t 2 i e 26 a z 0 2 b z 0 c r e a t 2 2 b t 2 c σ t 2 d d z a z 2 b z c t 2 0 the unknown stress σ t 2 follows from the lubliner power law distribution eq 1 and is equal to 27 σ t 2 e r e 1 n t 2 r n r e e 1 n the unknown coefficients of the polynomial function follow from the system of equations 26 and 27 and are equal to 28 a 4 r e a b b 4 t r e a b c r e t 2 4 a z 0 z 0 t b where 29 a r e n 1 e t 2 r e r n 2 r n 1 n b t 2 z 0 2

problem is briefly presented here for clarity without going into further details which are available in the literature e g chakrabarty 2006 the elastic plastic bending of wide sheets including strain hardening effects a progressive decrease of the plate thickness and bauschinger effect is formulated in cylindrical coordinates using radial σ r and circumferential σ θ stress distributions chakrabarty 2006 similarly to eq 7 the external loads have to be equilibrated by internal stress distributions i e it follows that the bending moment in the considered case is equal to 31 m 1 2 a b f r θ r d r where a and b are internal respectively external plate radii with respect to the instantaneous center of curvature fig 6 the function f r θ introduced in eq 31 is called the yield criterion and is equal to 32 f r θ σ θ σ r 2 k 1 m 1 r α n r 0 r b 2 k 1 m 1 r α n a r c 2 k 1 m a 1 r 0 α n c r r 0 where m and n are empirical constants k is the initial yield stress and 33 r 0 a 2 b 2 2 c a b α 2 a b a ln r c ln r 0 c by introducing eqs 32 and 33 into eq 31 after integration it follows that the external moment is equal to 34 m k ρ 2 1 c 2 ρ 2 ξ 2 1 m m 4 1 η 1 ξ 2 n ln ρ c 1 ξ 2 m η 2 n 2 c ρ η n 2 1 ξ η n 2 m c 2 2 ρ 2 m η 2 n 2 n 2 η 1 ξ 2 n 2 η 1 ξ n 2 where 35 ξ h 2 ρ η h h 0 ρ a b 2 n 2 while h and h 0 are the initial and final plate thicknesses as compared to the one dimensional beam approach the outlined 2d plate theory is rather complex particularly due to considered bauschinger effect along with that it relies on empirical constants which have to be determined using the experimental approach or sophisticated finite element modeling therefore it is not suitable for daily factory floor applications where quick estimates on required loading and production costs are required however as an advanced model it can be successfully applied as a benchmark verifying simpler models like the 1d beam approach the empirical constants m and n in eq 34 originate from the exponential assumption of the stress strain relationship both constants influence the material hardening rate by increasing or decreasing the slope of the curve in case when one of them is equal to 0 a material is considered to be nonhardening and behaves like ideally plastic material for purposes of the analysis presented further in the paper it will be assumed that empirical constants m and n are equal to 1 5 respectively 4 and that the difference between the initial and final plate thickness is negligible i e η 1 such an assumption is recommended by chakrabarty 2006 in cases of analysis of the work hardening metal sheets 4 residual stress and elastic recovery once the required plate form is obtained external bending moments diminish completely inducing a material spring back effect its importance is reflected in residual stress induction and plate elastic recovery chakrabarty 2006 recovery of residual stresses due to the elastic plastic plate forming process is quite important particularly as annealing is usually omitted from the manufacturing process consequently residual stresses form the very basis for the superposition of stresses induced during the lifetime of the ship structure influencing in such a way fatigue life structural redundancy and all other ship structural design aspects it is usually assumed that the spring back effect is governed by the elastic stress strain relationship therefore the induced stresses are of the opposite direction as compared to the bending induced stresses and are equal to chakrabarty 2006 36 σ spr z m i z where σ spr is stress induced due to the spring back effect and i moment of inertia the external moment m is determined using eqs 14 19 24 and 30 or 34 depending on the considered stress strain relationship and model accuracy the residual stress distribution across the plate cross section σ res z is therefore equal to 37 σ res z σ z σ spr z on the other hand elastic recovery affects the final form taken by the plate undergoing an elastic plastic forming process it can be demonstrated that the final permanent curvature of the plate 1 r perm is equal to chakrabarty 2006 38 1 r perm 1 r n m e i besides the spring back effect plastic deformations induce orthotropicity of the plates however that topic is beyond the scope of the present paper 5 experimental work basic parameters of steel plate forming process like upper roller force deformation work or stress distribution schemes have to be verified using experimental work particularly as a number of physical and geometrical simplifications are introduced by the theoretical work lin et al 2014 however the determination of the required parameters by experimental research in real factory floor conditions is rarely possible particularly in cases like large scale steel sheets forming it is therefore inevitably to apply the conditions of the similarity laws and to perform the experimental work using small scale models based on strain compatibility of two bodies of different sizes i e by applying geometric and physical similarities altan et al 1970 povrzanović 1996 krishnamurthy et al 2017 the geometric similarity of the model m and the actual body ab subsists if a relation between length l breadth b and thickness t of the model and the actual body 39 l a b l m b a b b m t a b t m n holds where n denotes similarity constant in fulfillment of the geometric similarity condition surface relations are equal to the square and volumes to the cube of the similarity constant therefore in the modeling of the metal forming process these relations must exist from the beginning to the end of the process the physical resemblance will exist if four basic conditions are met 1 the materials of the model and the actual body must be the same at any time of the deformation process including equal chemical composition phase state microstructure macrostructure and mechanical properties 2 temperature regimes of the forming process must be identical throughout the process 3 the strain and strain rate must be the same for the model and the actual body throughout the process 4 the friction and the tool contact surface must be identical consequently the following relations regarding bending stress σ upper roller force f and deformation work w are valid 40 σ a b η σ m f a b η n 2 f m w a b η n 3 w m where η is the divergence coefficient capturing all partial deviations of similarities in materials friction strain rate and temperature its value has to be determined using extensive experimental work and is therefore available in the specialized literature musafija 1979 boer et al 1986 povrzanović 1996 the divergence coefficient taken into account in the present study is equal to 10 13 due to losses like internal machine friction imperfect material the existence of the bauschinger effect localized contact surface etc musafija 1979 5 1 experimental setup and measurement results an experimental setup of bending process similar to fig 4 has been created according to the real production in order to provide upper roller force measurement and suitable verification of the numerical models using s355 material table 1 for the actual plate thickness of 50 mm actual distance between bottom support equal to 700 mm and actual roller radius equal to 200 mm the geometrical similarity is obtained by scaling using similarity constant equal to 10 while the sheet width was limited to 20 mm due to bending machine constraints the physical similarity is achieved by performing a forming process at room temperature in this way all problems related to temperature regimes phase states microstructural changes etc are avoided measurements are performed in the force direction in cases of three different bending radii and three equal workpieces as presented in table 2 an example of one workpiece after the completed experiment is presented in fig 7 a comparison between experimental and numerical data obtained using developed one dimensional beam approach assuming elastic ideally plastic ip elastic linearly plastic lp elastic multi linearly plastic mlp and elastic nonlinearly plastic nlp stress strain relationships and more sophisticated 2d plate theory pt is presented in table 2 it can be seen that all of the considered numerical models agree quite well with experimental data particularly in the range of lower curvature with reasonable discrepancies due to the assumed stress distributions the largest identified discrepancy is associated with the ip model in case of the smallest curvature radius and is equal to 7 5 while the 2d plate theory results with the smallest differences as compared to the experimental data therefore based on the experimental validation it can be concluded that all of the considered numerical methodologies are readily applicable in case of steel sheet forming process analysis which is considered in more detail in the following section 6 numerical examples the developed procedure of elastic plastic forming process analysis is further illustrated in the case of a typical plate of dimensions b 12 m and l 3 m usually used in shipyards during the manufacturing process bending moments forces and energy requirements are analyzed in cases of four different steel grades namely s235 s355 s420 and s460 table 1 and figs 8 11 for plate thicknesses between 10 and 50 mm the assumed roller radius and distance between lower rollers are r 200 mm and l 700 mm bending moment m is determined using eqs 14 20 24 and 30 assuming elastic ideally plastic ip elastic linearly plastic lp elastic multi linearly plastic mlp and elastic nonlinearly plastic nlp stress strain relationships in each case the upper roller force f and energy required to induce plastic deformations are calculated using eq 10 respectively 12 the obtained results for r 1000 mm presented in tables 3 6 are compared to loading and energy requirements determined using plate theory pt eq 34 it can be seen that quite good agreement is found between all of the considered elastic plastic plate forming models particularly as discrepancies do not exceed 5 as compared to the more sophisticated plate theory based on that comparison it can be concluded that the euler bernoulli beam theory is applicable within acceptable engineering accuracy range particularly in cases such as fast energy and production costs analysis for different ship structural components or product types like liquefied gas tanks special purpose ships offshore platforms etc along with that the simplified analytical models can also be applied for purposes of roller bending machine design and construction concerning different assumed stress strain relationships elastic ideally plastic ip and elastic linearly plastic lp models can be recommended for further application as the simples models based on usually available input data on the other hand elastic multi linearly plastic mlp requires more detailed input of material properties which may not be available in all cases while elastic nonlinearly plastic np model remains very sensitive to the assumed empirical coefficient n based on the above results the influence of bending radius r to bending moment forces and energy is analyzed in the case of s235 steel using an elastic ideally plastic ip model as presented in fig 12 it can be seen that energy required to induce plastic deformations is very sensitive to bending radius amplification while bending moments and forces remain almost constant except in the range of large respectively small radii the same effect can also be found in cases of s355 s420 and s460 material according to eqs 7 12 impact of other process parameters i e distance between rollers l and roller radius r is reflected only in case of bending forces leading to the logical conclusion that amplification of roller radius and distance between rollers results with lower forces required to induce the same bending moment it can finally very important aspects of the elastic plastic forming problem are residual stresses and permanent curvature due to the plate spring back effect influencing further ship structural analysis and design as well as the final form taken by the plate being formed distribution of the residual stress across the plate cross section was determined using eq 37 and taking into account all of the considered stress strain assumptions in cases of material s235 s355 s420 and s460 for plate thicknesses between 10 and 50 mm also permanent curvature was determined in the same cases using eq 38 as no significant differences could be found between considered stress strain relationships the obtained results are presented in case of the simplest approach using the elastic ideally plastic model in fig 13 the obtained residual stresses are presented in the form of a ratio σ resmax r e where σ resmax is the maximum value of the σ z along the plate cross section the permanent curvature is presented in the same fashion as the ratio r perm r n it can be seen that spring back effects due to residual stress and permanent curvature approach unit value from below respectively above with the amplification of the plate thickness while the influence of material type is evident especially in the range below t 20 mm 7 conclusion steel plates forming process is an important component of the ship production process particularly during fabrication of ship structure elements like bilge fore and aft peak and corrugated bulkheads yet due to its complexity it strongly relies on experienced craftsmen and their skills a thorough literature review presented in this paper reveals that research on the elastic plastic forming of steel plates remained quite sparse and that it is mainly driven by the application of fem in order to arrive at the optimal roller bending machine properties given such circumstances the main intention of the presented research is to address the influence of different assumed stress strain relationships to the analysis of the elastic plastic forming process particularly regarding bending moments bending forces and energy required to achieve desired plastic deformations applicability of the simplified one dimensional analytical models and different stress strain relationships is successfully verified by comparing the obtained results to the acquired experimental data as well as to more complex 2d plate theory in cases of four different steel grades for the plate thickness range between 10 and 50 mm as no significant discrepancies between different models were identified the application of the simplest elastic ideally plastic and elastic linearly plastic models are recommended for further application influence of bending radius amplification to the bending moments forces and energy is investigated pointing to the energy requirements as the most sensitive parameter particularly in the range of bending radii below 4000 mm along with that it is pointed out that the distance between rollers and roller radius determines an important aspect of the machine bendability range finally an important aspect of the plate spring back effect is analyzed in cases of four different materials in order to address residual stress recovery and permanent curvature as the final form taken by the plate being formed analysis of the ratio between maximum induced residual stress and yield strength as well as between permanent curvature and plate curvature during the process reveals particular sensitivity of the parameters for plate thicknesses below 20 mm however both parameters approach unit value as the plate thickness is amplified the importance of the presented research is reflected in the field of ship production technology as well as in the field of ship structural analysis and design in the former case the outlined methodology enables ship production engineers and researchers with simple and powerful method that can be successfully used as analytical tool for forming process planning ship production cost analysis bendability analysis and design of roller bending machines in order to achieve more reliable energy consumption control better product quality less fallout material and higher production rate in the latter case it contributes to the ship structural analysis and design as the residual stress distribution forms the very basis for further hull strength vibration fatigue and ultimate strength analysis that are crucial for the improvement of the lifelong ship service it is therefore of particular importance to further develop the presented theory in cases of four roller bending machines plate conical shapes elastic plastic forming of sections and plastic forming of

22454,in order to study the helical strakes suppression effects on the vibration riser triangle and circular sections helical strakes are proposed with the technology of dynamic mesh forced oscillation in steady flow of the riser with helical strakes in different cross section shapes at low reynolds number are numerically simulated the analysis is focused on the lock in range as well as the force status and trailing vortex structure under different values of amplitude a and oscillation frequency f e and draw comparisons to the bare riser s results research shows the lock in range will increase with the increase of amplitude ratio a d the riser with all three different shaped helical strakes have larger lock in range than bare riser before entering into the lock in region riser with different shaped helical strakes all have good effects on suppressing the vibrations of riser within and after lock in region riser with triangle and circular sections helical strakes have smaller lift force than that with rectangular section which reduced lift coefficient by 65 83 and 83 53 the trailing vortex structures of the riser with helical strakes are in strength three dimensional character inside the lock in region riser with triangle and circular sections have better suppression effect than that with rectangular section outside the lock in region riser with triangle section helical strakes has the best vortex suppression effect of which the influence on the flow field is greatest and the vortex induced force is least keywords helical strakes forced oscillation lock in vortex induced vibrations suppression 1 introduction marine risers are used in offshore oil gas development to connect submarine oil and gas fields to offshore bodies which can achieve deep water oil and gas production water and gas injection oil and gas exports and other functions montoya hernández et al 2014 under the action of ocean current the strong vortices are formed on both sides of the risers and fall off alternately causing vortex induced vibrations viv zhao et al 2013 frequency lock in occurs when the risers vibration frequency is close to the vortex shedding frequency blackburn and henderson 1996 at this point vortex induced force increases dramatically which even leads to risers fatigue damage thereby reducing service life gao et al 2016 weipao et al 2019 miao at al 2019 there exists fairings vandiver et al 2006 wang et al 2009 guide plates lou et al 2016 control rods wu et al 2012 helical strakes quen et al 2014a b holland et al 2017 and so on many vortex suppression devices with its characteristics of simple processing easy installation and low cost helical strakes are widely applied in the actual project allen et al 2008 huang 2011 quen et al 2014a b hong and shah 2018 at present a large number of studies on the vortex suppression effect of helical strakes have been carried out the efficiency of the viv suppression by means of helical strakes was proved in model test and numerical simulation trim et al 2005 analyzed the vertical and transverse responses of the long flexible riser model through experiments taking into account the different arrangement of helical strakes installed on the riser surface to suppress viv the results show that from the point of view of fatigue prevention the length of riser covered by helical strakes and the nature of flow are two main factors to be considered in the design of riser lubbad et al 2011 conducted a series of tests on viv reduction for a cylinder attached with round edged helical strakes three different parameters the number of starts strake diameter and strake pitch are used to define a configuration of round sectioned helical strakes the results show that the best configuration can reduce the oscillation amplitude relative to the bare cylinder case by 96 in the transverse direction and by 97 in the inline direction gao et al 2015 investigated the viv suppression using rectangular sectioned helical strakes for a flexible riser by experiment by analyzing the helical strakes at different heights it was found that the suppression efficiencies increased with the increase of the strake height quen et al 2014a b investigated the pitch and height of the strakes in suppressing the viv of long risers it is experimentally proven that the pitch of strakes contribute less in affecting the vibration of a cylinder while the height of strakes plays a major role in reducing the amplitude of vibration and an increased height will narrow the lock in region in 2018 quen et al 2018 performed experiment in the towing tank to investigate different helical strakes heights and pitches for five different configurations in two and three start helical strakes they confirmed that the number of helix is more sensitive in affecting the performance of helical strakes rather than the strakes height however many researchers paid much attention on the optimum configuration of the helical strakes pitch and height the best configurations for the viv suppression of a cylinder were pointed out a few researchers also studied the effects of the number of start screw heads and strakes coverage density on viv reduction while little attention was paid to the effect of the strake cross section shape on viv suppression in addition the structure of helical strakes involved in the existing research is single and the cross section shape is usually rectangular gao et al 2015 xu et al 2018a b quen et al 2014a b 2018 lubbad et al 2011 and xu et al 2018a b only conducted a series of tests on viv reduction for a cylinder attached with circular sectioned helical strakes to the best knowledge of the authors the investigation on the viv suppression for a riser fitted with different types of cross sectioned strakes is still needed moreover korkischko and meneghini 2010 and yeo and jones 2011 explored the effects of helical strakes with different geometric parameters on the vortex induced motion and selected the optimum structure of helical strakes huang 2011 researched the effects of triple starting helical grooves on the drag of fixed riser li and zhu 2016 went into the effect of helical strakes on vortex movement of double risers lou et al 2017 investigated the role of a stationary fairing in suppressing riser viv considering the effect of wake interference as we can see the current researches on helical strakes are mostly based on the fixed risers and rarely involve the vortex suppression effect of helical strakes during riser movement nevertheless the risers in practical engineering applications may have been in reciprocating motion all the time therefore it is important to study the vortex suppression effect of the helical strakes with the moveable riser considering that the profile of the helical strakes will affect the flow field to some extent and wear resistance of rectangular structure is poor while the circular section is closer to streamline and the triangular section can reduce the area of front contact with the fluid which are conducive to reducing the fluid resistance therefore two new types of helical strakes with triangular and circular cross section shapes are proposed the bare riser and risers with rectangular sectioned circular sectioned and triangular sectioned helical strakes are studied at different specific amplitude and different vibration frequencies when the reynolds number equal to 200 the impacts of helical strakes on the lock in range force status and vortex structure are discussed 2 model of helical strakes investigations by lubbad et al 2011 and quen et al 2014a b revealed that the helical strakes in the form of three start screw heads the lead s 10 the height h range of 5 d 15 d can achieve better suppression effect the helical strakes studied in the paper consists of three start screw heads the lead takes 10 and the height takes 15 d in which d is the model diameter of risers taking 0 02 m the main difference of the three sets of helical strakes is the cross section shapes that are rectangular circular and triangular as shown in fig 1 3 numerical method 3 1 governing equation the governing equation for incompressible viscous newtonian fluids is navier stokes equations the continuity equation and momentum equation in rectangular coordinates are

method is utilized to perform a discrete solution for the above governing equations its basic idea is to divide the flow field area to get a series of control volumes the node represents each control

adopted to deal with the pressure velocity coupling two order differential scheme is used in the computation of convection term two order center scheme is employed in the discretization of dissipation term 3 2 main parameters of forced vibration alternating wake vortices create transverse and longitudinal forces acting on the riser the equation of motion can be expressed as 6 m x c x k s x f x 7 m y c y k s y f y where m c and k s are mass structural damping and spring constants of risers per unit length respectively the correlation coefficients are 8 c y t f y t 1 2 ρ u c 2 p t sin α d s 1 2 ρ u c 2 9 c x t f x t 1 2 ρ u c 2 p t cos α d s 1 2 ρ u c 2 where f x t is the transverse force f y t is the longitudinal force s is the riser and fluid contact area α is the angle between fluid and stress u c is the fluid flowing velocity as the lateral force is generally an order of magnitude greater than the directional force the risers are more prone to lateral vibration bearman 1984 parkinson 1989 therefore this paper only considers the transverse vibration of the cylinder and only uses eq 9 as the governing equation of the riser in the simulation calculation when the vortex discharge frequency is locked on the oscillation frequency of the riser the linearized lift and transverse forced oscillation displacement y of the riser can be expressed as 10 f y t f 0 s i n 2 π f e t ϕ 11 y t a sin 2 π f e t where f 0 is the lift amplitude a is the vibrational amplitude f e is the vibrational frequency t is the movement time ϕ is the phase angle between lift and displacement of cylinder to make the calculation more universal apply dimensionless method to the vibration amplitudes and frequencies by a d and f e f s with f s is the vortex shedding frequency of stationary risers in this paper the forced oscillation of riser with a d 0 2 and 0 4 amplitude ratios is simulated the corresponding amplitude ratios and frequencies are shown in table 1 3 3 computational domain and boundary conditions as fig 2 shows take 100d 20d 10d as computational domain where riser center is 20d from the inlet boundary 80d from the outlet boundary 10d from the front and back boundary respectively spanwise length is equal to the riser height 10d the front of the computational domain is set as the velocity inlet the flow direction is the positive x axis and velocity is 0 01 m s the back is set as the pressure outlet ignoring the longitudinal velocity gradient the top and the bottom and the sides are set as symmetry boundaries the surface of the riser is set as no slip wall boundary 4 mesh generation and model validation fig 3 shows the mesh generation schematics of the overall computational domain xoy plane and local around the riser as shown the riser near field mesh is encrypted the height of the first mesh at the wall meets y 1 the area within 5d before and after the riser center is taken as the movement area and set as moving mesh while the rest is static grid moving and stationary meshes are separated by slip plane the update of moving mesh adopts dynamic method sst k ω turbulence model is chosen for solving the turbulence model combines the advantages of the k ω model in near wall calculations and the advantages of k ε model in far field calculations which is suitable for the needs of simulating the problems such as the backward vortex in the risers the flow separation and the detail structure of the wake near field menter 1994 to verify mesh distribution and calculate model reliability three different mesh distributions are used to calculate the flow around a stationary riser as the reynolds number does not affect vortex shedding and the performance of helical strakes korkischko et al 2007 therefore this paper studies the case of low reynolds number re 200 table 2 shows mesh parameters and the comparison of the calculated results with the literature s strobel numbers st f s d u note that meshⅱand meshⅲ results are in good agreement with the values calculated by meneghini and bearman 1995 and stewart et al 2005 and both meet the calculation accuracy requirements considering the total number of meshes and computational efficiency the meshⅱis selected to do related numerical analysis to further verify the reliability of moving mesh fig 4 shows the lock in range drawn by meneghini and bearman 1995 for a reynolds number of 200 and different amplitude ratios a d 0 6 and frequency ratios f e f s the square marked in fig 4 is the calculation results of this paper other symbols and curves are the literature experimental results from the comparison we can see the calculation results are basically consistent with the literature values when a d 0 2 f e f s 0 85 0 95 1 05 the vibrating cylinder is locked and f e f s 0 70 0 75 1 12 1 20 is not locked when a d 0 4 the lower limit of locking frequency ratio of cylindrical oscillation is about 0 75 it shows that the moving mesh model has high reliability and transverse vibration of risers can be trapped 5 results and analysis 5 1 forced oscillations of riser under different a d 5 1 1 riser response and lock in phenomenon fig 5 is the lift coefficient time history curves of bare riser and rise with rectangular helical strakes for frequency ratio f e f s 0 75 0 85 1 05 1 20 and amplitude ratio a d equal to 0 2 before entering the lock in region and jumping out of the lock in region the lift coefficient amplitude of the riser with helical strakes is smaller than that of the bare riser and the oscillation frequency is also reduced the lift coefficient curves of the two risers have obvious beat frequency characteristics which is due to the interaction of oscillation frequency f e and the vortex shedding frequency f s of the riser when f e f s 0 75 oscillation frequency f e is the main frequency for oscillation of two risers as the frequency ratio increased to 1 20 the main control frequency has been transformed to vortex shedding frequency f s the combination of these two frequencies results in the beat frequency characteristics of lift coefficient inside the lock in region there is no obvious beat behaviour in the lift coefficient curves but in a stable oscillation state at this time the vortex discharge frequency of the riser changes from f s to the oscillation frequency f e and the vortices is emitted at the fixed frequency f e in a certain range when f e f s 0 85 both risers are locked the lift coefficient of risers with helical strakes is smaller than bare riser when f e f s 1 05 the bare riser is locked while the riser with helical strakes is not locked this shows that the helical strakes have certain vortex suppression effect in fig 6 lift coefficient time histories for frequency f e f s 0 70 0 75 1 05 1 20 and amplitude ratio a d equal to 0 4 are shown we can see the beating pattern and lock in phenomenon of lift coefficient similar to that of a d 0 2 however the difference is that the bare riser has entered the lock in state at f e f s 0 75 and is still in the lock in region at f e f s 1 05 which indicates that the lock in range increases with the increase of oscillation amplitude however not all the upper and lower limits have obvious changes relatively speaking the lower limit is more obvious than the upper limit that is the locking range is not symmetrical with f e f s 1 as the central line which is consistent with the conclusion of meneghini and bearman 1995 the riser with helical strakes is always in lock in state for any of the frequencies test it shows that the wake vortex shedding is mainly caused by the forced oscillation of the riser itself because of the large amplitude and the auxiliary effect of the helical strakes and the vortex shedding is locked at a given frequency 5 1 2 vortex shedding modes fig 7 shows the vorticity contours of bare riser and riser with rectangular helical strakes at frequency ratio f e f s 0 85 1 20 and amplitude ratio a d equal to 0 2 it can be seen from the this figure that the vortex structures of the two riser wakes are in the form of 2s mode but the distribution of the vorticity contours is more regular inside the lock in region at the same frequency ratio the wake vortex shedding point of the riser with helical strakes is farther than that of the bare riser the relative distance between the vortex cores is larger and the vortex shedding is slower it shows that the helical strakes have a certain inhibitory effect on the wake vortex shedding in fig 8 the case when frequency ratio f e f s 0 75 1 20 and amplitude ratio a d equal to 0 4 is shown it can be seen that the vorticity contours of the two risers gradually become irregular with the increase of the amplitude inside the lock in region f e f s 0 75 the lateral spacing of the vortices increases fig 8 c compare to bare riser fig 8 a which due to the vortex suppression effect of the helical strakes outside the lock in region f e f s 1 20 a p s mode of vortex appears in the wake of a riser with helical strakes from fig 8 d it can be seen that a single vortex at one side of the oscillating riser while a pair of vortices is emitted from the other side the structure of the vortices in this form is the same as that in williamson and roshko 1988 experiments 5 2 response of the riser with different strakes cross section 5 2 1 aerodynamic coefficients the lift coefficients of the bare riser and risers fitted with three types of cross sectioned helical strakes are fourier transformed the lock in intervals of the rectangular sectioned circular sectioned and triangular sectioned straked risers are in the range of f e f s 0 75 0 95 0 85 1 12 and 0 75 1 12 respectively the risers lift coefficients with time curve at f e f s 0 70 and 0 85 are given in fig 9 as illustrated in fig 9 a when the vibrational frequency is not within the lock in range the lift coefficients show obvious beat frequency characteristics this is because the vortex shedding at this time is not only affected by the vibrational frequency f e but also affected by the vortex shedding frequency f s the combined effect of both results in the appearance of beat frequency characteristics in the lift coefficients from fig 9 b we can see that the lift coefficients show obvious beat frequency characteristics when the vibrational frequency is in the lock in range instead it s a sine curve that changes over time this is because the frequency of vortex shedding has been transformed from the original f s to the vibrational frequency f e and will remain within a certain range the risers coefficients of bare riser and risers fitted with different cross sectioned helical strakes at different vibrational frequencies are drawn in fig 10 fig 10 a shows the comparison of the amplitudes of the lift coefficients at different vibrational frequencies as can be seen from the fig the lift coefficients amplitudes of the straked risers decrease briefly before entering the lock in range then increase as the force vibrational frequency increases rectangular sectioned straked riser in the non locking range has a good viv suppression effect when the f e f s 0 75 the amplitude of the lift coefficient decreases by 77 71 circular sectioned and triangular sectioned straked risers have good viv suppression effects throughout the vibrational frequency range when the f e f s 1 05 the lifting amplitude of the circular sectioned straked riser is reduced by 83 53 and that of the triangular sectioned straked riser is reduced by 65 83 when the f e f s 1 12 the number is 59 93 and 57 69 respectively fig 10 b is the comparison of the average of the drag coefficients at different vibrational frequencies it can be found that the drag coefficients of the rectangular and triangular strakes risers increase at f e f s 0 75 this is due to the two risers at this time begin to enter the locked range the drag coefficient of the circular strakes riser increases at f e f s 0 85 which shows that the frequency circular strakes riser into the locked range is higher than the rectangular and triangular strakes risers the drag coefficients of the three risers are all higher than that of the bare riser this is because the presence of the helical strakes increases the contact area with the fluid resulting in increased drag the lift coefficient power spectral density diagrams of bare riser and risers fitted with different cross sectioned helical strakes before and after locking are shown in fig 11 when the f e f s 0 70 bare riser and straked risers are in front of the lock in range there are two obvious peaks in the power spectrum one of which is the vortex shedding frequency and the other is the vibrational frequency the peak and corresponding frequency of the three risers are significantly lower than those of the bare riser which illustrates the vortex shedding energy is weakened and the vibrational frequency is reduced when the f e f s 0 85 there is only one peak in the power spectrum of the bare riser and straked risers that indicates the vibrational frequency is the same as the eddy frequency this shows that at this time the risers have been completely induced vibration in a locked state when the f e f s 1 20 risers are out of the lock in range and two peaks appear on the power spectrum again by comparison of three different cross sectioned straked risers it is found that the peak power spectra of triangular and circular side plate risers are smaller than those of rectangular sectioned straked riser at the same frequency ratio this shows that the two new types of helical strakes presented in this paper can induce less vortex induced force and the vortex intensity is weakened 5 2 2 vortex shedding modes the three dimensional instantaneous vortex structure diagrams of bare riser and risers fitted with different cross sectioned helical strakes when f e f s 0 85 and f e f s 1 20 are presented in fig 12 the two frequency ratios corresponding to the locked and unlocked states of the oscillating riser respectively as can be seen from the diagrams the tail vortex of the bare riser is parallel to the riser and axial cross sectional shape is almost the same the vortex structure distribution of the riser in the locked state is more regular than that in the unlocked state inside the lock in region the tail vortex of the straked risers shows a state of torsion and bending along the length of the risers and the front and back are connected to each other which has obvious three dimensional characteristics outside the lock in region the three dimensional characteristics of the flow field are not obvious this is related to the interaction between oscillation frequency f e and vortex shedding frequency f s nobari and naderan 2006 also found that similar vorticity contours difference between locked and unlocked states fig 13 is vorticity contour map of bare riser and risers fitted with different cross sectioned helical strakes at different times during one vibration period at f e f s 0 85 the map shows that bare riser and straked risers vortex distribution are regular in the lock in range called 2s pattern this is because the vibrational frequency is the sole dominant frequency at this time playing the main control role in vortex shedding the vortex forms of circular sectioned and triangular sectioned straked risers are larger further from each other and shedding slowest which reveals that the two straked risers have a great influence on the wake field and better viv suppression effects fig 14 is vorticity contour map of bare riser and risers fitted with different cross sectioned helical strakes at different times during one vibration period at f e f s 1 20 the vortex of the bare riser and three risers with strakes are still being dispensed in 2s pattern when out of lock range but due to the interaction between eddy frequency and oscillation frequency the vorticity contour outside the locking interval is more irregular than the distribution within the locking interval vortex morphological changes staggering with each other and stretching towards the direction of wake in addition the wake centerline of bare riser and three strakes risers has a certain angle to the horizontal direction the vortex shedding trajectory is not horizontal distribution behind the risers with a certain angle to the horizontal direction and swing up and down with time off this is due to the fact that there is a low frequency eddy frequency at the lift coefficient curve besides the original high frequency oscillation frequency as compared to others the vortex shedding of the triangular strakes riser has tended to be parallel proving that it has the greatest impact on the wake field this is consistent with the lowest lift coefficient amplitude described above 6 conclusion based on the cfd theories the transverse forced vibrations of bare riser and risers fitted with different cross sectioned helical strakes are numerically simulated when the reynolds number equal to 200 the stress characteristic and vortex structure under fixed amplitude and different vibrational frequencies are analyzed below conclusions are drawn when the amplitude ratio a d of riser is 0 2 the lock in phenomena occur on bare riser and riser with helical strakes within a certain range of oscillation frequency as the amplitude of oscillation increases to 0 4 the frequency range of lock in phenomena of bare riser is obviously increased while the riser with helical strakes is always in the locked state this is because the amplitude is too large at this time and the helical strake intensifies the oscillation leading to the vortex shedding lock on a given oscillation frequency compared with the bare riser lock in range of straked risers is increased the frequency with which the rectangular sectioned and triangular sectioned straked risers enter the lock in state is reduced and the frequency with which the triangular sectioned and circular sectioned straked risers out of lock in state is increased in the case of fixed frequency ratio f e f s 0 2 and f e f s 0 4 the wake vortices of the bare riser and the riser with helical strakes are the form of 2s mode inside the lock in region and the distribution of vorticity contours is more regular than that outside the lock in range after the lock in range the p s mode appears in the wake vortex structure when the amplitude ratio a d of the riser with helical strakes is 0 4 when the amplitude ratio a d is fixed at 0 2 the rectangular sectioned straked riser has better viv suppression effect before entering the lock in range the largest reduction of lift coefficient is up to 77 71 while the effect in and out of the lock in range is not obvious the circular sectioned and triangular sectioned straked risers can effectively reduce the lift coefficient throughout the vibration frequency range the largest decline in the lock in range is up to 83 53 and 65 83 respectively this shows these two strakes can significantly improve the safety of the risers compared to rectangular sectioned strakes meanwhile the drag coefficients of the straked risers are increased the vortex structures of straked risers present a more obvious three dimensional characteristics and vortex shedding is performed in 2s mode throughout the vibrational frequency range within the lock in range the viv suppression effect of the circular sectioned and triangular sectioned strakes are better than the rectangular sectioned one after jumping out of the lock in range the triangular sectioned strakes have the greatest influence on the wake field and the smallest vortex force which indicates the best viv suppression effect acknowledgements the authors

22454,in order to study the helical strakes suppression effects on the vibration riser triangle and circular sections helical strakes are proposed with the technology of dynamic mesh forced oscillation in steady flow of the riser with helical strakes in different cross section shapes at low reynolds number are numerically simulated the analysis is focused on the lock in range as well as the force status and trailing vortex structure under different values of amplitude a and oscillation frequency f e and draw comparisons to the bare riser s results research shows the lock in range will increase with the increase of amplitude ratio a d the riser with all three different shaped helical strakes have larger lock in range than bare riser before entering into the lock in region riser with different shaped helical strakes all have good effects on suppressing the vibrations of riser within and after lock in region riser with triangle and circular sections helical strakes have smaller lift force than that with rectangular section which reduced lift coefficient by 65 83 and 83 53 the trailing vortex structures of the riser with helical strakes are in strength three dimensional character inside the lock in region riser with triangle and circular sections have better suppression effect than that with rectangular section outside the lock in region riser with triangle section helical strakes has the best vortex suppression effect of which the influence on the flow field is greatest and the vortex induced force is least keywords helical strakes forced oscillation lock in vortex induced vibrations suppression 1 introduction marine risers are used in offshore oil gas development to connect submarine oil and gas fields to offshore bodies which can achieve deep water oil and gas production water and gas injection oil and gas exports and other functions montoya hernández et al 2014 under the action of ocean current the strong vortices are formed on both sides of the risers and fall off alternately causing vortex induced vibrations viv zhao et al 2013 frequency lock in occurs when the risers vibration frequency is close to the vortex shedding frequency blackburn and henderson 1996 at this point vortex induced force increases dramatically which even leads to risers fatigue damage thereby reducing service life gao et al 2016 weipao et al 2019 miao at al 2019 there exists fairings vandiver et al 2006 wang et al 2009 guide plates lou et al 2016 control rods wu et al 2012 helical strakes quen et al 2014a b holland et al 2017 and so on many vortex suppression devices with its characteristics of simple processing easy installation and low cost helical strakes are widely applied in the actual project allen et al 2008 huang 2011 quen et al 2014a b hong and shah 2018 at present a large number of studies on the vortex suppression effect of helical strakes have been carried out the efficiency of the viv suppression by means of helical strakes was proved in model test and numerical simulation trim et al 2005 analyzed the vertical and transverse responses of the long flexible riser model through experiments taking into account the different arrangement of helical strakes installed on the riser surface to suppress viv the results show that from the point of view of fatigue prevention the length of riser covered by helical strakes and the nature of flow are two main factors to be considered in the design of riser lubbad et al 2011 conducted a series of tests on viv reduction for a cylinder attached with round edged helical strakes three different parameters the number of starts strake diameter and strake pitch are used to define a configuration of round sectioned helical strakes the results show that the best configuration can reduce the oscillation amplitude relative to the bare cylinder case by 96 in the transverse direction and by 97 in the inline direction gao et al 2015 investigated the viv suppression using rectangular sectioned helical strakes for a flexible riser by experiment by analyzing the helical strakes at different heights it was found that the suppression efficiencies increased with the increase of the strake height quen et al 2014a b investigated the pitch and height of the strakes in suppressing the viv of long risers it is experimentally proven that the pitch of strakes contribute less in affecting the vibration of a cylinder while the height of strakes plays a major role in reducing the amplitude of vibration and an increased height will narrow the lock in region in 2018 quen et al 2018 performed experiment in the towing tank to investigate different helical strakes heights and pitches for five different configurations in two and three start helical strakes they confirmed that the number of helix is more sensitive in affecting the performance of helical strakes rather than the strakes height however many researchers paid much attention on the optimum configuration of the helical strakes pitch and height the best configurations for the viv suppression of a cylinder were pointed out a few researchers also studied the effects of the number of start screw heads and strakes coverage density on viv reduction while little attention was paid to the effect of the strake cross section shape on viv suppression in addition the structure of helical strakes involved in the existing research is single and the cross section shape is usually rectangular gao et al 2015 xu et al 2018a b quen et al 2014a b 2018 lubbad et al 2011 and xu et al 2018a b only conducted a series of tests on viv reduction for a cylinder attached with circular sectioned helical strakes to the best knowledge of the authors the investigation on the viv suppression for a riser fitted with different types of cross sectioned strakes is still needed moreover korkischko and meneghini 2010 and yeo and jones 2011 explored the effects of helical strakes with different geometric parameters on the vortex induced motion and selected the optimum structure of helical strakes huang 2011 researched the effects of triple starting helical grooves on the drag of fixed riser li and zhu 2016 went into the effect of helical strakes on vortex movement of double risers lou et al 2017 investigated the role of a stationary fairing in suppressing riser viv considering the effect of wake interference as we can see the current researches on helical strakes are mostly based on the fixed risers and rarely involve the vortex suppression effect of helical strakes during riser movement nevertheless the risers in practical engineering applications may have been in reciprocating motion all the time therefore it is important to study the vortex suppression effect of the helical strakes with the moveable riser considering that the profile of the helical strakes will affect the flow field to some extent and wear resistance of rectangular structure is poor while the circular section is closer to streamline and the triangular section can reduce the area of front contact with the fluid which are conducive to reducing the fluid resistance therefore two new types of helical strakes with triangular and circular cross section shapes are proposed the bare riser and risers with rectangular sectioned circular sectioned and triangular sectioned helical strakes are studied at different specific amplitude and different vibration frequencies when the reynolds number equal to 200 the impacts of helical strakes on the lock in range force status and vortex structure are discussed 2 model of helical strakes investigations by lubbad et al 2011 and quen et al 2014a b revealed that the helical strakes in the form of three start screw heads the lead s 10 the height h range of 5 d 15 d can achieve better suppression effect the helical strakes studied in the paper consists of three start screw heads the lead takes 10 and the height takes 15 d in which d is the model diameter of risers taking 0 02 m the main difference of the three sets of helical strakes is the cross section shapes that are rectangular circular and triangular as shown in fig 1 3 numerical method 3 1 governing equation the governing equation for incompressible viscous newtonian fluids is navier stokes equations the continuity equation and momentum equation in rectangular coordinates are

method is utilized to perform a discrete solution for the above governing equations its basic idea is to divide the flow field area to get a series of control volumes the node represents each control

adopted to deal with the pressure velocity coupling two order differential scheme is used in the computation of convection term two order center scheme is employed in the discretization of dissipation term 3 2 main parameters of forced vibration alternating wake vortices create transverse and longitudinal forces acting on the riser the equation of motion can be expressed as 6 m x c x k s x f x 7 m y c y k s y f y where m c and k s are mass structural damping and spring constants of risers per unit length respectively the correlation coefficients are 8 c y t f y t 1 2 ρ u c 2 p t sin α d s 1 2 ρ u c 2 9 c x t f x t 1 2 ρ u c 2 p t cos α d s 1 2 ρ u c 2 where f x t is the transverse force f y t is the longitudinal force s is the riser and fluid contact area α is the angle between fluid and stress u c is the fluid flowing velocity as the lateral force is generally an order of magnitude greater than the directional force the risers are more prone to lateral vibration bearman 1984 parkinson 1989 therefore this paper only considers the transverse vibration of the cylinder and only uses eq 9 as the governing equation of the riser in the simulation calculation when the vortex discharge frequency is locked on the oscillation frequency of the riser the linearized lift and transverse forced oscillation displacement y of the riser can be expressed as 10 f y t f 0 s i n 2 π f e t ϕ 11 y t a sin 2 π f e t where f 0 is the lift amplitude a is the vibrational amplitude f e is the vibrational frequency t is the movement time ϕ is the phase angle between lift and displacement of cylinder to make the calculation more universal apply dimensionless method to the vibration amplitudes and frequencies by a d and f e f s with f s is the vortex shedding frequency of stationary risers in this paper the forced oscillation of riser with a d 0 2 and 0 4 amplitude ratios is simulated the corresponding amplitude ratios and frequencies are shown in table 1 3 3 computational domain and boundary conditions as fig 2 shows take 100d 20d 10d as computational domain where riser center is 20d from the inlet boundary 80d from the outlet boundary 10d from the front and back boundary respectively spanwise length is equal to the riser height 10d the front of the computational domain is set as the velocity inlet the flow direction is the positive x axis and velocity is 0 01 m s the back is set as the pressure outlet ignoring the longitudinal velocity gradient the top and the bottom and the sides are set as symmetry boundaries the surface of the riser is set as no slip wall boundary 4 mesh generation and model validation fig 3 shows the mesh generation schematics of the overall computational domain xoy plane and local around the riser as shown the riser near field mesh is encrypted the height of the first mesh at the wall meets y 1 the area within 5d before and after the riser center is taken as the movement area and set as moving mesh while the rest is static grid moving and stationary meshes are separated by slip plane the update of moving mesh adopts dynamic method sst k ω turbulence model is chosen for solving the turbulence model combines the advantages of the k ω model in near wall calculations and the advantages of k ε model in far field calculations which is suitable for the needs of simulating the problems such as the backward vortex in the risers the flow separation and the detail structure of the wake near field menter 1994 to verify mesh distribution and calculate model reliability three different mesh distributions are used to calculate the flow around a stationary riser as the reynolds number does not affect vortex shedding and the performance of helical strakes korkischko et al 2007 therefore this paper studies the case of low reynolds number re 200 table 2 shows mesh parameters and the comparison of the calculated results with the literature s strobel numbers st f s d u note that meshⅱand meshⅲ results are in good agreement with the values calculated by meneghini and bearman 1995 and stewart et al 2005 and both meet the calculation accuracy requirements considering the total number of meshes and computational efficiency the meshⅱis selected to do related numerical analysis to further verify the reliability of moving mesh fig 4 shows the lock in range drawn by meneghini and bearman 1995 for a reynolds number of 200 and different amplitude ratios a d 0 6 and frequency ratios f e f s the square marked in fig 4 is the calculation results of this paper other symbols and curves are the literature experimental results from the comparison we can see the calculation results are basically consistent with the literature values when a d 0 2 f e f s 0 85 0 95 1 05 the vibrating cylinder is locked and f e f s 0 70 0 75 1 12 1 20 is not locked when a d 0 4 the lower limit of locking frequency ratio of cylindrical oscillation is about 0 75 it shows that the moving mesh model has high reliability and transverse vibration of risers can be trapped 5 results and analysis 5 1 forced oscillations of riser under different a d 5 1 1 riser response and lock in phenomenon fig 5 is the lift coefficient time history curves of bare riser and rise with rectangular helical strakes for frequency ratio f e f s 0 75 0 85 1 05 1 20 and amplitude ratio a d equal to 0 2 before entering the lock in region and jumping out of the lock in region the lift coefficient amplitude of the riser with helical strakes is smaller than that of the bare riser and the oscillation frequency is also reduced the lift coefficient curves of the two risers have obvious beat frequency characteristics which is due to the interaction of oscillation frequency f e and the vortex shedding frequency f s of the riser when f e f s 0 75 oscillation frequency f e is the main frequency for oscillation of two risers as the frequency ratio increased to 1 20 the main control frequency has been transformed to vortex shedding frequency f s the combination of these two frequencies results in the beat frequency characteristics of lift coefficient inside the lock in region there is no obvious beat behaviour in the lift coefficient curves but in a stable oscillation state at this time the vortex discharge frequency of the riser changes from f s to the oscillation frequency f e and the vortices is emitted at the fixed frequency f e in a certain range when f e f s 0 85 both risers are locked the lift coefficient of risers with helical strakes is smaller than bare riser when f e f s 1 05 the bare riser is locked while the riser with helical strakes is not locked this shows that the helical strakes have certain vortex suppression effect in fig 6 lift coefficient time histories for frequency f e f s 0 70 0 75 1 05 1 20 and amplitude ratio a d equal to 0 4 are shown we can see the beating pattern and lock in phenomenon of lift coefficient similar to that of a d 0 2 however the difference is that the bare riser has entered the lock in state at f e f s 0 75 and is still in the lock in region at f e f s 1 05 which indicates that the lock in range increases with the increase of oscillation amplitude however not all the upper and lower limits have obvious changes relatively speaking the lower limit is more obvious than the upper limit that is the locking range is not symmetrical with f e f s 1 as the central line which is consistent with the conclusion of meneghini and bearman 1995 the riser with helical strakes is always in lock in state for any of the frequencies test it shows that the wake vortex shedding is mainly caused by the forced oscillation of the riser itself because of the large amplitude and the auxiliary effect of the helical strakes and the vortex shedding is locked at a given frequency 5 1 2 vortex shedding modes fig 7 shows the vorticity contours of bare riser and riser with rectangular helical strakes at frequency ratio f e f s 0 85 1 20 and amplitude ratio a d equal to 0 2 it can be seen from the this figure that the vortex structures of the two riser wakes are in the form of 2s mode but the distribution of the vorticity contours is more regular inside the lock in region at the same frequency ratio the wake vortex shedding point of the riser with helical strakes is farther than that of the bare riser the relative distance between the vortex cores is larger and the vortex shedding is slower it shows that the helical strakes have a certain inhibitory effect on the wake vortex shedding in fig 8 the case when frequency ratio f e f s 0 75 1 20 and amplitude ratio a d equal to 0 4 is shown it can be seen that the vorticity contours of the two risers gradually become irregular with the increase of the amplitude inside the lock in region f e f s 0 75 the lateral spacing of the vortices increases fig 8 c compare to bare riser fig 8 a which due to the vortex suppression effect of the helical strakes outside the lock in region f e f s 1 20 a p s mode of vortex appears in the wake of a riser with helical strakes from fig 8 d it can be seen that a single vortex at one side of the oscillating riser while a pair of vortices is emitted from the other side the structure of the vortices in this form is the same as that in williamson and roshko 1988 experiments 5 2 response of the riser with different strakes cross section 5 2 1 aerodynamic coefficients the lift coefficients of the bare riser and risers fitted with three types of cross sectioned helical strakes are fourier transformed the lock in intervals of the rectangular sectioned circular sectioned and triangular sectioned straked risers are in the range of f e f s 0 75 0 95 0 85 1 12 and 0 75 1 12 respectively the risers lift coefficients with time curve at f e f s 0 70 and 0 85 are given in fig 9 as illustrated in fig 9 a when the vibrational frequency is not within the lock in range the lift coefficients show obvious beat frequency characteristics this is because the vortex shedding at this time is not only affected by the vibrational frequency f e but also affected by the vortex shedding frequency f s the combined effect of both results in the appearance of beat frequency characteristics in the lift coefficients from fig 9 b we can see that the lift coefficients show obvious beat frequency characteristics when the vibrational frequency is in the lock in range instead it s a sine curve that changes over time this is because the frequency of vortex shedding has been transformed from the original f s to the vibrational frequency f e and will remain within a certain range the risers coefficients of bare riser and risers fitted with different cross sectioned helical strakes at different vibrational frequencies are drawn in fig 10 fig 10 a shows the comparison of the amplitudes of the lift coefficients at different vibrational frequencies as can be seen from the fig the lift coefficients amplitudes of the straked risers decrease briefly before entering the lock in range then increase as the force vibrational frequency increases rectangular sectioned straked riser in the non locking range has a good viv suppression effect when the f e f s 0 75 the amplitude of the lift coefficient decreases by 77 71 circular sectioned and triangular sectioned straked risers have good viv suppression effects throughout the vibrational frequency range when the f e f s 1 05 the lifting amplitude of the circular sectioned straked riser is reduced by 83 53 and that of the triangular sectioned straked riser is reduced by 65 83 when the f e f s 1 12 the number is 59 93 and 57 69 respectively fig 10 b is the comparison of the average of the drag coefficients at different vibrational frequencies it can be found that the drag coefficients of the rectangular and triangular strakes risers increase at f e f s 0 75 this is due to the two risers at this time begin to enter the locked range the drag coefficient of the circular strakes riser increases at f e f s 0 85 which shows that the frequency circular strakes riser into the locked range is higher than the rectangular and triangular strakes risers the drag coefficients of the three risers are all higher than that of the bare riser this is because the presence of the helical strakes increases the contact area with the fluid resulting in increased drag the lift coefficient power spectral density diagrams of bare riser and risers fitted with different cross sectioned helical strakes before and after locking are shown in fig 11 when the f e f s 0 70 bare riser and straked risers are in front of the lock in range there are two obvious peaks in the power spectrum one of which is the vortex shedding frequency and the other is the vibrational frequency the peak and corresponding frequency of the three risers are significantly lower than those of the bare riser which illustrates the vortex shedding energy is weakened and the vibrational frequency is reduced when the f e f s 0 85 there is only one peak in the power spectrum of the bare riser and straked risers that indicates the vibrational frequency is the same as the eddy frequency this shows that at this time the risers have been completely induced vibration in a locked state when the f e f s 1 20 risers are out of the lock in range and two peaks appear on the power spectrum again by comparison of three different cross sectioned straked risers it is found that the peak power spectra of triangular and circular side plate risers are smaller than those of rectangular sectioned straked riser at the same frequency ratio this shows that the two new types of helical strakes presented in this paper can induce less vortex induced force and the vortex intensity is weakened 5 2 2 vortex shedding modes the three dimensional instantaneous vortex structure diagrams of bare riser and risers fitted with different cross sectioned helical strakes when f e f s 0 85 and f e f s 1 20 are presented in fig 12 the two frequency ratios corresponding to the locked and unlocked states of the oscillating riser respectively as can be seen from the diagrams the tail vortex of the bare riser is parallel to the riser and axial cross sectional shape is almost the same the vortex structure distribution of the riser in the locked state is more regular than that in the unlocked state inside the lock in region the tail vortex of the straked risers shows a state of torsion and bending along the length of the risers and the front and back are connected to each other which has obvious three dimensional characteristics outside the lock in region the three dimensional characteristics of the flow field are not obvious this is related to the interaction between oscillation frequency f e and vortex shedding frequency f s nobari and naderan 2006 also found that similar vorticity contours difference between locked and unlocked states fig 13 is vorticity contour map of bare riser and risers fitted with different cross sectioned helical strakes at different times during one vibration period at f e f s 0 85 the map shows that bare riser and straked risers vortex distribution are regular in the lock in range called 2s pattern this is because the vibrational frequency is the sole dominant frequency at this time playing the main control role in vortex shedding the vortex forms of circular sectioned and triangular sectioned straked risers are larger further from each other and shedding slowest which reveals that the two straked risers have a great influence on the wake field and better viv suppression effects fig 14 is vorticity contour map of bare riser and risers fitted with different cross sectioned helical strakes at different times during one vibration period at f e f s 1 20 the vortex of the bare riser and three risers with strakes are still being dispensed in 2s pattern when out of lock range but due to the interaction between eddy frequency and oscillation frequency the vorticity contour outside the locking interval is more irregular than the distribution within the locking interval vortex morphological changes staggering with each other and stretching towards the direction of wake in addition the wake centerline of bare riser and three strakes risers has a certain angle to the horizontal direction the vortex shedding trajectory is not horizontal distribution behind the risers with a certain angle to the horizontal direction and swing up and down with time off this is due to the fact that there is a low frequency eddy frequency at the lift coefficient curve besides the original high frequency oscillation frequency as compared to others the vortex shedding of the triangular strakes riser has tended to be parallel proving that it has the greatest impact on the wake field this is consistent with the lowest lift coefficient amplitude described above 6 conclusion based on the cfd theories the transverse forced vibrations of bare riser and risers fitted with different cross sectioned helical strakes are numerically simulated when the reynolds number equal to 200 the stress characteristic and vortex structure under fixed amplitude and different vibrational frequencies are analyzed below conclusions are drawn when the amplitude ratio a d of riser is 0 2 the lock in phenomena occur on bare riser and riser with helical strakes within a certain range of oscillation frequency as the amplitude of oscillation increases to 0 4 the frequency range of lock in phenomena of bare riser is obviously increased while the riser with helical strakes is always in the locked state this is because the amplitude is too large at this time and the helical strake intensifies the oscillation leading to the vortex shedding lock on a given oscillation frequency compared with the bare riser lock in range of straked risers is increased the frequency with which the rectangular sectioned and triangular sectioned straked risers enter the lock in state is reduced and the frequency with which the triangular sectioned and circular sectioned straked risers out of lock in state is increased in the case of fixed frequency ratio f e f s 0 2 and f e f s 0 4 the wake vortices of the bare riser and the riser with helical strakes are the form of 2s mode inside the lock in region and the distribution of vorticity contours is more regular than that outside the lock in range after the lock in range the p s mode appears in the wake vortex structure when the amplitude ratio a d of the riser with helical strakes is 0 4 when the amplitude ratio a d is fixed at 0 2 the rectangular sectioned straked riser has better viv suppression effect before entering the lock in range the largest reduction of lift coefficient is up to 77 71 while the effect in and out of the lock in range is not obvious the circular sectioned and triangular sectioned straked risers can effectively reduce the lift coefficient throughout the vibration frequency range the largest decline in the lock in range is up to 83 53 and 65 83 respectively this shows these two strakes can significantly improve the safety of the risers compared to rectangular sectioned strakes meanwhile the drag coefficients of the straked risers are increased the vortex structures of straked risers present a more obvious three dimensional characteristics and vortex shedding is performed in 2s mode throughout the vibrational frequency range within the lock in range the viv suppression effect of the circular sectioned and triangular sectioned strakes are better than the rectangular sectioned one after jumping out of the lock in range the triangular sectioned strakes have the greatest influence on the wake field and the smallest vortex force which indicates the best viv suppression effect acknowledgements the authors
