5615,the endangered formosan landlocked salmon that habitats only in chichiwan creek has been successfully rehabilitated in one of its tributaries yusheng creek however the stream fragmentation no surface streamflow seriously reduced the salmon population hampering the restoration work the surface water groundwater sw gw interactions in a 500 m reach were examined by installing 6 monitoring wells at 3 sites to record temperatures and groundwater levels at every 15 min for two months the automatic estimator of vflux and numerical model of vs2dh are used to quantify the streambed hydraulic characteristics along the reach it is found that the entire study reach is a losing stream and the fragmented reaches have significantly higher streambed vertical hydraulic conductivity vk compared to the perennial one the streambed vk at the up stream perennial reach increased by about double after a rainfall event probably resulting from the removal of fine grain in the streambed by the rainfall event although the fragmented reaches reflowed after the event streambed vk at the mid and down stream fragmented reaches decreased by about 75 and 50 respectively compared to the pre fragmented period the clogging layers formed by the remains of dead diatom deposited in the streambed during the fragmented period were very likely responsible for the decreased streambed vk the spatial and temporal variations of streambed vk influenced by hydrological conditions and even bioactivities within such a short distance reveal the complexity of sw gw interactions further studies about the forming processes of clogging layer and its effect on the hydraulic characteristic should be conducted to create a more holistic and reliable picture of interaction processes keywords surface water groundwater interaction heat transport modeling hydraulic conductivity clogging layer hyporheic zone 1 introduction the interaction processes of surface water sw and groundwater gw have been recognized as a fundamental but unique element of hydrological system and their influence on stream hydrology and ecosystem is significant there has been a dramatic rise in the number of relevant publications since 2006 cardenas 2015 once the streamflow ceases the channels are often flashy erosive and destructive leading to the operational and maintaining difficulties constantz et al 2001 however most of the studies regarding the intermittent or ephemeral streams are in the arid or semi arid areas stonestrom and constantz 2003 stream fragmentation owing to cease to flow condition in the humid subtropical climate was rarely documented it is particularly a crucial issue because the stream fragmentation in our study reach has threatened the survival of an endangered salmon chichiawan creek located at the mountain area in northeast taiwan is the only habitat for the formosan landlocked salmon oncorhynchus masou formosanus to reintroduce the salmon back to their historical habitat the upstream of yusheng creek a tributary of chichiawan creek is successful to restore the salmons fig 1 however partial reaches at the upstream of yusheng creek were observed to cease flow non periodically resulting in significant loss of the salmon population although the annual rainfall is 2400 mm liao 2016 the phenomenon of losing water from the channels should be directly associated with the interaction between stream and streambed however the underlying potential mechanism is unclear it is eager to clarify the interaction process and seek a strategy to maintain the steady flow in the channel and the stable habitat for the salmon sw and gw are tightly linked by the discharge of gw or circulation of sw through underlying sediments and the exchanges of fluxes between two systems are continuous and considerable their associated geochemical composition changes through these fluxes and the ecosystem of rivers is influenced by these interactions accordingly many works have focused increasing on the investigation of interaction processes between sw and gw in recent years the interactions between sw and gw are complex sophocleous 2002 boano et al 2014 cardenas 2015 hester et al 2017 and are driven by various geomorphologic and hydrogeologic controls woessner 2000 kasahara and wondzell 2003 storey et al 2003 gooseff et al 2005 tonina and buffington 2009 fox et al 2014 schmadel et al 2017 among the research within stream aquifer systems spatial and temporal variations of streambed hydraulic characteristics is always an issue to be discussed and their dynamic processes such as sedimentation and bioclogging are essential to changes in channel geometry water table elevation composition of streambed and flux through streambed brunner et al 2009 hatch et al 2010 tonina et al 2014 sebok et al 2014 newcomer et al 2016 fox et al 2018 in order to understanding and responding to changes to sw and gw interactions a wide range of techniques have been developed to quantify gw and sw interaction in its various spatial and temporal scales kalbus et al 2006 rosenberry and labaugh 2008 these methods include the measurement of hydraulic head gradient differential stream flow measurements seepage meters and environmental tracers among these methods temperature is also commonly used to study physical processes of gw and sw interaction as it is a conservative tracer stonestrom and constantz 2003 this has been made for a period longer than 50 years since the heat tracer was first applied to evaluate flow directions and quantify the exchange fluxes between rivers and streambeds bredehoeft and papadopulos 1965 suzuki 1960 stallman 1965 lapham 1989 anderson 2005 constantz 2008 rau et al 2014 the usefulness of near surface temperature data as an indicator of natural heat flow were discovered and linked quantitatively to water flow through the soil zone cartwright 1974 taniguchi 1993 taniguchi and sharma 1993 and the streambed silliman et al 1995 the natural temperature variation of rivers allows the water fluxes into or out of the hyporheic zone and or groundwater system to be calculated conant 2004 lautz and fanelli 2008 bhaskar et al 2012 with growing confidence in the methods developed use of sediment thermal data to determine reasonable groundwater flux rates is likely to be an effective field method that is quicker and more cost effective than setting up piezometers or seepage meters schmidt et al 2011 as a further step towards the goal of automated flux calculations from thermal records the hatch and the keery methods hatch et al 2006 keery et al 2007 were included in the code ex stream swanson and cardenas 2011 and in the code vflux gordon et al 2012 which included comprehensive error and sensitivity analysis numerical methods for interpreting streambed temperature data are also commonly applied and numerous examples are found in 1 d lapham 1987 and in 2 d using vs2dh or other numerical codes anibas et al 2009 roshan et al 2012 cuthbert and mackay 2013 in this study the main objective is to clarify the interaction processes between the stream and underlying streambed in the subtropical alpine catchment in central taiwan using the temperature and water level data the monitoring wells were installed along the yusheng creek and both water levels and temperature data of stream and streambed were measured from up to downstream extents the collected data were inputted into the 1 d heat transport equation of vflux to analytically solve the water fluxes at each monitoring location then the variations in the vertical component of water flux are compared with the solutions obtained from the numerical model of vs2dh the vertical hydraulic conductivities vk of streambed are estimated with the river stages and gw levels finally the interactions between gw and sw is evaluated as a means of understanding the dynamic processes of stream transiting from flowing to ceasing the mechanism of streambed vk varied with space and time is also discussed in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the chichiawan watershed located in central taiwan is known for the formosan landlocked salmon oncorhynchus masou formosanus tung et al 2006 the chichiawan watershed consists of three major tributaries gaoshan yikawan and yusheng creek fig 1 originally the gaoshan and yikawan creeks are the only habitat for the salmon to restore the historical habitat of the salmon the taiwanese government began to expropriate the cultivated farms along yusheng creek in 2005 and reintroduced the salmon to the upstream of yusheng creek huang et al 2012 liao 2016 the salmon had been successfully rehabilitated until the fragmented reach was found owing to cease to flow condition the red box in fig 1 the fragmentation seriously reduced the population of the rehabilitated salmon and hampered the restoration work the yusheng creek watershed has drainage area of 31 km2 and elevations ranging from 1100 to 2600 m a s l according to the weather station siyuan maintained by the taiwan power company from 1995 to 2016 fig 1 the mean daily air temperature is 11 6 c with an average of 4 89 c in january and 16 7 c in july the average annual rainfall is 2400 mm and 60 of the annual rainfall occurs during the wet season may to october forest landuse covers 90 of the watershed while agriculture associated landuses occupy a significant portion of the remaining lee et al 2013 the basement of studied watershed mainly consists of low grade metamorphic rocks of lower cenozoic formation including argillite indurated sand quartzitic sandstone slate and graphitic slate huang et al 2006 the regional geological map provided by the central geological survey taiwan has been presented as the supplementary material fig s1 in order to evaluate the successfulness of salmon rehabilitation at the field the status of yusheng creek has been checked non periodically by rangers from national park service nps it has been observed that the streamflow ceased at the downstream end of well a fig 1 and the channel remained dry for a few days to a few months even during the wet season the fragmented reach not only limited the expansion of the salmon habitat but indeed reduced the salmon s population by 1 10 liao 2016 according to the nps s suggestion the reaches where streamflow had ever ceased were selected to study the stream groundwater interaction the studied reach the red box in fig 1 is approximately 500 m long from locations well a upstream to well c downstream where monitoring wells were established by this study the streambed elevation ranges from 1935 m at well a 1915 m at well c a b l the topography of creek is characterized by steep hills with narrow valleys all of which have been filled by eroded materials consisting of an extremely heterogeneous mixture of slate gravels sands few silts and even organic matters algae when streamflow is low the width and depth along the studied reach is about 5 10 m and 20 30 cm respectively the thickness of sediments in the channel is at least 4 m from our 6 drilling cores shown in fig s2 neither stream gauge nor piezometer has been installed near the studied reach there is only a stream gauge in the outlet of yusheng creek but it shows yusheng creek is a perennial stream and could not reflect the fragmentation in the upstream 2 2 monitoring wells the main purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential mechanism of stream fragmentation and the interaction between surface water and groundwater therefore three locations in the middle of channel of yusheng creek were selected to install the monitoring wells namely well a well b and well c representing the hydraulic conditions in the up mid and down stream of the studied reaches respectively fig 1 the locations of wells covered the section of fragmentation each well consists of two wells i e a piezometer used to collect groundwater gw levels and a monitoring well used to collect gw temperature at different depths each piezometer and monitoring well were installed by the air drilling to the desired depth of 4 0 m the clastic cores collected from wells a and c when drilling were provided as the supplementary material fig s2 and covered by a natural filter pack along the entire well depth each piezometer was constructed of 5 08 cm diameter pvc well casing 2 in with a perforated section of 0 5 m at the bottom fig 2 each monitoring well was constructed of 2 54 cm diameter pvc well casing 1 in with fully perforated sections at the depths from 0 1 to 3 65 m a steel casing with 10 2 cm diameter was installed outside each well to protect pvc tube being destroyed by flood the detail construction of piezometer and monitoring well at each location is shown in fig 2 a level troll 400 non vented pressure transducer temperature probe in situ inc laramie wyoming temperature accuracy resolution of 0 1 c 0 01 c and pressure accuracy resolution of 0 05 0 005 of full scale was installed inside each piezometer and collected gw level and temperature data every 15 min table 1 a baro troll barometric pressure temperature probe in situ inc laramie wyoming was installed at the top of piezometer at the upstream extent location well a the probe collected barometric pressure to compensate the water levels measured by level troll 400 and simultaneously recorded air temperature changes every 15 min six minilog ii t temperature loggers vemco halifax nova scotia canada temperature accuracy resolution of 0 1 c 0 01 c were placed in each monitoring well at pre determined depths of 0 20 0 40 0 75 1 25 2 25 and 3 60 m 3 10 m for well b below the streambed surface and collected temperature data every 15 min the factors which will affect the measurements while placing the temperature sensors were considered first the sediments deposited in the stream channel mainly consist of gravel and sand and the high percolated rate was expected the smaller interval 0 2 0 35 m was designed to capture more dynamically changed fluxes in the shallow streambed and larger interval 0 5 1 25 m was designed to delineate more stable groundwater flow in the deep streambed the placement of temperature sensor will affect the results significantly however the deployment of temperature sensors at the optimized depths were out of scope in this study due to the consist of sediments the scour of streambed was thought to be negligible and had been minor during our observation period a mini diver non vented pressure transducer temperature probe eijkelkamp temperature accuracy resolution of 0 1 c 0 01 c and pressure accuracy resolution of 0 5 0 2 cmh2o was installed on the surface of streambed at each location fixed outside of the steel casing of each piezometer and collected river stage and temperature data every 15 min all wells were completed on july 14th 2016 and started to collect water levels and temperatures due to the typhoon striking in taiwan in late september all of monitoring wells were destroyed and the data collected from july 15th 2016 to september 13th 2016 were used to investigate the mechanisms of interaction processes between stream and streambed the basic information of probe deployments is summarized in table 1 2 3 heat transfer equation heat has been used as an inexpensive and effective tracer in a wide range of hydrogeologic system anderson 2005 and has found particular use as a tracer for monitoring groundwater flow and hyporheic exchange below streams constantz 2008 rau et al 2014 stallman 1963 derived an equation for the simultaneous transport of heat and water through saturated sediments for the one dimensional case of steady vertical flow which forms the basis for quantitative analysis of the use of heat as a groundwater tracer stallman s equation for the one dimensional case of vertical flow z direction is as follows 1 k t 2 t z 2 q c w t z c s t t where k t is the thermal conductivity of the bulk streamed sediments w m c t is temperature c q is the steady liquid water flux through the sediment m s cw and cs are the volumetric heat capacity of water and the bulk sediment j m3 respectively z is depth m and t is time s the value of q is controlled by the darcy equation as the product of the hydraulic conductivity k m s and the total head hydraulic gradient l l thermal parameters can be estimated given more knowledge of streambed materials the heat capacity of variably saturated sediments can be estimated by the follows 2 c s f s c s ρ s f w c w ρ w f a c a ρ a where f s f w and f a are the volumetric functions of the sediment water and air respectively cs cw and c a are specific heat of the sediment water and air respectively j kg c and ρ s ρ s and ρ s are the densities of the sediment water and air respectively de vries 1963 2 4 analytical and numerical heat transfer models two approaches vflux and vs2dh were used in this study to calculate water flux through streambed based on measured time series of temperature data 2 4 1 vflux vflux is a program that calculates one dimensional vertical water flux through saturated porous media using heat transport equations it used temperature time series data measured by multiple temperature sensors in a vertical profile in order to calculate flux at specific times and depths vflux is written as a matlab toolbox a set of functions that run in the matlab environment vflux is the first published computer program for calculating water flux from temperature time series completely automate data pre processing including robust filtering with dynamic harmonic regression dhr and the first method use a sliding window to identify changing flux rates with depth at high spatial resolution gordon et al 2012 vflux calculates vertical flux q for each sample in the resampled time series using the hatch amplitude and phase methods hatch et al 2006 and the keery amplitude and phase methods keery et al 2007 the hatch methods are shown as follows 3a q c s c w 2 k e δ z ln a r α υ 2 2 3b q c s c w α 2 4 π δ t k e p δ z 2 where k e is the effective thermal diffusivity of the saturated sediment m2 s a r is the ratio of amplitude a measure of amplitude attenuation δ z is the distance between the two sensors in the streambed m υ is the velocity of the thermal front m s δ t is the time lag a measure of the speed of signal propagation between the two temperature signals s p is the period of the temperature signal s and α is defined by 3c α υ 4 8 π k e p 2 effective thermal diffusivity which incorporates conductivity and dispersivity is given by 3d k e λ 0 c s β υ f where λ 0 is the baseline thermal conductivity i e thermal conductivity without the dispersive effect of fluid flow of the saturated sediment j s m c β is thermal dispersivity m and υ f is the linear particle velocity m s the keery methods is similar to the hatch method and more detail information can be found in the vflux documentation and in gordon et al 2012 in this study the amplitude ratio calculated from hatch et al 2006 in vflux will be used to estimate the vertical fluxes because of the following reasons first a trend is developing in the literature which focuses on the amplitude ratio data fanelli and lautz 2008 vogt et al 2010 gordon et al 2012 schmidt et al 2011 briggs et al 2012 second the results from the hatch et al 2006 and keery et al 2007 methods are identical when the influence of thermal dispersivity is omitted irvine et al 2015 which is the case in this study small values of thermal dispersivities third because a value for effective thermal diffusivity was specified and the streambed scour was not observed during the study period the results obtained from mccallum et al 2012 and luce et al 2013 methods were not considered 2 4 2 vs2dh the numerical model of vs2dh is also used in this study because of its capability to simulate partial saturated porous media which cannot be handled by vflux vs2dh was developed by u s geological survey usgs and employs a finite difference approximation to numerically solve the heat flow governing equations healy and ronan 1996 ronan et al 1998 bravo and jiang 2002 constantz et al 2002 an alternate approach of a three dimensional energy transport equation on the basis of the convective dispersion equation for simulating solute transport kipp 1987 has been used to describe simultaneous heat and water transport through sediments the energy transport equation can be written with temperature as the dependent variable 4a θ c w 1 ϕ c s t t k t θ t θ c w d h t θ c w t q q c w t s where θ is percent volumetric water content ϕ is sediment porosity d h is the thermomechanical dispersion tensor m2 s q is the water flux m s q is the exchange rate of a fluid source with temperature t s the left side of the equation represents the temperature change in the variably saturated volume over time the first term on the right side represents the heat transport owing to heat conduction the second term accounts for thermomechanical dispersion the third term represents advective heat transport and the final term represents heat sources or sinks to water movement into or out of the volume the thermomechanical dispersion tensor is defined as healy 1990 4b d h α t ν δ i j α l α t ν i ν j α t where α l α t are longitudinal and transverse dispersivities respectively m δ i j is the kronecker delta function ν i ν j are the ith and jth component of the velocity vector respectively m s for nonisothermal continuous streamflow loss into streamed sediments at a sufficient water velocity to assume that conductive heat transport is negligible relative to advective heat transport eq 4a may be approximated by this simple expression taniguchi and sharma 1993 constantz and thomas 1996 4c q v t ρ s c s ρ w c w where v t is the measured vertical velocity of the a temperature peak through the wet porous material streambed vertical hydraulic conductivity vk streambed thermal conductivity kt sediment heat capacity cs porosity n and dispersivity dl served as the principal calibration parameters for the numerical simulations the automatic parameter estimation software pest doherty 2005 was used to calibrate the model until the differences between simulated and measured temperatures are minimized 3 results 3 1 hydrographs in piezometer wells fig 3 contains graphs illustrating rainfall stream water sw level and groundwater gw level measured in 2 inch wells during 7 15 9 13 in fig 3a the sw and gw levels at well a were strongly influenced by rainfalls the sw levels were significantly higher than the gw levels ranging from 0 1 cm to 10 2 cm indicating that the stream water infiltrated to the streambed the hydraulic gradients between streambed surface and the depth of 3 6 m slightly increased when no rainfall occurred but significantly decreased after the intensive rainfall on 8 12 the variation of gradients might be caused by the changes of streambed composition and the potential mechanisms will be further evaluated and analyzed using the analytical and numerical models in the next section besides a strong diurnal pattern with the amplitude of 1 2 cm twice a day in both sw levels and gw levels was observed and caused by the effect of earth tide the streamflow has never ceased during the observation period the sw and gw levels were also strongly influenced by rainfalls at both well b and well c but their patterns were different from those at well a the mid stream reach ceased flow during 8 1 8 9 and 9 1 9 3 fig 3b and the down stream reach ceased flow during 7 28 8 11 and 8 30 9 3 fig 3c during the periods of streamflow persistence the sw levels were significantly higher than the gw levels at both well b and well c again indicating the downwelling of stream water to the streambed the head differences at well b and well c ranged from 0 5 to 9 8 cm and from 9 7 to 44 0 cm respectively during the periods of streamflow ceased the drawdown of gw levels were more than 45 and 115 cm at well b and well c respectively several gw levels rise were recorded during the periods of streamflow ceased and governed by different mechanisms the gw level rises at well b were contributed by the stream water activated by isolated rainfall events fig 3b but the gw level rises at the down stream reach were contributed by the upstream lateral regional groundwater fig 3c proved by the thermographs shown below once the intensive rainfall occurred i e on 8 12 and 9 3 both sw and gw levels rose back simultaneously and immediately to the previous stages before streamflow ceased 3 2 thermographs in piezometer 1 in and monitoring 2 in wells fig 4 contains graphs illustrating air sw and gw temperatures measured in 2 inch piezometer wells during 07 15 09 13 in fig 4a a strong diurnal pattern was observed at well a in all air sw and gw temperatures ranging from 8 60 c to 32 60 c 13 49 c to 22 54 c and 13 53 c to 21 08 c respectively the temperature variations dampened in the sw and more in the gw compared to the air temperature the significant decrease of amplitudes during 8 10 8 14 was due to the intensive rainfall event the gradient in daily maximum temperatures between sw and gw is generally much greater than that in daily minimum temperatures there was a small thermal gradient which switched direction diurnally owing to rapid convection of surface thermal condition downward beyond the depth of 3 6 m this general thermal pattern at well a continues for the entire study period combined with the findings of the hydrograph at well a fig 3a it was found that the stream was rapidly losing water to the streambed but did not cease flow a strong diurnal pattern in all air sw and gw temperatures is also observed at well b and well c the sw gw temperatures at well b fig 4b and well c fig 4c ranged from 12 56 c to 29 59 c 13 59 c 21 09 c and from 12 14 c to 28 23 c 14 32 c 22 06 c respectively the phenomena of the dampened temperature variation the decreased amplitudes by the intensive rainfall event and the direction switched thermal gradient were similar to those observed at well a however several features were distinct at well b fig 4b a smaller temperature gradient persisted between sw and gw during 7 15 7 31 8 12 8 31 and 9 4 9 13 this pattern indicates that sw was rapidly losing to the streambed and rapid infiltration transferred the surface heat to a depth below 3 10 m during 8 1 8 11 and 9 1 9 3 a large temperature gradient between sw and gw was clearly present the prevailing condition of large thermal gradients indicates the streamflow was very low or even ceased because the sw temperatures were very close to the air temperatures as for well c fig 4c a small temperature gradient persisted between sw and gw during 7 15 7 26 8 12 8 30 and 9 4 9 13 when stream was flowing this pattern was the same as shown at well b owing to the rapid infiltration during 7 27 8 11 and 8 31 9 3 the sw temperature was close to the air temperature revealing again as shown by hydrographs in fig 3c the streamflow ceased and the channel became dry moreover gw temperature maintained as a constant strongly suggesting that low thermal conductivities as a result of low moisture in the streambed fig 5 illustrates air temperature sw temperature and streambed temperature measured at different depths in 1 inch monitoring wells for well a fig 5a a strong diurnal pattern for all temperature data indicated again that sw was rapidly losing to the streambed to a depth below 3 60 m however it shows much smaller thermal gradients between sw and streambed temperature e g at 360 cm in grey line unlike those observed in the 2 inch wells fig 4a the smaller gradient caused by no sealing between each temperature sensor and resulted from slight heat advections occurring inside the well after further examining the data the temperatures can be differentiated into two groups one are those observed at depths from 0 20 to 1 25 m and the other are those at the depth from 2 25 to 3 60 m e g figs 5a 1 5a 2 the temperatures were similar close in each group the discontinuity of temperatures implied that there might be the heterogeneity in the composition of streambed and an interface is existed between the two depths i e 1 25 and 2 25 m as for well b fig 5b a small temperature gradient and smaller than in well a fig 5a persisted between stream and streambed at all depths during 7 15 8 1 8 12 9 1 and 9 3 9 13 when stream was flowing when the streamflow almost ceased during 8 1 8 12 and 9 1 9 3 fig 3b the temperatures at the depth of 0 2 m close to air temperature and not within the extent in fig 5b 2 deviated from the temperatures at the other depths 0 4 3 6 m the thermal gradients increased between depths 0 2 m and the other depths showing the decreased heat transferred by percolated water it also implied that the streamflow was not completely dried out which is conflicted with the hydrograph derived result fig 3b this contradiction was clarified when our team checked the devices and collected data at the field on 8 9 the stream channel was not entirely dry and some water extended from the upstream still remained in the nearby channel stream water might still infiltrate into the streambed but not from the exactly measured point as for well c fig 5c due to the malfunction of temperature sensors only air and sw temperature were available during 8 10 9 7 before 7 28 when stream was flowing all of the thermographs varied simultaneously and little differences at different depths can be observed after 07 28 when there was no flow in the stream as shown in fig 3c large temperature gradients between stream and streambed were clearly presented the thermograph at the depth of 0 20 m was first deviated from its original diurnal pattern then followed by the thermographs at the depths of 0 40 m and 0 75 m and finally the thermograph at the depth of 1 25 m the heat transfer transited from convection dominant to conduction dominant and this transition process propagated from shallow to deep depths the thermographs at the depth of 2 25 m and 3 6 m remained as constants e g fig 5c 2 and this phenomenon indicated the damped depth of heat conduction is less than 2 25 m the separation of thermographs sustained until next rainfall occurred on 8 10 all of the thermographs synchronized in the end of the observed period because stream flew again due to the intensive rainfall on 9 3 3 3 temperature contour in the streambed fig 6 portrays a suite of temperature contour tc plots with the hydrograph for the 1 inch wells at well a well b and well c to visualize the transition of percolated stream water and transferred heat the rapid percolation of stream water carried both cool predawn stream water and warm afternoon stream water to a depth of 3 6 m 3 1 m for well b at all wells before 7 28 when stream was flowing however the tc patterns changed for well c on 7 28 fig 6c and well b on 8 1 fig 6b when streamflow ceased at well c then well b in well b fig 6b the increase of daily maximum temperature at the surface of streambed z 0 was not carried by the downwelling of stream water and the previous percolated stream water continued to penetrate into the deeper streambed the mechanisms controlled the heat transfer within the shallow and deep streambeds were significantly different in the shallow streambed the heat transfer was dominated by the heat conduction but in the deep streambed the heat transfer was dominated by the heat convection the damped depth of heat conduction can be approximately identified between the depths of 0 50 1 00 m the process of heat transfer transited from convection dominant to conduction dominant was even more apparent at well c fig 6c the transition occurred from shallow depths and then propagated to deep depths the deepest damped depth of heat conduction was about 1 25 m the heat transfer mechanisms changed from convection to conduction owing to the cease to flow once the stream channels became dry the rapidly declines of streambed water levels due to scarcity of stream recharge fig 3c leaded to the shallow part of streambed transited from saturated to unsaturated the streambed with low water content resulted in the heat transfer transited from convection dominant to conduction dominant and propagated from shallow to deep depths 3 4 vflux results in this study vflux gordon et al 2012 were firstly used to estimate the percolation flux of streambed and associated hydraulic conductivity based on the measured temperatures and water levels in the wells from the up mid and down stream reaches i e wells a b and c by considering the availability of streambed water levels measured data in the 2 inch wells were only used for the models the data during the period of cease to flow were neglected because vflux requires the porous media is fully saturated fig 7 a shows the results of calculated vertical fluxes ranged from 6 83 10 5 1 00 10 4 8 21 10 5 1 66 10 4 and 9 09 10 5 1 62 10 3 m s at wells a b and c respectively the calculated percolations indicated that the downwelling fluxes increased from up to down stream reaches and this phenomenon consisted with the results from the thermographs fig 4 the time varied downwelling fluxes at well a and well b were relative smaller than those at well c the fluxes at well b and well c started to decrease evidently before the streamflow ceased after the occurrence of intensive rainfall on 08 10 08 12 the fluxes at well a increased but those at well c slightly decreased the fluxes at well b before and after the rainfall almost remain relatively the same the streamflow measured at the monitoring wells in the beginning of study period i e 7 1 and 7 14 were used to verify the fluxes calculated by vflux based on the streamflow measurements the averaged losing of streamflows were 9 16 10 2 m3 s and 3 81 10 2 m3 s between well a well b and well b well c respectively based on the results of vflux the total amounts of downwelling flows were 9 72 10 2 m3 s and 3 05 10 2 m3 s between well a well b and well b well c respectively assumed the trapezoid of the stream channel and averaged fluxes calculated from vflux compared these estimated infiltrations to the actual measurements both of flows were almost identical and the results from vflux were verified the calculated percolations were further analyzed with the measured water levels to estimate the vertical hydraulic conductivity vk of streambed the streambed from the surface to the depth of 3 60 m or 3 10 m for well b was assumed homogeneous at each well and the estimated vk varied with time are shown in fig 7b the streambed at well a and well b have the lowest and highest vk respectively the vk at well a slightly decreased before the intensive rainfall on 08 12 but increased significantly from 4 39 10 3 to 8 56 10 4 m s after the rainfall event the vk at well b and well c decreased significantly before the rainfall event but continued to decrease from 1 23 10 2 to 6 8 10 3 m s and from 9 6 10 3 to 6 39 10 3 m s respectively after the rainfall the opposite changes of vk at well a and well b well c after the rainfall event might be controlled by different mechanisms the more detail discussion related to the mechanism will be addressed in the next section 3 5 vs2dh results in order to handle the unsaturated situation in the streambed and verify the calculated results obtained from vflux the numerical model of vs2dh was used to simulate the interaction between stream and underlying streambed for the 2 inch wells the one dimensional numerical model of heat and water flow for each piezometer profile was developed to interpret temperature and head observations and to estimate the specific discharge from river to the streambed q and the vertical hydraulic conductivity of streambed vk based on collected water levels and temperature data the diurnal temperature variations caused by rapidly downwelling flux at the depth of 3 6 m were significantly observed therefore the thermally active zone beneath the yusheng creek is expected to be deeper than 3 6 m besides the core logs from the nearby geological wells provided by central geological survey taiwan indicated the depth of bedrock is about 5 7 m deep if the bedrock is assumed as an impermeable layer the depth of thermally active zone along the yusheng creek should be less than 7 m according to these information the one dimensional models with 10 cm grid blocks were developed and the model domains were set 5 m depth for each profile simulation the top portion of the model domain that is occupied by the stream was modeled as a specified time variable head temperature boundary provided by the pressure transducer deployed at the surface of streambed mini diver the bottom portion of the model domain that is occupied by the groundwater was modeled as a specified time variable head temperature boundary as well the groundwater levels were provided by the pressure transducer installed in the piezometer level troll 400 and the groundwater temperatures were provided by the measurements in the nearby 25 m deep well at the salmon recovery center the rest of the portion of model domain was modeled as a no water and heat flow boundary when the stream ceased to flow at mid and down stream reaches the top portion of the model domain is modeled as a no water flow boundary the setting of numerical model and associated initial parameters are summarized in table 2 homogeneous hydraulic and thermal parameters were set throughout the model domain and the calibrated parameters were subsequently automatically adjusted to minimize sum of square error sse between measured and model data the measured temperatures at the depth of 3 60 m or 3 10 m were used to match model simulations the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities are scale dependent parameters but there is no consensus on how important the parameter of dispersivity is in temperature modeling the range of longitudinal dispersivity can vary between 0 1 and 20 m de marsily 1986 silliman et al 1995 niswonger and prudic 2003 schulze makuch 2005 and some researchers even suggested that the effects of dispersivity are so negligible for small spatial scales i e a value of zero can be used su et al 2004 anderson 2005 munz et al 2011 rau et al 2010 accordingly the sensitivity of longitudinal dispersivity ranging from 0 05 to 10 m was conducted to evaluate the property of scale dependence and its value ranged from 2 54 10 3 to 1 34 10 4 provided as the supplementary material fig s3 the sensitivity was higher with low dispersivity value and almost identical when dispersivity was larger than 1 0 m thus the dispersivities was initially set equal to 0 3 m based on the grain size green et al 1964 and its lower and upper bounds were set equal to 0 03 m and 3 0 m respectively during the model calibration the transverse dispersivities were assumed 0 1 of longitudinal dispersitivies de marsily 1986 and this ratio was kept as a constant through the model calibration in order to verify the time varied changes of streambed vk the entire model was divided into two periods i e before and after the rainfall event on 8 12 the measured temperatures were also divided into associated datasets and used to individually calibrate each model the periods that stream ceased to flow were ignored from the individual calibration for the consistent comparison of vflux results before the rainfall event the simulated time for well a well b and well c were 7 15 8 12 7 15 8 1 and 7 15 7 27 respectively after the rainfall event the simulated time for well a well b and well c were 8 12 9 13 8 12 9 1 and 8 12 8 31 respectively the calibrated results are summarized in table 3 for the entire period the streambed hydraulic conductivities at well b and well c are higher than that at well a these results confirmed that the stream ceased to flow between well b and well c is due to their higher hydraulic conductivity and the channels have the potential with higher downwelling fluxes to the streambed the two period calibrated results showed that the streambed vk at well a increased from 4 68 10 3 to 8 42 10 3 m s after the rainfall event but those at well b and well c decreased from 3 5 10 2 to 7 92 10 3 m s and 1 08 10 2 to 5 67 10 3 m s respectively the significant changes of streambed vk after the rainfall identified by vs2dh was consistent with those calculated by vflux in terms of trends and magnitudes table 3 before 8 12 the vk at well b was larger than that at well c and then at well a fig 7b after 8 12 the vk at well a showed the largest one then at well b and well c fig 8 depicts the results of the one dimensional modeling efforts by vs2dh at well a well b and well c in general the simulated results at all locations can fit the measured data well and the diurnal pattern can be delineated perfectly for well a fig 8a the simulated temperatures obtained from the two period calibrations i e before and after 8 12 perform better than those using the entire observation period as a whole to calibrate the model the improvement from the two period calibration is especially obvious after the rainfall event the effect of streambed vk changes on the temperatures at well a is evident for well b fig 8b the simulated temperatures obtained from one model overestimated underestimated the measured daily maximum minimum temperatures during cease to flow period i e 8 1 8 12 the reason to cause this mismatch might be that stream channel was not entirely dry out and some water extended from the upstream still remained in the nearby channel to infiltrate into the deeper streambed the simulated temperatures obtained from the two period calibrations also perform better compared to those obtained from one model as for well c fig 8c although the simulated temperatures obtained from one model underestimated the measured temperatures when stream is flowing they matched the temperatures very well when the heat transfer transited from convection dominant to conduction dominant i e streamflow ceased the model did not capture the two diurnal cycles of measured temperatures i e 7 28 29 because the streambed above the measured depth was not fully dry out and the residual infiltrated stream water remained in the streambed fig 5c overall the simulated temperatures obtained from the two period calibrations improved significantly compared to those obtained from one model the effect of streambed vk changes on the temperatures at well b and well c is also apparent and its mechanism will be discussed in the next section pest calculates the derivatives of the model outputs with respect to its parameters and provides a measure of the parameter sensitivities doherty 2005 the composite sensitivity is provided by pest as a byproduct of the parameter estimation results the results showed that the simulated temperatures were most sensitive to changes in vk and n but least sensitive to changes in dl table 4 due to high percolated downwelling fluxes with a small spatial scale in this study the calculated sensitivity values were within the expectation 4 discussion 4 1 time varied streambed vertical hydraulic conductivity the significant changes of streambed vk before and after the rainfall event on 8 12 were observed from the results of both vflux and vs2dh the streambed vk at well a increased by about double but those at well b and well c decreased by about 75 and 50 respectively the effect of the rainfall event on the streambed vk at the well a and well b well c was different it believes that the increase of streamflow due to the rainfall should be very similar because the distance from up and down stream reaches is only 500 m no tributary merges within this study reaches and the composition of streambed materials is almost identical the only difference among the wells is that there is always streamflow around well a however the stream had dried out in the reaches around well b and well c before the rainfall event therefore the streamflow conditions might be the key factor resulting in the opposite changes of streambed vk for the upstream reach around well a before the rainfall event fine grains were gradually deposited in the pore spaces of substrates due to the receding streamflow resulting in the gradually decreasing streambed vks fig 7b after the rainfall event the fine grains were very likely removed by the increased streamflow of the event being supported by the increased streambed vk this result consists with previous studies conducted during the flood season doble et al 2012 simpson and meixner 2012 however the decrease of streambed vk at well b and well c after the rainfall event cannot be explained by the fine grain removal mechanism for the mid and down stream reaches around well b and well c respectively it was found that the algae and diatom rapidly bloomed when streamflow gradually receded once the streamflow completely ceased the death of algae and diatom were mixed with fine grains and filled into the pore space or attached to the surface of the streambed substrates to form the clogging layer fig 9 although the intensive rainfall intuitively should be able to remove the sediments away from the substrates the rainfall may not last long enough or this clogging layer of mixed fine grains and organic matters may be more resistant to the streamflow the algae and diatom could also be found at the up stream reach when streamflow was low but the flowing streamflow remained in the channel could support the living algae and diatom the combined effects of cease to flow condition and biological activities should be responsible for the opposite changes of streambed vk after the rainfall event the forming of clogging layer was clearly observed when our team checked the devices and collected data at the field on 8 9 and the dried channel was entirely covered by the white substance attached on the substrate in the streambed fig 9a and b these white samples were collected from the field and conducted the analyses using the scanning electron microscope sem in the laboratory the results showed that the white samples were identified as the diatom and the photos of different types of diatom under sem are shown in fig 9c f 4 2 propagation of cease to flow condition and implication for habitat restoration the results obtained from vflux and vs2dh confirm that the mid stream reach has the largest streambed vk indicating that most stream water lost within this channel section the significant loss downwelling infiltration of stream water within the mid stream can cause the significant decrease of streamflow at the further down stream reach and result in the down stream channel drying out easily the down stream reach ceased to flow first then propagated toward the mid stream reach but never prolonged to the up stream reach the recorded temperatures of two distinct interchange patterns suggested the frequent switch between wet and dry conditions of channel and implied that the cease to flow condition at yusheng creek might be a general circumstance figs 3b c and 6b c the mid and down stream reaches ran dry easily but never happened at the up stream reach during the study period this observation can also be inferred to the heterogeneity of streambed within such a small scale the fragmentation associated consequence i e forming of bio clogging layer and decreasing hydraulic conductivity is like a natural resistance to the fragmentation the clogging layer can prevent the stream water from infiltrating into the streambed and maintain the stream water in the channel if the river restoration can be aimed on decreasing the vertically downwelling fluxes the frequency of fragmentation occurrence can be reduced and the habitats of the endangered formosan landlocked salmon can therefore extend it also implies that the fragmentation potential of selected reaches for reintroduction can be firstly evaluated by testing the vertical hydraulic conductivity 4 3 uncertainty and prospect although 1 d analytical solutions and numerical model were used in this study to estimate the vertical water fluxes and the streambed vk there might be horizontal flow influencing the temperature patterns beneath the streambed roshan et al 2012 cranswick et al 2014 besides the vertical water flux through the streambed would be expected to vary both longitudinally and vertically briggs et al 2012 cuthbert and mackay 2013 hence it is important for a model to capture variability in the vertical component of flux within a 2 d or 3 d flow system cranswick et al 2014 however temperature data are usually collected as vertical profiles and there is often insufficient data to properly constrain a 2 d and 3 d model of the flow system a 1 d model with the advantages of simplicity and ease of use is still preferred over more complex numerical models in a near stream environment because the high vertical percolated fluxes dominated the flow regime beneath the stream the estimated dynamic change of hydraulic properties should be similar with the results obtained by a 2d or 3d model recently the advancements in measurement techniques using fiber optical distributed temperature sensor fo dts selker et al 2006 heat pulse probes lewandowski et al 2011 and forward looking infrared radiation flir torgersen et al 2001 hare et al 2015 have been developed and implemented to partially overcome this challenge these techniques can provide highly detailed and sufficiently accurate longitudinal and vertical water temperature profiles and allow for the development of a 2 d and 3 d model besides a rather intensive effort involving the use of other tracers i e isotopic or chemical analysis can provide sufficient detail information to constrain the flow system and help to discern the heterogeneity of streambed 5 conclusion the temperature and water level data were collected from the stream and monitoring wells installed along the 500 m reach of yusheng creek in taiwan providing the processes of stream and groundwater interaction in the mountain area the temperature dataset allowed for the determination of both direction and magnitude of water fluxes the measurements of groundwater level in the streambed made possible the calculation of streambed hydraulic conductivity vflux was a very useful tool in calculating the variation of water fluxes and estimating the hydraulic characteristics by coupling with water level data vs2dh provided a more sophisticated approach in handling the transient processes of heat advection and heat conduction caused by the appearance of unsaturated zone by indirectly estimating the vertical hydraulic conduction of streambed varied with time the potential mechanisms of hydraulic conductivity changed with time induced by cease to flow condition and biological activities were evaluated stream water were observed to recharge the groundwater through the streambed along the entire monitoring stream reach of yusheng creek the thermographs and temperature contours indicated that the downwelling of flux at the mid and down stream reaches was greater than that at the up stream reach the identified streambed vks from up mid to down stream reaches using vflux and pest were 5 57 10 3 2 72 10 2 and 8 60 10 3 m s respectively when no rainfall occurred for a period the mid and down stream reaches ceased to flow and the groundwater levels drewdown quickly due to short of recharge sources the stream started ceasing at the down stream reach because of higher downwelling fluxes at the mid stream reach and propagated rapidly toward the mid stream reaches the key finding in this study is the dynamic changes of streambed s hydraulic characteristics in terms of space and time the significant changes of streambed vk before and after the intensive rainfall on 8 12 were observed through vflux and vs2dh the streambed vk at the up stream reach increased by about double after the rainfall event from 4 68 10 3 to 8 42 10 3 m s however the vk at the mid and down stream reaches decreased by about 75 and 50 from 3 5 10 2 to 7 92 10 3 m s and 1 08 10 2 to 5 67 10 3 m s respectively the increase of vk at the up stream reach should be related to the removal of fine grains by increased streamflow the decreases of vks at the mid and down stream reaches were caused by the formation of clogging layer when streamflow ceased the clogging layers consisted of died algae and diatom mixed with fine grains and might be resistant to the high streamflow within such a small scale reach the combination of cease to flow condition and bioactivities should be responsible for the opposite changes of streambed vk after the rainfall event which to our knowledge none of the previous studies have demonstrated in the filed study assessing such complicated dynamics of stream groundwater interaction using streambed temperature measurements groundwater level observations one dimensional heat transport modeling can quantitatively determine water flux rates and their directions in shallow streambeds and improve the understanding of its hydraulic characteristics and mechanisms controlling surface water groundwater exchange between stream and streambeds the thermal and hydrological information not only helps hydrologists understand the patterns of stream exchanges with shallow groundwater along the creek but is also useful to geochemists and microbiologists to linking microbes and chemical processes with the stream ecological environment the results obtained from this study can be used by the government or associated agencies for the restoration of endangered formosan landlocked salmon the integration of different validation tools i e geochemical analysis and fo dts are indeed required to establish a 2 d or 3 d flow system for comprehensive understanding of the interaction processes further studies about the formation of clogging layer in the streambed and its effect on the hydraulic characteristic should be conducted in the laboratory and at the field to create a more holistic and reliable picture of surface water groundwater interaction processes credit authorship contribution statement yung

5615,the endangered formosan landlocked salmon that habitats only in chichiwan creek has been successfully rehabilitated in one of its tributaries yusheng creek however the stream fragmentation no surface streamflow seriously reduced the salmon population hampering the restoration work the surface water groundwater sw gw interactions in a 500 m reach were examined by installing 6 monitoring wells at 3 sites to record temperatures and groundwater levels at every 15 min for two months the automatic estimator of vflux and numerical model of vs2dh are used to quantify the streambed hydraulic characteristics along the reach it is found that the entire study reach is a losing stream and the fragmented reaches have significantly higher streambed vertical hydraulic conductivity vk compared to the perennial one the streambed vk at the up stream perennial reach increased by about double after a rainfall event probably resulting from the removal of fine grain in the streambed by the rainfall event although the fragmented reaches reflowed after the event streambed vk at the mid and down stream fragmented reaches decreased by about 75 and 50 respectively compared to the pre fragmented period the clogging layers formed by the remains of dead diatom deposited in the streambed during the fragmented period were very likely responsible for the decreased streambed vk the spatial and temporal variations of streambed vk influenced by hydrological conditions and even bioactivities within such a short distance reveal the complexity of sw gw interactions further studies about the forming processes of clogging layer and its effect on the hydraulic characteristic should be conducted to create a more holistic and reliable picture of interaction processes keywords surface water groundwater interaction heat transport modeling hydraulic conductivity clogging layer hyporheic zone 1 introduction the interaction processes of surface water sw and groundwater gw have been recognized as a fundamental but unique element of hydrological system and their influence on stream hydrology and ecosystem is significant there has been a dramatic rise in the number of relevant publications since 2006 cardenas 2015 once the streamflow ceases the channels are often flashy erosive and destructive leading to the operational and maintaining difficulties constantz et al 2001 however most of the studies regarding the intermittent or ephemeral streams are in the arid or semi arid areas stonestrom and constantz 2003 stream fragmentation owing to cease to flow condition in the humid subtropical climate was rarely documented it is particularly a crucial issue because the stream fragmentation in our study reach has threatened the survival of an endangered salmon chichiawan creek located at the mountain area in northeast taiwan is the only habitat for the formosan landlocked salmon oncorhynchus masou formosanus to reintroduce the salmon back to their historical habitat the upstream of yusheng creek a tributary of chichiawan creek is successful to restore the salmons fig 1 however partial reaches at the upstream of yusheng creek were observed to cease flow non periodically resulting in significant loss of the salmon population although the annual rainfall is 2400 mm liao 2016 the phenomenon of losing water from the channels should be directly associated with the interaction between stream and streambed however the underlying potential mechanism is unclear it is eager to clarify the interaction process and seek a strategy to maintain the steady flow in the channel and the stable habitat for the salmon sw and gw are tightly linked by the discharge of gw or circulation of sw through underlying sediments and the exchanges of fluxes between two systems are continuous and considerable their associated geochemical composition changes through these fluxes and the ecosystem of rivers is influenced by these interactions accordingly many works have focused increasing on the investigation of interaction processes between sw and gw in recent years the interactions between sw and gw are complex sophocleous 2002 boano et al 2014 cardenas 2015 hester et al 2017 and are driven by various geomorphologic and hydrogeologic controls woessner 2000 kasahara and wondzell 2003 storey et al 2003 gooseff et al 2005 tonina and buffington 2009 fox et al 2014 schmadel et al 2017 among the research within stream aquifer systems spatial and temporal variations of streambed hydraulic characteristics is always an issue to be discussed and their dynamic processes such as sedimentation and bioclogging are essential to changes in channel geometry water table elevation composition of streambed and flux through streambed brunner et al 2009 hatch et al 2010 tonina et al 2014 sebok et al 2014 newcomer et al 2016 fox et al 2018 in order to understanding and responding to changes to sw and gw interactions a wide range of techniques have been developed to quantify gw and sw interaction in its various spatial and temporal scales kalbus et al 2006 rosenberry and labaugh 2008 these methods include the measurement of hydraulic head gradient differential stream flow measurements seepage meters and environmental tracers among these methods temperature is also commonly used to study physical processes of gw and sw interaction as it is a conservative tracer stonestrom and constantz 2003 this has been made for a period longer than 50 years since the heat tracer was first applied to evaluate flow directions and quantify the exchange fluxes between rivers and streambeds bredehoeft and papadopulos 1965 suzuki 1960 stallman 1965 lapham 1989 anderson 2005 constantz 2008 rau et al 2014 the usefulness of near surface temperature data as an indicator of natural heat flow were discovered and linked quantitatively to water flow through the soil zone cartwright 1974 taniguchi 1993 taniguchi and sharma 1993 and the streambed silliman et al 1995 the natural temperature variation of rivers allows the water fluxes into or out of the hyporheic zone and or groundwater system to be calculated conant 2004 lautz and fanelli 2008 bhaskar et al 2012 with growing confidence in the methods developed use of sediment thermal data to determine reasonable groundwater flux rates is likely to be an effective field method that is quicker and more cost effective than setting up piezometers or seepage meters schmidt et al 2011 as a further step towards the goal of automated flux calculations from thermal records the hatch and the keery methods hatch et al 2006 keery et al 2007 were included in the code ex stream swanson and cardenas 2011 and in the code vflux gordon et al 2012 which included comprehensive error and sensitivity analysis numerical methods for interpreting streambed temperature data are also commonly applied and numerous examples are found in 1 d lapham 1987 and in 2 d using vs2dh or other numerical codes anibas et al 2009 roshan et al 2012 cuthbert and mackay 2013 in this study the main objective is to clarify the interaction processes between the stream and underlying streambed in the subtropical alpine catchment in central taiwan using the temperature and water level data the monitoring wells were installed along the yusheng creek and both water levels and temperature data of stream and streambed were measured from up to downstream extents the collected data were inputted into the 1 d heat transport equation of vflux to analytically solve the water fluxes at each monitoring location then the variations in the vertical component of water flux are compared with the solutions obtained from the numerical model of vs2dh the vertical hydraulic conductivities vk of streambed are estimated with the river stages and gw levels finally the interactions between gw and sw is evaluated as a means of understanding the dynamic processes of stream transiting from flowing to ceasing the mechanism of streambed vk varied with space and time is also discussed in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the chichiawan watershed located in central taiwan is known for the formosan landlocked salmon oncorhynchus masou formosanus tung et al 2006 the chichiawan watershed consists of three major tributaries gaoshan yikawan and yusheng creek fig 1 originally the gaoshan and yikawan creeks are the only habitat for the salmon to restore the historical habitat of the salmon the taiwanese government began to expropriate the cultivated farms along yusheng creek in 2005 and reintroduced the salmon to the upstream of yusheng creek huang et al 2012 liao 2016 the salmon had been successfully rehabilitated until the fragmented reach was found owing to cease to flow condition the red box in fig 1 the fragmentation seriously reduced the population of the rehabilitated salmon and hampered the restoration work the yusheng creek watershed has drainage area of 31 km2 and elevations ranging from 1100 to 2600 m a s l according to the weather station siyuan maintained by the taiwan power company from 1995 to 2016 fig 1 the mean daily air temperature is 11 6 c with an average of 4 89 c in january and 16 7 c in july the average annual rainfall is 2400 mm and 60 of the annual rainfall occurs during the wet season may to october forest landuse covers 90 of the watershed while agriculture associated landuses occupy a significant portion of the remaining lee et al 2013 the basement of studied watershed mainly consists of low grade metamorphic rocks of lower cenozoic formation including argillite indurated sand quartzitic sandstone slate and graphitic slate huang et al 2006 the regional geological map provided by the central geological survey taiwan has been presented as the supplementary material fig s1 in order to evaluate the successfulness of salmon rehabilitation at the field the status of yusheng creek has been checked non periodically by rangers from national park service nps it has been observed that the streamflow ceased at the downstream end of well a fig 1 and the channel remained dry for a few days to a few months even during the wet season the fragmented reach not only limited the expansion of the salmon habitat but indeed reduced the salmon s population by 1 10 liao 2016 according to the nps s suggestion the reaches where streamflow had ever ceased were selected to study the stream groundwater interaction the studied reach the red box in fig 1 is approximately 500 m long from locations well a upstream to well c downstream where monitoring wells were established by this study the streambed elevation ranges from 1935 m at well a 1915 m at well c a b l the topography of creek is characterized by steep hills with narrow valleys all of which have been filled by eroded materials consisting of an extremely heterogeneous mixture of slate gravels sands few silts and even organic matters algae when streamflow is low the width and depth along the studied reach is about 5 10 m and 20 30 cm respectively the thickness of sediments in the channel is at least 4 m from our 6 drilling cores shown in fig s2 neither stream gauge nor piezometer has been installed near the studied reach there is only a stream gauge in the outlet of yusheng creek but it shows yusheng creek is a perennial stream and could not reflect the fragmentation in the upstream 2 2 monitoring wells the main purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential mechanism of stream fragmentation and the interaction between surface water and groundwater therefore three locations in the middle of channel of yusheng creek were selected to install the monitoring wells namely well a well b and well c representing the hydraulic conditions in the up mid and down stream of the studied reaches respectively fig 1 the locations of wells covered the section of fragmentation each well consists of two wells i e a piezometer used to collect groundwater gw levels and a monitoring well used to collect gw temperature at different depths each piezometer and monitoring well were installed by the air drilling to the desired depth of 4 0 m the clastic cores collected from wells a and c when drilling were provided as the supplementary material fig s2 and covered by a natural filter pack along the entire well depth each piezometer was constructed of 5 08 cm diameter pvc well casing 2 in with a perforated section of 0 5 m at the bottom fig 2 each monitoring well was constructed of 2 54 cm diameter pvc well casing 1 in with fully perforated sections at the depths from 0 1 to 3 65 m a steel casing with 10 2 cm diameter was installed outside each well to protect pvc tube being destroyed by flood the detail construction of piezometer and monitoring well at each location is shown in fig 2 a level troll 400 non vented pressure transducer temperature probe in situ inc laramie wyoming temperature accuracy resolution of 0 1 c 0 01 c and pressure accuracy resolution of 0 05 0 005 of full scale was installed inside each piezometer and collected gw level and temperature data every 15 min table 1 a baro troll barometric pressure temperature probe in situ inc laramie wyoming was installed at the top of piezometer at the upstream extent location well a the probe collected barometric pressure to compensate the water levels measured by level troll 400 and simultaneously recorded air temperature changes every 15 min six minilog ii t temperature loggers vemco halifax nova scotia canada temperature accuracy resolution of 0 1 c 0 01 c were placed in each monitoring well at pre determined depths of 0 20 0 40 0 75 1 25 2 25 and 3 60 m 3 10 m for well b below the streambed surface and collected temperature data every 15 min the factors which will affect the measurements while placing the temperature sensors were considered first the sediments deposited in the stream channel mainly consist of gravel and sand and the high percolated rate was expected the smaller interval 0 2 0 35 m was designed to capture more dynamically changed fluxes in the shallow streambed and larger interval 0 5 1 25 m was designed to delineate more stable groundwater flow in the deep streambed the placement of temperature sensor will affect the results significantly however the deployment of temperature sensors at the optimized depths were out of scope in this study due to the consist of sediments the scour of streambed was thought to be negligible and had been minor during our observation period a mini diver non vented pressure transducer temperature probe eijkelkamp temperature accuracy resolution of 0 1 c 0 01 c and pressure accuracy resolution of 0 5 0 2 cmh2o was installed on the surface of streambed at each location fixed outside of the steel casing of each piezometer and collected river stage and temperature data every 15 min all wells were completed on july 14th 2016 and started to collect water levels and temperatures due to the typhoon striking in taiwan in late september all of monitoring wells were destroyed and the data collected from july 15th 2016 to september 13th 2016 were used to investigate the mechanisms of interaction processes between stream and streambed the basic information of probe deployments is summarized in table 1 2 3 heat transfer equation heat has been used as an inexpensive and effective tracer in a wide range of hydrogeologic system anderson 2005 and has found particular use as a tracer for monitoring groundwater flow and hyporheic exchange below streams constantz 2008 rau et al 2014 stallman 1963 derived an equation for the simultaneous transport of heat and water through saturated sediments for the one dimensional case of steady vertical flow which forms the basis for quantitative analysis of the use of heat as a groundwater tracer stallman s equation for the one dimensional case of vertical flow z direction is as follows 1 k t 2 t z 2 q c w t z c s t t where k t is the thermal conductivity of the bulk streamed sediments w m c t is temperature c q is the steady liquid water flux through the sediment m s cw and cs are the volumetric heat capacity of water and the bulk sediment j m3 respectively z is depth m and t is time s the value of q is controlled by the darcy equation as the product of the hydraulic conductivity k m s and the total head hydraulic gradient l l thermal parameters can be estimated given more knowledge of streambed materials the heat capacity of variably saturated sediments can be estimated by the follows 2 c s f s c s ρ s f w c w ρ w f a c a ρ a where f s f w and f a are the volumetric functions of the sediment water and air respectively cs cw and c a are specific heat of the sediment water and air respectively j kg c and ρ s ρ s and ρ s are the densities of the sediment water and air respectively de vries 1963 2 4 analytical and numerical heat transfer models two approaches vflux and vs2dh were used in this study to calculate water flux through streambed based on measured time series of temperature data 2 4 1 vflux vflux is a program that calculates one dimensional vertical water flux through saturated porous media using heat transport equations it used temperature time series data measured by multiple temperature sensors in a vertical profile in order to calculate flux at specific times and depths vflux is written as a matlab toolbox a set of functions that run in the matlab environment vflux is the first published computer program for calculating water flux from temperature

detail information can be found in the vflux documentation and in gordon et al 2012 in this study the amplitude ratio calculated from hatch et al 2006 in vflux will be used to estimate the vertical fluxes because of the following reasons first a trend is developing in the literature which focuses on the amplitude ratio data fanelli and lautz 2008 vogt et al 2010 gordon et al 2012 schmidt et al 2011 briggs et al 2012 second the results from the hatch et al 2006 and keery et al 2007 methods are identical when the influence of thermal dispersivity is omitted irvine et al 2015 which is the case in this study small values of thermal dispersivities third because a value for effective thermal diffusivity was specified and the streambed scour was not observed during the study period the results obtained from mccallum et al 2012 and luce et al 2013 methods were not considered 2 4 2 vs2dh the numerical model of vs2dh is also used in this study because of its capability to simulate partial saturated porous media which cannot be handled by vflux vs2dh was developed by u s geological survey usgs and employs a finite difference approximation to numerically solve the heat flow governing

during 7 15 9 13 in fig 3a the sw and gw levels at well a were strongly influenced by rainfalls the sw levels were significantly higher than the gw levels ranging from 0 1 cm to 10 2 cm indicating that the stream water infiltrated to the streambed the hydraulic gradients between streambed surface and the depth of 3 6 m slightly increased when no rainfall occurred but significantly decreased after the intensive rainfall on 8 12 the variation of gradients might be caused by the changes of streambed composition and the potential mechanisms will be further evaluated and analyzed using the analytical and numerical models in the next section besides a strong diurnal pattern with the amplitude of 1 2 cm twice a day in both sw levels and gw levels was observed and caused by the effect of earth tide the streamflow has never ceased during the observation period the sw and gw levels were also strongly influenced by rainfalls at both well b and well c but their patterns were different from those at well a the mid stream reach ceased flow during 8 1 8 9 and 9 1 9 3 fig 3b and the down stream reach ceased flow during 7 28 8 11 and 8 30 9 3 fig 3c during the periods of streamflow persistence the sw levels were significantly higher than the gw levels at both well b and well c again indicating the downwelling of stream water to the streambed the head differences at well b and well c ranged from 0 5 to 9 8 cm and from 9 7 to 44 0 cm respectively during the periods of streamflow ceased the drawdown of gw levels were more than 45 and 115 cm at well b and well c respectively several gw levels rise were recorded during the periods of streamflow ceased and governed by different mechanisms the gw level rises at well b were contributed by the stream water activated by isolated rainfall events fig 3b but the gw level rises at the down stream reach were contributed by the upstream lateral regional groundwater fig 3c proved by the thermographs shown below once the intensive rainfall occurred i e on 8 12 and 9 3 both sw and gw levels rose back simultaneously and immediately to the previous stages before streamflow ceased 3 2 thermographs in piezometer 1 in and monitoring 2 in wells fig 4 contains graphs illustrating air sw and gw temperatures measured in 2 inch piezometer wells during 07 15 09 13 in fig 4a a strong diurnal pattern was observed at well a in all air sw and gw temperatures ranging from 8 60 c to 32 60 c 13 49 c to 22 54 c and 13 53 c to 21 08 c respectively the temperature variations dampened in the sw and more in the gw compared to the air temperature the significant decrease of amplitudes during 8 10 8 14 was due to the intensive rainfall event the gradient in daily maximum temperatures between sw and gw is generally much greater than that in daily minimum temperatures there was a small thermal gradient which switched direction diurnally owing to rapid convection of surface thermal condition downward beyond the depth of 3 6 m this general thermal pattern at well a continues for the entire study period combined with the findings of the hydrograph at well a fig 3a it was found that the stream was rapidly losing water to the streambed but did not cease flow a strong diurnal pattern in all air sw and gw temperatures is also observed at well b and well c the sw gw temperatures at well b fig 4b and well c fig 4c ranged from 12 56 c to 29 59 c 13 59 c 21 09 c and from 12 14 c to 28 23 c 14 32 c 22 06 c respectively the phenomena of the dampened temperature variation the decreased amplitudes by the intensive rainfall event and the direction switched thermal gradient were similar to those observed at well a however several features were distinct at well b fig 4b a smaller temperature gradient persisted between sw and gw during 7 15 7 31 8 12 8 31 and 9 4 9 13 this pattern indicates that sw was rapidly losing to the streambed and rapid infiltration transferred the surface heat to a depth below 3 10 m during 8 1 8 11 and 9 1 9 3 a large temperature gradient between sw and gw was clearly present the prevailing condition of large thermal gradients indicates the streamflow was very low or even ceased because the sw temperatures were very close to the air temperatures as for well c fig 4c a small temperature gradient persisted between sw and gw during 7 15 7 26 8 12 8 30 and 9 4 9 13 when stream was flowing this pattern was the same as shown at well b owing to the rapid infiltration during 7 27 8 11 and 8 31 9 3 the sw temperature was close to the air temperature revealing again as shown by hydrographs in fig 3c the streamflow ceased and the channel became dry moreover gw temperature maintained as a constant strongly suggesting that low thermal conductivities as a result of low moisture in the streambed fig 5 illustrates air temperature sw temperature and streambed temperature measured at different depths in 1 inch monitoring wells for well a fig 5a a strong diurnal pattern for all temperature data indicated again that sw was rapidly losing to the streambed to a depth below 3 60 m however it shows much smaller thermal gradients between sw and streambed temperature e g at 360 cm in grey line unlike those observed in the 2 inch wells fig 4a the smaller gradient caused by no sealing between each temperature sensor and resulted from slight heat advections occurring inside the well after further examining the data the temperatures can be differentiated into two groups one are those observed at depths from 0 20 to 1 25 m and the other are those at the depth from 2 25 to 3 60 m e g figs 5a 1 5a 2 the temperatures were similar close in each group the discontinuity of temperatures implied that there might be the heterogeneity in the composition of streambed and an interface is existed between the two depths i e 1 25 and 2 25 m as for well b fig 5b a small temperature gradient and smaller than in well a fig 5a persisted between stream and streambed at all depths during 7 15 8 1 8 12 9 1 and 9 3 9 13 when stream was flowing when the streamflow almost ceased during 8 1 8 12 and 9 1 9 3 fig 3b the temperatures at the depth of 0 2 m close to air temperature and not within the extent in fig 5b 2 deviated from the temperatures at the other depths 0 4 3 6 m the thermal gradients increased between depths 0 2 m and the other depths showing the decreased heat transferred by percolated water it also implied that the streamflow was not completely dried out which is conflicted with the hydrograph derived result fig 3b this contradiction was clarified when our team checked the devices and collected data at the field on 8 9 the stream channel was not entirely dry and some water extended from the upstream still remained in the nearby channel stream water might still infiltrate into the streambed but not from the exactly measured point as for well c fig 5c due to the malfunction of temperature sensors only air and sw temperature were available during 8 10 9 7 before 7 28 when stream was flowing all of the thermographs varied simultaneously and little differences at different depths can be observed after 07 28 when there was no flow in the stream as shown in fig 3c large temperature gradients between stream and streambed were clearly presented the thermograph at the depth of 0 20 m was first deviated from its original diurnal pattern then followed by the thermographs at the depths of 0 40 m and 0 75 m and finally the thermograph at the depth of 1 25 m the heat transfer transited from convection dominant to conduction dominant and this transition process propagated from shallow to deep depths the thermographs at the depth of 2 25 m and 3 6 m remained as constants e g fig 5c 2 and this phenomenon indicated the damped depth of heat conduction is less than 2 25 m the separation of thermographs sustained until next rainfall occurred on 8 10 all of the thermographs synchronized in the end of the observed period because stream flew again due to the intensive rainfall on 9 3 3 3 temperature contour in the streambed fig 6 portrays a suite of temperature contour tc plots with the hydrograph for the 1 inch wells at well a well b and well c to visualize the transition of percolated stream water and transferred heat the rapid percolation of stream water carried both cool predawn stream water and warm afternoon stream water to a depth of 3 6 m 3 1 m for well b at all wells before 7 28 when stream was flowing however the tc patterns changed for well c on 7 28 fig 6c and well b on 8 1 fig 6b when streamflow ceased at well c then well b in well b fig 6b the increase of daily maximum temperature at the surface of streambed z 0 was not carried by the downwelling of stream water and the previous percolated stream water continued to penetrate into the deeper streambed the mechanisms controlled the heat transfer within the shallow and deep streambeds were significantly different in the shallow streambed the heat transfer was dominated by the heat conduction but in the deep streambed the heat transfer was dominated by the heat convection the damped depth of heat conduction can be approximately identified between the depths of 0 50 1 00 m the process of heat transfer transited from convection dominant to conduction dominant was even more apparent at well c fig 6c the transition occurred from shallow depths and then propagated to deep depths the deepest damped depth of heat conduction was about 1 25 m the heat transfer mechanisms changed from convection to conduction owing to the cease to flow once the stream channels became dry the rapidly declines of streambed water levels due to scarcity of stream recharge fig 3c leaded to the shallow part of streambed transited from saturated to unsaturated the streambed with low water content resulted in the heat transfer transited from convection dominant to conduction dominant and propagated from shallow to deep depths 3 4 vflux results in this study vflux gordon et al 2012 were firstly used to estimate the percolation flux of streambed and associated hydraulic conductivity based on the measured temperatures and water levels in the wells from the up mid and down stream reaches i e wells a b and c by considering the availability of streambed water levels measured data in the 2 inch wells were only used for the models the data during the period of cease to flow were neglected because vflux requires the porous media is fully saturated fig 7 a shows the results of calculated vertical fluxes ranged from 6 83 10 5 1 00 10 4 8 21 10 5 1 66 10 4 and 9 09 10 5 1 62 10 3 m s at wells a b and c respectively the calculated percolations indicated that the downwelling fluxes increased from up to down stream reaches and this phenomenon consisted with the results from the thermographs fig 4 the time varied downwelling fluxes at well a and well b were relative smaller than those at well c the fluxes at well b and well c started to decrease evidently before the streamflow ceased after the occurrence of intensive rainfall on 08 10 08 12 the fluxes at well a increased but those at well c slightly decreased the fluxes at well b before and after the rainfall almost remain relatively the same the streamflow measured at the monitoring wells in the beginning of study period i e 7 1 and 7 14 were used to verify the fluxes calculated by vflux based on the streamflow measurements the averaged losing of streamflows were 9 16 10 2 m3 s and 3 81 10 2 m3 s between well a well b and well b well c respectively based on the results of vflux the total amounts of downwelling flows were 9 72 10 2 m3 s and 3 05 10 2 m3 s between well a well b and well b well c respectively assumed the trapezoid of the stream channel and averaged fluxes calculated from vflux compared these estimated infiltrations to the actual measurements both of flows were almost identical and the results from vflux were verified the calculated percolations were further analyzed with the measured water levels to estimate the vertical hydraulic conductivity vk of streambed the streambed from the surface to the depth of 3 60 m or 3 10 m for well b was assumed homogeneous at each well and the estimated vk varied with time are shown in fig 7b the streambed at well a and well b have the lowest and highest vk respectively the vk at well a slightly decreased before the intensive rainfall on 08 12 but increased significantly from 4 39 10 3 to 8 56 10 4 m s after the rainfall event the vk at well b and well c decreased significantly before the rainfall event but continued to decrease from 1 23 10 2 to 6 8 10 3 m s and from 9 6 10 3 to 6 39 10 3 m s respectively after the rainfall the opposite changes of vk at well a and well b well c after the rainfall event might be controlled by different mechanisms the more detail discussion related to the mechanism will be addressed in the next section 3 5 vs2dh results in order to handle the unsaturated situation in the streambed and verify the calculated results obtained from vflux the numerical model of vs2dh was used to simulate the interaction between stream and underlying streambed for the 2 inch wells the one dimensional numerical model of heat and water flow for each piezometer profile was developed to interpret temperature and head observations and to estimate the specific discharge from river to the streambed q and the vertical hydraulic conductivity of streambed vk based on collected water levels and temperature data the diurnal temperature variations caused by rapidly downwelling flux at the depth of 3 6 m were significantly observed therefore the thermally active zone beneath the yusheng creek is expected to be deeper than 3 6 m besides the core logs from the nearby geological wells provided by central geological survey taiwan indicated the depth of bedrock is about 5 7 m deep if the bedrock is assumed as an impermeable layer the depth of thermally active zone along the yusheng creek should be less than 7 m according to these information the one dimensional models with 10 cm grid blocks were developed and the model domains were set 5 m depth for each profile simulation the top portion of the model domain that is occupied by the stream was modeled as a specified time variable head temperature boundary provided by the pressure transducer deployed at the surface of streambed mini diver the bottom portion of the model domain that is occupied by the groundwater was modeled as a specified time variable head temperature boundary as well the groundwater levels were provided by the pressure transducer installed in the piezometer level troll 400 and the groundwater temperatures were provided by the measurements in the nearby 25 m deep well at the salmon recovery center the rest of the portion of model domain was modeled as a no water and heat flow boundary when the stream ceased to flow at mid and down stream reaches the top portion of the model domain is modeled as a no water flow boundary the setting of numerical model and associated initial parameters are summarized in table 2 homogeneous hydraulic and thermal parameters were set throughout the model domain and the calibrated parameters were subsequently automatically adjusted to minimize sum of square error sse between measured and model data the measured temperatures at the depth of 3 60 m or 3 10 m were used to match model simulations the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities are scale dependent parameters but there is no consensus on how important the parameter of dispersivity is in temperature modeling the range of longitudinal dispersivity can vary between 0 1 and 20 m de marsily 1986 silliman et al 1995 niswonger and prudic 2003 schulze makuch 2005 and some researchers even suggested that the effects of dispersivity are so negligible for small spatial scales i e a value of zero can be used su et al 2004 anderson 2005 munz et al 2011 rau et al 2010 accordingly the sensitivity of longitudinal dispersivity ranging from 0 05 to 10 m was conducted to evaluate the property of scale dependence and its value ranged from 2 54 10 3 to 1 34 10 4 provided as the supplementary material fig s3 the sensitivity was higher with low dispersivity value and almost identical when dispersivity was larger than 1 0 m thus the dispersivities was initially set equal to 0 3 m based on the grain size green et al 1964 and its lower and upper bounds were set equal to 0 03 m and 3 0 m respectively during the model calibration the transverse dispersivities were assumed 0 1 of longitudinal dispersitivies de marsily 1986 and this ratio was kept as a constant through the model calibration in order to verify the time varied changes of streambed vk the entire model was divided into two periods i e before and after the rainfall event on 8 12 the measured temperatures were also divided into associated datasets and used to individually calibrate each model the periods that stream ceased to flow were ignored from the individual calibration for the consistent comparison of vflux results before the rainfall event the simulated time for well a well b and well c were 7 15 8 12 7 15 8 1 and 7 15 7 27 respectively after the rainfall event the simulated time for well a well b and well c were 8 12 9 13 8 12 9 1 and 8 12 8 31 respectively the calibrated results are summarized in table 3 for the entire period the streambed hydraulic conductivities at well b and well c are higher than that at well a these results confirmed that the stream ceased to flow between well b and well c is due to their higher hydraulic conductivity and the channels have the potential with higher downwelling fluxes to the streambed the two period calibrated results showed that the streambed vk at well a increased from 4 68 10 3 to 8 42 10 3 m s after the rainfall event but those at well b and well c decreased from 3 5 10 2 to 7 92 10 3 m s and 1 08 10 2 to 5 67 10 3 m s respectively the significant changes of streambed vk after the rainfall identified by vs2dh was consistent with those calculated by vflux in terms of trends and magnitudes table 3 before 8 12 the vk at well b was larger than that at well c and then at well a fig 7b after 8 12 the vk at well a showed the largest one then at well b and well c fig 8 depicts the results of the one dimensional modeling efforts by vs2dh at well a well b and well c in general the simulated results at all locations can fit the measured data well and the diurnal pattern can be delineated perfectly for well a fig 8a the simulated temperatures obtained from the two period calibrations i e before and after 8 12 perform better than those using the entire observation period as a whole to calibrate the model the improvement from the two period calibration is especially obvious after the rainfall event the effect of streambed vk changes on the temperatures at well a is evident for well b fig 8b the simulated temperatures obtained from one model overestimated underestimated the measured daily maximum minimum temperatures during cease to flow period i e 8 1 8 12 the reason to cause this mismatch might be that stream channel was not entirely dry out and some water extended from the upstream still remained in the nearby channel to infiltrate into the deeper streambed the simulated temperatures obtained from the two period calibrations also perform better compared to those obtained from one model as for well c fig 8c although the simulated temperatures obtained from one model underestimated the measured temperatures when stream is flowing they matched the temperatures very well when the heat transfer transited from convection dominant to conduction dominant i e streamflow ceased the model did not capture the two diurnal cycles of measured temperatures i e 7 28 29 because the streambed above the measured depth was not fully dry out and the residual infiltrated stream water remained in the streambed fig 5c overall the simulated temperatures obtained from the two period calibrations improved significantly compared to those obtained from one model the effect of streambed vk changes on the temperatures at well b and well c is also apparent and its mechanism will be discussed in the next section pest calculates the derivatives of the model outputs with respect to its parameters and provides a measure of the parameter sensitivities doherty 2005 the composite sensitivity is provided by pest as a byproduct of the parameter estimation results the results showed that the simulated temperatures were most sensitive to changes in vk and n but least sensitive to changes in dl table 4 due to high percolated downwelling fluxes with a small spatial scale in this study the calculated sensitivity values were within the expectation 4 discussion 4 1 time varied streambed vertical hydraulic conductivity the significant changes of streambed vk before and after the rainfall event on 8 12 were observed from the results of both vflux and vs2dh the streambed vk at well a increased by about double but those at well b and well c decreased by about 75 and 50 respectively the effect of the rainfall event on the streambed vk at the well a and well b well c was different it believes that the increase of streamflow due to the rainfall should be very similar because the distance from up and down stream reaches is only 500 m no tributary merges within this study reaches and the composition of streambed materials is almost identical the only difference among the wells is that there is always streamflow around well a however the stream had dried out in the reaches around well b and well c before the rainfall event therefore the streamflow conditions might be the key factor resulting in the opposite changes of streambed vk for the upstream reach around well a before the rainfall event fine grains were gradually deposited in the pore spaces of substrates due to the receding streamflow resulting in the gradually decreasing streambed vks fig 7b after the rainfall event the fine grains were very likely removed by the increased streamflow of the event being supported by the increased streambed vk this result consists with previous studies conducted during the flood season doble et al 2012 simpson and meixner 2012 however the decrease of streambed vk at well b and well c after the rainfall event cannot be explained by the fine grain removal mechanism for the mid and down stream reaches around well b and well c respectively it was found that the algae and diatom rapidly bloomed when streamflow gradually receded once the streamflow completely ceased the death of algae and diatom were mixed with fine grains and filled into the pore space or attached to the surface of the streambed substrates to form the clogging layer fig 9 although the intensive rainfall intuitively should be able to remove the sediments away from the substrates the rainfall may not last long enough or this clogging layer of mixed fine grains and organic matters may be more resistant to the streamflow the algae and diatom could also be found at the up stream reach when streamflow was low but the flowing streamflow remained in the channel could support the living algae and diatom the combined effects of cease to flow condition and biological activities should be responsible for the opposite changes of streambed vk after the rainfall event the forming of clogging layer was clearly observed when our team checked the devices and collected data at the field on 8 9 and the dried channel was entirely covered by the white substance attached on the substrate in the streambed fig 9a and b these white samples were collected from the field and conducted the analyses using the scanning electron microscope sem in the laboratory the results showed that the white samples were identified as the diatom and the photos of different types of diatom under sem are shown in fig 9c f 4 2 propagation of cease to flow condition and implication for habitat restoration the results obtained from vflux and vs2dh confirm that the mid stream reach has the largest streambed vk indicating that most stream water lost within this channel section the significant loss downwelling infiltration of stream water within the mid stream can cause the significant decrease of streamflow at the further down stream reach and result in the down stream channel drying out easily the down stream reach ceased to flow first then propagated toward the mid stream reach but never prolonged to the up stream reach the recorded temperatures of two distinct interchange patterns suggested the frequent switch between wet and dry conditions of channel and implied that the cease to flow condition at yusheng creek might be a general circumstance figs 3b c and 6b c the mid and down stream reaches ran dry easily but never happened at the up stream reach during the study period this observation can also be inferred to the heterogeneity of streambed within such a small scale the fragmentation associated consequence i e forming of bio clogging layer and decreasing hydraulic conductivity is like a natural resistance to the fragmentation the clogging layer can prevent the stream water from infiltrating into the streambed and maintain the stream water in the channel if the river restoration can be aimed on decreasing the vertically downwelling fluxes the frequency of fragmentation occurrence can be reduced and the habitats of the endangered formosan landlocked salmon can therefore extend it also implies that the fragmentation potential of selected reaches for reintroduction can be firstly evaluated by testing the vertical hydraulic conductivity 4 3 uncertainty and prospect although 1 d analytical solutions and numerical model were used in this study to estimate the vertical water fluxes and the streambed vk there might be horizontal flow influencing the temperature patterns beneath the streambed roshan et al 2012 cranswick et al 2014 besides the vertical water flux through the streambed would be expected to vary both longitudinally and vertically briggs et al 2012 cuthbert and mackay 2013 hence it is important for a model to capture variability in the vertical component of flux within a 2 d or 3 d flow system cranswick et al 2014 however temperature data are usually collected as vertical profiles and there is often insufficient data to properly constrain a 2 d and 3 d model of the flow system a 1 d model with the advantages of simplicity and ease of use is still preferred over more complex numerical models in a near stream environment because the high vertical percolated fluxes dominated the flow regime beneath the stream the estimated dynamic change of hydraulic properties should be similar with the results obtained by a 2d or 3d model recently the advancements in measurement techniques using fiber optical distributed temperature sensor fo dts selker et al 2006 heat pulse probes lewandowski et al 2011 and forward looking infrared radiation flir torgersen et al 2001 hare et al 2015 have been developed and implemented to partially overcome this challenge these techniques can provide highly detailed and sufficiently accurate longitudinal and vertical water temperature profiles and allow for the development of a 2 d and 3 d model besides a rather intensive effort involving the use of other tracers i e isotopic or chemical analysis can provide sufficient detail information to constrain the flow system and help to discern the heterogeneity of streambed 5 conclusion the temperature and water level data were collected from the stream and monitoring wells installed along the 500 m reach of yusheng creek in taiwan providing the processes of stream and groundwater interaction in the mountain area the temperature dataset allowed for the determination of both direction and magnitude of water fluxes the measurements of groundwater level in the streambed made possible the calculation of streambed hydraulic conductivity vflux was a very useful tool in calculating the variation of water fluxes and estimating the hydraulic characteristics by coupling with water level data vs2dh provided a more sophisticated approach in handling the transient processes of heat advection and heat conduction caused by the appearance of unsaturated zone by indirectly estimating the vertical hydraulic conduction of streambed varied with time the potential mechanisms of hydraulic conductivity changed with time induced by cease to flow condition and biological activities were evaluated stream water were observed to recharge the groundwater through the streambed along the entire monitoring stream reach of yusheng creek the thermographs and temperature contours indicated that the downwelling of flux at the mid and down stream reaches was greater than that at the up stream reach the identified streambed vks from up mid to down stream reaches using vflux and pest were 5 57 10 3 2 72 10 2 and 8 60 10 3 m s respectively when no rainfall occurred for a period the mid and down stream reaches ceased to flow and the groundwater levels drewdown quickly due to short of recharge sources the stream started ceasing at the down stream reach because of higher downwelling fluxes at the mid stream reach and propagated rapidly toward the mid stream reaches the key finding in this study is the dynamic changes of streambed s hydraulic characteristics in terms of space and time the significant changes of streambed vk before and after the intensive rainfall on 8 12 were observed through vflux and vs2dh the streambed vk at the up stream reach increased by about double after the rainfall event from 4 68 10 3 to 8 42 10 3 m s however the vk at the mid and down stream reaches decreased by about 75 and 50 from 3 5 10 2 to 7 92 10 3 m s and 1 08 10 2 to 5 67 10 3 m s respectively the increase of vk at the up stream reach should be related to the removal of fine grains by increased streamflow the decreases of vks at the mid and down stream reaches were caused by the formation of clogging layer when streamflow ceased the clogging layers consisted of died algae and diatom mixed with fine grains and might be resistant to the high streamflow within such a small scale reach the combination of cease to flow condition and bioactivities should be responsible for the opposite changes of streambed vk after the rainfall event which to our knowledge none of the previous studies have demonstrated in the filed study assessing such complicated dynamics of stream groundwater interaction using streambed temperature measurements groundwater level observations one dimensional heat transport modeling can quantitatively determine water flux rates and their directions in shallow streambeds and improve the understanding of its hydraulic characteristics and mechanisms controlling surface water groundwater exchange between stream and streambeds the thermal and hydrological information not only helps hydrologists understand the patterns of stream exchanges with shallow groundwater along the creek but is also useful to geochemists and microbiologists to linking microbes and chemical processes with the stream ecological environment the results obtained from this study can be used by the government or

5616,rainfall interception by the forest canopy plays an important role in the water budget by removing water from the terrestrial hydrologic cycle as an atmospheric loss effective models of canopy interception are critical for simulating the water budget and river flows over the years several models have been developed to simulate canopy interception few comparative studies have been conducted that assess how well these models simulate measured interception this study compared five mechanistic canopy interception models including the rutter rutter sparse gash gash sparse and liu models the objective of the study was to use an objective automatic calibration to compare how the models behave relative to each other the objective of the study was not to establish definitive optimal parameter sets each interception model was calibrated independently using the parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis program pest an automatic parameter estimation routine the five models were calibrated using field measurements from an eastern deciduous forest dominated by american beech and yellow poplar under leafed and leafless conditions the models performed well in predicting cumulative interception with errors ranging between 0 0 and 14 9 however model performance declined when assessing individual rainfall events where the coefficient of determination r2 between measured and modeled interception events ranged between 0 21 and 0 48 the models were unable to simulate very low or very high levels of interception measured interception ranged between 0 2 and 12 2 mm while modeled interception only ranged between 1 2 and 6 9 mm the inability of the models to satisfactorily simulate measured interception is likely due to 1 errors in parameter ranges 2 measurement errors and or 3 a fundamental misunderstanding of interception mechanics these results indicate an important gap in our ability to understand a substantial portion of the water budget keywords interception forest canopy pest parameterization model evaluation rainfall 1 introduction interception is an important part of the water balance and can account for up to 50 of total precipitation depending on meteorological and canopy characteristics llorens et al 1997 roth et al 2007 sadeghi et al 2018 siegert et al 2017b there are many different models available for simulating forest canopy interception of rainfall including simple regression models e g helvey and patric 1965 physically based models e g gash 1979 rutter et al 1972 and stochastic models e g calder 1996 muzylo et al 2009 describe 15 different canopy interception models and summarize 111 individual model applications muzylo et al 2009 also describe two commonly used physically based model types the rutter type and gash type rutter type models are numerical models that keep a running balance of rainfall canopy storage trunk storage drainage and evaporation over the course of a storm event rutter and morton 1977 rutter et al 1975 rutter et al 1972 gash type models are analytical interpretations of the rutter type models gash 1979 sparse models simulate interception and evapotranspiration decrease in sparse canopies gash et al 1995 valente et al 1997 physically based models e g rutter and gash types receive the majority of attention in interception studies see table 3 in muzylo et al 2009 rutter and gash type models simulate single storm events however the calibration of these models has largely been conducted over monthly or longer time periods where cumulative interception was the objective function calibrating cumulative interception from single storm models presents a dilemma whereby the model formulation at the single storm event is not tested nonetheless many of the calibrations that simulate cumulative interception have been successful for example the rutter model achieved an average monthly error of 11 in corsican pine douglas fir norway spruce hornbeam and oak stands rutter et al 1975 the original gash model achieved an error of 5 based on cumulative interception over a period of two years using a 4 week time step in a pine forest gash 1979 the gash sparse model achieved an error of 5 based on cumulative interception over a period of one year in a maritime pine stand gash et al 1995 and errors of between 4 3 and 15 9 in pine oak and mixed pine oak stands based on cumulative interception over a period of one year návar 2013 surprisingly there are few studies that report model accuracy of individual storms the studies that do report model accuracy at the single storm event show more error compared to those studies that report cumulative model accuracy for example klingaman et al 2007 compared three canopy interception models at both a cumulative and single storm timestep in a leafless mixed deciduous forest the models that they tested included the gash 1979 mulder 1985 a rutter type model and wimo models hörmann et al 1996 a gash type model these models were successful in predicting cumulative interception with the mulder model overestimating by 3 2 and the wimo and gash models underestimating by 9 5 and 17 8 respectively but the same three models were much less accurate in predicting interception of individual storm events with an r2 of 0 12 for the mulder model 0 16 for the gash model and 0 26 for the wimo model the liu model is a physical model designed to run at any temporal resolution the liu model achieved an r2 of 0 89 on a weekly time step liu 1997 massman 1983 achieved an r2 between 0 52 and 0 93 for individual storms in a single old growth douglas fir using a model that explicitly simulated drip while massman s results are very promising the single tree study presents simplified conditions compared to stand level studies while there are many studies that report results from individual models there are fewer studies that compare how models perform klingaman et al 2007 lankreijer et al 1993 linhoss and siegert 2016 muzylo et al 2009 valente et al 1997 these studies have largely neglected the calibration process model calibration is an important step that ensures optimized results based on the range of physically based and realistic parameter values model calibration can also be used to identify flaws in how systems are perceived and modeled for example if during calibration an in stream model is unable to match peak flows the modeler may investigate if the model is parameterized wrong or if there might be a conceptual flaw in the model calibration is especially crucial in interception modeling where many parameters are empirical and cannot be measured directly ideally calibration should use an automatic parameter estimation routine that systematically explores the physically realistic parametric space to achieve optimized results and minimize modeler bias in parameter estimation in a model comparison an automatic parameter estimation routine is especially important to ensure objective results there are very few studies that used an automatic parameter estimation routine to calibrate an interception model one such study performed by vrugt et al 2003 used a shuffled complex evolution metropolis scem ua optimization algorithm to calibrate a multi layer interception model that is based on the rutter model to date the authors are unaware of any studies that have used an automatic parameter estimation routine to compare interception models even though such an exercise could provide insights into model performance accordingly the objectives of this study were to 1 use an automatic calibration routine to estimate and compare canopy parameters in five forest canopy rainfall interception models 2 compare the model outputs based on their fit to cumulative and event based measured data of interception and 3 identify where limitations in the models exist the objective of this study was not to establish definitive optimal parameter sets this novel approach to an interception model comparison provides a robust and objective analysis of five popular physically based interception models and identifies specific areas for model improvement in future work 2 methods the following section describes the study site interception models their equations and the calibration methodology each interception model simulated a single storm event assumed a previously dry canopy and used the penman monteith equation to calculate evaporation allen et al 1998 model validation was not conducted 2 1 study site and measured data data were collected at fair hill natural resources

spring 308 mm and winter 262 mm frontal precipitation patterns are typical for fall winter and spring while convective precipitation events dominate the summer siegert et al 2017a the research plot is located within a 12 ha forested catchment with a stand density of 225 trees ha 1 a stand basal area of 36 8 m2 ha 1 a mean diameter at breast height dbh of 40 8 cm and a mean tree height of 27 8 m the forest canopy is comprised of yellow poplar liriodendron tulipifera l american beech fagus grandifolia ehrh red maple acer rubrum l and white oak quercus alba l the dominant canopy trees are approximately 80 to 100 years old with a leaf area index lai of 5 3 m2 m 2 the canopy was fully leafed between may and september while leafless conditions occurred between october and april throughfall and stemflow volumetric flux were measured using stationary tipping bucket gauges te525 mm texas electronics dallas tx usa attached to a centrally located datalogger and recorded data every five minutes cr1000 campbell scientific logan utah usa a separate te525mm gage was located in a nearby clearing with a fully equipped meteorological station to record gross precipitation that is part of the delaware environmental observing system deos udel edu the meteorological station recorded air temperature relative humidity solar radiation wind speed and direction and soil moisture continuously and aggregated those values to 5 minute intervals these data were used for the meteorological model inputs a total of four tipping buckets gauges measured throughfall two were placed under american beech canopy and two were placed under yellow poplar canopy stemflow collars were installed on three representative canopy trees of each species by fitting 31 8 mm vinyl tubing cut longitudinally that drained into tipping buckets to monitor stemflow a description of the stemflow collar construction and implementation can be found in levia et al 2010 stemflow throughfall and rainfall data were recorded from january 2008 through august 2011 tipping buckets are subject to clogging with particulate organic matter and under sampling of during high rainfall intensities these issues have been addressed in previous studies at this research site levia et al 2010 with the same quality analysis and quality control attention for the additional data points presented within throughout the study data were inspected and removed when clogging was apparent or when rainfall rates exceeded gauge capacities data are available for 41 storms and 552 mm of cumulative rainfall under leafed american beech conditions for 65 storms and 1305 mm of cumulative rainfall under leafless american beech conditions for 39 storms and 567 mm of cumulative rainfall under leafed yellow popular conditions and for 62 storms and 1146 mm of cumulative rainfall under leafless yellow poplar conditions fig 1 in each rainfall event precipitation ranged between 3 and 61 mm and storm duration ranged between 0 4 and 62 0 h the average coefficient of variation of measurements between the two tipping buckets during individual storm events for throughfall under american beech was 0 11 range 0 00 0 45 and under yellow poplar was 0 12 range 0 00 0 55 the average coefficient of variation of measurements between the three stemflow collars during individual storm events from american beech was 0 12 range 0 00 0 81 and under yellow poplar was 0 36 range 0 00 1 41 these data provide more than 3 years of continuous monitoring beneath the crown of individual trees that isolate the impact of throughfall and stemflow by individual species in this way the data are able to highlight the contributions of specific tree species which is critical in understanding how model parameters are calibrated for canopy characteristics that vary among tree species 2 2 models five canopy interception models were compared including the rutter rutter sparse gash gash sparse and liu models the models each simulated single storm events based on the measured data from the study site modeled interception was compared to measured interception using both cumulative and single storm timescales linhoss and siegert 2016 present model descriptions equations and results from a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis for all five models so only a brief summary of each model is provided here the rutter model provided the groundwork for current interception modeling rutter and morton 1977 rutter et al 1975 rutter et al 1972 the rutter model is a numerical model that simulates canopy water storage trunk water storage rate of drainage from the canopy evaporation from the canopy stemflow and evaporation from the trunk parameters in the rutter model include maximum canopy storage capacity s maximum trunk storage capacity st the free throughfall coefficient p the stemflow coefficient pt evaporation from the trunk as a proportion of the evaporation from the saturated canopy the rate of water dripping from the canopy when canopy storage capacity has been reached d s and an empirical drainage parameter b parameters in the model equations b and s were calibrated based on empirical measurements from a corsican pine stand pinus nigra the rutter sparse model was developed in portugal with field observations from a sparse eucalypt and pine forests parameters in the rutter sparse model include maximum canopy storage capacity s maximum trunk storage capacity st canopy cover c a drainage partitioning coefficient p d and trunk evaporation as a proportion of evaporation from the saturated canopy over the years a number of analytical models based on the rutter model have been developed one of the first was the gash model 1979 which treats rainfall events as three categories 1 the canopy wetting phase 2 the canopy saturation phase and 3 the canopy drying phase parameters in the gash model include maximum canopy storage capacity s maximum trunk storage capacity st the free throughfall coefficient p and the stemflow coefficient pt the gash sparse canopy model gash et al 1995 provides an improvement to the original gash model this model estimates evaporation based on canopy area rather than the ground area parameters in the gash sparse model include maximum canopy storage capacity s maximum trunk storage capacity st canopy cover c and the stemflow coefficient pt the liu model is also based on the rutter model it was developed to minimize data requirements by using only three parameters including maximum canopy storage capacity s maximum trunk storage capacity st and the free throughfall coefficient p liu 1997 2001 to reduce the number of parameters the model removes the dynamic prediction of stem interception and discards the empirical drainage parameters liu 2001 the liu model was developed based on data from cypress wetlands taxodium distichum and slash pine uplands pinus elliottii and explained 89 of interception variability in these stands the single storm form of the liu model assumes a dry canopy at the model start liu 1997 2001 2 3 parameter ranges each of the models used 1 measured precipitation 2 evaporation calculated from the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and 3 canopy characteristics to simulate canopy interception the current study involved manipulating only the canopy characteristics for each model to reach an optimal fit between measured and simulated interception the probability density functions pdfs for model parameters were developed from literature values of temperate forest conditions across a range of species assemblages and stand types i e hardwoods pines and mixed bottomlands and uplands unmanaged and plantation table 1 using literature values to bound the pdf s ensured that the optimized parameter values represented realistic and physically based values the pdf for canopy storage capacity s was u 0 29 2 24 bryant et al 2005 herbst et al 2008 návar 2013 šraj et al 2008 xiao and mcpherson 2016 the pdf for the free canopy cover c was u 0 43 0 95 bryant et al 2005 návar 2013 trunk storage capacity st was u 0 0037 0 9800 bryant et al 2005 herbst et al 2008 limousin et al 2008 návar 2013 šraj et al 2008 xiao and mcpherson 2016 the pdf for canopy drip when canopy storage capacity is reached ds was u 0 024 0 74 massman 1983 the pdf for the empirical drainage parameter b was u 3 0 4 6 rutter et al 1972 the pdf for the free throughfall coefficient p was u 0 06 0 55 herbst et al 2008 šraj et al 2008 the pdf for the stemflow coefficient pt was u 0 0031 0 06 bryant et al 2005 návar 2013 the pdfs for the drainage partitioning coefficient pd and trunk evaporation as a proportion of evaporation from the saturated canopy were u 0 0076 0 0324 and u 0 022 0 024 respectively valente et al 1997 the parameter pdfs contain uncertainty for two main reasons first there are limited numbers of studies that these pdf s are based on second many of the parameters are empirically derived and therefore cannot be directly measured to account for this uncertainty and to ensure that all possible parametric space was explored wide parameter pdf s were also developed table 1 these wide pdf s are approximately 5 times as wide as the regular pdfs which were based on literature values note that these wide pdfs are not physically realistic they were solely developed to understand if model behavior improved under relaxed parametric constraints 2 4 pest calibration the models were individually calibrated using the model independent parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis pest version 13 6 software doherty 2005 pest 2016 pest is a nonlinear parameter estimator it employs the gauss marquardt levenberg gml method to find the optimal parameter set to minimize the sum of the square errors between measured and modeled data the pest algorithm is given in eq 1 here x is a matrix of m n dimensions that relates model parameters vector b with order n to the modeled system response vector c with order m the modeled system response c should have corresponding measured values to enable a comparison of the modeled results to the measured results 1 x b c an optimal parameter set is defined as a set with the minimum sum of squared deviations between the modeled system response and field observations the vector b that minimizes the sum of squared deviations between the model response c and field observations c is given in eq 2 eq 2 requires that the number of observations exceeds the number of parameters 2 b x t x 1 x t c pest has a number of advantages over similar parameter optimization software it is model independent free open source well documented and frequently referenced in the literature in highly nonlinear models and models that may have more than one objective function minima whereby the calibration process can descend into a valley and find a good fit without exploring all of the parametric space it may be difficult to find a global minimum objective function using pest doherty 2005 the initial value that is provided for each parameter should represent the best guess of the true value this value is important for optimizing stability and was based on the mean of the literature values table 1 in systems containing high observation errors and or sparse observations pest may fail to yield a solution goegebeur and pauwels 2007 the condition number is an indication of the successful calculation of an optimal unique solution a high condition number greater than 104 indicates that a unique solution was not found a detailed descript of the pest algorithms can be found in doherty 2005 in complex models with numerous parameters there is a risk of overparameterization beven 1993 2006 the risks related to overparameterization in this study is relatively low for two reasons first the interception models used only three to six calibration parameters to simulate interception second the goal of the study was not to identify optimal parameter sets for use in making predictions instead the goal of the study was to compare model behavior by looking at the optimized parameter sets and the optimized model behavior finally another drawback of automatic parameter estimation routines in general is the fact that functional interactions between the optimized parameter values is not accounted for risking over parameterization realistic ranges for parameter values are input into the calibration routine however realistic relationships between the optimized parameter sets is not accounted for 3 results the gash gash sparse rutter rutter sparse and liu models were each calibrated independently based on measured interception and climatic data from an american beech and yellow poplar stand under leafed and leafless conditions respectively the objective function was a minimized sum of squared errors between measured and modeled individual rainfall events the models were not calibrated to cumulative interception to compute cumulative interception interception was summed for the individual storm events each simulation gave a low condition number indicating that a unique and optimal solution was found the condition number was under 50 for the rutter simulations and under 10 for all other simulations 3 1 model calibrated parameters a summary of the calibrated parameters is given in table 2 normalized ranges for each of the calibrated parameters are shown in fig 2 the following paragraphs describe the results shown in table 2 and fig 2 the calibration process provided no prior information regarding leafed versus leafless conditions or for american beech versus yellow poplar canopies besides the inherent differences in field observed values of interception for example from a mechanistic viewpoint maximum canopy storage s should be higher under leafed conditions and lower under leafless conditions however the calibration process received the same input pdf for s in both the leafed and leafless conditions in every simulation but one s calibrated to a higher value under leafed conditions versus leafless conditions table 2 the exception was the for the rutter yellow poplar model where s calibrated to 1 74 mm under leafed conditions and 1 77 mm under leafless conditions this shows that without any prior knowledge most of the calibrated models stored more water in the canopy under leafed conditions and that the empirical calibration process was able to represent actual mechanistic processes the relationship between the stemflow coefficient pt and interception is more complex a higher stemflow coefficient means that there was more water diverted to trunk storage resulting in higher overall interception table 2 shows that the stemflow coefficient calibrated to higher values under leafed versus leafless conditions in every model run where it was used except for the case of the rutter yellow poplar table 2 these values are centered around the pdf mean for pt fig 2 suggesting that the model values of stemflow are consistent with values reported in the literature larger stemflow coefficient values in the leafed period equated to greater trunk storage and lower stemflow production which is consistent with decades of field observations in which stemflow production is greater during leafless conditions than during leafed brown and barker 1970 siegert and levia 2014 staelens et al 2008 it is likely that the models were trying to direct more stemflow to trunk storage in the leafed season to achieve higher overall water storage and less throughfall in contrast the reduced demand for canopy storage in the leafless season reduces the pressure of the models to force stemflow into trunk storage 3 2 measured vs modeled interception cumulative storms the percent error of measured versus modeled cumulative interception over the 3 5 years of data collection ranged between 14 9 and 9 8 table 3 in general the gash sparse model resulted in the smallest errors while the rutter sparse model resulted in the largest errors across species and seasons the rutter model performed well for yellow poplar especially in the leafless season but had errors greater than 5 for american beech in both seasons the liu model had small errors less than 2 in the leafless season but had larger errors in the leafed season for both species in contrast the gash model had small errors less than 2 in the leafed season but had larger errors in the leafless season 3 3 measured vs modeled interception individual storms bar plots show the measured and modeled interception for individual storm event under all of the five models gash gash sparse rutter rutter sparse and liu fig 3 scatterplots also show the same individual simulations for measured versus modeled results fig 4 the similarity in the results illustrates the similarity between model function figs 3 and 4 none of the models were able to simulate very high or very low levels of interception the measured range in interception varied from 0 19 to 12 0 mm a range of 12 0 mm across all five models the maximum range in modeled interception varied between 1 2 and 6 9 mm a range of 5 7 mm as such the range in measured interception was over twice as large as the range in modeled interception 12 0 mm versus 5 7 mm all of the models did a rather poor job simulating interception under individual interception events r2 values ranged between 0 21 and 0 48 root mean squared errors ranged between 1 7 and 2 0 mm and the mean of the absolute value of the percent error for each storm event ranged between 73 and 145 table 4 the mean of the absolute value of the percent error for each storm event table 4 is provided to compare the error in individual storm events to the error in the cumulative storm events percent error table 3 the models were weaker in the leafed season for both species compared to the leafless season table 4 for american beech the percent difference in r2 improved across models from the leafed to the leafless season on average by 22 while the r2 for yellow poplar interception improved 55 the gash sparse model showed the most leafed to leafless season r2 improvement for both american beech 32 and yellow poplar 71 the liu model returned slightly higher r2 values than other models by species within their respective season except for yellow poplar during leafed conditions table 4 higher accuracy along with the parsimony of parameters involved in the liu model indicates that the liu model may be considered the best model under these conditions the automatic calibration was also performed using the wide pdfs table 1 to determine whether the regular pdfs constrained model behavior widening the parameter pdf s did improve model behavior to some extent the r2 for the calibrated models under the wide parameter ranges was between 0 33 and 0 62 with an average r2 of 0 49 the root mean squared error for the calibrated models under the wide parameter ranges was between 1 44 and 2 14 with an average root mean squared error of 1 68 similar to the results for the regular parameter pdfs when using the wide parameter pdfs none of the models were able to simulate very high or very low levels of interception however the wide parameter pdf s did enable somewhat more dynamics across all five models the maximum range in modeled interception using the wide parameter pdfs varied between 0 8 and 8 9 mm a range of 8 1 mm as such the range in measured interception was 1 5 times as large as the range in modeled interception under the wide parameter pdfs 12 0 mm versus 8 1 mm we do not detail the results from the wide parameter pdfs further because the calibrated parameters are not necessarily physically representative of the system a residual analysis at the event based scale was conducted to better understand systematic model bias under the regular parameter pdfs this analysis compared residuals to modeled interception as well as to each of the climatic measurements including precipitation duration intensity humidity wind speed and temperature the analysis showed little correlation between modeled interception and residuals r2 between 0 02 and 0 18 fig 5 these residual plots show an x y bias where most of the predictions were slightly too high but some were much too low the residual plots also show a degree of heteroscedasticity where the residuals tend to get larger with increasing modeled interception the r2 comparing precipitation and residuals ranged between 0 13 and 0 40 the r2 comparing the climatic variables and residuals ranged between 0 00 and 0 16 4 discussion in this study we employed an automatic parameterization routine to compare five similar but different interception models our results demonstrate how similar the models behave in their estimation of canopy interception and ability to simulate interception dynamics the five interception models were able to successfully simulate cumulative interception however they were not able to accurately simulate interception during individual rainfall events most canopy interception studies report cumulative percent error between modeled versus measured canopy interception gash et al 1995 návar 2013 valente et al 1997 fewer studies report the percent error associated with individual rainfall events or the coefficient of determination r2 between individually measured and modeled rainfall events klingaman et al 2007 massman 1983 rutter et al 1975 cumulative error is useful in understanding long term trends and in hydrologic modeling under monthly or annual time steps reporting the error associated with individual rainfall events is more useful when looking at smaller time steps many hydrologic models hspf butcher et al 2014 i tree hydro livesley et al 2014 swat lin et al 2015 and topmodel niu et al 2005 are run on a daily or sub daily time step where it is important to have good estimations of interception for individual storm events our study shows that reporting cumulative interception hides the error that may be present in measurements or simulations of interception during individual rainfall events as such interception modeling studies should report cumulative and single storm summary statistics a previous study by linhoss and siegert 2016 along with the current study both highlight the similarity between the five interception models linhoss and siegert 2016 used a global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis to compare the same five interception models the 2016 study found that all of the models demonstrated similar degrees of uncertainty with confidence intervals ranging between 3 and 5 mm based on five years of simulated storm events in mississippi usa linhoss and siegert 2016 also showed that precipitation storm duration solar radiation and canopy storage capacity were the most important parameters in all of the models excluding climatic variables which were not perturbed and held constant in the calibration study the linhoss and siegert 2016 global sensitivity analysis showed that the most important canopy characteristics in the models were canopy storage capacity s trunk storage capacity st and canopy cover c our current study showed that canopy storage capacity s and trunk storage capacity st both calibrated towards the upper end of their pdfs therefore the models used two of the most important canopy characteristics to increase trunk storage and canopy storage table 2 during individual storm events the models were all unable to simulate low and high levels of measured interception as a result the models were unable to simulate the variability in the measured interception there were separate reasons for the models inability to simulate low versus high levels of interception it was impossible for the models to simulate high levels of interception because of the regular pdfs that were defined for s and st derived from literature and representative of values used in interception studies to date and also et calculated by the penman montieth equation the maximum evapotranspiration et from the simulated storms was 5 07 mm the maximum canopy storage s was 2 24 mm and the maximum trunk storage st was 0 98 mm given these ranges of parameter values and not accounting for free throughfall p stemflow pt drainage partitioning pd or canopy drip ds simulated interception could not exceed 8 29 mm measurements however showed interception sometimes exceeding 8 mm and frequently exceeding 6 mm using in situ whole tree mechanical displacement sensors friesen et al 2008 estimated total canopy interception to be 6 45 mm which is three times larger than most values cited in the literature while this value does not account for intra event evaporation it supports our findings and others klaassen et al 1998 that canopy storage and subsequently total interception may be greater than what the models are able to simulate the models were also unable to simulate low levels of interception this may be a function of model structure in that the models do not simulate the existence or magnitude of drip effects that deplete canopy and or trunk storage before the storage s are filled it may also be a function of inaccuracies in measured data discussed below more research is necessary to understand this discrepancy the poor performance of the models in simulating individual rainfall events could be a result of 1 narrow parameter pdfs 2 measurement errors and or 3 conceptual error in the models below we discuss each of these possibilities in turn first there is a possibility that the regular parameter pdfs which were used in calibration are too narrow these parameter pdfs were defined from a limited set of literature values which may not represent the studies field conditions and or may contain errors in response wide parameter pdfs were developed and run through the automatic calibration routine to investigate if the parameter pdfs constricted model performance these wide pdfs are not physically realistic and their results should not be considered valid they simply served to illustrate how model behavior improved under relaxed parametric constraints widening the parameter pdfs improved model results of individual storm events to some extent for example the r2 under the regular pdfs varied between 0 21 and 0 48 while the r2 under the wide pdfs ranged between 0 33 and 0 62 this analysis shows that some error can be attributed to the narrow parameter pdf ranges however the pdf ranges are not only reason for poor model performance second the measurements of throughfall and stemflow include some error and may explain a portion of the poor model performance the interception measurements used 2 tipping buckets and 3 stemflow collars on each tree species during each storm event variations in canopy cover are likely to introduce some artificial spatial variation in the measurements of throughfall and stemflow the average coefficient of variation for the measurements of throughfall and stemflow during individual storm events from each stand which were reported in the methods section gives some indication of the spatial error in these measurements more work should be done to understand how the measurement variance contributes to poor model performance third poor model performance may be due to how we understand the mechanistic interception process and resulting conceptual errors in the models the current models are essentially bucket models that assume that there is a fixed value for maximum canopy storage capacity in the models all of the rainfall that occurs after canopy storage capacity is reached becomes throughfall not accounting for et in reality canopy storage is rarely saturated and follows an asymptotic curve keim et al 2005 xiao and mcpherson 2016 also storage by bark and stem surfaces responds to rainfall events in a much different way than storage by canopy foliage herwitz 1985 for example levia et al 2011 showed that difference in rainfall intensity can initiate new stemflow pathways on tree trunks while wind driven rainfall preferentially wets more stem surface area than vertical rainfall van stan et al 2011 likewise localized trunk storage occurs throughout the duration of rainfall events but rarely reaches complete saturation furthermore it is well established that more rainfall is diverted to stemflow production in the leafless dormant season dunkerley 2014 siegert and levia 2014 but the distribution of within event stem interception versus canopy interception as a whole remains unstudied canopy interception models assume a dry canopy at the onset of individual events such that canopy and trunk storage are empty in the real world this is not always the case nor is it likely especially for bark storage which may always retain some hygroscopic water and or water from xylem exchange levia and herwitz 2005 zweifel et al 2000 in turn this would mean stem storage was already partially filled and make it less important in the subsequent model runs but our calibration exercise shows that the models want to divert more water into trunk storage suggesting that the initial input values are not large enough other recent work supports this preliminary hypothesis and model results li et al 2016 used rainfall simulation experiments to isolate process based mechanisms of canopy interception and identified three phases including an initial rapid wetting phase accounting for the majority of interception a stable phase and a post rainfall drainage phase among the four tree species used in this experiment some displayed correlations with only rainfall intensity while leaf and branch traits were strongly correlated with interception in others iida et al 2017 found similar temporal trends in canopy interception and identified wetting and water storage as key mechanisms to be considered in interception models their findings also highlight the importance of canopy storage up to 7 2 mm with 70 90 intercepted by woody surfaces and its likely underestimation to explain the missing water that has heretofore been ascribed to wet canopy evaporation van dijk et al 2015 wind may also play an important role in interception beyond its effects on evapotranspiration for example herwitz and slye 1995 adapted the gash model to account for the positive effect of wind on canopy storage in a cyclone prone tropical system their assumption was that higher and more prominent tree crowns intercept more rainfall under lateral wind driven rain and as a result produce rain shadows for the less prominent tree crowns even under normal rainfall conditions wind driven rain preferentially wets stem surface and diverts an increased proportion of rainfall to stem storage and or stemflow van stan et al 2011 in contrast other studies have found that wind aids in intra event evaporation of water from canopy surfaces which resets canopy storage capacity and increases interception staelens et al 2008 toba and ohta 2008 the optimized parameter values in this study should not be considered optimized in the sense that they represent real world values because of the nature of the automatic calibration routine this study does not place confidence in the optimized parameter values furthermore the optimized parameter sets should not be generalized and only apply to the specific study site in which interception was measured the study does evaluate trends in the parameter values to gain better insight into mechanistic processes and options for measurement and model improvement 5 conclusion this paper presents a novel method for comparing rainfall interception models using automatic parameterization the benefits of this technique are fourfold first the method is unbiased second the method allows for a comparison of optimized results optimized results indicate which model is the best at reproducing measured results third the method allows for a comparison of optimized parameter sets fourth the method provides insight into the models functionality in our example the models all behaved similarly in their inability to simulate high and low levels of interception in the discussion we examine how errors in 1 parameter pdfs 2 measurements and 3 the conceptual model of canopy interception may be the cause of poor model performance more study is required to partition these errors to the model output error based upon optimized parameter fitting our findings suggest that storage compartments both foliar and trunk are underutilized in the models improvements may be through better measurements of canopy and trunk storage as well as a better understanding of how those storages fill up and empty during a storm for foliar storage lai can be estimated from litterfall collections aber 1979 plant canopy analyzers chen 1996 hemispherical photos zhang et al 2005 or remote sensing platforms garrigues et al 2008 estimating bark water storage capacity has garnered much less attention herwitz 1985 levia and herwitz 2005 van stan et al 2016 and as such is much less refined therefore efforts should be focused on improving the accuracy of this parameter across forest types and conditions there are countless models that simulate the various components of the hydrologic cycle while model building is an important step in moving hydrologic sciences forward this paper shows that critical model evaluation is also important new models should not be developed without a strong understanding of the

5616,rainfall interception by the forest canopy plays an important role in the water budget by removing water from the terrestrial hydrologic cycle as an atmospheric loss effective models of canopy interception are critical for simulating the water budget and river flows over the years several models have been developed to simulate canopy interception few comparative studies have been conducted that assess how well these models simulate measured interception this study compared five mechanistic canopy interception models including the rutter rutter sparse gash gash sparse and liu models the objective of the study was to use an objective automatic calibration to compare how the models behave relative to each other the objective of the study was not to establish definitive optimal parameter sets each interception model was calibrated independently using the parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis program pest an automatic parameter estimation routine the five models were calibrated using field measurements from an eastern deciduous forest dominated by american beech and yellow poplar under leafed and leafless conditions the models performed well in predicting cumulative interception with errors ranging between 0 0 and 14 9 however model performance declined when assessing individual rainfall events where the coefficient of determination r2 between measured and modeled interception events ranged between 0 21 and 0 48 the models were unable to simulate very low or very high levels of interception measured interception ranged between 0 2 and 12 2 mm while modeled interception only ranged between 1 2 and 6 9 mm the inability of the models to satisfactorily simulate measured interception is likely due to 1 errors in parameter ranges 2 measurement errors and or 3 a fundamental misunderstanding of interception mechanics these results indicate an important gap in our ability to understand a substantial portion of the water budget keywords interception forest canopy pest parameterization model evaluation rainfall 1 introduction interception is an important part of the water balance and can account for up to 50 of total precipitation depending on meteorological and canopy characteristics llorens et al 1997 roth et al 2007 sadeghi et al 2018 siegert et al 2017b there are many different models available for simulating forest canopy interception of rainfall including simple regression models e g helvey and patric 1965 physically based models e g gash 1979 rutter et al 1972 and stochastic models e g calder 1996 muzylo et al 2009 describe 15 different canopy interception models and summarize 111 individual model applications muzylo et al 2009 also describe two commonly used physically based model types the rutter type and gash type rutter type models are numerical models that keep a running balance of rainfall canopy storage trunk storage drainage and evaporation over the course of a storm event rutter and morton 1977 rutter et al 1975 rutter et al 1972 gash type models are analytical interpretations of the rutter type models gash 1979 sparse models simulate interception and evapotranspiration decrease in sparse canopies gash et al 1995 valente et al 1997 physically based models e g rutter and gash types receive the majority of attention in interception studies see table 3 in muzylo et al 2009 rutter and gash type models simulate single storm events however the calibration of these models has largely been conducted over monthly or longer time periods where cumulative interception was the objective function calibrating cumulative interception from single storm models presents a dilemma whereby the model formulation at the single storm event is not tested nonetheless many of the calibrations that simulate cumulative interception have been successful for example the rutter model achieved an average monthly error of 11 in corsican pine douglas fir norway spruce hornbeam and oak stands rutter et al 1975 the original gash model achieved an error of 5 based on cumulative interception over a period of two years using a 4 week time step in a pine forest gash 1979 the gash sparse model achieved an error of 5 based on cumulative interception over a period of one year in a maritime pine stand gash et al 1995 and errors of between 4 3 and 15 9 in pine oak and mixed pine oak stands based on cumulative interception over a period of one year návar 2013 surprisingly there are few studies that report model accuracy of individual storms the studies that do report model accuracy at the single storm event show more error compared to those studies that report cumulative model accuracy for example klingaman et al 2007 compared three canopy interception models at both a cumulative and single storm timestep in a leafless mixed deciduous forest the models that they tested included the gash 1979 mulder 1985 a rutter type model and wimo models hörmann et al 1996 a gash type model these models were successful in predicting cumulative interception with the mulder model overestimating by 3 2 and the wimo and gash models underestimating by 9 5 and 17 8 respectively but the same three models were much less accurate in predicting interception of individual storm events with an r2 of 0 12 for the mulder model 0 16 for the gash model and 0 26 for the wimo model the liu model is a physical model designed to run at any temporal resolution the liu model achieved an r2 of 0 89 on a weekly time step liu 1997 massman 1983 achieved an r2 between 0 52 and 0 93 for individual storms in a single old growth douglas fir using a model that explicitly simulated drip while massman s results are very promising the single tree study presents simplified conditions compared to stand level studies while there are many studies that report results from individual models there are fewer studies that compare how models perform klingaman et al 2007 lankreijer et al 1993 linhoss and siegert 2016 muzylo et al 2009 valente et al 1997 these studies have largely neglected the calibration process model calibration is an important step that ensures optimized results based on the range of physically based and realistic parameter values model calibration can also be used to identify flaws in how systems are perceived and modeled for example if during calibration an in stream model is unable to match peak flows the modeler may investigate if the model is parameterized wrong or if there might be a conceptual flaw in the model calibration is especially crucial in interception modeling where many parameters are empirical and cannot be measured directly ideally calibration should use an automatic parameter estimation routine that systematically explores the physically realistic parametric space to achieve optimized results and minimize modeler bias in parameter estimation in a model comparison an automatic parameter estimation routine is especially important to ensure objective results there are very few studies that used an automatic parameter estimation routine to calibrate an interception model one such study performed by vrugt et al 2003 used a shuffled complex evolution metropolis scem ua optimization algorithm to calibrate a multi layer interception model that is based on the rutter model to date the authors are unaware of any studies that have used an automatic parameter estimation routine to compare interception models even though such an exercise could provide insights into model performance accordingly the objectives of this study were to 1 use an automatic calibration routine to estimate and compare canopy parameters in five forest canopy rainfall interception models 2 compare the model outputs based on their fit to cumulative and event based measured data of interception and 3 identify where limitations in the models exist the objective of this study was not to establish definitive optimal parameter sets this novel approach to an interception model comparison provides a robust and objective analysis of five popular physically based interception models and identifies specific areas for model improvement in future work 2 methods the following section describes the study site interception models their equations and the calibration methodology each interception model simulated a single storm event assumed a previously dry canopy and used the penman monteith equation to calculate evaporation allen et al 1998 model validation was not conducted 2 1 study site and measured data data were collected at fair hill natural resources

spring 308 mm and winter 262 mm frontal precipitation patterns are typical for fall winter and spring while convective precipitation events dominate the summer siegert et al 2017a the research plot is located within a 12 ha forested catchment with a stand density of 225 trees ha 1 a stand basal area of 36 8 m2 ha 1 a mean diameter at breast height dbh of 40 8 cm and a mean tree height of 27 8 m the forest canopy is comprised of yellow poplar liriodendron tulipifera l american beech fagus grandifolia ehrh red maple acer rubrum l and white oak quercus alba l the dominant canopy trees are approximately 80 to 100 years old with a leaf area index lai of 5 3 m2 m 2 the canopy was fully leafed between may and september while leafless conditions occurred between october and april throughfall and stemflow volumetric flux were measured using stationary tipping bucket gauges te525 mm texas electronics dallas tx usa attached to a centrally located datalogger and recorded data every five minutes cr1000 campbell scientific logan utah usa a separate te525mm gage was located in a nearby clearing with a fully equipped meteorological station to record gross precipitation that is part of the delaware environmental observing system deos udel edu the meteorological station recorded air temperature relative humidity solar radiation wind speed and direction and soil moisture continuously and aggregated those values to 5 minute intervals these data were used for the meteorological model inputs a total of four tipping buckets gauges measured throughfall two were placed under american beech canopy and two were placed under yellow poplar canopy stemflow collars were installed on three representative canopy trees of each species by fitting 31 8 mm vinyl tubing cut longitudinally that drained into tipping buckets to monitor stemflow a description of the stemflow collar construction and implementation can be found in levia et al 2010 stemflow throughfall and rainfall data were recorded from january 2008 through august 2011 tipping buckets are subject to clogging with particulate organic matter and under sampling of during high rainfall intensities these issues have been addressed in previous studies at this research site levia et al 2010 with the same quality analysis and quality control attention for the additional data points presented within throughout the study data were inspected and removed when clogging was apparent or when rainfall rates exceeded gauge capacities data are available for 41 storms and 552 mm of cumulative rainfall under leafed american beech conditions for 65 storms and 1305 mm of cumulative rainfall under leafless american beech conditions for 39 storms and 567 mm of cumulative rainfall under leafed yellow popular conditions and for 62 storms and 1146 mm of cumulative rainfall under leafless yellow poplar conditions fig 1 in each rainfall event precipitation ranged between 3 and 61 mm and storm duration ranged between 0 4 and 62 0 h the average coefficient of variation of measurements between the two tipping buckets during individual storm events for throughfall under american beech was 0 11 range 0 00 0 45 and under yellow poplar was 0 12 range 0 00 0 55 the average coefficient of variation of measurements between the three stemflow collars during individual storm events from american beech was 0 12 range 0 00 0 81 and under yellow poplar was 0 36 range 0 00 1 41 these data provide more than 3 years of continuous monitoring beneath the crown of individual trees that isolate the impact of throughfall and stemflow by individual species in this way the data are able to highlight the contributions of specific tree species which is critical in understanding how model parameters are calibrated for canopy characteristics that vary among tree species 2 2 models five canopy interception models were compared including the rutter rutter sparse gash gash sparse and liu models the models each simulated single storm events based on the measured data from the study site modeled interception was compared to measured interception using both cumulative and single storm timescales linhoss and siegert 2016 present model descriptions equations and results from a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis for all five models so only a brief summary of each model is provided here the rutter model provided the groundwork for current interception modeling rutter and morton 1977 rutter et al 1975 rutter et al 1972 the rutter model is a numerical model that simulates canopy water storage trunk water storage rate of drainage from the canopy evaporation from the canopy stemflow and evaporation from the trunk parameters in the rutter model include maximum canopy storage capacity s maximum trunk storage capacity st the free throughfall coefficient p the stemflow coefficient pt evaporation from the trunk as a proportion of the evaporation from the saturated canopy the rate of water dripping from the canopy when canopy storage capacity has been reached d s and an empirical drainage parameter b parameters in the model equations b and s were calibrated based on empirical measurements from a corsican pine stand pinus nigra the rutter sparse model was developed in portugal with field observations from a sparse eucalypt and pine forests parameters in the rutter sparse model include maximum canopy storage capacity s maximum trunk storage capacity st canopy cover c a drainage partitioning coefficient p d and trunk evaporation as a proportion of evaporation from the saturated canopy over the years a number of analytical models based on the rutter model have been developed one of the first was the gash model 1979 which treats rainfall events as three categories 1 the canopy wetting phase 2 the canopy saturation phase and 3 the canopy drying phase parameters in the gash model include maximum canopy storage capacity s maximum trunk storage capacity st the free throughfall coefficient p and the stemflow coefficient pt the gash sparse canopy model gash et al 1995 provides an improvement to the original gash model this model estimates evaporation based on canopy area rather than the ground area parameters in the gash sparse model include maximum canopy storage capacity s maximum trunk storage capacity st canopy cover c and the stemflow coefficient pt the liu model is also based on the rutter model it was developed to minimize data requirements by using only three parameters including maximum canopy storage capacity s maximum trunk storage capacity st and the free throughfall coefficient p liu 1997 2001 to reduce the number of parameters the model removes the dynamic prediction of stem interception and discards the empirical drainage parameters liu 2001 the liu model was developed based on data from cypress wetlands taxodium distichum and slash pine uplands pinus elliottii and explained 89 of interception variability in these stands the single storm form of the liu model assumes a dry canopy at the model start liu 1997 2001 2 3 parameter ranges each of the models used 1 measured precipitation 2 evaporation calculated from the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and 3 canopy characteristics to simulate canopy interception the current study involved manipulating only the canopy characteristics for each model to reach an optimal fit between measured and simulated interception the probability density functions pdfs for model parameters were developed from literature values of temperate forest conditions across a range of species assemblages and stand types i e hardwoods pines and mixed bottomlands and uplands unmanaged and plantation table 1 using literature values to bound the pdf s ensured that the optimized parameter values represented realistic and physically based values the pdf for canopy storage capacity s was u 0 29 2 24 bryant et al 2005 herbst et al 2008 návar 2013 šraj et al 2008 xiao and mcpherson 2016 the pdf for the free canopy cover c was u 0 43 0 95 bryant et al 2005 návar 2013 trunk storage capacity st was u 0 0037 0 9800 bryant et al 2005 herbst et al 2008 limousin et al 2008 návar 2013 šraj et al 2008 xiao and mcpherson 2016 the pdf for canopy drip when canopy storage capacity is reached ds was u 0 024 0 74 massman 1983 the pdf for the empirical drainage parameter b was u 3 0 4 6 rutter et al 1972 the pdf for the free throughfall coefficient p was u 0 06 0 55 herbst et al 2008 šraj et al 2008 the pdf for the stemflow coefficient pt was u 0 0031 0 06 bryant et al 2005 návar 2013 the pdfs for the drainage partitioning coefficient pd and trunk evaporation as a proportion of evaporation from the saturated canopy were u 0 0076 0 0324 and u 0 022 0 024 respectively valente et al 1997 the parameter pdfs contain uncertainty for two main reasons first there are limited numbers of studies that these pdf s are based on second many of the parameters are empirically derived and therefore cannot be directly measured to account for this uncertainty and to ensure that all possible parametric space was explored wide parameter pdf s were also developed table 1 these wide pdf s are approximately 5 times as wide as the regular pdfs which were based on literature values note that these wide pdfs are not physically realistic they were solely developed to understand if model behavior improved under relaxed parametric constraints 2 4 pest calibration the models were individually calibrated using the model independent parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis pest version 13 6 software doherty 2005 pest 2016 pest is a nonlinear parameter estimator it employs the gauss marquardt levenberg gml method to find the optimal parameter set to minimize the sum of the square errors between measured and modeled data the pest algorithm is given in eq 1 here x is a matrix of m n dimensions that relates model parameters vector b with order n to the modeled system response vector c with order m the modeled system response c should have corresponding measured values to enable a comparison of the modeled results to the measured results 1 x b c an optimal parameter set is defined as a set with the minimum sum of squared deviations between the modeled system response and field observations the vector b that minimizes the sum of squared deviations between the model response c and field observations c is given in eq 2 eq 2 requires that the number of observations exceeds the number of parameters 2 b x t x 1 x t c pest has a number of advantages over similar parameter optimization software it is model independent free open source well documented and frequently referenced in the literature in highly nonlinear models and models that may have more than one objective function minima whereby the calibration process can descend into a valley and find a good fit without exploring all of the parametric space it may be difficult to find a global minimum objective function using pest doherty 2005 the initial value that is provided for each parameter should represent the best guess of the true value this value is important for optimizing stability and was based on the mean of the literature values table 1 in systems containing high observation errors and or sparse observations pest may fail to yield a solution goegebeur and pauwels 2007 the condition number is an indication of the successful calculation of an optimal unique solution a high condition number greater than 104 indicates that a unique solution was not found a detailed descript of the pest algorithms can be found in doherty 2005 in complex models with numerous parameters there is a risk of overparameterization beven 1993 2006 the risks related to overparameterization in this study is relatively low for two reasons first the interception models used only three to six calibration parameters to simulate interception second the goal of the study was not to identify optimal parameter sets for use in making predictions instead the goal of the study was to compare model behavior by looking at the optimized parameter sets and the optimized model behavior finally another drawback of automatic parameter estimation routines in general is the fact that functional interactions between the optimized parameter values is not accounted for risking over parameterization realistic ranges for parameter values are input into the calibration routine however realistic relationships between the optimized parameter sets is not accounted for 3 results the gash gash sparse rutter rutter sparse and liu models were each calibrated independently based on measured interception and climatic data from an american beech and yellow poplar stand under leafed and leafless conditions respectively the objective function was a minimized sum of squared errors between measured and modeled individual rainfall events the models were not calibrated to cumulative interception to compute cumulative interception interception was summed for the individual storm events each simulation gave a low condition number indicating that a unique and optimal solution was found the condition number was under 50 for the rutter simulations and under 10 for all other simulations 3 1 model calibrated parameters a summary of the calibrated parameters is given in table 2 normalized ranges for each of the calibrated parameters are shown in fig 2 the following paragraphs describe the results shown in table 2 and fig 2 the calibration process provided no prior information regarding leafed versus leafless conditions or for american beech versus yellow poplar canopies besides the inherent differences in field observed values of interception for example from a mechanistic viewpoint maximum canopy storage s should be higher under leafed conditions and lower under leafless conditions however the calibration process received the same input pdf for s in both the leafed and leafless conditions in every simulation but one s calibrated to a higher value under leafed conditions versus leafless conditions table 2 the exception was the for the rutter yellow poplar model where s calibrated to 1 74 mm under leafed conditions and 1 77 mm under leafless conditions this shows that without any prior knowledge most of the calibrated models stored more water in the canopy under leafed conditions and that the empirical calibration process was able to represent actual mechanistic processes the relationship between the stemflow coefficient pt and interception is more complex a higher stemflow coefficient means that there was more water diverted to trunk storage resulting in higher overall interception table 2 shows that the stemflow coefficient calibrated to higher values under leafed versus leafless conditions in every model run where it was used except for the case of the rutter yellow poplar table 2 these values are centered around the pdf mean for pt fig 2 suggesting that the model values of stemflow are consistent with values reported in the literature larger stemflow coefficient values in the leafed period equated to greater trunk storage and lower stemflow production which is consistent with decades of field observations in which stemflow production is greater during leafless conditions than during leafed brown and barker 1970 siegert and levia 2014 staelens et al 2008 it is likely that the models were trying to direct more stemflow to trunk storage in the leafed season to achieve higher overall water storage and less throughfall in contrast the reduced demand for canopy storage in the leafless season reduces the pressure of the models to force stemflow into trunk storage 3 2 measured vs modeled interception cumulative storms the percent error of measured versus modeled cumulative interception over the 3 5 years of data collection ranged between 14 9 and 9 8 table 3 in general the gash sparse model resulted in the smallest errors while the rutter sparse model resulted in the largest errors across species and seasons the rutter model performed well for yellow poplar especially in the leafless season but had errors greater than 5 for american beech in both seasons the liu model had small errors less than 2 in the leafless season but had larger errors in the leafed season for both species in contrast the gash model had small errors less than 2 in the leafed season but had larger errors in the leafless season 3 3 measured vs modeled interception individual storms bar plots show the measured and modeled interception for individual storm event under all of the five models gash gash sparse rutter rutter sparse and liu fig 3 scatterplots also show the same individual simulations for measured versus modeled results fig 4 the similarity in the results illustrates the similarity between model function figs 3 and 4 none of the models were able to simulate very high or very low levels of interception the measured range in interception varied from 0 19 to 12 0 mm a range of 12 0 mm across all five models the maximum range in modeled interception varied between 1 2 and 6 9 mm a range of 5 7 mm as such the range in measured interception was over twice as large as the range in modeled interception 12 0 mm versus 5 7 mm all of the models did a rather poor job simulating interception under individual interception events r2 values ranged between 0 21 and 0 48 root mean squared errors ranged between 1 7 and 2 0 mm and the mean of the absolute value of the percent error for each storm event ranged between 73 and 145 table 4 the mean of the absolute value of the percent error for each storm event table 4 is provided to compare the error in individual storm events to the error in the cumulative storm events percent error table 3 the models were weaker in the leafed season for both species compared to the leafless season table 4 for american beech the percent difference in r2 improved across models from the leafed to the leafless season on average by 22 while the r2 for yellow poplar interception improved 55 the gash sparse model showed the most leafed to leafless season r2 improvement for both american beech 32 and yellow poplar 71 the liu model returned slightly higher r2 values than other models by species within their respective season except for yellow poplar during leafed conditions table 4 higher accuracy along with the parsimony of parameters involved in the liu model indicates that the liu model may be considered the best model under these conditions the automatic calibration was also performed using the wide pdfs table 1 to determine whether the regular pdfs constrained model behavior widening the parameter pdf s did improve model behavior to some extent the r2 for the calibrated models under the wide parameter ranges was between 0 33 and 0 62 with an average r2 of 0 49 the root mean squared error for the calibrated models under the wide parameter ranges was between 1 44 and 2 14 with an average root mean squared error of 1 68 similar to the results for the regular parameter pdfs when using the wide parameter pdfs none of the models were able to simulate very high or very low levels of interception however the wide parameter pdf s did enable somewhat more dynamics across all five models the maximum range in modeled interception using the wide parameter pdfs varied between 0 8 and 8 9 mm a range of 8 1 mm as such the range in measured interception was 1 5 times as large as the range in modeled interception under the wide parameter pdfs 12 0 mm versus 8 1 mm we do not detail the results from the wide parameter pdfs further because the calibrated parameters are not necessarily physically representative of the system a residual analysis at the event based scale was conducted to better understand systematic model bias under the regular parameter pdfs this analysis compared residuals to modeled interception as well as to each of the climatic measurements including precipitation duration intensity humidity wind speed and temperature the analysis showed little correlation between modeled interception and residuals r2 between 0 02 and 0 18 fig 5 these residual plots show an x y bias where most of the predictions were slightly too high but some were much too low the residual plots also show a degree of heteroscedasticity where the residuals tend to get larger with increasing modeled interception the r2 comparing precipitation and residuals ranged between 0 13 and 0 40 the r2 comparing the climatic variables and residuals ranged between 0 00 and 0 16 4 discussion in this study we employed an automatic parameterization routine to compare five similar but different interception models our results demonstrate how similar the models behave in their estimation of canopy interception and ability to simulate interception dynamics the five interception models were able to successfully simulate cumulative interception however they were not able to accurately simulate interception during individual rainfall events most canopy interception studies report cumulative percent error between modeled versus measured canopy interception gash et al 1995 návar 2013 valente et al 1997 fewer studies report the percent error associated with individual rainfall events or the coefficient of determination r2 between individually measured and modeled rainfall events klingaman et al 2007 massman 1983 rutter et al 1975 cumulative error is useful in understanding long term trends and in hydrologic modeling under monthly or annual time steps reporting the error associated with individual rainfall events is more useful when looking at smaller time steps many hydrologic models hspf butcher et al 2014 i tree hydro livesley et al 2014 swat lin et al 2015 and topmodel niu et al 2005 are run on a daily or sub daily time step where it is important to have good estimations of interception for individual storm events our study shows that reporting cumulative interception hides the error that may be present in measurements or simulations of interception during individual rainfall events as such interception modeling studies should report cumulative and single storm summary statistics a previous study by linhoss and siegert 2016 along with the current study both highlight the similarity between the five interception models linhoss and siegert 2016 used a global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis to compare the same five interception models the 2016 study found that all of the models demonstrated similar degrees of uncertainty with confidence intervals ranging between 3 and 5 mm based on five years of simulated storm events in mississippi usa linhoss and siegert 2016 also showed that precipitation storm duration solar radiation and canopy storage capacity were the most important parameters in all of the models excluding climatic variables which were not perturbed and held constant in the calibration study the linhoss and siegert 2016 global sensitivity analysis showed that the most important canopy characteristics in the models were canopy storage capacity s trunk storage capacity st and canopy cover c our current study showed that canopy storage capacity s and trunk storage capacity st both calibrated towards the upper end of their pdfs therefore the models used two of the most important canopy characteristics to increase trunk storage and canopy storage table 2 during individual storm events the models were all unable to simulate low and high levels of measured interception as a result the models were unable to simulate the variability in the measured interception there were separate reasons for the models inability to simulate low versus high levels of interception it was impossible for the models to simulate high levels of interception because of the regular pdfs that were defined for s and st derived from literature and representative of values used in interception studies to date and also et calculated by the penman montieth equation the maximum evapotranspiration et from the simulated storms was 5 07 mm the maximum canopy storage s was 2 24 mm and the maximum trunk storage st was 0 98 mm given these ranges of parameter values and not accounting for free throughfall p stemflow pt drainage partitioning pd or canopy drip ds simulated interception could not exceed 8 29 mm measurements however showed interception sometimes exceeding 8 mm and frequently exceeding 6 mm using in situ whole tree mechanical displacement sensors friesen et al 2008 estimated total canopy interception to be 6 45 mm which is three times larger than most values cited in the literature while this value does not account for intra event evaporation it supports our findings and others klaassen et al 1998 that canopy storage and subsequently total interception may be greater than what the models are able to simulate the models were also unable to simulate low levels of interception this may be a function of model structure in that the models do not simulate the existence or magnitude of drip effects that deplete canopy and or trunk storage before the storage s are filled it may also be a function of inaccuracies in measured data discussed below more research is necessary to understand this discrepancy the poor performance of the models in simulating individual rainfall events could be a result of 1 narrow parameter pdfs 2 measurement errors and or 3 conceptual error in the models below we discuss each of these possibilities in turn first there is a possibility that the regular parameter pdfs which were used in calibration are too narrow these parameter pdfs were defined from a limited set of literature values which may not represent the studies field conditions and or may contain errors in response wide parameter pdfs were developed and run through the automatic calibration routine to investigate if the parameter pdfs constricted model performance these wide pdfs are not physically realistic and their results should not be considered valid they simply served to illustrate how model behavior improved under relaxed parametric constraints widening the parameter pdfs improved model results of individual storm events to some extent for example the r2 under the regular pdfs varied between 0 21 and 0 48 while the r2 under the wide pdfs ranged between 0 33 and 0 62 this analysis shows that some error can be attributed to the narrow parameter pdf ranges however the pdf ranges are not only reason for poor model performance second the measurements of throughfall and stemflow include some error and may explain a portion of the poor model performance the interception measurements used 2 tipping buckets and 3 stemflow collars on each tree species during each storm event variations in canopy cover are likely to introduce some artificial spatial variation in the measurements of throughfall and stemflow the average coefficient of variation for the measurements of throughfall and stemflow during individual storm events from each stand which were reported in the methods section gives some indication of the spatial error in these measurements more work should be done to understand how the measurement variance contributes to poor model performance third poor model performance may be due to how we understand the mechanistic interception process and resulting conceptual errors in the models the current models are essentially bucket models that assume that there is a fixed value for maximum canopy storage capacity in the models all of the rainfall that occurs after canopy storage capacity is reached becomes throughfall not accounting for et in reality canopy storage is rarely saturated and follows an asymptotic curve keim et al 2005 xiao and mcpherson 2016 also storage by bark and stem surfaces responds to rainfall events in a much different way than storage by canopy foliage herwitz 1985 for example levia et al 2011 showed that difference in rainfall intensity can initiate new stemflow pathways on tree trunks while wind driven rainfall preferentially wets more stem surface area than vertical rainfall van stan et al 2011 likewise localized trunk storage occurs throughout the duration of rainfall events but rarely reaches complete saturation furthermore it is well established that more rainfall is diverted to stemflow production in the leafless dormant season dunkerley 2014 siegert and levia 2014 but the distribution of within event stem interception versus canopy interception as a whole remains unstudied canopy interception models assume a dry canopy at the onset of individual events such that canopy and trunk storage are empty in the real world this is not always the case nor is it likely especially for bark storage which may always retain some hygroscopic water and or water from xylem exchange levia and herwitz 2005 zweifel et al 2000 in turn this would mean stem storage was already partially filled and make it less important in the subsequent model runs but our calibration exercise shows that the models want to divert more water into trunk storage suggesting that the initial input values are not large enough other recent work supports this preliminary hypothesis and model results li et al 2016 used rainfall simulation experiments to isolate process based mechanisms of canopy interception and identified three phases including an initial rapid wetting phase accounting for the majority of interception a stable phase and a post rainfall drainage phase among the four tree species used in this experiment some displayed correlations with only rainfall intensity while leaf and branch traits were strongly correlated with interception in others iida et al 2017 found similar temporal trends in canopy interception and identified wetting and water storage as key mechanisms to be considered in interception models their findings also highlight the importance of canopy storage up to 7 2 mm with 70 90 intercepted by woody surfaces and its likely underestimation to explain the missing water that has heretofore been ascribed to wet canopy evaporation van dijk et al 2015 wind may also play an important role in interception beyond its effects on evapotranspiration for example herwitz and slye 1995 adapted the gash model to account for the positive effect of wind on canopy storage in a cyclone prone tropical system their assumption was that higher and more prominent tree crowns intercept more rainfall under lateral wind driven rain and as a result produce rain shadows for the less prominent tree crowns even under normal rainfall conditions wind driven rain preferentially wets stem surface and diverts an increased proportion of rainfall to stem storage and or stemflow van stan et al 2011 in contrast other studies have found that wind aids in intra event evaporation of water from canopy surfaces which resets canopy storage capacity and increases interception staelens et al 2008 toba and ohta 2008 the optimized parameter values in this study should not be considered optimized in the sense that they represent real world values because of the nature of the automatic calibration routine this study does not place confidence in the optimized parameter values furthermore the optimized parameter sets should not be generalized and only apply to the specific study site in which interception was measured the study does evaluate trends in the parameter values to gain better insight into mechanistic processes and options for measurement and model improvement 5 conclusion this paper presents a novel method for comparing rainfall interception models using automatic parameterization the benefits of this technique are fourfold first the method is unbiased second the method allows for a comparison of optimized results optimized results indicate which model is the best at reproducing measured results third the method allows for a comparison of optimized parameter sets fourth the method provides insight into the models functionality in our example the models all behaved similarly in their inability to simulate high and low levels of interception in the discussion we examine how errors in 1 parameter pdfs 2 measurements and 3 the conceptual model of canopy interception may be the cause of poor model performance more study is required to partition these errors to the model output error based upon optimized parameter fitting our findings suggest that storage compartments both foliar and trunk are underutilized in the models improvements may be through better measurements of canopy and trunk storage as well as a better understanding of how those storages fill up and empty during a storm for foliar storage lai can be estimated from litterfall collections aber 1979 plant canopy analyzers chen 1996 hemispherical photos zhang et al 2005 or remote sensing platforms garrigues et al 2008 estimating bark water storage capacity has garnered much less attention herwitz 1985 levia and herwitz 2005 van stan et al 2016 and as such is much less refined therefore efforts should be focused on improving the accuracy of this parameter across forest types and conditions there are countless models that simulate the various components of the hydrologic cycle while model building is an important step in moving hydrologic sciences forward this paper shows that critical model evaluation is also important new models should not be developed without a strong understanding of the

5617,the sub seasonal forecast horizon with lead times up to 7 weeks has a number of possibilities for operational applications this sub seasonal time scale is only recently motivated for research on applications as it is often recognized as being in the gray zone of predictability in both meteorological and hydrological sciences this work is one of the first assessments of ensemble sub seasonal meteorological inputs to large scale basin hydrological modelling within a tropical climate where it could benefit hydropower generation the quantitative precipitation forecast qpf data were provided by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf within the sub seasonal to seasonal s2s project s context to assess the quality of the forecasts a statistical evaluation was performed including a comparison with the traditional extended streamflow prediction esp technique results allowed for an estimation of the error magnitudes and the potential to the benefit of the ensemble over the deterministic reference forecast and the esp approach we showed that the sub seasonal qpf based forecasts have advantages over the esp although generally their skill deteriorates in lead times after day 30 the evaluation across multiple locations considering drainage area and hydrometeorological conditions suggests that the statistical performance outcome is also spatio temporal dependent keywords sub seasonal streamflow forecasting s2s mgb iph model 1 introduction the quantitative precipitation forecast qpf originated from numerical weather prediction models is frequently being adopted as input information for hydrological models aiming better streamflow prediction as shown by recent operational and scientific literature anghileri et al 2016 baker et al 2019 cuo et al 2011 fan et al 2014 2015 2016 golding 2009 schwanenberg et al 2015 white et al 2017 despite the widespread usage of qpf and its improvements over the last few decades pappenberger 2019 it is recognized that this data s low skill or high uncertainty is an obstacle in further applying it for hydrometeorological modeling while the qpf skill usually tends to decrease as the forecast lead time increases benefits such as better inflow to reservoir volume estimations can be obtained through this increase in the predicted horizon lettenmaier and wood 1993 bartholmes and todini 2005 cuo et al 2011 in the last decades the numerical weather prediction scientific community has developed methods such as the ensemble approach that allow the extension of the horizon beyond the short range lead times while also delineating the uncertainty of the predictions such an approach lends it a probabilistic sense expressing the uncertainties through the assessment of the ensemble members outcomes probabilistic distribution additionally providing valuable information to hydrometeorological prediction systems bauer et al 2015 demargne et al 2014 jaun and ahrens 2009 krzysztofowicz 2001 schaake et al 2006 verbunt et al 2007 more recent efforts in ensemble forecasting have been focusing toward better comprehending the forecasts within the sub seasonal timescale i e forecast lead time up to 3 7 weeks which is often considered unfeasible due to the high level of uncertainties and low predictability as it is placed between the short range or weather and long range or seasonal forecasts brunet et al 2010 robertson et al 2018 2017 robertson and vitart 2018 shapiro et al 2010 vitart 2015 vitart et al 2016 vitart and robertson 2018 2016 white et al 2017 the sub seasonal hydrometeorological predictions present potential information to meet the needs of users in many socio economic activities for both the public and the private sectors examples are supporting decision making in water supply management and the development of early warning systems for droughts and flood control bazile et al 2017 hao et al 2018 hartmann 2006 lemos 2008 o donnell and colby 2009 pagano et al 2002 sene

2014 turner et al 2017 and in shipping and navigation planning ensuring inland waterway transportation meißner et al 2017 although it still face many inherent issues which are discussed by white et al 2017 the sub seasonal predictions are now being endorsed by research initiatives that set their focus on assessing the predictability and usefulness of forecasts within this timescale robertson et al 2018 2017 vitart and robertson 2018 regarding streamflow forecasting the qpf ensemble based modeling may lead to the development of hydrologic ensemble prediction systems or h eps which are expected to have greater skill and less inconsistency than deterministic forecasts also allowing for an evaluation of uncertainties provided by the spread of ensemble members bartholmes et al 2009 boucher et al 2011 buizza 2008 cloke et al 2013 cloke and pappenberger 2009 cuo et al 2011 golding 2009 pappenberger et al 2011 roulin 2007 scherrer et al 2004 verkade and werner 2011 the h eps have been extensively used for short range forecasting in flood warning systems and natural disaster prediction and more recently the development of technologies has led to wider large scale global flood forecasting pappenberger et al 2013a b in this context a sub seasonal h eps may constitute a powerful tool for decision making in water resource management providing useful information in regards to drawing adjustments between long term and short term planning cloke and pappenberger 2009 emerton et al 2016 as an alternative for medium to long term streamflow forecasts there is the extended streamflow prediction esp technique which is nowadays referred to as ensemble streamflow prediction day 1985 it considers historical meteorological data as a possible representation of the future generating one streamflow scenario i e ensemble member for each historical year using the current watershed status as initial conditions for each simulation the quality of esp forecasts is strongly tied to the main drivers of predictability within the basin where it produces high skill in basins where the initial hydrological conditions predominate over other sources while in basins where the meteorological forcing drives the predictability it may result in lower esp forecast skill also the main errors in using the esp technique arise from the variability of climate data errors and model calibration regardless of the method used to generate the streamflow ensembles the forecast quality depends on the catchments climatic and hydrological conditions exposing the necessity of correctly assessing the potentials of h eps across many regions of the world especially in places where this approach it still incipient for scientific and operational applications such as in most southern hemisphere countries pappenberger et al 2013 the scarcity of studies concerned with the application of sub seasonal h eps is noteworthy white et al 2017 reviews potential benefits in applications of sub seasonal to seasonal s2s predictions and draws attention to the challenges of integrating these forecasts with decision making in socio economic sectors as in water resources management power generation agriculture and others the authors point out key points in improving sub seasonal forecasting such as investigating where and when prediction skill is obtained quantification of systematic errors and uncertainties and better communication between forecast producers and users the study of shah et al 2017 is an application of sub seasonal lead time up to 45 days precipitation forecasts tailored to benefit the agricultural sector in india in this study total runoff and soil moisture was simulated using daily precipitation forecast with considered satisfying performance by the authors in terms of performance statistics in a timescale useful to water resource and agriculture managers the authors monhart et al 2019 compared the traditional esp approach to a sub seasonal with a lead time up to 32 days hydrometeorological ensemble prediction system within three alpine catchments in switzerland with distinct hydroclimatic conditions the study demonstrated the potential of ensemble reforecasts in small to medium mountainous catchments drainage areas ranging from 185 km2 to 1696 km2 where the account of snow related processes is necessary for proper modeling the study of anderson et al 2019 although not focusing on the sub seasonal time scale points out some aspects regarding ensemble forecast verification across spatial scales the authors highlight that the catchment area and proprieties must be considered in forecast verification in addition for flow forecasts greater regional variation in forecast reliability must be expected as it accounts for hydrological variables uncertainties particularly to the basins as preliminary knowledge of hydrometeorological conditions being of great value for water management operations it could also be obtained from sub seasonal ensemble forecasting in this sense this work seeks to explore the development of a sub seasonal hydrological prediction system and its benefits for tropical climates and large watersheds expanding the knowledge regarding this forecasting methodology we believe that such forecasting systems are auspicious in regions of the world where the generation of electricity relies heavily on hydroelectric power dams as the hydrological variability of the streamflow and uncertainties on estimates directly influences the system s operation and planning such as in the areas presented following 2 case study the studied site is the paraná river basin prb brazil located within the central south america territory covering regions from south central brazil to the itaipu hydropower dam having a drainage area of approximately 900 000 km2 the prb is responsible for more than 50 of the hydroelectric production in the entire country adam et al 2015 within the basin there are around 150 large reservoirs along its main river and tributaries paraná river grande tiête paranapanema and iguaçu aneel 2008 some of these rivers are also used as inland waterways for navigation such as the tietê paraná in brazil the oversight of hydroelectric generation and transmission is under the responsibility of the national electric system operator ons operador nacional do sistema and usually uses medium term average daily flow forecasts to perform the management of power generation ons 2011 2012a b 2014 in this management various methodologies are used mostly stochastic methods such as the previvaz model da silveira et al 2017 including in some cases conceptual hydrologic modelling the studied basin presents different hydrological regimes across its large territory exhibiting a seasonality caused primarily by the activity of air masses in brazil the region at the north end of the basin features a tropical climate with dry winters and more rain in the summer the rainfall is tropical and convective while the southern region presents steadier rainfall evenly distributed throughout the seasons siqueira et al 2018a b in this case study we selected 6 reservoir dams locations to proceed with the streamflow forecasts as shown in fig 1 we selected locations with distinct hydroclimatic characteristics and large scale cascading dams with drainage areas ranging from approximately 33 000 km2 to 827 000 km2 it is expected that the assessment may provide information regarding sub seasonal streamflow forecasting in these different conditions 3 methodology 3 1 mgb iph hydrological model the mgb iph described by collischonn et al 2007a b pontes et al 2017 is a large scale distributed model used in several studies for hydrological simulations in south america collischonn et al 2007b 2005 collischonn and tucci 2005 paz et al 2007 fan et al 2014 meller et al 2016 paiva et al 2013 siqueira et al 2018 tucci et al 2003 the applied version of this model discretizes the basin into unit catchments whenever there are confluences of streams or at specific points these units are denominated unit catchments paiva et al 2013 the soil and vegetation variability are classified by hydrologic response units hru whose parameters are associated with each hru type kouwen et al 2006 for the evapotranspiration calculation the model is based on penman monteith shuttleworth 1993 the surface runoff and soil water balance follow the arno model approach todini 1996 also the streamflow routing is computed using the muskingum cunge method in the case of this study or the full saint venant when necessary paiva et al 2013 the basin was discretized into 1424 unit catchments in this study while the rainfall runoff process was simulated using a daily time step model calibration was carried out using data from the national electric system operator ons spanning the years between 1975 and 1995 for the calibration period and 1995 to 2010 for validation due to data availability and occurrences of extreme events collischonn et al 2014 table 1 presents resulting values of the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient for streamflow ns nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient for logarithms streamflow log ns and relative volume errors dv at each gauging station used in the calibration and verification period based on table 1 we believe that the hydrologic model calibration and verification was satisfactory for further hydrological applications since the ns and log ns were above 0 75 and the volume error dv between 10 3 2 meteorological data the meteorological ensemble used as input for the hydrological model was generated by the integrated forecast system ifs model version cy43r3 from the european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf sub seasonal to seasonal s2s dataset vitart and robertson 2018 this model integrates 51 ensemble members including one unperturbed initial condition control member running twice a week on monday and thursday utc 00 and forecasts up to lead day 46 we used the data with a 0 125 grid resolution for daily accumulated time steps ecmwf 2017 the data is available at https apps ecmwf int datasets with a delay of 3 weeks of present time therefore it may not yet be suited for real time operations the study of fan et al 2015 in the south american context analyzed medium range forecasts originated from this research center for inflow verification demonstrating the best performance of this ensemble among the tested ones the observed precipitation dataset used to run the hydrological simulations was the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep version 2 1 this is a global dataset covering the years from 1979 to 2016 with grid resolution of 0 1 and provided as 3 hourly accumulated value which had to be accumulated from daily values beck et al 2017b 2017a employing a gridded dataset was the selected method in the current study due to its advantages over local in situ gauges as it uses complementary information from diverse sources such as satellite reanalysis and data gauges also providing information for long temporal availability the fig 2 shows the evolution of the mean absolute error mae of the s2s data throughout the forecast horizon averaged over all forecast issued in this study before the mae computation a representative data series was calculated using the area weighted mean for each drainage area eq 1 1 p 1 n a i p i 1 n a i 3 3 ensemble streamflow hindcasting experiments the experiments consisted of assembling a hydrological ensemble prediction system h eps using the meteorological ensembles as forcing s to the mgb iph model table 2 since the main river basin is discretized into 1424 unit catchments elementary areas the centroid coordinates of each of these was used to interpolate representative precipitation series from the gridded s2s data by taking the nearest qpf grid pixel from the centroid coordinate as its value the same interpolation was done to the mswep dataset the extended streamflow prediction esp technique was used to generate an ensemble of hydrologic simulations considering the historical rainfall data each esp ensemble member considered the same period day and month of the real time forecast lead times and a total of 20 years into the past were used i e number of climatological ensemble members we also used a reference forecast a perfect rainfall forecast in which one assumes the predicted precipitation to be equal to the observed this reference forecast was used to evaluate the model errors themselves enabling in the case of this study the assessment of forecasts that only have to consider the uncertainties associated with the meteorological data the sub seasonal s2s data based forecasts have been initialized with mswep data from 1990 until the forecast initial date the same for the esp simulations which assumes current basin conditions the forecast issuing date for simulations with the sampled rainfall series from previous years 3 4 results assessment approach the hydrological simulations produced results in the streamflow series for all 1424 unit catchments however we selected 6 case studies locations itaipu porto primavera jupiá água vermelha furnas and barra bonita for the assessments in this selection we favored points with hydropower reservoirs that could possibly benefit from the sub seasonal forecasts and tried to cover a wide range of watershed spatial scales as shown in table 3 the verification of forecasts for the six selected locations was carried out with the goal to better comprehend the performance of the developed h eps across spatial scales since the main meteorological and hydrological drivers present great variability within the basin for instance precipitation systems at the northern part of the basin are characterized by a tropical climate regime with dry winters and rainy summers most tropical and convective precipitation systems in the southern end as well feature more regular and well distributed precipitation along the year mostly convective and frontal precipitation in the summer on the hydrological side it would be interesting to acknowledge the performance scores of the forecasts across basins with quicker response to the streamflow generating process as well as larger areas with smoother hydrographs response the ensemble forecasting was evaluated using the ensemble verification system evs software described by brown et al 2010 we applied selected customary scores in ensemble forecasting assessments which were the mean absolute error mae root mean squared error rmse mean continuous ranked score mcrps mean continuous ranked probability skill score mcrpss and rank histogram these scores are usually employed in ensemble assessments and are highly documented within specific statistical literature wilks 2006 jolliffe and stephenson 2012 the objective of the assessment was to present an overview of the reliability and performance of ensemble forecasting results in comparison to the deterministic values given by the ensemble mean and ensemble control member as these values may be representative of a deterministic forecast and may be used in the absence of ensemble forecasts also in this assessment the comparison with the esp provides information on the performance of the ensemble against historical rainfall based forecasts the mean absolute error mae eq 2 reduces the ensemble to its mean value for each time step measuring the difference from the reference benchmark i e perfect rainfall simulation this score assigns the same weight to all errors and primarily measures the magnitude of the errors the optimal value is equal to zero meanwhile the root mean squared error rmse equation 3 as a quadratic score rule penalizes larger errors providing a measurement on the variability of the errors magnitudes serving as a measure of accuracy 2 mae t 1 n i 1 n y i t x i t where mae t is the mean absolute error in timestep t n is the number of the forecasts issued y i t is the ensemble mean in timestep t and x i t is the respective observation in timestep t 3 rms e t 1 n i 1 n y i t x i t 2 1 2 where r mse t is the root mean square error in timestep t n is the number of the forecasts issued y i t is the ensemble mean in timestep t and x i t is the respective observation in timestep t the continuous ranked probability score crps summarizes the quality of the ensemble forecast reducing it to a single value which is obtained by measuring the integrated square difference between the cumulative distribution function of the forecast value and the corresponding function of the observed value the crps when averaged for all forecast and observation pairs leads to the mean crps mcrps eq 4 where lower values correspond to the optimal scores it is important to highlight that the mean crps may be used to compare the ensemble performance to a reference forecast since it reduces to the mae for deterministic forecasts in addition the mean continuous ranked probability skill score mcrpss eq 5 measures the performance of the forecast system in regards to another in terms of mean crps the mcrpss closer to 1 indicates that the main forecast system for instance the s2s based have better skill over the reference system for instance the esp based opposed to values approaching 1 4 mcrps 1 n i 1 n f y y 1 y x 2 d qp t n where mcrps is the mean continuous ranked probability score f y y is the cdf of the forecast 1 y x is a step function that assumes value probability 1 0 for forecasted values greater than or equal to the observation and 0 0 otherwise 5 mcrpss 1 mcrps m a i n mcrps r e f where mcrpss is the mean continuous ranked probability skill score mcrps main mcrps ref is the ratio of mcrps of the forecast systems issued in order to allow a comparison between different locations errors scores mae rmse and mcprs were evaluated after a normalization procedure the calculated value of the respective scores were divided by the long term average of the perfect rainfall simulated flow series thus the result may disregard the magnitudes and express the errors corresponding to the mean flow the rank histogram rh is a measure of reliability statistical consistency between measurements and simulations and whether uncertainty is correctly represented in the forecast it scopes out the fraction of observation that may fall between any two ranked ensemble members in the forecast distribution this score is optimal i e the forecast system is reliable in terms of rank histogram when the probability of the observation falls between any two ranked members and is approximately uniform a lack of spreading of the ensemble is indicated by a u shaped rank histogram high probabilities in one or both tails on the other hand an inverted u shape indicates an excessive spreading 4 results fig 3 shows hydrograph examples of the results of ensemble streamflow forecasts the sub seasonal ecmwf qpfs originated from the s2s database and the esp series were used as input for generating the streamflow forecasts the figure depicts a flood event in the itaipu location on the upper figures the forecasts were issued two weeks prior a flow peak whereas the bottom part displays the development of the event it is noted that the s2s based forecasts followed more in accordance to the perfect rainfall than the esp based providing more accurate information on inflows to the itaipu dam location the results of the mae and mcrps analysis throughout the 6 studied locations is shown in fig 4 the mcrps score is always lower than the mae of the ensemble mean and the control member in all locations comparing the ensemble mcrps to a deterministic reference given by the control member forecast it is indicated that using the ensemble distribution is more likely to obtain better predictably than the control member forecast deterministic the error scores are always greater than zero and readily increase from initial lead days onwards in barra bonita and furnas locations the normalized error scores are more prominent possibly caused by the quicker response of rainfall runoff generation processes within the catchment drainage area thereby suggesting more dependency on streamflow response to the forecasted rainfall itaipu 827 000 km2 porto primavera 574 000 and jupiá 479 000 km2 which are located along the main river of the basin paraná river and also the água vermelha 139 000 km2 presented magnitudes of mae and mcrps scores placed around 0 10 to 0 2 times the long term flow average as for the control member until approximately day 8 the mae magnitude was akin to the ensemble mean and after this lead day its errors were around 0 4 times the long term flow average furnas 52 000 km2 at the northeast region of the basin presented mae magnitudes around 0 2 times the long term flow average and 0 2 times for the mcrps the control member obtained similar magnitudes to the ensemble mean until lead day 6 and after values ranged 0 4 times the long term flow average as for barra bonita 33 000 km2 located at the mideast region of the basin with the smallest drainage area of all 6 locations also presented the highest error magnitudes in regard to the long term flow average spanning values around 0 6 and 0 4 for mae and mcrps respectively the control member forecast resulted in close score values until day 8 then 0 8 times the long term flow average the rmse fig 5 analysis indicates that the errors follow a similar behavior to the mae and mcrps which indicated a tendency to increase as the drainage area decreases the three larger drainage areas i e itaipu porto primavera and jupiá presented the smallest rmses relative to the long term flow average as the drainage area decreases respectively água vermelha furnas and barra bonita the rmse tends to present higher values at barra bonita a pattern more closely dependent on the forecasts runs on the rmse results appears along the forecast horizon this pattern is a result of the rapid response in the hydrograph of the catchment from intense rainfall events presented in the sub seasonal forecasts which in turn influence the result in certain lead days this does not appear on other locations due to the attenuation of the errors and catchment size figs 6 8 show the 51 member rank histogram for itaipu furnas and barra bonita at sampled lead days 1 14 28 and 42 depicting the behavior of ensemble spread throughout the forecast horizon the itaipu rank histograms are similar to that of porto primavera jupiá and água vermelha which presented a lack of spread and also a small positive on early lead days bias or overestimations of streamflow furnas rank histograms have a lack of spread on early lead days and a small tendency towards overestimation of the forecasted streamflow over the entire horizon the barra bonita histograms show that in early lead days the u shape is present indicating a lack of spread although along the forecast evolution the positive bias streamflow overestimates is more pronounced than in the other locations these results suggest that a bias removal method may have to be applied in order to deal with the tendency towards overestimation in streamflow forecasts across almost all locations the spread analysis results are similar to what is commonly observed in other ensemble forecasts verification studies where the lack of spread in early lead time is presented when considering the precipitation as the only source of uncertainty fan et al 2014 the analysis of the forecast s skill against a historical reference of forecasts is presented in terms of mcrpss fig 9 shows the results for the 6 locations delineating the performance of the qpf based sub seasonal streamflow forecasts in comparison to the esp based for itaipu after lead day 3 the qpf based forecast outperforms the esp throughout the entire forecast horizon at porto primavera jupiá and água vermelha the behavior is similar to itaipu except that approximately after a month lead day 30 the esp presented superior skill than the sub seasonal qpf ensemble broadly these results concur with studies investigating the quality of esp which claim that many ensemble predictions systems have difficulties in outperforming esp after a month of forecasting arnal et al 2018 lucatero et al 2018 monhart et al 2019 as for the deficient sub seasonal ensemble skill until day 3 this is possibly caused by the favorable esp skill in forecasting the initial lead days in large basins where the inertial memory of hydrological conditions has more influence over the prediction for furnas the sub seasonal qpf based forecasts were slightly better than the esp until the third week lead day 21 as for barra bonita it is the only location that the sub seasonal qpf ensemble outperformed the esp across all lead days possibly because the main predictability drivers on this location were obtained from the meteorological data in other words low seasonality is presented thereby manifesting on the skill of the esp technique 5 discussion the results presented in this work are one of the first assessments of sub seasonal qpf based ensemble streamflow forecasts in the south american continent and for tropical climates regarding the comparison between the ensemble and the deterministic approach our results agree with the usual results from other h eps assessments against deterministic references the results from the statistical verification indicate that ensemble hydrological forecasting presents many advantages when compared to the deterministic control member in terms of mae and mcprs after approximately a week of lead time the errors of the ensemble are always lower than the deterministic reference for all six locations also it is suggested that the error scores may be dependent on the catchment scale and hydrologic conditions e g runoff generation process water storage and flow routing since smaller ones presented the greater errors furnas and barra bonita as it may be attenuated by the streamflow generation processes on larger basins which is in agreement with other studies regarding ensemble forecast performance assessment across catchments with distinct spatial scales and characteristics e g anderson et al 2019 meteorologically larger drainage areas performed better possibly due to errors related to the spatial resolution rainfall location and temporal occurrence of rainfalls of the meteorological input being averaged for greater area values as well as phase errors on the forecast being compensated by the streamflow generation processes delay time therefore not greatly contributing for depreciation of forecast quality consequently on larger basins the errors tend to compensate for themselves on the hydrological model larger areas result in better performance in the simulations given that errors on parametrization and discretization are also compensated one may note that for the larger drainage areas the statistical scores tend to bear better results remarkable is the fact that for drainage areas equal to or greater than 479 000 km2 jupiá p primavera and itaipu dam mae and rmse of hydrological forecasting were very similar suggesting a threshold area for bearing the best results regarding rank histogram analysis the score provides an overview of the spread of the ensemble it is showed that for early lead times there is a lack of spread in the ensemble across all locations studied suggesting that the results are more dependent on the observed initial conditions in the basin rather than on meteorological inputs furthermore the histograms point out systematic bias present in some lead times suggesting that some bias removal technique may be applied the importance of the initial conditions to simulations on large watershed has already been investigated sometimes in literature frequently relating the area as a predictability related variable paiva et al 2012 yossef et al 2013 the results regarding skill comparison of s2s based forecast against the esp approach indicates that the first set have more quality and potential usefulness for inflow forecasting these results are particularly important for locations such as the studied area where most of the medium to long term sub seasonal timescale hydropower operations and management relies on forecasts based on stochastic methods also forecasting within the sub seasonal time scale is very interesting as it provides valuable information on streamflow estimative on a daily or sub daily basis issued twice a week which could be applied for monthly planning of operations in addition the forecasts following a distributed hydrological model framework supply information at multiple locations within the interest region thereby supporting an integrated analysis for sub seasonal water resources management the fig 10 below shows an overview of normalized mae for all unit catchments centroids used in the distributed hydrological framework applied in this study it is depicted that there are regions of the basin which are more likely to obtain better quality of forecasts in terms of the statistic presented this is partially explained by different drivers of predictability atmospheric and hydrologic processes acting within the study basin as described in previous sections also it is noted that along the main river of the basin the errors tends to be in the lower class 0 25 until lead time 28 and a small portion with errors ranging between 0 25 and 0 50 on lead time 42 which can be related to the total catchment drainage area and its hydrological processes such as streamflow generation and propagation this last statement concurs with studies that instigates the relationship between ensemble statistical evaluation performance in a distributed hydrological forecasting and catchment size as in anderson et al 2019 also in an operational point of view the forecasts may also be improved with data assimilation and post processing methods the results suggest that the ecmwf ensemble may perform differently at distinct catchments among the study basin it can be noted that the performance results on one location may not be transposed to another this evidence is also perceived within the studies of fan et al 2015 which tested medium range ensemble forecasts on distinct watersheds within the same hydroclimatic region and monhart et al 2019 that investigated the sub seasonal ensemble forecast performance in alpine climate catchments the climatic characteristic at each location may influence the performance on techniques that rely on a historical series that is in cases where little seasonality is presented using the sub seasonal qpf based forecasts may achieve better skill as it considers more accurate meteorological conditions along forecast lead time finally we did not carry out any post processing on the forecast streamflow which could be assessed in future studies considering each location s particularities siqueira et al 2019 6 conclusions this research presented one of the first statistical assessments of the sub seasonal to seasonal s2s meteorological data as input for hydrological modeling in a tropical and sub tropical region where the most important streamflow generation processes mainly comes from the precipitation considering the location of hydropower plants which could potentially benefit over the streamflow predictions the results showed that the performance of the issued ensemble forecasts possess some advantages in applications where total inflow is necessary when compared to the deterministic control member and to a climatological reference esp which is the approach currently used for hydropower operation in the region the locations with greater drainage area presented the best performance when taking into account mae mcprs and mcprss especially for the itaipu dam which presented a higher skill than climatology after day 3 until the end of the forecast horizon following the main paraná river upstream the direct errors mae and mcprs presented slight deteriorations concerning the skill score the results indicated similar behavior to itaipu except that after a month of lead time it has underperformed the historical reference the other locations situated in tributaries of the main river with smaller drainage areas presented a higher degree of degradation in the results on barra bonita and furnas the mae and mcprs resulted on the largest values caused by some degree of bias on the other hand the first outperformed the esp on all timesteps and the second presented skill above the esp until week 3 day 21 ultimately we expect that our results will contribute to the usage of sub seasonal horizon forecasts and its benefits to hydrological forecasting consolidating ensemble forecasting experiments in large south american basins and tropical to sub tropical climates as well in large scale basins the sub seasonal streamflow predictions proved to be promising with better skill than the forecasts generated using the historical rainfall in addition the efforts addressed some issues related to the main incitements of the sub seasonal to the seasonal s2s project especially on those regarding to the evaluation of the forecasts in brazil it may be particularly important as it is an alternative to empirical methods commonly used by the national electric system operator such as previvaz model also the sub seasonal qpf based forecast provides integrated information across multiple locations and basin scales regarding future works we believe that more test cases may be useful considering the meteorological inputs originated from different research centers as they are freely available from the s2s database potentially providing a grand ensemble with more statistically reliable results likewise succeeding recent efforts in the integrated modeling of complex hydraulic systems in south america e g siqueira et al 2018 it is expected that value can be attained from these models towards the use of sub seasonal forecasting precipitation and other variables in hydrological forecasts especially when regarding techniques that only employ historical information credit authorship contribution statement erik

5617,the sub seasonal forecast horizon with lead times up to 7 weeks has a number of possibilities for operational applications this sub seasonal time scale is only recently motivated for research on applications as it is often recognized as being in the gray zone of predictability in both meteorological and hydrological sciences this work is one of the first assessments of ensemble sub seasonal meteorological inputs to large scale basin hydrological modelling within a tropical climate where it could benefit hydropower generation the quantitative precipitation forecast qpf data were provided by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf within the sub seasonal to seasonal s2s project s context to assess the quality of the forecasts a statistical evaluation was performed including a comparison with the traditional extended streamflow prediction esp technique results allowed for an estimation of the error magnitudes and the potential to the benefit of the ensemble over the deterministic reference forecast and the esp approach we showed that the sub seasonal qpf based forecasts have advantages over the esp although generally their skill deteriorates in lead times after day 30 the evaluation across multiple locations considering drainage area and hydrometeorological conditions suggests that the statistical performance outcome is also spatio temporal dependent keywords sub seasonal streamflow forecasting s2s mgb iph model 1 introduction the quantitative precipitation forecast qpf originated from numerical weather prediction models is frequently being adopted as input information for hydrological models aiming better streamflow prediction as shown by recent operational and scientific literature anghileri et al 2016 baker et al 2019 cuo et al 2011 fan et al 2014 2015 2016 golding 2009 schwanenberg et al 2015 white et al 2017 despite the widespread usage of qpf and its improvements over the last few decades pappenberger 2019 it is recognized that this data s low skill or high uncertainty is an obstacle in further applying it for hydrometeorological modeling while the qpf skill usually tends to decrease as the forecast lead time increases benefits such as better inflow to reservoir volume estimations can be obtained through this increase in the predicted horizon lettenmaier and wood 1993 bartholmes and todini 2005 cuo et al 2011 in the last decades the numerical weather prediction scientific community has developed methods such as the ensemble approach that allow the extension of the horizon beyond the short range lead times while also delineating the uncertainty of the predictions such an approach lends it a probabilistic sense expressing the uncertainties through the assessment of the ensemble members outcomes probabilistic distribution additionally providing valuable information to hydrometeorological prediction systems bauer et al 2015 demargne et al 2014 jaun and ahrens 2009 krzysztofowicz 2001 schaake et al 2006 verbunt et al 2007 more recent efforts in ensemble forecasting have been focusing toward better comprehending the forecasts within the sub seasonal timescale i e forecast lead time up to 3 7 weeks which is often considered unfeasible due to the high level of uncertainties and low predictability as it is placed between the short range or weather and long range or seasonal forecasts brunet et al 2010 robertson et al 2018 2017 robertson and vitart 2018 shapiro et al 2010 vitart 2015 vitart et al 2016 vitart and robertson 2018 2016 white et al 2017 the sub seasonal hydrometeorological predictions present potential information to meet the needs of users in many socio economic activities for both the public and the private sectors examples are supporting decision making in water supply management and the development of early warning systems for droughts and flood control bazile et al 2017 hao et al 2018 hartmann 2006 lemos 2008 o donnell and colby 2009 pagano et al 2002 sene

2014 turner et al 2017 and in shipping and navigation planning ensuring inland waterway transportation meißner et al 2017 although it still face many inherent issues which are discussed by white et al 2017 the sub seasonal predictions are now being endorsed by research initiatives that set their focus on assessing the predictability and usefulness of forecasts within this timescale robertson et al 2018 2017 vitart and robertson 2018 regarding streamflow forecasting the qpf ensemble based modeling may lead to the development of hydrologic ensemble prediction systems or h eps which are expected to have greater skill and less inconsistency than deterministic forecasts also allowing for an evaluation of uncertainties provided by the spread of ensemble members bartholmes et al 2009 boucher et al 2011 buizza 2008 cloke et al 2013 cloke and pappenberger 2009 cuo et al 2011 golding 2009 pappenberger et al 2011 roulin 2007 scherrer et al 2004 verkade and werner 2011 the h eps have been extensively used for short range forecasting in flood warning systems and natural disaster prediction and more recently the development of technologies has led to wider large scale global flood forecasting pappenberger et al 2013a b in this context a sub seasonal h eps may constitute a powerful tool for decision making in water resource management providing useful information in regards to drawing adjustments between long term and short term planning cloke and pappenberger 2009 emerton et al 2016 as an alternative for medium to long term streamflow forecasts there is the extended streamflow prediction esp technique which is nowadays referred to as ensemble streamflow prediction day 1985 it considers historical meteorological data as a possible representation of the future generating one streamflow scenario i e ensemble member for each historical year using the current watershed status as initial conditions for each simulation the quality of esp forecasts is strongly tied to the main drivers of predictability within the basin where it produces high skill in basins where the initial hydrological conditions predominate over other sources while in basins where the meteorological forcing drives the predictability it may result in lower esp forecast skill also the main errors in using the esp technique arise from the variability of climate data errors and model calibration regardless of the method used to generate the streamflow ensembles the forecast quality depends on the catchments climatic and hydrological conditions exposing the necessity of correctly assessing the potentials of h eps across many regions of the world especially in places where this approach it still incipient for scientific and operational applications such as in most southern hemisphere countries pappenberger et al 2013 the scarcity of studies concerned with the application of sub seasonal h eps is noteworthy white et al 2017 reviews potential benefits in applications of sub seasonal to seasonal s2s predictions and draws attention to the challenges of integrating these forecasts with decision making in socio economic sectors as in water resources management power generation agriculture and others the authors point out key points in improving sub seasonal forecasting such as investigating where and when prediction skill is obtained quantification of systematic errors and uncertainties and better communication between forecast producers and users the study of shah et al 2017 is an application of sub seasonal lead time up to 45 days precipitation forecasts tailored to benefit the agricultural sector in india in this study total runoff and soil moisture was simulated using daily precipitation forecast with considered satisfying performance by the authors in terms of performance statistics in a timescale useful to water resource and agriculture managers the authors monhart et al 2019 compared the traditional esp approach to a sub seasonal with a lead time up to 32 days hydrometeorological ensemble prediction system within three alpine catchments in switzerland with distinct hydroclimatic conditions the study demonstrated the potential of ensemble reforecasts in small to medium mountainous catchments drainage areas ranging from 185 km2 to 1696 km2 where the account of snow related processes is necessary for proper modeling the study of anderson et al 2019 although not focusing on the sub seasonal time scale points out some aspects regarding ensemble forecast verification across spatial scales the authors highlight that the catchment area and proprieties must be considered in forecast verification in addition for flow forecasts greater regional variation in forecast reliability must be expected as it accounts for hydrological variables uncertainties particularly to the basins as preliminary knowledge of hydrometeorological conditions being of great value for water management operations it could also be obtained from sub seasonal ensemble forecasting in this sense this work seeks to explore the development of a sub seasonal hydrological prediction system and its benefits for tropical climates and large watersheds expanding the knowledge regarding this forecasting methodology we believe that such forecasting systems are auspicious in regions of the world where the generation of electricity relies heavily on hydroelectric power dams as the hydrological variability of the streamflow and uncertainties on estimates directly influences the system s operation and planning such as in the areas presented following 2 case study the studied site is the paraná river basin prb brazil located within the central south america territory covering regions from south central brazil to the itaipu hydropower dam having a drainage area of approximately 900 000 km2 the prb is responsible for more than 50 of the hydroelectric production in the entire country adam et al 2015 within the basin there are around 150 large reservoirs along its main river and tributaries paraná river grande tiête paranapanema and iguaçu aneel 2008 some of these rivers are also used as inland waterways for navigation such as the tietê paraná in brazil the oversight of hydroelectric generation and transmission is under the responsibility of the national electric system operator ons operador nacional do sistema and usually uses medium term average daily flow forecasts to perform the management of power generation ons 2011 2012a b 2014 in this management various methodologies are used mostly stochastic methods such as the previvaz model da silveira et al 2017 including in some cases conceptual hydrologic modelling the studied basin presents different hydrological regimes across its large territory exhibiting a seasonality caused primarily by the activity of air masses in brazil the region at the north end of the basin features a tropical climate with dry winters and more rain in the summer the rainfall is tropical and convective while the southern region presents steadier rainfall evenly distributed throughout the seasons siqueira et al 2018a b in this case study we selected 6 reservoir dams locations to proceed with the streamflow forecasts as shown in fig 1 we selected locations with distinct hydroclimatic characteristics and large scale cascading dams with drainage areas ranging from approximately 33 000 km2 to 827 000 km2 it is expected that the assessment may provide information regarding sub seasonal streamflow forecasting in these different conditions 3 methodology 3 1 mgb iph hydrological model the mgb iph described by collischonn et al 2007a b pontes et al 2017 is a large scale distributed model used in several studies for hydrological simulations in south america collischonn et al 2007b 2005 collischonn and tucci 2005 paz et al 2007 fan et al 2014 meller et al 2016 paiva et al 2013 siqueira et al 2018 tucci et al 2003 the applied version of this model discretizes the basin into unit catchments whenever there are confluences of streams or at specific points these units are denominated unit catchments paiva et al 2013 the soil and vegetation variability are classified by hydrologic response units hru whose parameters are associated with each hru type kouwen et al 2006 for the evapotranspiration calculation the model is based on penman monteith shuttleworth 1993 the surface runoff and soil water balance follow the arno model approach todini 1996 also the streamflow routing is computed using the muskingum cunge method in the case of this study or the full saint venant when necessary paiva et al 2013 the basin was discretized into 1424 unit catchments in this study while the rainfall runoff process was simulated using a daily time step model calibration was carried out using data from the national electric system operator ons spanning the years between 1975 and 1995 for the calibration period and 1995 to 2010 for validation due to data availability and occurrences of extreme events collischonn et al 2014 table 1 presents resulting values of the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient for streamflow ns nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient for logarithms streamflow log ns and relative volume errors dv at each gauging station used in the calibration and verification period based on table 1 we believe that the hydrologic model calibration and verification was satisfactory for further hydrological applications since the ns and log ns were above 0 75 and the volume error dv between 10 3 2 meteorological data the meteorological ensemble used as input for the hydrological model was generated by the integrated forecast system ifs model version cy43r3 from the european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf sub seasonal to seasonal s2s dataset vitart and robertson 2018 this model integrates 51 ensemble members including one unperturbed initial condition control member running twice a week on monday and thursday utc 00 and forecasts up to lead day 46 we used the data with a 0 125 grid resolution for daily accumulated time steps ecmwf 2017 the data is available at https apps ecmwf int datasets with a delay of 3 weeks of present time therefore it may not yet be suited for real time operations the study of fan et al 2015 in the south american context analyzed medium range forecasts originated from this research center for inflow verification demonstrating the best performance of this ensemble among the tested ones the observed precipitation dataset used to run the hydrological simulations was the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep version 2 1 this is a global dataset covering the years from 1979 to 2016 with grid resolution of 0 1 and provided as 3 hourly accumulated value which had to be accumulated from daily values beck et al 2017b 2017a employing a gridded dataset was the selected method in the current study due to its advantages over local in situ gauges as it uses complementary information from diverse sources such as satellite reanalysis and data gauges also providing information for long temporal availability the fig 2 shows the evolution of the mean absolute error mae of the s2s data throughout the forecast horizon averaged over all forecast issued in this study before the mae computation a representative data series was calculated using the area weighted mean for each drainage area eq 1 1 p 1 n a i p i 1 n a i 3 3 ensemble streamflow hindcasting experiments the experiments consisted of assembling a hydrological ensemble prediction system h eps using the meteorological ensembles as forcing s to the mgb iph model table 2 since the main river basin is discretized into 1424 unit catchments elementary areas the centroid coordinates of each of these was used to interpolate representative precipitation series from the gridded s2s data by taking the nearest qpf grid pixel from the centroid coordinate as its value the same interpolation was done to the mswep dataset the extended streamflow prediction esp technique was used to generate an ensemble of hydrologic simulations considering the historical rainfall data each esp ensemble member considered the same period day and month of the real time forecast lead times and a total of 20 years into the past were used i e number of climatological ensemble members we also used a reference forecast a perfect rainfall forecast in which one assumes the predicted precipitation to be equal to the observed this reference forecast was used to evaluate the model errors themselves enabling in the case of this study the assessment of forecasts that only have to consider the uncertainties associated with the meteorological data the sub seasonal s2s data based forecasts have been initialized with mswep data from 1990 until the forecast initial date the same for the esp simulations which assumes current basin conditions the forecast issuing date for simulations with the sampled rainfall series from previous years 3 4 results assessment approach the hydrological simulations produced results in the streamflow series for all 1424 unit catchments however we selected 6 case studies locations itaipu porto primavera jupiá água vermelha furnas and barra bonita for the assessments in this selection we favored points with hydropower reservoirs that could possibly benefit from the sub seasonal forecasts and tried to cover a wide range of watershed spatial scales as shown in table 3 the verification of forecasts for the six selected locations was carried out with the goal to better comprehend the performance of the developed h eps across spatial scales since the main meteorological and hydrological drivers present great variability within the basin for instance precipitation systems at the northern part of the basin are characterized by a tropical climate regime with dry winters and rainy summers most tropical and convective precipitation systems in the southern end as well feature more regular and well distributed precipitation along the year mostly convective and frontal precipitation in the summer on the hydrological side it would be interesting to acknowledge the performance scores of the forecasts across basins with quicker response to the streamflow generating process as well as larger areas with smoother hydrographs response the ensemble forecasting was evaluated using the ensemble verification system evs software described by brown et al 2010 we applied selected customary scores in ensemble forecasting assessments which were the mean absolute error mae root mean squared error rmse mean continuous ranked score mcrps mean continuous ranked probability skill score mcrpss and rank histogram these scores are usually employed in ensemble assessments and are highly documented within specific statistical literature wilks 2006 jolliffe and stephenson 2012 the objective of the assessment was to present an overview of the reliability and performance of ensemble forecasting results in comparison to the deterministic values given by the ensemble mean and ensemble control member as these values may be representative of a deterministic forecast and may be used in the absence of ensemble forecasts also in this assessment the comparison with the esp provides information on the performance of the ensemble against historical rainfall based forecasts the mean absolute error mae eq 2 reduces the ensemble to its mean value for each time step measuring the difference from the reference benchmark i e perfect rainfall simulation this score assigns the same weight to all errors and primarily measures the magnitude of the errors the optimal value is equal to zero meanwhile the root mean squared error rmse equation 3 as a quadratic score rule penalizes larger errors providing a measurement on the variability of the errors magnitudes serving as a measure of accuracy 2 mae t 1 n i 1 n y i t x i t where mae t is the mean absolute error in timestep t n is the number of the forecasts issued y i t is the ensemble mean in timestep t and x i t is the respective observation in timestep t 3 rms e t 1 n i 1 n y i t x i t 2 1 2 where r mse t is the root mean square error in timestep t n is the number of the forecasts issued y i t is the ensemble mean in timestep t and x i t is the respective observation in timestep t the continuous ranked probability score crps summarizes the quality of the ensemble forecast reducing it to a single value which is obtained by measuring the integrated square difference between the cumulative distribution function of the forecast value and the corresponding function of the observed value the crps when averaged for all forecast and observation pairs leads to the mean crps mcrps eq 4 where lower values correspond to the optimal scores it is important to highlight that the mean crps may be used to compare the ensemble performance to a reference forecast since it reduces to the mae for deterministic forecasts in addition the mean continuous ranked probability skill score mcrpss eq 5 measures the performance of the forecast system in regards to another in terms of mean crps the mcrpss closer to 1 indicates that the main forecast system for instance the s2s based have better skill over the reference system for instance the esp based opposed to values approaching 1 4 mcrps 1 n i 1 n f y y 1 y x 2 d qp t n where mcrps is the mean continuous ranked probability score f y y is the cdf of the forecast 1 y x is a step function that assumes value probability 1 0 for forecasted values greater than or equal to the observation and 0 0 otherwise 5 mcrpss 1 mcrps m a i n mcrps r e f where mcrpss is the mean continuous ranked probability skill score mcrps main mcrps ref is the ratio of mcrps of the forecast systems issued in order to allow a comparison between different locations errors scores mae rmse and mcprs were evaluated after a normalization procedure the calculated value of the respective scores were divided by the long term average of the perfect rainfall simulated flow series thus the result may disregard the magnitudes and express the errors corresponding to the mean flow the rank histogram rh is a measure of reliability statistical consistency between measurements and simulations and whether uncertainty is correctly represented in the forecast it scopes out the fraction of observation that may fall between any two ranked ensemble members in the forecast distribution this score is optimal i e the forecast system is reliable in terms of rank histogram when the probability of the observation falls between any two ranked members and is approximately uniform a lack of spreading of the ensemble is indicated by a u shaped rank histogram high probabilities in one or both tails on the other hand an inverted u shape indicates an excessive spreading 4 results fig 3 shows hydrograph examples of the results of ensemble streamflow forecasts the sub seasonal ecmwf qpfs originated from the s2s database and the esp series were used as input for generating the streamflow forecasts the figure depicts a flood event in the itaipu location on the upper figures the forecasts were issued two weeks prior a flow peak whereas the bottom part displays the development of the event it is noted that the s2s based forecasts followed more in accordance to the perfect rainfall than the esp based providing more accurate information on inflows to the itaipu dam location the results of the mae and mcrps analysis throughout the 6 studied locations is shown in fig 4 the mcrps score is always lower than the mae of the ensemble mean and the control member in all locations comparing the ensemble mcrps to a deterministic reference given by the control member forecast it is indicated that using the ensemble distribution is more likely to obtain better predictably than the control member forecast deterministic the error scores are always greater than zero and readily increase from initial lead days onwards in barra bonita and furnas locations the normalized error scores are more prominent possibly caused by the quicker response of rainfall runoff generation processes within the catchment drainage area thereby suggesting more dependency on streamflow response to the forecasted rainfall itaipu 827 000 km2 porto primavera 574 000 and jupiá 479 000 km2 which are located along the main river of the basin paraná river and also the água vermelha 139 000 km2 presented magnitudes of mae and mcrps scores placed around 0 10 to 0 2 times the long term flow average as for the control member until approximately day 8 the mae magnitude was akin to the ensemble mean and after this lead day its errors were around 0 4 times the long term flow average furnas 52 000 km2 at the northeast region of the basin presented mae magnitudes around 0 2 times the long term flow average and 0 2 times for the mcrps the control member obtained similar magnitudes to the ensemble mean until lead day 6 and after values ranged 0 4 times the long term flow average as for barra bonita 33 000 km2 located at the mideast region of the basin with the smallest drainage area of all 6 locations also presented the highest error magnitudes in regard to the long term flow average spanning values around 0 6 and 0 4 for mae and mcrps respectively the control member forecast resulted in close score values until day 8 then 0 8 times the long term flow average the rmse fig 5 analysis indicates that the errors follow a similar behavior to the mae and mcrps which indicated a tendency to increase as the drainage area decreases the three larger drainage areas i e itaipu porto primavera and jupiá presented the smallest rmses relative to the long term flow average as the drainage area decreases respectively água vermelha furnas and barra bonita the rmse tends to present higher values at barra bonita a pattern more closely dependent on the forecasts runs on the rmse results appears along the forecast horizon this pattern is a result of the rapid response in the hydrograph of the catchment from intense rainfall events presented in the sub seasonal forecasts which in turn influence the result in certain lead days this does not appear on other locations due to the attenuation of the errors and catchment size figs 6 8 show the 51 member rank histogram for itaipu furnas and barra bonita at sampled lead days 1 14 28 and 42 depicting the behavior of ensemble spread throughout the forecast horizon the itaipu rank histograms are similar to that of porto primavera jupiá and água vermelha which presented a lack of spread and also a small positive on early lead days bias or overestimations of streamflow furnas rank histograms have a lack of spread on early lead days and a small tendency towards overestimation of the forecasted streamflow over the entire horizon the barra bonita histograms show that in early lead days the u shape is present indicating a lack of spread although along the forecast evolution the positive bias streamflow overestimates is more pronounced than in the other locations these results suggest that a bias removal method may have to be applied in order to deal with the tendency towards overestimation in streamflow forecasts across almost all locations the spread analysis results are similar to what is commonly observed in other ensemble forecasts verification studies where the lack of spread in early lead time is presented when considering the precipitation as the only source of uncertainty fan et al 2014 the analysis of the forecast s skill against a historical reference of forecasts is presented in terms of mcrpss fig 9 shows the results for the 6 locations delineating the performance of the qpf based sub seasonal streamflow forecasts in comparison to the esp based for itaipu after lead day 3 the qpf based forecast outperforms the esp throughout the entire forecast horizon at porto primavera jupiá and água vermelha the behavior is similar to itaipu except that approximately after a month lead day 30 the esp presented superior skill than the sub seasonal qpf ensemble broadly these results concur with studies investigating the quality of esp which claim that many ensemble predictions systems have difficulties in outperforming esp after a month of forecasting arnal et al 2018 lucatero et al 2018 monhart et al 2019 as for the deficient sub seasonal ensemble skill until day 3 this is possibly caused by the favorable esp skill in forecasting the initial lead days in large basins where the inertial memory of hydrological conditions has more influence over the prediction for furnas the sub seasonal qpf based forecasts were slightly better than the esp until the third week lead day 21 as for barra bonita it is the only location that the sub seasonal qpf ensemble outperformed the esp across all lead days possibly because the main predictability drivers on this location were obtained from the meteorological data in other words low seasonality is presented thereby manifesting on the skill of the esp technique 5 discussion the results presented in this work are one of the first assessments of sub seasonal qpf based ensemble streamflow forecasts in the south american continent and for tropical climates regarding the comparison between the ensemble and the deterministic approach our results agree with the usual results from other h eps assessments against deterministic references the results from the statistical verification indicate that ensemble hydrological forecasting presents many advantages when compared to the deterministic control member in terms of mae and mcprs after approximately a week of lead time the errors of the ensemble are always lower than the deterministic reference for all six locations also it is suggested that the error scores may be dependent on the catchment scale and hydrologic conditions e g runoff generation process water storage and flow routing since smaller ones presented the greater errors furnas and barra bonita as it may be attenuated by the streamflow generation processes on larger basins which is in agreement with other studies regarding ensemble forecast performance assessment across catchments with distinct spatial scales and characteristics e g anderson et al 2019 meteorologically larger drainage areas performed better possibly due to errors related to the spatial resolution rainfall location and temporal occurrence of rainfalls of the meteorological input being averaged for greater area values as well as phase errors on the forecast being compensated by the streamflow generation processes delay time therefore not greatly contributing for depreciation of forecast quality consequently on larger basins the errors tend to compensate for themselves on the hydrological model larger areas result in better performance in the simulations given that errors on parametrization and discretization are also compensated one may note that for the larger drainage areas the statistical scores tend to bear better results remarkable is the fact that for drainage areas equal to or greater than 479 000 km2 jupiá p primavera and itaipu dam mae and rmse of hydrological forecasting were very similar suggesting a threshold area for bearing the best results regarding rank histogram analysis the score provides an overview of the spread of the ensemble it is showed that for early lead times there is a lack of spread in the ensemble across all locations studied suggesting that the results are more dependent on the observed initial conditions in the basin rather than on meteorological inputs furthermore the histograms point out systematic bias present in some lead times suggesting that some bias removal technique may be applied the importance of the initial conditions to simulations on large watershed has already been investigated sometimes in literature frequently relating the area as a predictability related variable paiva et al 2012 yossef et al 2013 the results regarding skill comparison of s2s based forecast against the esp approach indicates that the first set have more quality and potential usefulness for inflow forecasting these results are particularly important for locations such as the studied area where most of the medium to long term sub seasonal timescale hydropower operations and management relies on forecasts based on stochastic methods also forecasting within the sub seasonal time scale is very interesting as it provides valuable information on streamflow estimative on a daily or sub daily basis issued twice a week which could be applied for monthly planning of operations in addition the forecasts following a distributed hydrological model framework supply information at multiple locations within the interest region thereby supporting an integrated analysis for sub seasonal water resources management the fig 10 below shows an overview of normalized mae for all unit catchments centroids used in the distributed hydrological framework applied in this study it is depicted that there are regions of the basin which are more likely to obtain better quality of forecasts in terms of the statistic presented this is partially explained by different drivers of predictability atmospheric and hydrologic processes acting within the study basin as described in previous sections also it is noted that along the main river of the basin the errors tends to be in the lower class 0 25 until lead time 28 and a small portion with errors ranging between 0 25 and 0 50 on lead time 42 which can be related to the total catchment drainage area and its hydrological processes such as streamflow generation and propagation this last statement concurs with studies that instigates the relationship between ensemble statistical evaluation performance in a distributed hydrological forecasting and catchment size as in anderson et al 2019 also in an operational point of view the forecasts may also be improved with data assimilation and post processing methods the results suggest that the ecmwf ensemble may perform differently at distinct catchments among the study basin it can be noted that the performance results on one location may not be transposed to another this evidence is also perceived within the studies of fan et al 2015 which tested medium range ensemble forecasts on distinct watersheds within the same hydroclimatic region and monhart et al 2019 that investigated the sub seasonal ensemble forecast performance in alpine climate catchments the climatic characteristic at each location may influence the performance on techniques that rely on a historical series that is in cases where little seasonality is presented using the sub seasonal qpf based forecasts may achieve better skill as it considers more accurate meteorological conditions along forecast lead time finally we did not carry out any post processing on the forecast streamflow which could be assessed in future studies considering each location s particularities siqueira et al 2019 6 conclusions this research presented one of the first statistical assessments of the sub seasonal to seasonal s2s meteorological data as input for hydrological modeling in a tropical and sub tropical region where the most important streamflow generation processes mainly comes from the precipitation considering the location of hydropower plants which could potentially benefit over the streamflow predictions the results showed that the performance of the issued ensemble forecasts possess some advantages in applications where total inflow is necessary when compared to the deterministic control member and to a climatological reference esp which is the approach currently used for hydropower operation in the region the locations with greater drainage area presented the best performance when taking into account mae mcprs and mcprss especially for the itaipu dam which presented a higher skill than climatology after day 3 until the end of the forecast horizon following the main paraná river upstream the direct errors mae and mcprs presented slight deteriorations concerning the skill score the results indicated similar behavior to itaipu except that after a month of lead time it has underperformed the historical reference the other locations situated in tributaries of the main river with smaller drainage areas presented a higher degree of degradation in the results on barra bonita and furnas the mae and mcprs resulted on the largest values caused by some degree of bias on the other hand the first outperformed the esp on all timesteps and the second presented skill above the esp until week 3 day 21 ultimately we expect that our results will contribute to the usage of sub seasonal horizon forecasts and its benefits to hydrological forecasting consolidating ensemble forecasting experiments in large south american basins and tropical to sub tropical climates as well in large scale basins the sub seasonal streamflow predictions proved to be promising with better skill than the forecasts generated using the historical rainfall in addition the efforts addressed some issues related to the main incitements of the sub seasonal to the seasonal s2s project especially on those regarding to the evaluation of the forecasts in brazil it may be particularly important as it is an alternative to empirical methods commonly used by the national electric system operator such as previvaz model also the sub seasonal qpf based forecast provides integrated information across multiple locations and basin scales regarding future works we believe that more test cases may be useful considering the meteorological inputs originated from different research centers as they are freely available from the s2s database potentially providing a grand ensemble with more statistically reliable results likewise succeeding recent efforts in the integrated modeling of complex hydraulic systems in south america e g siqueira et al 2018 it is expected that value can be attained from these models towards the use of sub seasonal forecasting precipitation and other variables in hydrological forecasts especially when regarding techniques that only employ historical information credit authorship contribution statement erik

5618,with more satellite and model precipitation data becoming available new analytical methods are needed that can take advantage of emerging data patterns to make well informed predictions in many hydrological applications we propose a new strategy where we extract precipitation variability patterns and use correlation map to build the resulting density map that serves as an input to centroidal voronoi tessellation construction that optimizes placement of precipitation gauges we provide results of numerical experiments based on the data from the alto adige region in northern italy and oklahoma and compare them against actual gauge locations this method provides an automated way for choosing new gauge locations and can be generalized to include physical constraints and to tackle other types of resource allocation problems keywords rain gauges cvt decorrelation optimal placement 1 introduction precipitation is a critical variable in the water cycle as it provides moisture for processes such as runoff evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge knowledge of the precipitation characteristics and patterns is therefore crucial for understanding land climate interactions for extreme event monitoring and for water resource management however accurate precipitation information at fine space and time scales is difficult to obtain as precipitation estimates from rain gauges ground based radars satellite sensors and numerical models are all affected by significant uncertainties which can even be amplified when exposed to non linear land surface model physics gottschalck et al 2005 hazra et al 2019 rain gauge or pluviometer networks are the only direct method to measure precipitation and provide observations with high temporal resolution as such they are widely accepted as the benchmark for validating remotely sensed precipitation products e g maggioni et al 2016 anagnostou et al 2009 point gauge measurements are often interpolated to obtain a spatially distributed rainfall field whose quality highly depends on the interpolation method used common interpolation methods include inverse distance weighted averaging ordinary kriging and correlation length grieser 2015 and more recent ones include co kriging foehn et al 2018 and methods that combine meteorological observations with regional climate model simulations wang et al 2017 however obtaining a spatially representative precipitation field from rain gauges may require collecting a large number of observations at several locations to include different terrain micro climate and vegetation variability this translates into placing numerous gauges which is costly in terms of maintenance and often not feasible because of location inaccessibility since rain gauges cannot offer spatially continuous information of precipitation kidd et al 2012 it is desirable to place them in a strategic way accounting for changes in spatio temporal patterns and having a methodology that is able to adapt to climate instabilities as suggested in emelianenko et al 2019 this work proposes an automated method to identify the optimal locations of rain gauges in order to capture the spatial variability of precipitation systems in the region and therefore provide a spatially representative rain field in comparison with kriging based approaches wadoux et al 2017 pardo igúzquiza 1998 barca et al 2008 our model enjoys a simpler analytical and numerical formulation owing to the natural minimization properties of the centroidal voronoi tessellations cvts described below allowing to readily apply it to relatively large regions of interest voronoi tessellations appear in many contexts and serve a variety of purposes they are referred to as quantizations in the electrical engineering community agrell and ericsson 1998 as polygons of influence or thiessen regions in geostatistics thiessen 1911 as geodesic icosahedral or hexagonal grids in climate system modeling ringler et al 2000 the corresponding energy functional can be thought of as variation in statistical terminology or as a cost functional in economic terms the basic idea of this construction is to represent a large set of data by means of few representative points i e generators while this general concept has been widely used in a variety of contexts the special case of cvts which is used to denote voronoi diagrams with the choice of generators that minimizes the energy functional is less known due to the difficulties associated with its construction this concept has been gaining popularity in the recent decades in many applications areas ranging from biology and physics to finance economics and social science see du et al 2000 chen and xu 2004 ringler et al 2008 and references therein it is particularly well studied in the context of mesh generation clustering quantization imaging reduced order modeling and partial differential equations applications where a number of theoretical results has been obtained attesting for its superior qualities comparing to other competing methodologies to the best of our knowledge applications of cvts in hydrology so far have been limited to mesh generation lu et al 2017 due to the flexibility provided by cvt for local mesh refinement the goal of this work is twofold first we want to introduce the concept of cvts for precipitation pattern analysis and point out some recently developed numerical algorithms that help constructing cvts in continuous and discrete settings second we are applying the idea of cvts in the context of optimal placement of rain gauges similarly to how it was previously applied in finding optimal placement of schools post offices and other resources du et al 1999 while other types of generalizations of the voronoi construction have been explored for instance in the context of optimizing precipitation field using similarity of rainfall data at grid locations e g using the radar polygon method proposed in cho et al 2016 this is the first application of the cvt methodology to modeling rainfall data and specifically to the optimization of rain gauge placement the practical aim of this study is to develop an automated strategy that would work for an arbitrary data in any geographical location we draw attention to several modeling assumptions that are part of the algorithm presented herein and the implications of these assumptions on the algorithm performance based on several selected datasets we utilize the truncated newton tn method nash 2000 which is a large scale nonlinear optimization algorithm to construct all cvt solutions this method allows to considerably speed up the calculation comparing to techniques such as lloyd method widely used in the engineering community lloyd 1982 and has advantages over previously introduced modified lloyd formulations as shown in di et al 2012 as in any cvt problem aimed at finding optimal placement of resources one needs to have a local density estimator when trying to optimize rain gauge placement this density should be naturally related to the measure of local precipitation variability in this work we have used a variability estimator based on local covariance matrix computed at the decorrelation distance overall our aim in this work is to develop an automated strategy to optimally place rain gauge that could be employed in any geographical location in the future to achieve this goal we propose a cvt method that uses the local covariance matrix derived from local precipitation as the density estimator this method could be applied to any precipitation dataset whether in situ remotely sensed or based on model simulations the article is organized as follows section 2 provides information on the cvt methodology and formulates the problem of optimal gauge placement comparing to previously used approaches section 3 gives information on the data we used in this work the proposed algorithm is presented in section 4 we also demonstrate predictions given by this model with existing gauge locations in section 5 2 methods 2 1 voronoi and centroidal voronoi tessellations the idea of tessellating the region i e decomposing the region into sub regions based on the locations of rain gauges has appeared in the early works of thiessen thiessen 1911 the construction is simple consider a certain geographic region w r 2 voronoi regions v i i 1 k are generated by a set of points x i i 1 k r 2 and are defined as follows v i x i x w x x i x x j j 1 k j i where is any distance metric in this work we choose it to be the standard euclidean norm these regions cover the entire domain w and can be formed by drawing perpendicular bisectors to the segments joining consecutive generating points given a certain desired density function ρ x one can compute the tessellation error i e 2 1 e x i i 1 k min x i i 1 k i 1 k v i ρ x x x i 2 d x it can be shown burkardt et al 2006 that this happens precisely when x i x i where x i is the mass centroid of the corresponding voronoi region v i a tessellation satisfying this property is called a centroidal voronoi tessellation or cvt for short notice that the above formulation may be extended to other more general cases i e by considering other distance metrics f other geometric constraints and periodic extensions du et al 1999 zhang et al 2012 the density function may be used to represent a variety of physical characteristics such as local characteristic length scale ringler et al 2008 signal intensity emelianenko 2010 desired grid resolution burkardt et al 2006 in this work we propose to use it for representing spatial rainfall variability as described in section 4 the classical method for constructing cvts is the algorithm developed by lloyd in the 1980s lloyd 1982 which represents a fixed point type iterative mechanism more efficient methods for calculating cvts have been developed in the past decades du and emelianenko 2006 du and emelianenko 2008 di et al 2012 for an overview of cvt related numerical techniques we refer interested reader to du et al 1999 chen and holst 2011 to achieve a robust construction of cvt we utilize tn to solve the resulting large scale optimization problem due to its relative simplicity and robust performance comparing to other existing methods in terms of both accuracy and convergence speed see the pseudocode given in appendix b we note that other methods might deliver comparable or better performance possibly at the cost of an increase in numerical sophistication comparative study of numerical solvers suitable for this problem is outside the scope of the current work 2 2 problem formulation there are several possible ways to formulate the problem of optimal placement of rain gauges in a certain region one method has been proposed in okabe et al 1992 and later used in du et al 1999 if k rain gauges locations in region w r 2 are given by x 1 x k and v i w are the voronoi region associated with the i th gauge one can minimize the expected squared approximation error for the amount of rainfall z x treated as a random variable z x m x x with mean m x and deviation x if the change in the average trend m x is small compared with the variance var x e x 2 ε which is assumed to be constant the expected squared approximation error can be approximated as 2 2 e x i i 1 k min x i i 1 k i 1 n v i 2 ε 2 1 corr x x i d x where 2 3 corr x x i e x x i var x var x i is the pearson linear correlation coefficient of the time series at locations x and x i details on this derivation are given in appendix a evaluation of 2 2 is computationally intensive requiring calculation of pairwise correlations for all points inside the domain notice that under the additional assumption that corr x x i only depends on the differences x x i e x i v i i 1 k can be thought of as a generalization of the cvt energy 2 1 given by 2 4 e x i i 1 k i 1 k v i ρ x f x x i d x with distance metric f x x i 2 ε 2 1 corr x x i and ρ x 1 the combination of conditions of constant mean and variance together with corr x x i corr x x i is normally referred to as the weak stationarity assumption that might or might not hold in practice as discussed for instance in emelianenko et al 2019 effectively in this formulation the distance plays the most important role placing a small weight on highly correlated points and magnifying weakly correlated regions the maximum value of the variance can be rather small depending on the data which may possibly lead to slow convergence for commonly used numerical algorithms du et al 2006 in contrast with the above approach standard cvt formulation 2 1 applied to the same problem allows achieving a similar effect by fixing euclidean density and instead selecting appropriate density function ρ this method is grounded on the observation that for the solutions to 2 1 the sizes of 2 dimensional voronoi regions defined as h v i 2 max y v i x i y satisfy du et al 1999 2 5 h v i h v j ρ x i ρ x j 1 3 this is the approach advocated for in this work one may rescale the density ρ to achieve any desired ratio of cell sizes based on a certain spatial distribution of interest for instance in ringler et al 2008 cvt mesh was generated using a velocity field in this work we choose our density so that it satisfies the following conditions sup x w ρ x lim corr x c min ρ x r and inf x w ρ x lim corr x c max ρ x r here r and r are scale parameters and corr x denotes effective average correlation at spatial location x with 1 c min corr x c max 1 x w the method for computing this quantity based on averaging correlations at a decorrelation distance is discussed in 4 1 there are many functional forms such a relation can take one choice is to consider power law relation of the type 2 6 ρ x r r c max corr x c max c min α where α 0 denotes the power exponent the choice of this density has been motivated mainly by ringler et al 2008 but other choices might be argued for and will be explored in subsequent research this approach results in the following alternative formulation of the optimal rain gauge placement problem 2 7 min x i i 1 k i 1 k v i r r c max corr x c max c min α x x i 2 2 d x the choice of parameters r r α is ultimately dependent on the data the choice of the numerical optimization algorithm and particular application due to possible convergence issues one needs to constrain density away from zero so that r 0 the scale parameter r magnifies the range of density values based on 2 5 the ratio r r can be interpreted as an approximation for the ratio of largest and smallest voronoi regions r r h max h min and only affects eqn 2 7 linearly we illustrate the role of this ratio in fig 1 by fixing r 1 and varying r values we defer to the values of r 10 6 and r 1 in this work to provide the proof of concept this choice gives a ratio of r r 10 6 and was optimized for the use of tn cvt construction algorithm given desired region size ratio parameter α allows to enhance the contrast between peaks and valleys of the function it is expected that higher values of α will essentially penalize low correlation areas compared to high correlation low density areas exaggerating density differences inside the given domain the choice of the enhancement parameter α is described in details in section 4 3 study regions and dataset this work focused on two very different regions oklahoma in the united states and alto adige in northern italy the reason we chose these two domains is twofold first they are both covered by dense rain gauge networks that can be used as reference to evaluate the proposed algorithm second they are characterized by different topography and therefore different precipitation processes oklahoma is characterized by relatively uniform terrain with gentle topography that rises from the southeastern corner to the tip of the panhandle the continental climate of the region presents cold winters and hot summer seasons and a rainfall spatial pattern that exhibits a west to east dry to wet gradient the study domain is covered by a dense network of meteorological stations the oklahoma mesoscale network hereinafter mesonet brock et al 1995 as seen in fig 2 top although data collected at these stations were not used in this study their locations were compared to the output from our proposed algorithm that optimizes gauge placement to fully capture the precipitation variability in the region a similar analysis was performed in alto adige located in the eastern italian alps unlike oklahoma this area is characterized by complex topography with elevation ranging from 65 to almost 4000 m a s l precipitation climatology in the area exhibits strong spatial gradients with mean annual precipitation varying from 500 mm in the northwestern region to 1700 mm in the southeastern part maggioni et al 2017 nikolopoulos et al 2015 a network of 192 rain gauges is available in the region the rain gauges are distributed quite uniformly over the area fig 2 bottom providing a very dense gauge density 1 70 rain gauge km 2 for a mountainous area for the regional studies across oklahoma and alto adige we adopted a high resolution 1hour 0 04 satellite precipitation product the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann hsu et al 1997 sorooshian et al 2000 hsu et al 2008 produced by the university of california irvine the persiann algorithm extracts and combines information from different types of data including infra red ir brightness temperature images rain gauges and ground based radar specifically in this study we used the persiann cloud classification system persiann ccs which only applies information from ir observations from geostationary satellites with high sampling frequency hsu et al 2010 the hourly persiann ccs was chosen among all available products because of its high spatial resolution 0 04 the persiann ccs algorithm follows four main steps 1 separation of cloud images into cloud patches 2 extraction of cloud features including temperature geometry and texture 3 clustering of cloud patches into organized subgroups and 4 calibration of cloud top brightness temperature and rainfall relationships for the identified subgroups using hourly gauge corrected radar rainfall data hong et al 2004 in the numerical examples below we used a crude conversion of 0 04 5 km when presenting the results for both regions of interest improving this approximation or changing it for other geographic locations will bear no significant consequences in terms of the results 4 proposed algorithm the main steps of the algorithm we are proposing are the following step 1 build cvt density function based on the information on spatio temporal correlations in a certain region using 2 6 step 2 solve the cvt minimization problem 2 7 to obtain optimal rain gauge locations for this region we are now going to discuss the details of step 1 while an example of a tn based cvt solver is provided in appendix b note that other methods may be used in place of the tn method and might be equally effective depending on the properties of the data 4 1 effective correlation computation effective local correlation corr x is a key ingredient of the cvt density estimator used in our method the approach we take is based on the calculation of local correlation of the time series at each grid point the number of neighbors one should be taking into account in this computation is related to the decorrelation distance radius which is estimated using the exponential model with the so called nugget effect ciach and krajewski 1999 ciach and krajewski 2006 4 8 ρ g d c 0 exp d d 0 s 0 where d is the separation distance between two points c 0 is the nugget parameter which corresponds to the correlation value for the near zero distances cressie 1993 d 0 is the scale parameter which corresponds to the spatial decorrelation distance and s 0 is the correlogram shape parameter which controls the behavior of the model near the origin for small separation distances note that 1 c 0 is the instant decorrelation due to random errors in the rainfall observations ciach 2003 we estimate corr x as the average of correlation coefficients between given point x and locations on the circle s x d y w y x 2 d of radius d 4 9 corr x corr d x 1 s x d y s x d corr x y where corr x y is the pearson correlation coefficient given in 2 3 monte carlo integration over the circle of radius d may be used to speed up the calculation of this quantity using uniform sampling y 1 y n over the region s x d y w d 1 y x 2 d 1 we define 4 10 corr n x 1 n i 1 n corr x y i this method gives an error of the order of o 1 n caflisch 1998 the value of n 100 was used in the numerical experiments described in section 5 importance sampling may be used to improve the accuracy of the monte carlo approximation of the local correlation map but it was not explored in current work we define the separating distance d 0 at which the correlation is 1 e the correlation length for the assumed exponential variogram model 4 11 d 0 min d corr d x 1 e fig 3 left demonstrates the calculation of the decorrelation distance for the case of the data collected over the adige mountainous region in northern italy we expect to have relatively small decorrelation distance over mountains which is indeed true based on this data from which a value of 9 grid points may be estimated which corresponds to 45 km similar calculation performed over the flat region of oklahoma shows decorrelation at 16 grid points corresponding to 80 km as seen in fig 3 right now that the correlation component of the density is defined we are ready to discuss a possible strategy for picking optimal value for α given expected number of rain gauges and a correlation threshold the choice of the density can be motivated by several factors including availability of resources and desired accuracy fig 4 shows cvt densities for adige region computed using formula 2 6 with corr x computed at the decorrelation distance as discussed above two different values of parameter α have been tested resulting in clear differences in densities 4 2 optimal α and main algorithm first let us investigate the sensitivity of the density function given in 2 6 to the choice of α we generate 50 densities based on different α evenly distributed between 0 5 and 25 a subset of corresponding densities is shown in fig 6 two error metrics wang et al 2004 are used to quantify the differences between the two images i e two different densities in this case the root mean squared error rmse and the structural similarity index ssim which is used to resemble human perception the closer the value of ssim is to 1 the greater the similarity between two images fig 5 shows the differences between densities for different α values and the first density corresponding to α 0 5 as we can see from the consistent trend provided by different metrics the change of density slows down dramatically as α increases in view of these results it is critical to carefully choose such parameter one may want to optimize the choice of parameter α based for instance on the desired number of rain gauges k g to be placed in the regions with relative correlation below a certain threshold c tol namely we can pick density in such a way that we get approximately k g locations with relative correlation below c tol we may choose an optimal value α as the smallest α satisfying 4 12 k x c rel α corr x c min c max c min α c tol k g where denotes the number of grid points in the set if α 1 immediately satisfies condition 4 12 we stop otherwise we keep increasing α until the desired resolution is obtained for instance if the desired relative tolerance is c tol 0 1 meaning that locations with correlation below 10 are targeted and if we are planning to place k g 100 gauges in a certain area we will need to pick α to satisfy k x c rel α 0 1 100 fig 6 gives a visualization of the optimal α selection procedure in the case of adige data based on the above strategy with the choice of k g 60 c tol 0 1 and default values r 1 r 1 while the locations satisfying condition 4 12 are good candidates for initial gauge placement this choice is not optimal in terms of the overall approximation of the precipitation in the region of interest as discussed above optimal placement is attained by computing cvt that minimizes the approximation error 2 1 finally in algorithm 1 we describe the main iterative algorithm for determining optimal placement for rain gauges for a given region algorithm 1 automatic selection of optimal gauge locations 1 procedure gaugeoptim 2 define correlation threshold c tol default value c tol 0 1 desired number of gauges k g 3 form the n n observation matrix y where n and n denote the discrete spatial and temporal resolution respectively 4 compute corr y j at each location y j j 1 n using 4 10 5 compute decorrelation distance d using 4 11 6 interpolate the correlation map set α 0 7 loop let α α 1 8 build the density map for the interpolated grid using 2 6 9 if 4 12 is not satisfied then 10 goto loop 11 else 12 return optimal α 13 starting with k g random points find cvt optimal generators x i i 1 k g using tn method given in appendix b or any alternative method with the density 2 6 14 calculate cvt energy 2 1 apart from the precipitation time series data the only input parameters needed to run the code are the correlation threshold c tol and the number of gauges to be placed k g the default value for c tol is 0 1 while the number of gauges can be arbitrary if desired the user may choose to construct the cvt tessellation for any given number of generators k g starting immediately at line 13 of algorithm 1 5 numerical results and discussion figs 7 and 8 provide the results of applying algorithm 1 to both regions and compare the optimal locations of rain gauges with existing rain gauge locations the default values of r 10 6 r 1 were chosen in all calculations as shown in fig 7 more gauges would be required where topography is the most complex i e the northwestern region of alto adige characterized by altitudes close to 4000 m a s l on the other hand in the valleys in the southeastern region fewer gauges would be needed to fully capture the variability of precipitation similarly in oklahoma where topography is more uniform than in alto adige the gauge placement is also more homogeneous with limited areas characterized by high density this suggests that the proposed algorithm has the potential to optimize gauge placement based on observed precipitation patterns and variability that are partly linked to the geography of the region e g orographic rainfall systems in fact elevation was shown in past literature to play a crucial role in rainfall variability e g sanchez moreno et al 2014 gebregiorgis and hossain 2012 nevertheless as topography is not the only variable affecting precipitation e g johnson and hanson 1995 future work should look at investigating gauge placement as a function of such information e g climate temperature vegetation cover etc since the output of the proposed framework is the optimal gauge locations provided above one could wonder how different they are from the actual gauge locations in these regions in other words 1 can we identify actual gauges that are close to the optimal location and therefore fundamental to capture precipitation variability and 2 can we identify gauges that are less important and even if undergoing maintenance would not be crucial to capture the full variability of the precipitation field in the area in order to answer these questions we look at euclidean distance between a certain gauge and the closest optimal location for its simplicity and practical application others can be considered e g ringler et al 2008 we pick a measure of closeness as a circle of a certain radius and count the number of gauges that fall within that distance from any optimal location tables 1 and 2 give direct counts of the gauges that are close and far from optimal locations and figs 9 and 10 provide visual representation of these results obviously some locations may be inaccessible especially in complex terrain although optimal the methodology introduced in this work can be modified to account for physical constraints and other resource allocation problems but this is beyond the scope of this article and recommended for future work we now demonstrate the use of cvt energy as a way of measuring optimality of any given set of gauge locations and apply it to existing gauges in both regions as shown in fig 11 the approximation error is significantly decreased by running the optimization routine more specifically the error decreases from 259 56 to 15 02 for adige data and from 8 61 10 4 to 4 67 10 4 for oklahoma which are smaller than both from the real gauge locations since the goal of this work is to provide a proof of concept of our cvt based methodology a systematic and rigorous validation process will be developed in the future 6 summary we developed an automated strategy that allows to find optimal precipitation gauge locations in any given region based on the variability pattern in the precipitation over the region the proposed algorithm could potentially be applied to any precipitation dataset including re analysis products that is long enough to capture the temporal variability of precipitation regardless of any seasonality while variance was assumed to be stationary in this work cvt framework allows to extend this approach to the non stationary situation by keeping additional terms in the cost functional

5618,with more satellite and model precipitation data becoming available new analytical methods are needed that can take advantage of emerging data patterns to make well informed predictions in many hydrological applications we propose a new strategy where we extract precipitation variability patterns and use correlation map to build the resulting density map that serves as an input to centroidal voronoi tessellation construction that optimizes placement of precipitation gauges we provide results of numerical experiments based on the data from the alto adige region in northern italy and oklahoma and compare them against actual gauge locations this method provides an automated way for choosing new gauge locations and can be generalized to include physical constraints and to tackle other types of resource allocation problems keywords rain gauges cvt decorrelation optimal placement 1 introduction precipitation is a critical variable in the water cycle as it provides moisture for processes such as runoff evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge knowledge of the precipitation characteristics and patterns is therefore crucial for understanding land climate interactions for extreme event monitoring and for water resource management however accurate precipitation information at fine space and time scales is difficult to obtain as precipitation estimates from rain gauges ground based radars satellite sensors and numerical models are all affected by significant uncertainties which can even be amplified when exposed to non linear land surface model physics gottschalck et al 2005 hazra et al 2019 rain gauge or pluviometer networks are the only direct method to measure precipitation and provide observations with high temporal resolution as such they are widely accepted as the benchmark for validating remotely sensed precipitation products e g maggioni et al 2016 anagnostou et al 2009 point gauge measurements are often interpolated to obtain a spatially distributed rainfall field whose quality highly depends on the interpolation method used common interpolation methods include inverse distance weighted averaging ordinary kriging and correlation length grieser 2015 and more recent ones include co kriging foehn et al 2018 and methods that combine meteorological observations with regional climate model simulations wang et al 2017 however obtaining a spatially representative precipitation field from rain gauges may require collecting a large number of observations at several locations to include different terrain micro climate and vegetation variability this translates into placing numerous gauges which is costly in terms of maintenance and often not feasible because of location inaccessibility since rain gauges cannot offer spatially continuous information of precipitation kidd et al 2012 it is desirable to place them in a strategic way accounting for changes in spatio temporal patterns and having a methodology that is able to adapt to climate instabilities as suggested in emelianenko et al 2019 this work proposes an automated method to identify the optimal locations of rain gauges in order to capture the spatial variability of precipitation systems in the region and therefore provide a spatially representative rain field in comparison with kriging based approaches wadoux et al 2017 pardo igúzquiza 1998 barca et al 2008 our model enjoys a simpler analytical and numerical formulation owing to the natural minimization properties of the centroidal voronoi tessellations cvts described below allowing to readily apply it to relatively large regions of interest voronoi tessellations appear in many contexts and serve a variety of purposes they are referred to as quantizations in the electrical engineering community agrell and ericsson 1998 as polygons of influence or thiessen regions in geostatistics thiessen 1911 as geodesic icosahedral or hexagonal grids in climate system modeling ringler et al 2000 the corresponding energy functional can be thought of as variation in statistical terminology or as a cost functional in economic terms the basic idea of this construction is to represent a large set of data by means of few representative points i e generators while this general concept has been widely used in a variety of contexts the special case of cvts which is used to denote voronoi diagrams with the choice of generators that minimizes the energy functional is less known due to the difficulties associated with its construction this concept has been gaining popularity in the recent decades in many applications areas ranging from biology and physics to finance economics and social science see du et al 2000 chen and xu 2004 ringler et al 2008 and references therein it is particularly well studied in the context of mesh generation clustering quantization imaging reduced order modeling and partial differential equations applications where a number of theoretical results has been obtained attesting for its superior qualities comparing to other competing methodologies to the best of our knowledge applications of cvts in hydrology so far have been limited to mesh generation lu et al 2017 due to the flexibility provided by cvt for local mesh refinement the goal of this work is twofold first we want to introduce the concept of cvts for precipitation pattern analysis and point out some recently developed numerical algorithms that help constructing cvts in continuous and discrete settings second we are applying the idea of cvts in the context of optimal placement of rain gauges similarly to how it was previously applied in finding optimal placement of schools post offices and other resources du et al 1999 while other types of generalizations of the voronoi construction have been explored for instance in the context of optimizing precipitation field using similarity of rainfall data at grid locations e g using the radar polygon method proposed in cho et al 2016 this is the first application of the cvt methodology to modeling rainfall data and specifically to the optimization of rain gauge placement the practical aim of this study is to develop an automated strategy that would work for an arbitrary data in any geographical location we draw attention to several modeling assumptions that are part of the algorithm presented herein and the implications of these assumptions on the algorithm performance based on several selected datasets we utilize the truncated newton tn method nash 2000 which is a large scale nonlinear optimization algorithm to construct all cvt solutions this method allows to considerably speed up the calculation comparing to techniques such as lloyd method widely used in the engineering community lloyd 1982 and has advantages over previously introduced modified lloyd formulations as shown in di et al 2012 as in any cvt problem aimed at finding optimal placement of resources one needs to have a local density estimator when trying to optimize rain gauge placement this density should be naturally related to the measure of local precipitation variability in this work we have used a variability estimator based on local covariance matrix computed at the decorrelation distance overall our aim in this work is to develop an automated strategy to optimally place rain gauge that could be employed in any geographical location in the future to achieve this goal we propose a cvt method that uses the local covariance matrix derived from local precipitation as the density estimator this method could be applied to any precipitation dataset whether in situ remotely sensed or based on model simulations the article is organized as follows section 2 provides information on the cvt methodology and formulates the problem of optimal gauge placement comparing to previously used approaches section 3 gives information on the data we used in this work the proposed algorithm is presented in section 4 we also demonstrate predictions given by this model with existing gauge locations in section 5 2 methods 2 1 voronoi and centroidal voronoi tessellations the idea of tessellating the region i e decomposing the region into sub regions based on the locations of rain gauges has appeared in the early works of thiessen thiessen 1911 the construction is simple consider a certain geographic region w r 2 voronoi regions v i i 1 k are generated by a set of points x i i 1 k r 2 and are defined as follows v i x i x w x x i x x j j 1 k j i where is any distance metric in this work we choose it to be the standard euclidean norm these regions cover the entire domain w and can be formed by drawing perpendicular bisectors to the segments joining consecutive generating points given a certain desired density function ρ x one can compute the tessellation error i e 2 1 e x i i 1 k min x i i 1 k i 1 k v i ρ x x x i 2 d x it can be shown burkardt et al 2006 that this happens precisely when x i x i where x i is the mass centroid of the corresponding voronoi region v i a tessellation satisfying this property is called a centroidal voronoi tessellation or cvt for short notice that the above formulation may be extended to other more general cases i e by considering other distance metrics f other geometric constraints and periodic extensions du et al 1999 zhang et al 2012 the density function may be used to represent a variety of physical characteristics such as local characteristic length scale ringler et al 2008 signal intensity emelianenko 2010 desired grid resolution burkardt et al 2006 in this work we propose to use it for representing spatial rainfall variability as described in section 4 the classical method for constructing cvts is the algorithm developed by lloyd in the 1980s lloyd 1982 which represents a fixed point type iterative mechanism more efficient methods for calculating cvts have been developed in the past decades du and emelianenko 2006 du and emelianenko 2008 di et al 2012 for an overview of cvt related numerical techniques we refer interested reader to du et al 1999 chen and holst 2011 to achieve a robust construction of cvt we utilize tn to solve the resulting large scale optimization problem due to its relative simplicity and robust performance comparing to other existing methods in terms of both accuracy and convergence speed see the pseudocode given in appendix b we note that other methods might deliver comparable or better performance possibly at the cost of an increase in numerical sophistication comparative study of numerical solvers suitable for this problem is outside the scope of the current work 2 2 problem formulation there are several possible ways to formulate the problem of optimal placement of rain gauges in a certain region one method has been proposed in okabe et al 1992 and later used in du et al 1999 if k rain gauges locations in region w r 2 are given by x 1 x k and v i w are the voronoi region associated with the i th gauge one can minimize the expected squared approximation error for the amount of rainfall z x treated as a random variable z x m x x with mean m x and deviation x if the change in the average trend m x is small compared with the variance var x e x 2 ε which is assumed to be constant the expected squared approximation error can be approximated as 2 2 e x i i 1 k min x i i 1 k i 1 n v i 2 ε 2 1 corr x x i d x where 2 3 corr x x i e x x i var x var x i is the pearson linear correlation coefficient of the time series at locations x and x i details on this derivation are given in appendix a evaluation of 2 2 is computationally intensive requiring calculation of pairwise correlations for all points inside the domain notice that under the additional assumption that corr x x i only depends on the differences x x i e x i v i i 1 k can be thought of as a generalization of the cvt energy 2 1 given by 2 4 e x i i 1 k i 1 k v i ρ x f x x i d x with distance metric f x x i 2 ε 2 1 corr x x i and ρ x 1 the combination of conditions of constant mean and variance together with corr x x i corr x x i is normally referred to as the weak stationarity assumption that might or might not hold in practice as discussed for instance in emelianenko et al 2019 effectively in this formulation the distance plays the most important role placing a small weight on highly correlated points and magnifying weakly correlated regions the maximum value of the variance can be rather small depending on the data which may possibly lead to slow convergence for commonly used numerical algorithms du et al 2006 in contrast with the above approach standard cvt formulation 2 1 applied to the same problem allows achieving a similar effect by fixing euclidean density and instead selecting appropriate density function ρ this method is grounded on the observation that for the solutions to 2 1 the sizes of 2 dimensional voronoi regions defined as h v i 2 max y v i x i y satisfy du et al 1999 2 5 h v i h v j ρ x i ρ x j 1 3 this is the approach advocated for in this work one may rescale the density ρ to achieve any desired ratio of cell sizes based on a certain spatial distribution of interest for instance in ringler et al 2008 cvt mesh was generated using a velocity field in this work we choose our density so that it satisfies the following conditions sup x w ρ x lim corr x c min ρ x r and inf x w ρ x lim corr x c max ρ x r here r and r are scale parameters and corr x denotes effective average correlation at spatial location x with 1 c min corr x c max 1 x w the method for computing this quantity based on averaging correlations at a decorrelation distance is discussed in 4 1 there are many functional forms such a relation can take one choice is to consider power law relation of the type 2 6 ρ x r r c max corr x c max c min α where α 0 denotes the power exponent the choice of this density has been motivated mainly by ringler et al 2008 but other choices might be argued for and will be explored in subsequent research this approach results in the following alternative formulation of the optimal rain gauge placement problem 2 7 min x i i 1 k i 1 k v i r r c max corr x c max c min α x x i 2 2 d x the choice of parameters r r α is ultimately dependent on the data the choice of the numerical optimization algorithm and particular application due to possible convergence issues one needs to constrain density away from zero so that r 0 the scale parameter r magnifies the range of density values based on 2 5 the ratio r r can be interpreted as an approximation for the ratio of largest and smallest voronoi regions r r h max h min and only affects eqn 2 7 linearly we illustrate the role of this ratio in fig 1 by fixing r 1 and varying r values we defer to the values of r 10 6 and r 1 in this work to provide the proof of concept this choice gives a ratio of r r 10 6 and was optimized for the use of tn cvt construction algorithm given desired region size ratio parameter α allows to enhance the contrast between peaks and valleys of the function it is expected that higher values of α will essentially penalize low correlation areas compared to high correlation low density areas exaggerating density differences inside the given domain the choice of the enhancement parameter α is described in details in section 4 3 study regions and dataset this work focused on two very different regions oklahoma in the united states and alto adige in northern italy the reason we chose these two domains is twofold first they are both covered by dense rain gauge networks that can be used as reference to evaluate the proposed algorithm second they are characterized by different topography and therefore different precipitation processes oklahoma is characterized by relatively uniform terrain with gentle topography that rises from the southeastern corner to the tip of the panhandle the continental climate of the region presents cold winters and hot summer seasons and a rainfall spatial pattern that exhibits a west to east dry to wet gradient the study domain is covered by a dense network of meteorological stations the oklahoma mesoscale network hereinafter mesonet brock et al 1995 as seen in fig 2 top although data collected at these stations were not used in this study their locations were compared to the output from our proposed algorithm that optimizes gauge placement to fully capture the precipitation variability in the region a similar analysis was performed in alto adige located in the eastern italian alps unlike oklahoma this area is characterized by complex topography with elevation ranging from 65 to almost 4000 m a s l precipitation climatology in the area exhibits strong spatial gradients with mean annual precipitation varying from 500 mm in the northwestern region to 1700 mm in the southeastern part maggioni et al 2017 nikolopoulos et al 2015 a network of 192 rain gauges is available in the region the rain gauges are distributed quite uniformly over the area fig 2 bottom providing a very dense gauge density 1 70 rain gauge km 2 for a mountainous area for the regional studies across oklahoma and alto adige we adopted a high resolution 1hour 0 04 satellite precipitation product the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann hsu et al 1997 sorooshian et al 2000 hsu et al 2008 produced by the university of california irvine the persiann algorithm extracts and combines information from different types of data including infra red ir brightness temperature images rain gauges and ground based radar specifically in this study we used the persiann cloud classification system persiann ccs which only applies information from ir observations from geostationary satellites with high sampling frequency hsu et al 2010 the hourly persiann ccs was chosen among all available products because of its high spatial resolution 0 04 the persiann ccs algorithm follows four main steps 1 separation of cloud images into cloud patches 2 extraction of cloud features including temperature geometry and texture 3 clustering of cloud patches into organized subgroups and 4 calibration of cloud top brightness temperature and rainfall relationships for the identified subgroups using hourly gauge corrected radar rainfall data hong et al 2004 in the numerical examples below we used a crude conversion of 0 04 5 km when presenting the results for both regions of interest improving this approximation or changing it for other geographic locations will bear no significant consequences in terms of the results 4 proposed algorithm the main steps of the algorithm we are proposing are the following step 1 build cvt density function based on the information on spatio temporal correlations in a certain region using 2 6 step 2 solve the cvt minimization problem 2 7 to obtain optimal rain gauge locations for this region we are now going to discuss the details of step 1 while an example of a tn based cvt solver is provided in appendix b note that other methods may be used in place of the tn method and might be equally effective depending on the properties of the data 4 1 effective correlation computation effective local correlation corr x is a key ingredient of the cvt density estimator used in our method the approach we take is based on the calculation of local correlation of the time series at each grid point the number of neighbors one should be taking into account in this computation is related to the decorrelation distance radius which is estimated using the exponential model with the so called nugget effect ciach and krajewski 1999 ciach and krajewski 2006 4 8 ρ g d c 0 exp d d 0 s 0 where d is the separation distance between two points c 0 is the nugget parameter which corresponds to the correlation value for the near zero distances cressie 1993 d 0 is the scale parameter which corresponds to the spatial decorrelation distance and s 0 is the correlogram shape parameter which controls the behavior of the model near the origin for small separation distances note that 1 c 0 is the instant decorrelation due to random errors in the rainfall observations ciach 2003 we estimate corr x as the average of correlation coefficients between given point x and locations on the circle s x d y w y x 2 d of radius d 4 9 corr x corr d x 1 s x d y s x d corr x y where corr x y is the pearson correlation coefficient given in 2 3 monte carlo integration over the circle of radius d may be used to speed up the calculation of this quantity using uniform sampling y 1 y n over the region s x d y w d 1 y x 2 d 1 we define 4 10 corr n x 1 n i 1 n corr x y i this method gives an error of the order of o 1 n caflisch 1998 the value of n 100 was used in the numerical experiments described in section 5 importance sampling may be used to improve the accuracy of the monte carlo approximation of the local correlation map but it was not explored in current work we define the separating distance d 0 at which the correlation is 1 e the correlation length for the assumed exponential variogram model 4 11 d 0 min d corr d x 1 e fig 3 left demonstrates the calculation of the decorrelation distance for the case of the data collected over the adige mountainous region in northern italy we expect to have relatively small decorrelation distance over mountains which is indeed true based on this data from which a value of 9 grid points may be estimated which corresponds to 45 km similar calculation performed over the flat region of oklahoma shows decorrelation at 16 grid points corresponding to 80 km as seen in fig 3 right now that the correlation component of the density is defined we are ready to discuss a possible strategy for picking optimal value for α given expected number of rain gauges and a correlation threshold the choice of the density can be motivated by several factors including availability of resources and desired accuracy fig 4 shows cvt densities for adige region computed using formula 2 6 with corr x computed at the decorrelation distance as discussed above two different values of parameter α have been tested resulting in clear differences in densities 4 2 optimal α and main algorithm first let us investigate the sensitivity of the density function given in 2 6 to the choice of α we generate 50 densities based on different α evenly distributed between 0 5 and 25 a subset of corresponding densities is shown in fig 6 two error metrics wang et al 2004 are used to quantify the differences between the two images i e two different densities in this case the root mean squared error rmse and the structural similarity index ssim which is used to resemble human perception the closer the value of ssim is to 1 the greater the similarity between two images fig 5 shows the differences between densities for different α values and the first density corresponding to α 0 5 as we can see from the consistent trend provided by different metrics the change of density slows down dramatically as α increases in view of these results it is critical to carefully choose such parameter one may want to optimize the choice of parameter α based for instance on the desired number of rain gauges k g to be placed in the regions with relative correlation below a certain threshold c tol namely we can pick density in such a way that we get approximately k g locations with relative correlation below c tol we may choose an optimal value α as the smallest α satisfying 4 12 k x c rel α corr x c min c max c min α c tol k g where denotes the number of grid points in the set if α 1 immediately satisfies condition 4 12 we stop otherwise we keep increasing α until the desired resolution is obtained for instance if the desired relative tolerance is c tol 0 1 meaning that locations with correlation below 10 are targeted and if we are planning to place k g 100 gauges in a certain area we will need to pick α to satisfy k x c rel α 0 1 100 fig 6 gives a visualization of the optimal α selection procedure in the case of adige data based on the above strategy with the choice of k g 60 c tol 0 1 and default values r 1 r 1 while the locations satisfying condition 4 12 are good candidates for initial gauge placement this choice is not optimal in terms of the overall approximation of the precipitation in the region of interest as discussed above optimal placement is attained by computing cvt that minimizes the approximation error 2 1 finally in algorithm 1 we describe the main iterative algorithm for determining optimal placement for rain gauges for a given region algorithm 1 automatic selection of optimal gauge locations 1 procedure gaugeoptim 2 define correlation threshold c tol default value c tol 0 1 desired number of gauges k g 3 form the n n observation matrix y where n and n denote the discrete spatial and temporal resolution respectively 4 compute corr y j at each location y j j 1 n using 4 10 5 compute decorrelation distance d using 4 11 6 interpolate the correlation map set α 0 7 loop let α α 1 8 build the density map for the interpolated grid using 2 6 9 if 4 12 is not satisfied then 10 goto loop 11 else 12 return optimal α 13 starting with k g random points find cvt optimal generators x i i 1 k g using tn method given in appendix b or any alternative method with the density 2 6 14 calculate cvt energy 2 1 apart from the precipitation time series data the only input parameters needed to run the code are the correlation threshold c tol and the number of gauges to be placed k g the default value for c tol is 0 1 while the number of gauges can be arbitrary if desired the user may choose to construct the cvt tessellation for any given number of generators k g starting immediately at line 13 of algorithm 1 5 numerical results and discussion figs 7 and 8 provide the results of applying algorithm 1 to both regions and compare the optimal locations of rain gauges with existing rain gauge locations the default values of r 10 6 r 1 were chosen in all calculations as shown in fig 7 more gauges would be required where topography is the most complex i e the northwestern region of alto adige characterized by altitudes close to 4000 m a s l on the other hand in the valleys in the southeastern region fewer gauges would be needed to fully capture the variability of precipitation similarly in oklahoma where topography is more uniform than in alto adige the gauge placement is also more homogeneous with limited areas characterized by high density this suggests that the proposed algorithm has the potential to optimize gauge placement based on observed precipitation patterns and variability that are partly linked to the geography of the region e g orographic rainfall systems in fact elevation was shown in past literature to play a crucial role in rainfall variability e g sanchez moreno et al 2014 gebregiorgis and hossain 2012 nevertheless as topography is not the only variable affecting precipitation e g johnson and hanson 1995 future work should look at investigating gauge placement as a function of such information e g climate temperature vegetation cover etc since the output of the proposed framework is the optimal gauge locations provided above one could wonder how different they are from the actual gauge locations in these regions in other words 1 can we identify actual gauges that are close to the optimal location and therefore fundamental to capture precipitation variability and 2 can we identify gauges that are less important and even if undergoing maintenance would not be crucial to capture the full variability of the precipitation field in the area in order to answer these questions we look at euclidean distance between a certain gauge and the closest optimal location for its simplicity and practical application others can be considered e g ringler et al 2008 we pick a measure of closeness as a circle of a certain radius and count the number of gauges that fall within that distance from any optimal location tables 1 and 2 give direct counts of the gauges that are close and far from optimal locations and figs 9 and 10 provide visual representation of these results obviously some locations may be inaccessible especially in complex terrain although optimal the methodology introduced in this work can be modified to account for physical constraints and other resource allocation problems but this is beyond the scope of this article and recommended for future work we now demonstrate the use of cvt energy as a way of measuring optimality of any given set of gauge locations and apply it to existing gauges in both regions as shown in fig 11 the approximation error is significantly decreased by running the optimization routine more specifically the error decreases from 259 56 to 15 02 for adige data and from 8 61 10 4 to 4 67 10 4 for oklahoma which are smaller than both from the real gauge locations since the goal of this work is to provide a proof of concept of our cvt based methodology a systematic and rigorous validation process will be developed in the future 6 summary we developed an automated strategy that allows to find optimal precipitation gauge locations in any given region based on the variability pattern in the precipitation over the region the proposed algorithm could potentially be applied to any precipitation dataset including re analysis products that is long enough to capture the temporal variability of precipitation regardless of any seasonality while variance was assumed to be stationary in this work cvt framework allows to extend this approach to the non stationary situation by keeping additional terms in the cost functional 8 13 and adjusting the corresponding density we chose satellite based observations because of their global or quasi global coverage making this method applicable anywhere else in the world this is particularly useful when planning a field campaign to select sampling sites or when installing a new gauge network to pick the optimal number of gauges and their locations credit authorship

5619,we investigate the seasonal evolution of stratification in a deep 100 m high altitude 4 730 m a s l dimictic lake on the tibetan plateau using three years of observation of nam co the lake is situated at relatively low latitude 30 n where it receives high solar radiative forcing observed maximum daily average 400 w m 2 yet the annual average air temperature is close to 0 c at this high altitude these features make nam co distinct from most well documented dimictic lakes which are usually located at higher latitude and lower altitude we classify seasonal stratification into six phases based on strength of stratification surface temperature relative to the temperature of maximum density ice cover and heat and mixing dynamics which we use to compare nam co with better documented higher latitude dimictic lakes while the three warm stratification phases i e when water is warmer than the temperature of maximum density in nam co are relatively cold they are otherwise similar to that observed in high latitude dimictic lakes conversely two of nam co s cold stratification phases are distinct from that reported in high latitude lakes these two phases are characterized by the interplay between the relatively strong radiative forcing and surface heat flux and include the following 1 during fall turnover persistent winds aided by radiatively driven convection prolong vertical mixing i e turnover and surface heat loss such that the entire water column cools well below the temperature of maximum density as low as 1 c and 2 in contrast under ice cover with relatively little snow the entire water column of the lake warms continuously due to through ice solar radiative flux the intense cooling and heating during these two phases counteract each other such that hypolimnetic temperature at spring turnover is similar to that observed in high latitude lakes our observations highlight the relative importance of radiatively driven convection on the seasonal stratification dynamics of nam co and underscore that these dynamics must be considered when attempting to predict climate change impacts on high altitude low latitude lakes including the 1100 largely unstudied lakes on the tibetan plateau keywords nam co the tibetan plateau radiatively driven convection winter stratification dimictic thermal fluxes 1 introduction the seasonal cycle of thermal stratification in large deep freshwater lakes is modified by latitude and altitude macintyre and melack 2009 in general annual average air temperature decreases with both increasing latitude and altitude thus the effect of increasing altitude on lake stratification is typically assumed to be equivalent to increasing latitude e g hutchison and löffler 1956 lewis 1983 while this generalized latitude altitude equivalency captures variation in bulk heat input it neglects changes to the components of surface heat flux with changing latitude in particular it overlooks latitudinal changes of penetrating solar radiation versus non penetrating heat fluxes net long wave radiation sensible and latent heat this is significant because when fresh water is colder than the temperature of maximum density tmd 4 c for pure water at standard atmospheric pressure warming increases density and penetrating solar radiation drives convection within the water column c f farmer 1975 mironov et al 2002 in typical e g high latitude low altitude dimictic lakes radiatively driven convection is only significant during the later stages of winter when solar radiation is strong but ice cover persists with minimal snow cover e g winter ii as defined by kirillin et al 2012 conversely radiatively driven convection is typically considered insignificant during the ice free season between fall turnover and ice formation because fall turnover occurs near the annual solar minimum e g farmer and carmack 1981 for example at 60 c latitude top of atmosphere daily average solar radiative forcing varies from a maximum of 350 w m 2 during summer solstice to a minimum of 25 w m 2 during winter solstice around the time of fall turnover e g pawlowicz et al 2001 radiatively driven convection is also considered insignificant during early winter because of continued low solar radiation at that time combined with snow attenuation and reflection e g winter i kirillin et al 2012 to highlight latitudinal versus altitudinal effects on penetrating versus non penetrating heat fluxes consider that global annual average surface air temperature at 30 n is 20 c peixoto and oort 1992 yet due to its high elevation the annual average air temperature on the tibetan plateau is 0 c you et al 2007 more comparable to global annual temperatures at 60 n conversely the annual minimum top of atmosphere solar insolation at 30 latitude is 220 w m 2 substantially more than the 25 w m 2 annual minimum at 60 latitude pawlowicz et al 2001 thus lakes at the altitude and latitude of the tibetan plateau are subjected to low winter air temperatures comparable to lakes at 60 n but with much stronger solar forcing the tibetan plateau is a large distinct and relatively understudied geographic region its high mean elevation 4000 m a s l results in low air temperature despite its relatively low latitude qiu 2008 more than 1123 lakes larger than 1 km2 with a combined surface area of 4 104 km2 are distributed across the tibetan plateau zhang et al 2013 making it a globally significant lake region though the authors do not get into energetics analyses published observations of thermistor chain data from bangong co wang et al 2014 and nam co wang et al 2019 show that fall isothermal cooling extends well below tmd suggesting either strong wind stirring or an additional mixing mechanism not typically considered important at fall overturn e g radiatively driven convection in addition their data show both lakes warmed isothermally under ice cover suggesting winter ii conditions kirillin et al 2012 prevailed during the ice covered period in this paper we explore the effects of low air temperature and high solar forcing on seasonal stratification emphasizing turnover and winter stratification when lake water is colder than the temperature of maximum density we present three years of observations of thermal stratification in nam co a large deep high altitude lake on the central tibetan plateau based on continuous in situ monitoring we develop a heat budget to validate heat flux estimates then quantify energetics of mixing and stratification to identify six distinct phases of the seasonal evolution of thermal stratification which are shown to be controlled by a competition between combined mixing effects due to wind and the seasonally alternating mixing and stratifying effects of surface buoyancy flux the six phases of seasonal stratification observed in nam co are then discussed in relation to observations of seasonal stratification of comparator lakes 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description nam co lake center at 30 40 n 90 30 e is a dimictic endorheic lake at high altitude 4730 m a s l located in the central part of the tibetan plateau fig 1 a wang et al 2019 the lake has a surface area of 2020 km2 making it the third largest lake in the tibetan plateau region zhang et al 2013 the basin shape is dominated by a large flat deep water area in the central part of the lake where the water depth is generally 95 m and the maximum recorded water depth is 98 9 m a small shallower sub basin exists to the east of kunduo and qiduo islands fig 1c with a maximum water depth of 60 m wang et al 2009 the lake volume is estimated as 86 km3 and has been increasing over several decades zhu et al 2010 climatically nam co is located in the monsoon influenced transition zone between semi humid and semi arid areas the mean annual wind speed is 4 m s 1 with a maximum monthly mean wind speed of 6 1 m s 1 occurring in january you et al 2007 the nam co area has an annual mean air temperature of approximately 0 c and precipitation of 450 mm a 1 guan et al 1984 ma et al 2012 with distinct rainy and dry seasons the precipitation during the warm rainy season may september constitutes 91 of the total annual precipitation guan et al 1984 ma et al 2012 some attempts have been made to estimate the annual evaporation from nam co s surface with a range of values reported 635 mm ma et al 2016 658 mm haginoya et al 2009 832 69 mm lazhu et al 2016 river inflow into the lake primarily occurs during the summer season with mean summer flow rates 200 300 m3 s 1 yielding a seasonal lake level increase of 400 1000 mm zhou et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 conducted a water balance for nam co during the open water months may october and found a consistent imbalance over five years that they attribute to net groundwater recharge from nam co 100 200 m3 s 1 assuming this outflow is constant year round gives a hydraulic residence time 10 15 years this long residence time suggests the influence of inflows on seasonal timescales is insignificant to heat budgets and stratification and inflows will be assumed negligible in this work as expected for an endorheic lake nam co is saline and alkaline measured specific conductivity and ph are 1850 μs cm 1 and 9 2 respectively wang et al 2009 with na and hco3 the dominant cation and anion in the lake water respectively wang et al 2010 showed that an evaporation crystallization process is the main controlling mechanism of the lake water chemistry as will be shown the observed salinity distribution is of secondary importance to the seasonal evolution of thermal stratification except during spring melt of ice and snow based on remote sensing modis data and in situ observations gou et al 2017 found that complete freezing and start of break up in nam co occurred in late january and mid late april respectively with an average complete ice cover period of 80 days also based on remote sensing cai et al 2019 reported the mean breakup end date at nam co was 9th may the thickest ice is observed in mid march with a thickness of 60 cm based on the in situ measurement 2 2 field data meteorological data air temperature precipitation wind speed short and long wave radiation were recorded at 10 minute intervals at the nam co station fig 1c with a vaisala miro520 automated weather station temperature data loggers vemco minilog ii t canada accuracy 0 1 c from 5 to 35 c resolution 0 01 c were deployed throughout the entire study period at station t2 fig 1c from late october 2011 to early july 2014 at the following depths 6 16 21 26 31 36 56 and 66 m a logger at 46 m depth was lost and the loggers at 21 and 31 m depth were deployed in may 2013 the logging interval was 10 min two ctd90m multi parameter probes sea sun technology germany measuring in situ temperature electrical conductivity pressure and turbidity were deployed near the surface 3 m deep late may 2012 to middle september 2013 and the bottom 83 m deep late may 2012 to early july 2014 of the mooring at station t2 with a recording interval of 2 h unfortunately the 83 m turbidity sensor became fouled in january 2013 giving high turbidity values 40 ftu which decreased to 1 ftu upon servicing thus these data are not shown regular water quality profiling of in situ temperature specific conductivity and photosynthetically active radiation par was conducted with a multi parameter sonde hach hydrolab ds5 usa at one station in the main western basin t2 93 m depth fig 1c every two to four weeks from early april to late november covering most of the open water period the hydrolab conductivity and temperature sensors were calibrated at 1 2 year intervals and spot checked against the two moored ctd90m multi parameter probes one profile was made at t2 with a ctd90m multi parameter probe on 8 september 2013 and in situ temperature specific conductivity and turbidity are presented here direct measurements of ice thickness were made offshore of the peninsula to the southeast of qiduo island fig 1c following pawlowicz 2008 in situ salinity is calculated from in situ c25 using a site specific linear relation derived from the chemical analysis of water samples in wang et al 2010 a linear fit through the narrow range of water sample c25 1880 2250 μs cm 1 is given by 1 s 1 g l 1 m s cm 1 1 c 25 0 35 g l 1 and has an r2 value of 0 99 in situ c25 measurements from ctd profiles presented here range from 1 7 to 1 9 ms cm 1 which is slightly outside the range eq 1 is based on given the high r2 for eq 1 we use eq 1 for this work on the assumption that even extrapolated to 1 7 ms cm 1 eq 1 is more accurate than a fit forced through zero this choice of regression versus one forced through zero does not change the overall conclusions water density was calculated as σ0 i e sigma 0 density calculated using in situ temperature and salinity with atmospheric pressure minus 1000 kg m 3 using the thermodynamic equation of state teos 10 pawlowicz and feistel 2012 2 3 remote sensing the evolution of snow and ice cover during the field study was observed from daily repeat terra modis corrected reflectance true colour image mosaics downloaded from nasa worldview https worldview earthdata nasa gov for ice cover categorization purposes the lake was divided into two regions the eastern basin east of islands kunduo and qiduo and the main basin west of islands kunduo and qiduo fig 1c snow and ice cover were identified manually as none partial or complete for each region each day dates when the lake was obscured by cloud cover were neglected so the total days of snow cover may be underestimated 2 4 surface heat flux a heat budget was calculated from available meteorological and radiation data measured at nam co station fig 1c combined with bulk heat transfer models due to the relatively long hydraulic residence time 10 15 years heat flux due to surface and ground water inflows and outflows were neglected bengsston et al 1996 observed sediment heat flux under ice of 1 w m 2 in shallow 1 10 m regions of lakes given the large depth of nam co mean depth of 42 m sediment heat flux is unlikely to contribute significantly to the heat budget and is neglected in this analysis only surface short and long wave radiative sensible and latent heat flux as detailed below are considered in the heat budget 2 4 1 penetrative heat flux downwelling short wave radiation measured at nam co station was not available for the entire monitoring period to extend available data to cover the entire period mean atmospheric transmission was estimated as 62 from the average of the ratio of available data to top of atmosphere calculations for downwelling solar radiation payne 1972 predicted downwelling shortwave radiation at the lake surface was then estimated by multiplying predicted top of atmosphere downwelling solar radiation by the mean atmospheric transmission estimated above a comparison of observed and predicted downwelling shortwave radiation at the lake surface is given in fig 2 a while day to day fluctuations due to cloud cover are not captured by the prediction the mean annual trend is shortwave radiation albedo for open water was calculated using payne 1972 during periods of complete ice cover penetrating shortwave radiation is assumed to be the dominant component of surface heat flux and other heat fluxes e g net longwave sensible and latent heat are neglected the satellite based visual band imagery discussed above suggests that other than cracking and rifting ice cover is clear with very little white ice and that snow cover on the ice is episodic and short lived ice cover albedo was considered for the following two conditions no or partial snow cover or complete snow cover following perovich 1991 ice albedo was taken as 0 4 roughly consistent with the spectral average of clear ice albedo for days with no or partial snow cover table 1 and 0 8 roughly consistent with ice covered by new snow for days with complete snow cover attenuation of shortwave radiation by propagation through ice cover was accounted for using a clear ice extinction coefficient of 1 5 m 1 launiainen and cheng 1998 applied to the mean observed ice thickness of 0 55 m given the lack of snow depth or snow properties extinction of shortwave radiation propagating through snow was not considered as will be shown the estimated shortwave radiative heat flux closely matches the observed heating rate of nam co under ice cover validating our simple model and crude approximations for the optical properties of snow and ice 2 4 2 non penetrative heat fluxes available observed downwelling longwave radiation was compared with calculations from the bulk formulae of swinbank 1963 based on observed air temperature fig 2b the mean square difference between observations and calculations was minimized for a cloud cover of 40 constant cloud cover misses day to day variability as well as some seasonal variability upwelling longwave radiative heat flux was estimated assuming an emissivity for water of 0 97 with lake surface temperature as measured at 6 m depth the difference in lake water temperature at observed 3 and 6 m is small root mean square difference of 0 3 c over 15 continuous months of simultaneous observation at both depths suggesting surface waters are typically well mixed fig 2c thus the more complete record of water temperature at 6 m depth was used as a proxy for surface temperature matlab air sea toolbox v2 pawlowicz et al 2001 which applies a simplified version of fairall et al 1996 to compute sensible and latent heat fluxes was applied using observed air temperature atmospheric pressure and relative humidity long wave radiative sensible and latent heat fluxes were neglected during periods of complete ice cover with no observations near the ice water interface we are essentially assuming that heat flux imbalances at the ice water interface will lead to accretion or melting of ice as will be shown a good balance in the heat budget despite our approximations supports these decisions and approximations no attempt was made to account for partial ice cover and periods of partial ice cover were treated as open water for the purposes of estimating all heat fluxes 2 5 stratification and mixing dynamics we quantify strength of density stratification using schmidt stability as defined by idso 1973 as 2 s t g a s h 0 ρ ρ o z z v a d z in j m 2 here we integrate upwards from the lake bottom at z 0 to the free surface at z h assumed constant g is gravitation acceleration ρ ρ z t is the lake water density ρ o is a reference density taken as 1000 kg m 3 a is the lake hypsograph and is a function of elevation z and zv is the elevation of the lake centre of volume surface buoyancy flux b o is separated into penetrative b p and non penetrative b np components and is estimated from net surface heat flux as 3 b o b p b np g α ρ o c p h p g α ρ o c p h np where α is the thermal expansion coefficient of water cp is the specific heat of water and hp and hnp are respectively the surface heat flux due to penetrative i e shortwave radiation and non penetrative heat flux i e long wave radiation sensible and latent the thermal expansion coefficient and specific heat of nam co water were calculated using the thermodynamic equation of state teos 10 pawlowicz and feistel 2012 with in situ temperature and a nominal salinity of 1 5 g l 1 note the thermal expansion coefficient is strongly temperature dependent crossing zero and changing sign at tmd nam co salinity depresses the temperature of maximum density tmd to 3 65 c at local atmospheric pressure note the increase in tmd due to reduced atmospheric pressure at the elevation of nam co is negligible as will be shown hp is always net heating i e negative and hnp is always net cooling at nam co thus b p and b np will be of opposite sign and whether these buoyancy fluxes stabilize or destabilize the water column will depend on water temperature relative to tmd in order to classify the various stages of seasonal evolution of thermal stratification we identify stratification phases based on strength of stratification surface water temperature relative to tmd ice cover and heat and mixing dynamics following the recommendation of engelhardt and kirillin 2014 we use a schmidt stability st threshold to delineate periods of strong stratification from periods of weak stratification we use a delineation threshold of st 100 j m 2 the same threshold used by priet mahéo et al 2018 who studied summer stratification in a similar depth arctic lake lake lagerflot iceland maximum depth 110 m mean depth 42 m further classification by surface water temperature relative to tmd delineates periods when b p and b np are stabilizing or destabilizing the water column using these delineations we classify the seasonal evolution of stratification in nam co into six phases whose characteristics we describe in the next section to estimate relative importance of wind energy versus buoyancy flux in surface mixed layer energetics we use monin obukhov depth 4 l m u 3 k b o kundu and cohen 2008 where k is von karman s constant taken as 0 4 and u is the wind shear velocity of water estimated using bulk formula for wind stress at the lake surface estimated from wind speed 5 u c d ρ a ρ o 1 2 u with ρ a the air density taken as 0 73 kg m 3 based on mean air pressure and temperature as measured on site and c d is a drag coefficient consistent with the elevation above ground of the measured wind speed u at depths within the surface mixed layer shallower than lm mixing energy by surface wind shear dominates mixing while at depths within the mixed layer greater than lm mixing energy from convection driven by a destabilizing surface buoyancy flux e g due to surface cooling at water temperature greater than tmd dominates mixing for a stabilizing surface buoyancy flux lm is negative in which case lm indicates depth to which wind mixing is effective wind stress is zero under ice which implies lm 0 3 results to provide context to water column observations we begin with a description of observations of atmospheric lake surface temperature and snow and ice this is followed by detailed observations of water state variables i e temperature dissolved and suspended solids to show temperature variations dominate buoyancy expect for a brief period during spring melt when water temperature approaches tmd and dissolved solids become relatively important at a time when stratification is extremely weak we subsequently present a heat budget to validate estimated heat fluxes from which surface buoyancy flux is calculated we then describe the relative importance of wind stirring and buoyancy flux due to penetrating versus non penetrating heat fluxes 3 1 observations of surface conditions consistent with you et al 2007 s observation of a mean annual temperature of 0 c from 14 july 2005 to 13 july 2006 the mean annual air temperature during the three years of observation was 0 5 c with daily average temperature ranging from 20 to 10 c fig 2c and daily temperature ranges of up to 20 c daily average air temperature was below 0 c for 160 32 days each year with a three year mean annual minimum temperature of 29 0 5 c during winter months 1 november 30 april wind speed corrected to 10 m elevation mean wind speed was 4 4 m s 1 and direction consistent from 250 while during the remainder of the year mean wind speed decreased to 3 6 m s 1 and wind direction was more variable fig 2e and f maximum surface water temperature was comparable to maximum daily average air temperature but with a 38 day lag wang et al 2019 while minimum surface water temperature was close to 0 c and annual mean surface temperature was 6 3 c almost 7 c warmer than the mean annual air temperature fig 2c air temperature only exceeded surface water temperature for about 6 weeks each year beginning in may fig 2c the water surface temperatures are abnormally low for a lake at the relatively low latitude of 30 n indicating the profound effect of high altitude on lake forcing visible satellite imagery indicated consistent with a predominantly west southwest wind ice began to form and accumulate on the eastern shore of the relatively shallow east basin e g fig 3 d at start of freeze up in mid to late december table 1 ice cover then spread westward with the east basin completely ice covered by early to mid january during the three years of observation ice cover was complete on nam co by the end of january each year consistent with gou et al 2017 in all monitored years the annual average ice thickness was 0 55 0 1 m ice break up occurred in a reverse pattern with leads forming along the western shore around april then open water spreading eastward large ice pans 1 10 km diameter were observed in the main basin while the east basin remained completely ice covered e g fig 3d by mid may only the east basin remained ice covered and by mid to late may of each year nam co was ice free fig 3a consistent with cai et al 2019 nam co ice cover is often free of snow e g fig 3b however 2 3 substantial snowfall events completely cover the lake each winter table 1 e g fig 3c these snow covered periods likely dramatically reduced penetrating shortwave radiation entering the water column c a bouffard et al 2019 during the three years observed in this study the total number of days of complete snow cover were relatively low 30 days in 2012 and 2014 while 2013 had over twice the duration of snow cover 69 days table 1 as will be shown this larger number of days of complete snow cover is correlated with a decrease by a factor of two in rate of water column heating 3 2 observations of seasonal evolution of stratification 3 2 1 thermal stratification nam co is dimictic with 5 months of summer thermal stratification followed by 1 2 months of near isothermal conditions during open water followed by 5 6 months of weak stratification under partial and complete ice cover fig 4 a as summarized in table 2 we classify the seasonal evolution of stratification into six phases using the delineations introduced in section 2 5 and proceed to describe the characteristics of these six phases the stratification phases follow the standard seasons of a dimictic lake i e summer fall turnover winter and spring turnover however we further separate summer into summer1 with increasing heat content and stability and summer2 with decreasing heat content and stability as well we separate fall turnover into fall1 with water warmer than tmd and fall2 labelled as pre winter in kirillin et al 2012 with water colder than tmd but open water or partial open water this is followed by winter with complete ice cover then spring as open water develops and ice off proceeds nam co returns to summer1 as water temperature warms past the temperature of maximum density of note phases summer1 summer2 and fall1 are all at water temperatures warmer than tmd while fall2 winter and spring are all at water temperatures colder than tmd and only summer1 and 2 have st substantially greater than 100 j m 2 the warm phases summer1 and 2 fall1 are typically observed in warm monomictic and dimictic lakes and well documented e g wetzel 2001 spigel et al 1986 while the cold phases typical to temperate dimictic lakes are relatively poorly documented kirillin et al 2012 schmidt stability increased rapidly during summer1 attaining a maximum stratification of 1700 j m 2 in september fig 4b while this peak st is relatively low for temperate lakes it is higher than the peak of 1000 j m 2 reported for lake lagerflot priet mahéo et al 2018 during phase summer2 the lake cooled rapidly as daily average air temperature fell below 0 c in late october this cooling rapidly decreased st transitioning in each of the three observed years from strong to weak stratification in november at a water column temperature of 5 c denoting the beginning of fall turnover fall 1 the fall turnover phases were characterized by cooling with near zero st i e nearly isothermal during phases fall1 and fall2 near isothermal cooling continued for about 1 month at a rate of 120 20 w m 2 averaged over the three years of observation a minimum water temperature of less than 1 c occurred during phase fall2 as ephemeral weak inverse stratification developed and broke down and ice cover progressed westward across the entire lake during the winter phase inverse thermal stratification was weak and episodic especially in 2012 and 2014 though somewhat more persistent in 2013 nam co warmed during winter in all years during winter 2012 and 2014 the lake warmed at an average rate of 36 2 w m 2 this was approximately double the 17 w m 2 observed during winter 2013 the reduced under ice heating observed during winter 2013 was correlated with significantly increased duration of snow cover table 1 as will be shown the calculated rate of lake warming closely matches the estimated shortwave heat flux confirming the observed heating of nam co under ice cover was primarily due to shortwave radiation penetrating the snow and ice cover the spring phase was a period of continued weak stratification as ice cover came off and nam co became ice free by the end of may table 1 during spring the water column warmed while remaining weakly stratified until reaching tmd at which point summer thermal stratification developed rapidly and the lake returned to phase summer1 in spring 2012 ice came off completely on 13 may 2012 on 25 may 2012 the water column was nearly isothermal fig 5 d and fig 4a 3 weeks after air temperature first became consistently warmer than 0 c and by 30 may 2012 the lake was weakly linearly stratified to 90 m with surface water warming above tmd fig 5d thereafter surface water warmed rapidly while bottom water stayed near tmd until mid august fig 5d july profile when bottom water gradually warmed as large amplitude baroclinic motions reversible temperature changes at all depths likely driven by changes in wind stress agitated the lake fig 4a a similar spring turnover pattern occurred during spring 2013 except the bottom water remained below tmd until in the beginning of fall turnover in november at that point the bottom water abruptly warmed fig 4a a profile with water warmer than tmd at the surface and water colder than tmd at the bottom is only gravitationally stable if the thermal stratification is compensated for by another stratifying agent such as dissolved i e salinity or suspended solids profiles of salinity fig 5b e h indicate salt stratification was sufficient to compensate for any apparent temperature inversions especially around tmd where the thermal expansion coefficient approaches zero this was especially exemplified in may 2013 where the entire water column above 40 m depth was gravitationally unstable if only considering temperature stratification fig 5g this apparent gravitational instability was compensated by commensurate freshening of the water column at the time of meltwater runoff fig 5h such that density increased with depth fig 5i 3 2 2 dissolved solids dissolved ions were generally well mixed vertically such that salinity is nearly homogeneously distributed in the vertical fig 5b e h the exception to this was during the spring freshet mentioned above fig 5g i seasonal salinity dynamics are further illustrated in time series measured at 3 and 83 m depth at t2 fig 6 b salinity was relatively constant in time and with depth in all seasons except spring there were small fluctuations 0 02 g l 1 at 3 and 83 m especially during winter and top to bottom salinity differences rarely exceeded 0 02 g l 1 however during spring coincident with melting of snow and ice as air temperature increased above zero fig 2c surface salinity decreased rapidly by 0 2 g l 1 by the end of spring in early june salinity at 3 m depth had returned to the steady value of 1 53 g l 1 observed during the rest of the year thus temperature dominates over salinity stratification except for a brief period in spring when the weak stratification was dominated by salinity rather than temperature this slight freshening of the surface water and commensurate stabilizing of the water column during spring melt are similar to that observed by pieters and lawrence 2009 in a small lake tailings lake with salinity of 1 g l 1 though unlike tailings lake this salinity stratification in nam co is rapidly broken down before the surface water reaches tmd here we quantify the impact of neglecting dissolved solids when calculating st fig 4b by comparing timeseries of density difference between 3 and 83 m using time varying versus constant 1 5 g l 1 salinity fig 6d consistent with ctd profiles discussed above the impact of assuming a constant salinity was negligible during all phases except spring when the salinity stratification was comparatively large fig 6b during spring the temperature stratification was very weak because of small top to bottom temperature difference and temperature near tmd but salinity stratification was relatively strong likely due to melting of snow and ice thus during the spring phases salinity likely dominated top to bottom density difference otherwise temperature dominated top to bottom density difference 3 2 3 suspended solids not much is known about suspended solids concentration or turbidity of surface inflows though visual inspection shows some creeks are glacier fed and hence visibly turbid despite this pelagic turbidity levels at t2 are relatively low one serendipitous ctd profile at t2 on september 2013 had a turbidity sensor fig 5j this profile shows generally low turbidity 0 5 ftu except in a bottom layer about 5 m thick where turbidity increased to almost 2 ftu this observation is consistent with time series of turbidity recorded at 3 and 83 m depth at t2 fig 6c which in fall of 2012 show 0 2 and 1 ftu at 3 m and 83 m respectively turbidity at 83 m then increased steadily reaching a peak of 3 ftu in mid fall1 when the lake homogenized in temperature salinity and turbidity fig 6a c at 3 m turbidity was below 0 5 ftu until turnover in late november whereupon it increased to 1 ftu turbidity increased once ice cover was complete reaching a maximum of 2 ftu near the end of march then subsequently decreasing there was no significant turbidity increase at 3 m during freshet in may june 2013 these observed low turbidity values suggest suspended solids are not a significant component of stratification away from the near shore regions 3 3 heat budget shortwave radiative heating and net longwave radiative cooling dominated the estimated surface heat fluxes at nam co fig 7 a especially between ice off and peak heating i e april through july thereafter cooling due to latent and sensible heat fluxes became progressively more important as shortwave radiative heating decreased then prior to ice formation there was a very high net cooling of 150 250 w m 2 with latent sensible and longwave cooling contributing 100 w m 2 each compared to 100 w m 2 of solar heating note that our solar heating estimate uses a long term average atmospheric transmissivity and neglects short term variations of cloud cover so this estimate of daily average solar heating does not include daily variability as expected during open water net longwave radiation and latent heat were always positive i e cooling fig 7a though notably sensible heat flux was only negative during may july and at insignificant values 10 w m 2 thus the open water heat budget was driven by heating due to penetrating shortwave radiation and cooling due to non penetrating surface heat loss fig 7b compares the net heat flux into the lake black line with the rate of change of heat content within the lake red line conservation of heat requires that these two terms balance we observe that the two terms agree well considering the crudeness of the bulk methods used to estimate surface heat fluxes the balance between these terms is especially good during the cooling phases summer2 fall1 and 2 as well as during the periods of complete ice cover winter however the estimated net surface heat flux was 100 w m 2 higher than observed rate of change of heat content during most of spring and summer1 the likely cause for this mis match during summer1 is the use of a 6 m water temperature as a proxy for surface temperature during summer the water column likely develops a diurnal surface layer that is shallower than 6 m and surface temperature is underestimated 3 4 energetics of seasonal evolution of thermal stratification buoyancy fluxes associated with these surface heat fluxes and wind stirring change the potential energy of the water column and hence st fig 4b we analyze the seasonal pattern of st against the destratifying effects of wind stirring and the stratifying and destratifying effects of surface buoyancy flux where we differentiate between penetrating b p and non penetrating b np components of buoyancy flux at seasonal time scales the rate of change of st was dominated by the development and breakdown of seasonal summer stratification during phases summer1 and 2 during the development of seasonal summer stratification summer1 wind power is relatively small fig 7e while the increase in st resulting from solar heating b p fig 7d exceeded the mixing produced by wind stirring and non penetrative surface cooling b np resulting in a net stabilizing buoyancy flux i e b o b p b np 0 conversely during the break down of seasonal summer stratification phase summer2 b p decreased towards zero while b np continued to become more negative i e b o b p b np 0 the resultant available mixing energy was produced more quickly than the development of stratification and the stratification began to break down during summer 2 the seasonal stratification continued to mix until the lake was nearly isothermal at which time the lake entered fall1 this phase was characterized by strong wind input while b o decreased to zero as the water column cooled to tmd and α approached zero fig 7d and e also during fall1 st was nearly zero since the lake was nearly isothermal however the net rate of input of mixing energy was large with episodically high u this high wind energy at a time of low bo and st indicates the generated turbulence was primarily being lost to viscous dissipation and there was a low net efficiency the continued cooling below tmd phase fall2 had a variable but high rate of wind energy input and low but stabilizing b o the continued low st during fall2 suggests wind energy input exceeded buoyancy flux once ice cover was complete i e winter there was no wind stress acting on the lake and penetrating solar radiation warmed the water column the associated negative buoyancy flux b o b p drove convection which kept st small convection may have also be driven by salt rejection during ice formation c a pieters and lawrence 2009 unfortunately it is not possible to quantitatively assess this impact since our shallowest thermistor is too deep to resolve the surface thermal boundary layer where water temperatures transitions to the surface boundary condition of 0 c however the small increase of near bottom salinity 83 m in fig 6b during february may be due to salt rejection as the ice thickness increases as ice cover came off during spring penetrative solar radiation continued mixing the water column and was aided by relatively weak wind stirring resulting in weak ephemeral thermal stratification thus the water column remained weakly stratified as it warmed to tmd despite water temperature being close to tmd bo was comparable in magnitude but of opposite sign to that in fall2 thus this net positive buoyancy flux during spring sustained convectively generated turbulence during a period of weak wind contrary to fall2 in which wind forcing is strong and was sufficient to overcome the salinity stratification induced by snow and ice melt this is contrary to that observed by pieters and lawrence 2009 who found salinity stratification induced by spring melt endured until the subsequent fall turnover once the water column warms past tmd a rapid increase in buoyancy flux dominated by penetrative solar radiation rapidly stratified the water column with wind stirring developing a shallow mixed layer and nam co entered summer1 note as mentioned above that during the spring phase salinity became a relatively important stratifying agent fig 6d due to snow and ice melt reducing salinity of the surface waters however overall stratification was weak and ephemeral during spring since both temperature and salinity stratification developed and broke down rapidly and repeatedly fig 6a and b which is indicative of mixing also salinity anomalies were at times associated with seemingly gravitationally unstable temperature profiles at temperatures below tmd e g 31 may 2013 profile in fig 5g h thus salinity stratification was compensatory resulting in near neutral density stratification fig 5i during summer 1 the surface mixed layer was shallow and the magnitude of lm was comparable to or larger than surface layer depth fig 7c suggesting mixed layer depth was controlled by wind stirring as would be expected since net buoyancy flux was stabilizing progressing into summer 2 lm continued to be comparable to or deeper than the surface mixed layer depth suggesting that wind stirring dominated mixing within the deepening surface mixed layer in contrast during fall 1 lm was often shallower than the mixed layer depth which consistently encompassed the entire water column suggesting free convection was maintaining a deep surface mixed layer fig 7c because of missing wind data the only estimates of lm during fall2 were associated with net stabilizing b o which gave a negative lm the magnitude of lm was comparable or greater than mixed layer depth suggesting wind stirring dominated within the surface layer once ice formed the surface ice blocked the surface shear stress and l m 0 as the ice melted spring despite b o being diminished by water temperature close to tmd lm was often shallower than the surface mixed layer suggesting free convection was contributing to a deep surface layer 4 discussion based on its mictic state dimictic with 3 5 months of complete ice cover nam co is similar to other high latitude continental lakes such as great slave lake 61 n in canada or the laurentian great lakes 40 50 n in canada and the usa however due to its low latitude nam co receives considerably more shortwave radiation similar to large warm monomictic lakes e g lake tahoe 2000 m elevation 39 n in the usa sahoo et al 2016 lake biwa 90 m elevation 35 n in japan yoshimizu et al 2010 whose temperatures remain above tmd year round thus the cold climate associated with the high altitude relatively low latitude continental environment of the tibetan plateau results in seasonal thermal stratification similar to that documented for large high latitude dimictic lake regions of the world especially at water temperatures above tmd i e summer1 and 2 and fall1 however the arid i e low snow fall high altitude low latitude climate of the tibetan plateau results in important differences between nam co and similar large deep high latitude lakes during the cold phases i e at water temperature below tmd of stratification we now compare these cold phases of nam co with those documented in similar lakes phases fall1 and 2 encompassing fall turnover are the periods when the contribution of wind forcing dominates overall mixing and its destratifying effect generally exceeds any net positive buoyancy flux fig 7c e the fall1 phase in nam co was similar to mixing reportedly induced by fall storms at lake tahoe usa schladow et al 2004 note that lake tahoe never cools to tmd and thus never enters fall2 net buoyancy flux during fall2 at nam co was relatively low and consistently stabilizing while wind during fall2 was strong keeping nam co well stirred cooling to 1 c at 83 m depth before ice cover was complete this minimum temperature is lower than observations of great slave lake in which inverse stratification develops at the point where isothermal cooling reaches 3 5 c near their hypolimnetic tmd ca schertzer et al 2003 resulting in no significant fall2 phase in this high latitude lake at the time great slave lake was cooling through tmd net surface heat flux was 200 300 w m 2 note positive is cooling which is greater than the 100 200 w m 2 estimated for fall2 in nam co this reduced net cooling due to relatively high solar forcing at nam co during fall turnover results in reduced but positive buoyancy flux which is insufficient to negate wind stirring thus the lake remains well stirred allowing the entire water column to cool prior to complete ice cover this cooling of a well stirred water column to low temperatures in fall is similar to that observed in lake superior 47 n which does not often form complete ice cover but does develop a 50 100 m deep surface layer that does cool to below 1 c and as low as 0 1 c in an anomalously cold year 2009 that did form complete ice cover titze and austin 2014 while radiatively driven convection helps maintain a well stirred water column during cooling to very low water temperatures in nam co these observations in lake superior suggest that in very large lakes wind stirring can achieve a similar result at high latitude once ice cover is complete i e winter nam co begins to gain heat in their review of winter limnology kirillin et al 2012 discuss under ice heating of lakes as a late winter process they label winter ii during winter ii the seasonal increase of penetrating shortwave radiation drives convective mixing farmer 1975 mironov et al 2002 especially in high latitude regions with large variations in seasonal insolation and persistence of ice cover almost to summer solstice as snow cover decreases however in early winter i e winter i see kirillin et al 2012 once ice forms deep large high latitude dimictic lakes are observed to continue cooling as inverse thermal stratification develops for example under ice cover lake superior cools at 3 124 w m 2 until ice comes off and inverse stratification breaks down titze and austin 2014 in a second example once ice forms on great slave lake the lake inversely stratifies and it continues to cool through the end of december schertzer et al 2003 with net surface heat flux near zero rouse et al 2003 thereafter deep water temperatures remain nearly constant until spring turnover in june conversely during the entire period of ice cover nam co heats at 17 36 w m 2 depending on the presence of snow cover on the ice thus nam co does not experience winter i rather skipping straight to winter ii our winter phase during the entire period of complete ice cover furthermore nam co water is exceptionally clear with bulk extinction coefficient based fitting a beer s law exponential relation to open water vertical par profiles fig 8 a c ranging between 0 07 and 0 14 m 1 fig 8d corresponding to 1 light levels ranging from 33 to 63 m this deep penetration of solar radiation will destabilize the water column to great depth likely contributing to low stability throughout the three cold phases similar to observations of high latitude lakes intense solar radiation in spring rapidly warms nam co while driving convection until tmd is reached where great slave lake and lake superior cool continuously through fall then under ice cover in winter such that deep water temperatures drop to 2 3 c by ice off schertzer et al 2003 titze and austin 2014 austin 2019 it is interesting to note nam co cools to about 1 c during fall2 then warms continuously during winter such that at ice off hypolimnetic temperature is similar to these large high latitude lakes thus similar to great slave lake spring phase in nam co is generally somewhat protracted as the lake must warm from 2 c to tmd and similar to lake superior austin 2019 convective mixing in nam co driven by strong penetrating shortwave radiative forcing keeps the water column well stirred during this period of reduced wind interannual variation in duration of snow and ice cover leads to drastic changes in wintertime heating of the water column in nam co this effect of snow cover on shortwave radiation albedo is exemplified by comparing the net rate of heating during 2013 with its relatively prolonged snow cover with the two other observed winters winter 2013 had 2 5 to 10 times more days of snow cover resulting in half the seasonal average heating rate the effects of this reduced heating rate due to snow cover in 2013 were however mitigated by a longer period of ice cover an earlier start to ice cover reduced open water heat loss such that the mean water temperature when complete ice cover was established was warmer in 2013 than in the other two winters observed complete ice cover of nam co in 2013 was about 50 longer than in 2012 and 2014 such that despite reduced under ice heating water column temperatures as ice cover came off in 2013 were not markedly different from the other two years the one exception was the bottom temperature in 2013 stayed below tmd until about mid august well beyond spring turnover which may be due to the relatively short spring phase because of the extended winter phase if reduced hypolimnetic water temperature due to anomalously persistent snow cover is not reset at turnover there is a potential for interannual impact on thermal stratification however the subsequent turnover in fall was observed to reset hypolimnetic temperature thus there seems to be some capacity for nam co to experience interannual variability of seasonal duration and intensity without commensurate long term change in hypolimnetic temperature 5 conclusions we have presented a three year record of thermal stratification in a lake on the tibetan plateau and investigated factors controlling its seasonal heat and mixing dynamics though nam co is a terminal lake with relatively high dissolved solids content salinity 1 5 g l 1 salinity is of secondary importance to water column stability except in spring when nam co water is close to tmd and winds are relatively weak thus thermal fluxes control the seasonal evolution of water column stratification which we classify into six distinct phases table 2 three phases are warmer and three are colder than tmd the warmer phases include summer 1 and 2 with the development and breakdown of seasonal summer thermal stratification isothermal cooling characterizes the two fall phases with the lake transitioning from fall1 to fall2 as the lake cools through tmd and the opposing effects of penetrative and non penetrative surface buoyancy flux change sign during fall2 nam co continues to cool as ice cover spreads upwind across the lake winter is the period of complete ice cover characterized by continuous warm and progresses to the spring phase as ice cover recedes in the down wind direction and the lake warms to tmd once surface waters warm through tmd solar radiation rapidly stratifies the water column and summer1 begins again penetrating and non penetrating buoyancy fluxes compete to stratify and destratify the lake with summer1 the only period when stratification consistently increases table 2 and summer2 when that stratification breaks down to cooling isothermal conditions in fall1 as nonpenetrative surface buoyancy flux and wind stirring exceed the waning penetrative buoyancy flux while relatively cold for its latitude these warm phases in nam co are similar to those in most dimictic lakes the buoyancy flux associated with penetrating and non penetrating heat flux changes sign as nam co water crosses tmd the relatively intense solar forcing due to low latitude and high altitude contributes to maintaining a well mixed water column more so than at higher latitude until the entire water column cools to near freezing as ice cover spreads upwind across the lake once ice cover is complete the relatively intense solar forcing combined with clear ice and ephemeral snow cover results in continuous heating and stirring of nam co during the period of complete ice cover winter phase this continuous heating during winter compensates for the extended cooling during fall2 resulting in hypolimnetic temperature at spring turnover similar to that observed in high latitude lakes e g great slave lake that have no appreciable fall2 and cool continuously at depth during ice cover this understanding of the evolution of seasonal stratification will aid in the interpretation of field observations and the development of lake models to predict the influence of a changing climate and other anthropogenic influences on the many lakes distributed

5619,we investigate the seasonal evolution of stratification in a deep 100 m high altitude 4 730 m a s l dimictic lake on the tibetan plateau using three years of observation of nam co the lake is situated at relatively low latitude 30 n where it receives high solar radiative forcing observed maximum daily average 400 w m 2 yet the annual average air temperature is close to 0 c at this high altitude these features make nam co distinct from most well documented dimictic lakes which are usually located at higher latitude and lower altitude we classify seasonal stratification into six phases based on strength of stratification surface temperature relative to the temperature of maximum density ice cover and heat and mixing dynamics which we use to compare nam co with better documented higher latitude dimictic lakes while the three warm stratification phases i e when water is warmer than the temperature of maximum density in nam co are relatively cold they are otherwise similar to that observed in high latitude dimictic lakes conversely two of nam co s cold stratification phases are distinct from that reported in high latitude lakes these two phases are characterized by the interplay between the relatively strong radiative forcing and surface heat flux and include the following 1 during fall turnover persistent winds aided by radiatively driven convection prolong vertical mixing i e turnover and surface heat loss such that the entire water column cools well below the temperature of maximum density as low as 1 c and 2 in contrast under ice cover with relatively little snow the entire water column of the lake warms continuously due to through ice solar radiative flux the intense cooling and heating during these two phases counteract each other such that hypolimnetic temperature at spring turnover is similar to that observed in high latitude lakes our observations highlight the relative importance of radiatively driven convection on the seasonal stratification dynamics of nam co and underscore that these dynamics must be considered when attempting to predict climate change impacts on high altitude low latitude lakes including the 1100 largely unstudied lakes on the tibetan plateau keywords nam co the tibetan plateau radiatively driven convection winter stratification dimictic thermal fluxes 1 introduction the seasonal cycle of thermal stratification in large deep freshwater lakes is modified by latitude and altitude macintyre and melack 2009 in general annual average air temperature decreases with both increasing latitude and altitude thus the effect of increasing altitude on lake stratification is typically assumed to be equivalent to increasing latitude e g hutchison and löffler 1956 lewis 1983 while this generalized latitude altitude equivalency captures variation in bulk heat input it neglects changes to the components of surface heat flux with changing latitude in particular it overlooks latitudinal changes of penetrating solar radiation versus non penetrating heat fluxes net long wave radiation sensible and latent heat this is significant because when fresh water is colder than the temperature of maximum density tmd 4 c for pure water at standard atmospheric pressure warming increases density and penetrating solar radiation drives convection within the water column c f farmer 1975 mironov et al 2002 in typical e g high latitude low altitude dimictic lakes radiatively driven convection is only significant during the later stages of winter when solar radiation is strong but ice cover persists with minimal snow cover e g winter ii as defined by kirillin et al 2012 conversely radiatively driven convection is typically considered insignificant during the ice free season between fall turnover and ice formation because fall turnover occurs near the annual solar minimum e g farmer and carmack 1981 for example at 60 c latitude top of atmosphere daily average solar radiative forcing varies from a maximum of 350 w m 2 during summer solstice to a minimum of 25 w m 2 during winter solstice around the time of fall turnover e g pawlowicz et al 2001 radiatively driven convection is also considered insignificant during early winter because of continued low solar radiation at that time combined with snow attenuation and reflection e g winter i kirillin et al 2012 to highlight latitudinal versus altitudinal effects on penetrating versus non penetrating heat fluxes consider that global annual average surface air temperature at 30 n is 20 c peixoto and oort 1992 yet due to its high elevation the annual average air temperature on the tibetan plateau is 0 c you et al 2007 more comparable to global annual temperatures at 60 n conversely the annual minimum top of atmosphere solar insolation at 30 latitude is 220 w m 2 substantially more than the 25 w m 2 annual minimum at 60 latitude pawlowicz et al 2001 thus lakes at the altitude and latitude of the tibetan plateau are subjected to low winter air temperatures comparable to lakes at 60 n but with much stronger solar forcing the tibetan plateau is a large distinct and relatively understudied geographic region its high mean elevation 4000 m a s l results in low air temperature despite its relatively low latitude qiu 2008 more than 1123 lakes larger than 1 km2 with a combined surface area of 4 104 km2 are distributed across the tibetan plateau zhang et al 2013 making it a globally significant lake region though the authors do not get into energetics analyses published observations of thermistor chain data from bangong co wang et al 2014 and nam co wang et al 2019 show that fall isothermal cooling extends well below tmd suggesting either strong wind stirring or an additional mixing mechanism not typically considered important at fall overturn e g radiatively driven convection in addition their data show both lakes warmed isothermally under ice cover suggesting winter ii conditions kirillin et al 2012 prevailed during the ice covered period in this paper we explore the effects of low air temperature and high solar forcing on seasonal stratification emphasizing turnover and winter stratification when lake water is colder than the temperature of maximum density we present three years of observations of thermal stratification in nam co a large deep high altitude lake on the central tibetan plateau based on continuous in situ monitoring we develop a heat budget to validate heat flux estimates then quantify energetics of mixing and stratification to identify six distinct phases of the seasonal evolution of thermal stratification which are shown to be controlled by a competition between combined mixing effects due to wind and the seasonally alternating mixing and stratifying effects of surface buoyancy flux the six phases of seasonal stratification observed in nam co are then discussed in relation to observations of seasonal stratification of comparator lakes 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description nam co lake center at 30 40 n 90 30 e is a dimictic endorheic lake at high altitude 4730 m a s l located in the central part of the tibetan plateau fig 1 a wang et al 2019 the lake has a surface area of 2020 km2 making it the third largest lake in the tibetan plateau region zhang et al 2013 the basin shape is dominated by a large flat deep water area in the central part of the lake where the water depth is generally 95 m and the maximum recorded water depth is 98 9 m a small shallower sub basin exists to the east of kunduo and qiduo islands fig 1c with a maximum water depth of 60 m wang et al 2009 the lake volume is estimated as 86 km3 and has been increasing over several decades zhu et al 2010 climatically nam co is located in the monsoon influenced transition zone between semi humid and semi arid areas the mean annual wind speed is 4 m s 1 with a maximum monthly mean wind speed of 6 1 m s 1 occurring in january you et al 2007 the nam co area has an annual mean air temperature of approximately 0 c and precipitation of 450 mm a 1 guan et al 1984 ma et al 2012 with distinct rainy and dry seasons the precipitation during the warm rainy season may september constitutes 91 of the total annual precipitation guan et al 1984 ma et al 2012 some attempts have been made to estimate the annual evaporation from nam co s surface with a range of values reported 635 mm ma et al 2016 658 mm haginoya et al 2009 832 69 mm lazhu et al 2016 river inflow into the lake primarily occurs during the summer season with mean summer flow rates 200 300 m3 s 1 yielding a seasonal lake level increase of 400 1000 mm zhou et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 conducted a water balance for nam co during the open water months may october and found a consistent imbalance over five years that they attribute to net groundwater recharge from nam co 100 200 m3 s 1 assuming this outflow is constant year round gives a hydraulic residence time 10 15 years this long residence time suggests the influence of inflows on seasonal timescales is insignificant to heat budgets and stratification and inflows will be assumed negligible in this work as expected for an endorheic lake nam co is saline and alkaline measured specific conductivity and ph are 1850 μs cm 1 and 9 2 respectively wang et al 2009 with na and hco3 the dominant cation and anion in the lake water respectively wang et al 2010 showed that an evaporation crystallization process is the main controlling mechanism of the lake water chemistry as will be shown the observed salinity distribution is of secondary importance to the seasonal evolution of thermal stratification except during spring melt of ice and snow based on remote sensing modis data and in situ observations gou et al 2017 found that complete freezing and start of break up in nam co occurred in late january and mid late april respectively with an average complete ice cover period of 80 days also based on remote sensing cai et al 2019 reported the mean breakup end date at nam co was 9th may the thickest ice is observed in mid march with a thickness of 60 cm based on the in situ measurement 2 2 field data meteorological data air temperature precipitation wind speed short and long wave radiation were recorded at 10 minute intervals at the nam co station fig 1c with a vaisala miro520 automated weather station temperature data loggers vemco minilog ii t canada accuracy 0 1 c from 5 to 35 c resolution 0 01 c were deployed throughout the entire study period at station t2 fig 1c from late october 2011 to early july 2014 at the following depths 6 16 21 26 31 36 56 and 66 m a logger at 46 m depth was lost and the loggers at 21 and 31 m depth were deployed in may 2013 the logging interval was 10 min two ctd90m multi parameter probes sea sun technology germany measuring in situ temperature electrical conductivity pressure and turbidity were deployed near the surface 3 m deep late may 2012 to middle september 2013 and the bottom 83 m deep late may 2012 to early july 2014 of the mooring at station t2 with a recording interval of 2 h unfortunately the 83 m turbidity sensor became fouled in january 2013 giving high turbidity values 40 ftu which decreased to 1 ftu upon servicing thus these data are not shown regular water quality profiling of in situ temperature specific conductivity and photosynthetically active radiation par was conducted with a multi parameter sonde hach hydrolab ds5 usa at one station in the main western basin t2 93 m depth fig 1c every two to four weeks from early april to late november covering most of the open water period the hydrolab conductivity and temperature sensors were calibrated at 1 2 year intervals and spot checked against the two moored ctd90m multi parameter probes one profile was made at t2 with a ctd90m multi parameter probe on 8 september 2013 and in situ temperature specific conductivity and turbidity are presented here direct measurements of ice thickness were made offshore of the peninsula to the southeast of qiduo island fig 1c following pawlowicz 2008 in situ salinity is calculated from in situ c25 using a site specific linear relation derived from the chemical analysis of water samples in wang et al 2010 a linear fit through the narrow range of water sample c25 1880 2250 μs cm 1 is given by 1 s 1 g l 1 m s cm 1 1 c 25 0 35 g l 1 and has an r2 value of 0 99 in situ c25 measurements from ctd profiles presented here range from 1 7 to 1 9 ms cm 1 which is slightly outside the range eq 1 is based on given the high r2 for eq 1 we use eq 1 for this work on the assumption that even extrapolated to 1 7 ms cm 1 eq 1 is more accurate than a fit forced through zero this choice of regression versus one forced through zero does not change the overall conclusions water density was calculated as σ0 i e sigma 0 density calculated using in situ temperature and salinity with atmospheric pressure minus 1000 kg m 3 using the thermodynamic equation of state teos 10 pawlowicz and feistel 2012 2 3 remote sensing the evolution of snow and ice cover during the field study was observed from daily repeat terra modis corrected reflectance true colour image mosaics downloaded from nasa worldview https worldview earthdata nasa gov for ice cover categorization purposes the lake was divided into two regions the eastern basin east of islands kunduo and qiduo and the main basin west of islands kunduo and qiduo fig 1c snow and ice cover were identified manually as none partial or complete for each region each day dates when the lake was obscured by cloud cover were neglected so the total days of snow cover may be underestimated 2 4 surface heat flux a heat budget was calculated from available meteorological and radiation data measured at nam co station fig 1c combined with bulk heat transfer models due to the relatively long hydraulic residence time 10 15 years heat flux due to surface and ground water inflows and outflows were neglected bengsston et al 1996 observed sediment heat flux under ice of 1 w m 2 in shallow 1 10 m regions of lakes given the large depth of nam co mean depth of 42 m sediment heat flux is unlikely to contribute significantly to the heat budget and is neglected in this analysis only surface short and long wave radiative sensible and latent heat flux as detailed below are considered in the heat budget 2 4 1 penetrative heat flux downwelling short wave radiation measured at nam co station was not available for the entire monitoring period to extend available data to cover the entire period mean atmospheric transmission was estimated as 62 from the average of the ratio of available data to top of atmosphere calculations for downwelling solar radiation payne 1972 predicted downwelling shortwave radiation at the lake surface was then estimated by multiplying predicted top of atmosphere downwelling solar radiation by the mean atmospheric transmission estimated above a comparison of observed and predicted downwelling shortwave radiation at the lake surface is given in fig 2 a while day to day fluctuations due to cloud cover are not captured by the prediction the mean annual trend is shortwave radiation albedo for open water was calculated using payne 1972 during periods of complete ice cover penetrating shortwave radiation is assumed to be the dominant component of surface heat flux and other heat fluxes e g net longwave sensible and latent heat are neglected the satellite based visual band imagery discussed above suggests that other than cracking and rifting ice cover is clear with very little white ice and that snow cover on the ice is episodic and short lived ice cover albedo was considered for the following two conditions no or partial snow cover or complete snow cover following perovich 1991 ice albedo was taken as 0 4 roughly consistent with the spectral average of clear ice albedo for days with no or partial snow cover table 1 and 0 8 roughly consistent with ice covered by new snow for days with complete snow cover attenuation of shortwave radiation by propagation through ice cover was accounted for using a clear ice extinction coefficient of 1 5 m 1 launiainen and cheng 1998 applied to the mean observed ice thickness of 0 55 m given the lack of snow depth or snow properties extinction of shortwave radiation propagating through snow was not considered as will be shown the estimated shortwave radiative heat flux closely matches the observed heating rate of nam co under ice cover validating our simple model and crude approximations for the optical properties of snow and ice 2 4 2 non penetrative heat fluxes available observed downwelling longwave radiation was compared with calculations from the bulk formulae of swinbank 1963 based on observed air temperature fig 2b the mean square difference between observations and calculations was minimized for a cloud cover of 40 constant cloud cover misses day to day variability as well as some seasonal variability upwelling longwave radiative heat flux was estimated assuming an emissivity for water of 0 97 with lake surface temperature as measured at 6 m depth the difference in lake water temperature at observed 3 and 6 m is small root mean square difference of 0 3 c over 15 continuous months of simultaneous observation at both depths suggesting surface waters are typically well mixed fig 2c thus the more complete record of water temperature at 6 m depth was used as a proxy for surface temperature matlab air sea toolbox v2 pawlowicz et al 2001 which applies a simplified version of fairall et al 1996 to compute sensible and latent heat fluxes was applied using observed air temperature atmospheric pressure and relative humidity long wave radiative sensible and latent heat fluxes were neglected during periods of complete ice cover with no observations near the ice water interface we are essentially assuming that heat flux imbalances at the ice water interface will lead to accretion or melting of ice as will be shown a good balance in the heat budget despite our approximations supports these decisions and approximations no attempt was made to account for partial ice cover and periods of partial ice cover were treated as open water for the purposes of estimating all heat fluxes 2 5 stratification and mixing dynamics we quantify strength of density stratification using schmidt stability as defined by idso 1973 as 2 s t g a s h 0 ρ ρ o z z v a d z in j m 2 here we integrate upwards from the lake bottom at z 0 to the free surface at z h assumed constant g is gravitation acceleration ρ ρ z t is the lake water density ρ o is a reference density taken as 1000 kg m 3 a is the lake hypsograph and is a function of elevation z and zv is the elevation of the lake centre of volume surface buoyancy flux b o is separated into penetrative b p and non penetrative b np components and is estimated from net surface heat flux as 3 b o b p b np g α ρ o c p h p g α ρ o c p h np where α is the thermal expansion coefficient of water cp is the specific heat of water and hp and hnp are respectively the surface heat flux due to penetrative i e shortwave radiation and non penetrative heat flux i e long wave radiation sensible and latent the thermal expansion coefficient and specific heat of nam co water were calculated using the thermodynamic equation of state teos 10 pawlowicz and feistel 2012 with in situ temperature and a nominal salinity of 1 5 g l 1 note the thermal expansion coefficient is strongly temperature dependent crossing zero and changing sign at tmd nam co salinity depresses the temperature of maximum density tmd to 3 65 c at local atmospheric pressure note the increase in tmd due to reduced atmospheric pressure at the elevation of nam co is negligible as will be shown hp is always net heating i e negative and hnp is always net cooling at nam co thus b p and b np will be of opposite sign and whether these buoyancy fluxes stabilize or destabilize the water column will depend on water temperature relative to tmd in order to classify the various stages of seasonal evolution of thermal stratification we identify stratification phases based on strength of stratification surface water temperature relative to tmd ice cover and heat and mixing dynamics following the recommendation of engelhardt and kirillin 2014 we use a schmidt stability st threshold to delineate periods of strong stratification from periods of weak stratification we use a delineation threshold of st 100 j m 2 the same threshold used by priet mahéo et al 2018 who studied summer stratification in a similar depth arctic lake lake lagerflot iceland maximum depth 110 m mean depth 42 m further classification by surface water temperature relative to tmd delineates periods when b p and b np are stabilizing or destabilizing the water column using these delineations we classify the seasonal evolution of stratification in nam co into six phases whose characteristics we describe in the next section to estimate relative importance of wind energy versus buoyancy flux in surface mixed layer energetics we use monin obukhov depth 4 l m u 3 k b o kundu and cohen 2008 where k is von karman s constant taken as 0 4 and u is the wind shear velocity of water estimated using bulk formula for wind stress at the lake surface estimated from wind speed 5 u c d ρ a ρ o 1 2 u with ρ a the air density taken as 0 73 kg m 3 based on mean air pressure and temperature as measured on site and c d is a drag coefficient consistent with the elevation above ground of the measured wind speed u at depths within the surface mixed layer shallower than lm mixing energy by surface wind shear dominates mixing while at depths within the mixed layer greater than lm mixing energy from convection driven by a destabilizing surface buoyancy flux e g due to surface cooling at water temperature greater than tmd dominates mixing for a stabilizing surface buoyancy flux lm is negative in which case lm indicates depth to which wind mixing is effective wind stress is zero under ice which implies lm 0 3 results to provide context to water column observations we begin with a description of observations of atmospheric lake surface temperature and snow and ice this is followed by detailed observations of water state variables i e temperature dissolved and suspended solids to show temperature variations dominate buoyancy expect for a brief period during spring melt when water temperature approaches tmd and dissolved solids become relatively important at a time when stratification is extremely weak we subsequently present a heat budget to validate estimated heat fluxes from which surface buoyancy flux is calculated we then describe the relative importance of wind stirring and buoyancy flux due to penetrating versus non penetrating heat fluxes 3 1 observations of surface conditions consistent with you et al 2007 s observation of a mean annual temperature of 0 c from 14 july 2005 to 13 july 2006 the mean annual air temperature during the three years of observation was 0 5 c with daily average temperature ranging from 20 to 10 c fig 2c and daily temperature ranges of up to 20 c daily average air temperature was below 0 c for 160 32 days each year with a three year mean annual minimum temperature of 29 0 5 c during winter months 1 november 30 april wind speed corrected to 10 m elevation mean wind speed was 4 4 m s 1 and direction consistent from 250 while during the remainder of the year mean wind speed decreased to 3 6 m s 1 and wind direction was more variable fig 2e and f maximum surface water temperature was comparable to maximum daily average air temperature but with a 38 day lag wang et al 2019 while minimum surface water temperature was close to 0 c and annual mean surface temperature was 6 3 c almost 7 c warmer than the mean annual air temperature fig 2c air temperature only exceeded surface water temperature for about 6 weeks each year beginning in may fig 2c the water surface temperatures are abnormally low for a lake at the relatively low latitude of 30 n indicating the profound effect of high altitude on lake forcing visible satellite imagery indicated consistent with a predominantly west southwest wind ice began to form and accumulate on the eastern shore of the relatively shallow east basin e g fig 3 d at start of freeze up in mid to late december table 1 ice cover then spread westward with the east basin completely ice covered by early to mid january during the three years of observation ice cover was complete on nam co by the end of january each year consistent with gou et al 2017 in all monitored years the annual average ice thickness was 0 55 0 1 m ice break up occurred in a reverse pattern with leads forming along the western shore around april then open water spreading eastward large ice pans 1 10 km diameter were observed in the main basin while the east basin remained completely ice covered e g fig 3d by mid may only the east basin remained ice covered and by mid to late may of each year nam co was ice free fig 3a consistent with cai et al 2019 nam co ice cover is often free of snow e g fig 3b however 2 3 substantial snowfall events completely cover the lake each winter table 1 e g fig 3c these snow covered periods likely dramatically reduced penetrating shortwave radiation entering the water column c a bouffard et al 2019 during the three years observed in this study the total number of days of complete snow cover were relatively low 30 days in 2012 and 2014 while 2013 had over twice the duration of snow cover 69 days table 1 as will be shown this larger number of days of complete snow cover is correlated with a decrease by a factor of two in rate of water column heating 3 2 observations of seasonal evolution of stratification 3 2 1 thermal stratification nam co is dimictic with 5 months of summer thermal stratification followed by 1 2 months of near isothermal conditions during open water followed by 5 6 months of weak stratification under partial and complete ice cover fig 4 a as summarized in table 2 we classify the seasonal evolution of stratification into six phases using the delineations introduced in section 2 5 and proceed to describe the characteristics of these six phases the stratification phases follow the standard seasons of a dimictic lake i e summer fall turnover winter and spring turnover however we further separate summer into summer1 with increasing heat content and stability and summer2 with decreasing heat content and stability as well we separate fall turnover into fall1 with water warmer than tmd and fall2 labelled as pre winter in kirillin et al 2012 with water colder than tmd but open water or partial open water this is followed by winter with complete ice cover then spring as open water develops and ice off proceeds nam co returns to summer1 as water temperature warms past the temperature of maximum density of note phases summer1 summer2 and fall1 are all at water temperatures warmer than tmd while fall2 winter and spring are all at water temperatures colder than tmd and only summer1 and 2 have st substantially greater than 100 j m 2 the warm phases summer1 and 2 fall1 are typically observed in warm monomictic and dimictic lakes and well documented e g wetzel 2001 spigel et al 1986 while the cold phases typical to temperate dimictic lakes are relatively poorly documented kirillin et al 2012 schmidt stability increased rapidly during summer1 attaining a maximum stratification of 1700 j m 2 in september fig 4b while this peak st is relatively low for temperate lakes it is higher than the peak of 1000 j m 2 reported for lake lagerflot priet mahéo et al 2018 during phase summer2 the lake cooled rapidly as daily average air temperature fell below 0 c in late october this cooling rapidly decreased st transitioning in each of the three observed years from strong to weak stratification in november at a water column temperature of 5 c denoting the beginning of fall turnover fall 1 the fall turnover phases were characterized by cooling with near zero st i e nearly isothermal during phases fall1 and fall2 near isothermal cooling continued for about 1 month at a rate of 120 20 w m 2 averaged over the three years of observation a minimum water temperature of less than 1 c occurred during phase fall2 as ephemeral weak inverse stratification developed and broke down and ice cover progressed westward across the entire lake during the winter phase inverse thermal stratification was weak and episodic especially in 2012 and 2014 though somewhat more persistent in 2013 nam co warmed during winter in all years during winter 2012 and 2014 the lake warmed at an average rate of 36 2 w m 2 this was approximately double the 17 w m 2 observed during winter 2013 the reduced under ice heating observed during winter 2013 was correlated with significantly increased duration of snow cover table 1 as will be shown the calculated rate of lake warming closely matches the estimated shortwave heat flux confirming the observed heating of nam co under ice cover was primarily due to shortwave radiation penetrating the snow and ice cover the spring phase was a period of continued weak stratification as ice cover came off and nam co became ice free by the end of may table 1 during spring the water column warmed while remaining weakly stratified until reaching tmd at which point summer thermal stratification developed rapidly and the lake returned to phase summer1 in spring 2012 ice came off completely on 13 may 2012 on 25 may 2012 the water column was nearly isothermal fig 5 d and fig 4a 3 weeks after air temperature first became consistently warmer than 0 c and by 30 may 2012 the lake was weakly linearly stratified to 90 m with surface water warming above tmd fig 5d thereafter surface water warmed rapidly while bottom water stayed near tmd until mid august fig 5d july profile when bottom water gradually warmed as large amplitude baroclinic motions reversible temperature changes at all depths likely driven by changes in wind stress agitated the lake fig 4a a similar spring turnover pattern occurred during spring 2013 except the bottom water remained below tmd until in the beginning of fall turnover in november at that point the bottom water abruptly warmed fig 4a a profile with water warmer than tmd at the surface and water colder than tmd at the bottom is only gravitationally stable if the thermal stratification is compensated for by another stratifying agent such as dissolved i e salinity or suspended solids profiles of salinity fig 5b e h indicate salt stratification was sufficient to compensate for any apparent temperature inversions especially around tmd where the thermal expansion coefficient approaches zero this was especially exemplified in may 2013 where the entire water column above 40 m depth was gravitationally unstable if only considering temperature stratification fig 5g this apparent gravitational instability was compensated by commensurate freshening of the water column at the time of meltwater runoff fig 5h such that density increased with depth fig 5i 3 2 2 dissolved solids dissolved ions were generally well mixed vertically such that salinity is nearly homogeneously distributed in the vertical fig 5b e h the exception to this was during the spring freshet mentioned above fig 5g i seasonal salinity dynamics are further illustrated in time series measured at 3 and 83 m depth at t2 fig 6 b salinity was relatively constant in time and with depth in all seasons except spring there were small fluctuations 0 02 g l 1 at 3 and 83 m especially during winter and top to bottom salinity differences rarely exceeded 0 02 g l 1 however during spring coincident with melting of snow and ice as air temperature increased above zero fig 2c surface salinity decreased rapidly by 0 2 g l 1 by the end of spring in early june salinity at 3 m depth had returned to the steady value of 1 53 g l 1 observed during the rest of the year thus temperature dominates over salinity stratification except for a brief period in spring when the weak stratification was dominated by salinity rather than temperature this slight freshening of the surface water and commensurate stabilizing of the water column during spring melt are similar to that observed by pieters and lawrence 2009 in a small lake tailings lake with salinity of 1 g l 1 though unlike tailings lake this salinity stratification in nam co is rapidly broken down before the surface water reaches tmd here we quantify the impact of neglecting dissolved solids when calculating st fig 4b by comparing timeseries of density difference between 3 and 83 m using time varying versus constant 1 5 g l 1 salinity fig 6d consistent with ctd profiles discussed above the impact of assuming a constant salinity was negligible during all phases except spring when the salinity stratification was comparatively large fig 6b during spring the temperature stratification was very weak because of small top to bottom temperature difference and temperature near tmd but salinity stratification was relatively strong likely due to melting of snow and ice thus during the spring phases salinity likely dominated top to bottom density difference otherwise temperature dominated top to bottom density difference 3 2 3 suspended solids not much is known about suspended solids concentration or turbidity of surface inflows though visual inspection shows some creeks are glacier fed and hence visibly turbid despite this pelagic turbidity levels at t2 are relatively low one serendipitous ctd profile at t2 on september 2013 had a turbidity sensor fig 5j this profile shows generally low turbidity 0 5 ftu except in a bottom layer about 5 m thick where turbidity increased to almost 2 ftu this observation is consistent with time series of turbidity recorded at 3 and 83 m depth at t2 fig 6c which in fall of 2012 show 0 2 and 1 ftu at 3 m and 83 m respectively turbidity at 83 m then increased steadily reaching a peak of 3 ftu in mid fall1 when the lake homogenized in temperature salinity and turbidity fig 6a c at 3 m turbidity was below 0 5 ftu until turnover in late november whereupon it increased to 1 ftu turbidity increased once ice cover was complete reaching a maximum of 2 ftu near the end of march then subsequently decreasing there was no significant turbidity increase at 3 m during freshet in may june 2013 these observed low turbidity values suggest suspended solids are not a significant component of stratification away from the near shore regions 3 3 heat budget shortwave radiative heating and net longwave radiative cooling dominated the estimated surface heat fluxes at nam co fig 7 a especially between ice off and peak heating i e april through july thereafter cooling due to latent and sensible heat fluxes became progressively more important as shortwave radiative heating decreased then prior to ice formation there was a very high net cooling of 150 250 w m 2 with latent sensible and longwave cooling contributing 100 w m 2 each compared to 100 w m 2 of solar heating note that our solar heating estimate uses a long term average atmospheric transmissivity and neglects short term variations of cloud cover so this estimate of daily average solar heating does not include daily variability as expected during open water net longwave radiation and latent heat were always positive i e cooling fig 7a though notably sensible heat flux was only negative during may july and at insignificant values 10 w m 2 thus the open water heat budget was driven by heating due to penetrating shortwave radiation and cooling due to non penetrating surface heat loss fig 7b compares the net heat flux into the lake black line with the rate of change of heat content within the lake red line conservation of heat requires that these two terms balance we observe that the two terms agree well considering the crudeness of the bulk methods used to estimate surface heat fluxes the balance between these terms is especially good during the cooling phases summer2 fall1 and 2 as well as during the periods of complete ice cover winter however the estimated net surface heat flux was 100 w m 2 higher than observed rate of change of heat content during most of spring and summer1 the likely cause for this mis match during summer1 is the use of a 6 m water temperature as a proxy for surface temperature during summer the water column likely develops a diurnal surface layer that is shallower than 6 m and surface temperature is underestimated 3 4 energetics of seasonal evolution of thermal stratification buoyancy fluxes associated with these surface heat fluxes and wind stirring change the potential energy of the water column and hence st fig 4b we analyze the seasonal pattern of st against the destratifying effects of wind stirring and the stratifying and destratifying effects of surface buoyancy flux where we differentiate between penetrating b p and non penetrating b np components of buoyancy flux at seasonal time scales the rate of change of st was dominated by the development and breakdown of seasonal summer stratification during phases summer1 and 2 during the development of seasonal summer stratification summer1 wind power is relatively small fig 7e while the increase in st resulting from solar heating b p fig 7d exceeded the mixing produced by wind stirring and non penetrative surface cooling b np resulting in a net stabilizing buoyancy flux i e b o b p b np 0 conversely during the break down of seasonal summer stratification phase summer2 b p decreased towards zero while b np continued to become more negative i e b o b p b np 0 the resultant available mixing energy was produced more quickly than the development of stratification and the stratification began to break down during summer 2 the seasonal stratification continued to mix until the lake was nearly isothermal at which time the lake entered fall1 this phase was characterized by strong wind input while b o decreased to zero as the water column cooled to tmd and α approached zero fig 7d and e also during fall1 st was nearly zero since the lake was nearly isothermal however the net rate of input of mixing energy was large with episodically high u this high wind energy at a time of low bo and st indicates the generated turbulence was primarily being lost to viscous dissipation and there was a low net efficiency the continued cooling below tmd phase fall2 had a variable but high rate of wind energy input and low but stabilizing b o the continued low st during fall2 suggests wind energy input exceeded buoyancy flux once ice cover was complete i e winter there was no wind stress acting on the lake and penetrating solar radiation warmed the water column the associated negative buoyancy flux b o b p drove convection which kept st small convection may have also be driven by salt rejection during ice formation c a pieters and lawrence 2009 unfortunately it is not possible to quantitatively assess this impact since our shallowest thermistor is too deep to resolve the surface thermal boundary layer where water temperatures transitions to the surface boundary condition of 0 c however the small increase of near bottom salinity 83 m in fig 6b during february may be due to salt rejection as the ice thickness increases as ice cover came off during spring penetrative solar radiation continued mixing the water column and was aided by relatively weak wind stirring resulting in weak ephemeral thermal stratification thus the water column remained weakly stratified as it warmed to tmd despite water temperature being close to tmd bo was comparable in magnitude but of opposite sign to that in fall2 thus this net positive buoyancy flux during spring sustained convectively generated turbulence during a period of weak wind contrary to fall2 in which wind forcing is strong and was sufficient to overcome the salinity stratification induced by snow and ice melt this is contrary to that observed by pieters and lawrence 2009 who found salinity stratification induced by spring melt endured until the subsequent fall turnover once the water column warms past tmd a rapid increase in buoyancy flux dominated by penetrative solar radiation rapidly stratified the water column with wind stirring developing a shallow mixed layer and nam co entered summer1 note as mentioned above that during the spring phase salinity became a relatively important stratifying agent fig 6d due to snow and ice melt reducing salinity of the surface waters however overall stratification was weak and ephemeral during spring since both temperature and salinity stratification developed and broke down rapidly and repeatedly fig 6a and b which is indicative of mixing also salinity anomalies were at times associated with seemingly gravitationally unstable temperature profiles at temperatures below tmd e g 31 may 2013 profile in fig 5g h thus salinity stratification was compensatory resulting in near neutral density stratification fig 5i during summer 1 the surface mixed layer was shallow and the magnitude of lm was comparable to or larger than surface layer depth fig 7c suggesting mixed layer depth was controlled by wind stirring as would be expected since net buoyancy flux was stabilizing progressing into summer 2 lm continued to be comparable to or deeper than the surface mixed layer depth suggesting that wind stirring dominated mixing within the deepening surface mixed layer in contrast during fall 1 lm was often shallower than the mixed layer depth which consistently encompassed the entire water column suggesting free convection was maintaining a deep surface mixed layer fig 7c because of missing wind data the only estimates of lm during fall2 were associated with net stabilizing b o which gave a negative lm the magnitude of lm was comparable or greater than mixed layer depth suggesting wind stirring dominated within the surface layer once ice formed the surface ice blocked the surface shear stress and l m 0 as the ice melted spring despite b o being diminished by water temperature close to tmd lm was often shallower than the surface mixed layer suggesting free convection was contributing to a deep surface layer 4 discussion based on its mictic state dimictic with 3 5 months of complete ice cover nam co is similar to other high latitude continental lakes such as great slave lake 61 n in canada or the laurentian great lakes 40 50 n in canada and the usa however due to its low latitude nam co receives considerably more shortwave radiation similar to large warm monomictic lakes e g lake tahoe 2000 m elevation 39 n in the usa sahoo et al 2016 lake biwa 90 m elevation 35 n in japan yoshimizu et al 2010 whose temperatures remain above tmd year round thus the cold climate associated with the high altitude relatively low latitude continental environment of the tibetan plateau results in seasonal thermal stratification similar to that documented for large high latitude dimictic lake regions of the world especially at water temperatures above tmd i e summer1 and 2 and fall1 however the arid i e low snow fall high altitude low latitude climate of the tibetan plateau results in important differences between nam co and similar large deep high latitude lakes during the cold phases i e at water temperature below tmd of stratification we now compare these cold phases of nam co with those documented in similar lakes phases fall1 and 2 encompassing fall turnover are the periods when the contribution of wind forcing dominates overall mixing and its destratifying effect generally exceeds any net positive buoyancy flux fig 7c e the fall1 phase in nam co was similar to mixing reportedly induced by fall storms at lake tahoe usa schladow et al 2004 note that lake tahoe never cools to tmd and thus never enters fall2 net buoyancy flux during fall2 at nam co was relatively low and consistently stabilizing while wind during fall2 was strong keeping nam co well stirred cooling to 1 c at 83 m depth before ice cover was complete this minimum temperature is lower than observations of great slave lake in which inverse stratification develops at the point where isothermal cooling reaches 3 5 c near their hypolimnetic tmd ca schertzer et al 2003 resulting in no significant fall2 phase in this high latitude lake at the time great slave lake was cooling through tmd net surface heat flux was 200 300 w m 2 note positive is cooling which is greater than the 100 200 w m 2 estimated for fall2 in nam co this reduced net cooling due to relatively high solar forcing at nam co during fall turnover results in reduced but positive buoyancy flux which is insufficient to negate wind stirring thus the lake remains well stirred allowing the entire water column to cool prior to complete ice cover this cooling of a well stirred water column to low temperatures in fall is similar to that observed in lake superior 47 n which does not often form complete ice cover but does develop a 50 100 m deep surface layer that does cool to below 1 c and as low as 0 1 c in an anomalously cold year 2009 that did form complete ice cover titze and austin 2014 while radiatively driven convection helps maintain a well stirred water column during cooling to very low water temperatures in nam co these observations in lake superior suggest that in very large lakes wind stirring can achieve a similar result at high latitude once ice cover is complete i e winter nam co begins to gain heat in their review of winter limnology kirillin et al 2012 discuss under ice heating of lakes as a late winter process they label winter ii during winter ii the seasonal increase of penetrating shortwave radiation drives convective mixing farmer 1975 mironov et al 2002 especially in high latitude regions with large variations in seasonal insolation and persistence of ice cover almost to summer solstice as snow cover decreases however in early winter i e winter i see kirillin et al 2012 once ice forms deep large high latitude dimictic lakes are observed to continue cooling as inverse thermal stratification develops for example under ice cover lake superior cools at 3 124 w m 2 until ice comes off and inverse stratification breaks down titze and austin 2014 in a second example once ice forms on great slave lake the lake inversely stratifies and it continues to cool through the end of december schertzer et al 2003 with net surface heat flux near zero rouse et al 2003 thereafter deep water temperatures remain nearly constant until spring turnover in june conversely during the entire period of ice cover nam co heats at 17 36 w m 2 depending on the presence of snow cover on the ice thus nam co does not experience winter i rather skipping straight to winter ii our winter phase during the entire period of complete ice cover furthermore nam co water is exceptionally clear with bulk extinction coefficient based fitting a beer s law exponential relation to open water vertical par profiles fig 8 a c ranging between 0 07 and 0 14 m 1 fig 8d corresponding to 1 light levels ranging from 33 to 63 m this deep penetration of solar radiation will destabilize the water column to great depth likely contributing to low stability throughout the three cold phases similar to observations of high latitude lakes intense solar radiation in spring rapidly warms nam co while driving convection until tmd is reached where great slave lake and lake superior cool continuously through fall then under ice cover in winter such that deep water temperatures drop to 2 3 c by ice off schertzer et al 2003 titze and austin 2014 austin 2019 it is interesting to note nam co cools to about 1 c during fall2 then warms continuously during winter such that at ice off hypolimnetic temperature is similar to these large high latitude lakes thus similar to great slave lake spring phase in nam co is generally somewhat protracted as the lake must warm from 2 c to tmd and similar to lake superior austin 2019 convective mixing in nam co driven by strong penetrating shortwave radiative forcing keeps the water column well stirred during this period of reduced wind interannual variation in duration of snow and ice cover leads to drastic changes in wintertime heating of the water column in nam co this effect of snow cover on shortwave radiation albedo is exemplified by comparing the net rate of heating during 2013 with its relatively prolonged snow cover with the two other observed winters winter 2013 had 2 5 to 10 times more days of snow cover resulting in half the seasonal average heating rate the effects of this reduced heating rate due to snow cover in 2013 were however mitigated by a longer period of ice cover an earlier start to ice cover reduced open water heat loss such that the mean water temperature when complete ice cover was established was warmer in 2013 than in the other two winters observed complete ice cover of nam co in 2013 was about 50 longer than in 2012 and 2014 such that despite reduced under ice heating water column temperatures as ice cover came off in 2013 were not markedly different from the other two years the one exception was the bottom temperature in 2013 stayed below tmd until about mid august well beyond spring turnover which may be due to the relatively short spring phase because of the extended winter phase if reduced hypolimnetic water temperature due to anomalously persistent snow cover is not reset at turnover there is a potential for interannual impact on thermal stratification however the subsequent turnover in fall was observed to reset hypolimnetic temperature thus there seems to be some capacity for nam co to experience interannual variability of seasonal duration and intensity without commensurate long term change in hypolimnetic temperature 5 conclusions we have presented a three year record of thermal stratification in a lake on the tibetan plateau and investigated factors controlling its seasonal heat and mixing dynamics though nam co is a terminal lake with relatively high dissolved solids content salinity 1 5 g l 1 salinity is of secondary importance to water column stability except in spring when nam co water is close to tmd and winds are relatively weak thus thermal fluxes control the seasonal evolution of water column stratification which we classify into six distinct phases table 2 three phases are warmer and three are colder than tmd the warmer phases include summer 1 and 2 with the development and breakdown of seasonal summer thermal stratification isothermal cooling characterizes the two fall phases with the lake transitioning from fall1 to fall2 as the lake cools through tmd and the opposing effects of penetrative and non penetrative surface buoyancy flux change sign during fall2 nam co continues to cool as ice cover spreads upwind across the lake winter is the period of complete ice cover characterized by continuous warm and progresses to the spring phase as ice cover recedes in the down wind direction and the lake warms to tmd once surface waters warm through tmd solar radiation rapidly stratifies the water column and summer1 begins again penetrating and non penetrating buoyancy fluxes compete to stratify and destratify the lake with summer1 the only period when stratification consistently increases table 2 and summer2 when that stratification breaks down to cooling isothermal conditions in fall1 as nonpenetrative surface buoyancy flux and wind stirring exceed the waning penetrative buoyancy flux while relatively cold for its latitude these warm phases in nam co are similar to those in most dimictic lakes the buoyancy flux associated with penetrating and non penetrating heat flux changes sign as nam co water crosses tmd the relatively intense solar forcing due to low latitude and high altitude contributes to maintaining a well mixed water column more so than at higher latitude until the entire water column cools to near freezing as ice cover spreads upwind across the lake once ice cover is complete the relatively intense solar forcing combined with clear ice and ephemeral snow cover results in continuous heating and stirring of nam co during the period of complete ice cover winter phase this continuous heating during winter compensates for the extended cooling during fall2 resulting in hypolimnetic temperature at spring turnover similar to that observed in high latitude lakes e g great slave lake that have no appreciable fall2 and cool continuously at depth during ice cover this understanding of the evolution of seasonal stratification will aid in the interpretation of field observations and the development of lake models to predict the influence of a changing climate and other anthropogenic influences on the many lakes distributed
