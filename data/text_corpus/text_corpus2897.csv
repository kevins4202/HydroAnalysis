and h2o2 o3 respectively haa fp decreased by 36 for o3 bac and 20 for h2o2 o3 bac better performance by o3 was likely due to increased haa precursor formation by the aop bac was found to perform

organic carbon detection lc ocd 2 materials and methods 2 1 source water pilot scale biofiltration studies were conducted using otonabee river water peterborough canada raw water doc varied between 5 0 and 6 3 mg l mean daily water temperatures during the study ranged from 16 2 to 23 3 c coagulated alum 40 mg l flocculated and settled water obtained from the full scale water treatment plant wtp served as influent to o3 o3 h2o2 and pilot filters settled water turbidity ph and doc ranged from 0 16 0 41 ntu 6 9 7 2 and 3 3 3 6 mg l respectively pre chlorination 0 5 mg cl2 l at the intake was applied during the study low concentrations 0 05 mg cl2 l remained in the pilot influent sampling conducted on the pre chlorinated water showed low concentrations 5 μg l of both thms and haas 2 2 pilot plant details 2 2 1 biofiltration pilot the biofiltration pilot consisted of six parallel filters dia 7 6 cm all of which were operated with an empty bed contact time ebct of 10 1 min table 1 three filters contained 50 cm of anthracite effective size d10 0 85 uniformity coefficient uc 1 8 over 50 cm of sand d10 0 5 uc 1 8 the other three filters contained 50 cm of biologically active gac bac filtrasorb 300 calgon carbon over 50 cm of sand d10 0 5 uc 1 8 the bac was deemed to be exhausted following 10 years of operation at full scale anthracite biofilters were acclimated for a period of four months until steady state was observed in terms of adenosine triphosphate atp minimum 100 ng g media 12 doc removal 0 1 mg l and uv254 reduction 0 05 cm 1 all filters were operated at constant head and declining flow one conventional filter was backwashed three times per week using chlorinated water 1 5 mg l residual from the full scale wtp all biofilters were backwashed at the same frequency with their individual unchlorinated effluent this procedure consisted of a low flow backwash 30 fluidization for 2 min b high flow backwash 50 fluidization for 8 min and c low flow backwash 30 fluidization for 4 min to ensure proper media layer separation air scour at collapse pulsing conditions was used when media fluidization could not be achieved using backwash alone azzeh et al 13 previously reported no significant α 0 05 impact of backwash or air scour on filter media atp values which was similar to other studies 14 15 2 2 2 o3 and h2o2 o3 pilot to investigate the impact of oxidation o3 and h2o2 o3 was added prior to biofiltration the o3 pilot consisted of two parallel trains with a residence time of 12 1 min flow rate 11 0 5 l min two different o3 doses were applied in parallel depending on the experimental trial table 1 on average o3 dosages of 2 9 0 1 mg l and 3 4 0 1 mg l were applied to obtain nominal residuals of 0 8 mg l and 1 2 mg l respectively the average transferred dose efficiency was 96 2 o3 demands of 2 1 2 2 mg l after 11 min of contact time immediately prior to quenching remained consistent throughout the study for specific trials an advanced oxidation process aop was employed by adding h2o2 to settled water immediately prior to the o3 contactors h2o2 o3 during aop trials a consistent o3 dose was applied 2 9 mg l based on prior trials while the mass ratio mg l of h2o2 to o3 was adjusted to either 0 5 or 1 0 oxidation concentrations o3 dose of 2 9 and 3 4 mg l as well as h2o2 o3 ratios of 0 5 and 1 0 were selected to achieve a ratio of 1 mg o3 mg doc 16 prior to biofiltration residual oxidant was quenched using sodium thiosulfate sts at a stoichiometric ratio of 3 1 2 3 experimental design this study focused on increasing the biodegradability of filter influent by the application of o3 and h2o2 o3 previous bac studies conducted on the same source water without pre oxidation reported modest doc reductions of 5 10 13 17 in addition it was shown that nutrient enhancement 0 5 mg l n and p had no impact on doc reduction the authors suggested that the fraction of biodegradable carbon may have been limited in the biofilter influents in the present study trial 1 was used to identify an appropriate o3 dose by comparing the performance of bac pre treated with 2 9 and 3 4 mg o3 l the better performing dose 2 9 mg l based on organics reduction and dbp fp control was selected for a subsequent aop study in trial 2 wherein two h2o2 o3 ratios 0 5 and 1 0 were applied while maintaining a constant o3 dose 2 9 mg l the h2o2 o3 ratio was confirmed by measuring peroxide stock solution concentration and flow rate and observing the ozone transfer dose from the pilot system finally trial 3 provided a comparative study using 2 9 mg o3 l with and without 0 5 mg h2o2 mg o3 in summary trial 1 identified a preferred ozone dose whereas trial 2 identified a preferred peroxide dose for subsequent bac treatment trial 3 directly compared operating conditions o3 and aop doses as pre treatment for biofiltration each trial also considered non biological filtration filters backwashed with chlorinated water atp 100 ng g media and biofiltration without pre oxidation treating settled water 2 4 analytical methods doc was measured using a persulfate wet oxidation method as described in standard method 5310 d 18 with an o i corporation model 1010 toc analyzer college station texas usa lc ocd analyses were conducted at the university of waterloo waterloo ontario canada according to the method described by huber et al 19 this technique separates organic compounds into five fractions based on size biopolymers humic substances building blocks low molecular weight lmw acids and lmw neutrals biopolymers humics and building blocks together comprise high molecular weight organics while lmw acids and lmw neutrals are collectively referred to as low molecular weight organics 20 lc ocd analysis was conducted to evaluate changes in organic composition due to oxidation and biological treatment biological density on the filter media was characterized using atp analyses luminultra deposit surface analysis kit fredricton new brunswick canada each filter media sample 1 g as sampled was treated with a proprietary lysing solution dsa kit luminultra ltd upon collection all atp measurements were performed on the cell lysates within 12 h of collection as per the manufacturer s recommendation when performing dbp formation potential fp analyses duplicate samples were chlorinated to a target residual of 1 5 0 5 mg l at 24 h 20 c where ph mimicked full scale conditions 18 free chlorine residuals were measured as per standard method 4500 cl g and quenched with sodium thiosulfate 2 mg mg cl2 18 thm and haa fps were analyzed using liquid liquid extraction and gas chromatography based on standard methods 6232 b and 6251 respectively 18 differences in dbp fps associated with various treatments were attributed to the removal of precursors since all other factors were held constant four thms chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform and nine haas monochloroacetic acid monobromoacetic acid dichloroacetic acid trichloroacetic acid bromochloroacetic acid dibromoacetic acid bromodichloroacetic acid dibromochloroacetic acid and tribromoacetic acid were selected for analysis formation potentials were reported as the sum of concentrations of the four thms and nine haas a hewlett packard 5890 series ii plus gas chromatograph mississauga ontario canada equipped with an electron capture detector gc ecd and a db 5 625 capillary column agilent technologies canada inc mississauga ontario canada was used for both thm and haa analysis adsorbable organic halides aox were analyzed using a titration method based on standard method 5320 with a trace element instruments xplorer organic halogens analyzer delft netherlands 18 duplicate samples were analyzed for each thm haa and aox prepared standards served as a check following every ten samples in accordance with standard method 1020 18 2 5 sampling schedule filter effluent sampling was performed two hours following a backwash as preliminary trials showed doc concentrations and dbp formation potential stabilization within the first hour of backwash for each trial table 1 6 sampling events were conducted lc ocd characterization was performed on the final sample of each trial thms and haas were analyzed twice during the o3 2 9 vs 3 4 mg l dose and the h2o2 o3 0 5 vs 1 0 h2o2 o3 trials three sets of thm and haa samples were collected and analyzed during trial 3 o3 vs h2o2 o3 one set of aox samples were collected during trial 3 atp measurements were performed on media obtained from the top 5 cm of the filter immediately prior to backwash to allow backwashing to redistribute media after sampling at the beginning and end of each trial to assess the impact of pre oxidation on attached microbial biomass 2 6 statistical methods a paired student t test with a significance level of 95 was used to compare treatments all analyses comparison between filters or impact of o3 and h2o2 o3 on filter influent were conducted using two tailed tests 17 reported p values indicate the level of significance for a given relationship 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of optimal pre oxidation conditions the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of different pre oxidants on biofiltration performance during trial 1 o3 doses of 2 9 and 3 4 mg o3 l were selected for evaluation prior to biofiltration based on o3 doc ratios of 0 85 and 1 0 16 increasing the concentration of o3 from 2 9 to 3 4 mg o3 l improved doc removal 15 vs 13 based on increased removal of biopolymers 40 vs 35 and humic substances 33 vs 18 table 2 however higher o3 doses did not provide the same benefits with respect to dbp fp when combined with bac the 2 9 mg o3 l dose removed more thm fp 43 vs 39 and haa fp 27 vs 18 when compared to the 3 4 mg o3 l dose based on previous studies by chowdhury et al 21 it is likely that the improved removal of dbp fp was a result of the lower ozone dose combined with bac resulting in less lmw acids 150 vs 158 μg l since thms and haas are regulated parameters and organic removal was similar for both doses an o3 dose of 2 9 mg o3 l was selected for use in subsequent aop trials 22 23 two different doses of h2o2 0 5 and 1 0 mg h2o2 mg o3 were selected for application prior to biofiltration 16 no significant differences were measured between the two pre oxidation conditions with respect to doc specific ultraviolet absorption suva thm fp or haa fp table s1 based on the fact that no differences existed between the two conditions a h2o2 dose of 0 5 mg mg o3 was chosen for further evaluation 3 2 filter media biomass atp was measured throughout the study to provide an estimate of active microbial biomass on the filter media the conventional anthracite filter caf which was backwashed with chlorinated water residual 1 5 mg l had an atp concentration of 22 9 ng g media fig 1 well below the minimum biological filtration threshold of 100 ng atp g media suggested by pharand et al 12 the biologically operated anthracite filter baf had atp levels 143 11 ng g media fig 1 that were significantly higher α 0 05 table s2 than its caf counterpart baf was run in parallel to caf to examine the potential benefits of operating the full scale anthracite filters in a biological mode by eliminating exposure to chlorinated backwash the atp concentration on baf media downstream of pre oxidation 2 9 mg l o3 or 0 5 h2o2 o3 was on average 43 higher 205 vs 143 ng g media than baf media without pre oxidation this result was expected as oxidation will create organics that are more readily biodegradable and can support higher densities of active biomass the bac control filter did not receive pre oxidized water at any time during the study yet supported more biomass than the baf filters treating pre oxidized water α 0 05 table s2 with atp concentrations of 358 37 ng g media fig 1 this preferential attachment to granular activated carbon has been attributed to its chemical composition and the macro and microporous structure of the media which are more conducive to biofilm attachment growth and retention 35 similar biomass increases on bac media have also been reported using the phospholipid method indicating that bac is a superior media for developing biofilms in biofiltration systems 24 25 a statistically significant α 0 05 table s2 impact of pre oxidation on atp was observed for the bac filters where atp values increased by 41 and 52 when o3 doses of 2 9 and 3 4 mg l were applied when compared to the control bac supplied with settled water fig 1 the addition of h2o2 o3 increased atp concentrations by 14 and 36 compared to the bac without pre oxidation when dose ratios of 0 5 and 1 were applied respectively these results are in agreement with magic knezev and van der kooij 26 who studied 30 different bac biofilters atp range 25 5000 ng cm3 media treating various surface waters 1 8 2 4 mg l doc and reported a 200 300 increase in the bac atp following ozonation our results confirm that oxidative pre treatment can increase the density of active biomass on both bac and baf filters atp concentrations were also examined as a function of water temperature which ranged from 16 to 23 c during the study neither media type anthracite or gac showed strong correlation with temperature r2 0 8 it is likely that changes to pre oxidation conditions in each trial impacted the biomass in such a way that temperature was not the primary factor influencing biofilm development furthermore previous studies have observed that atp may not be directly influenced by temperature evans et al 2005 27 this is especially true with respect to gac media where the media structure provides better protection and resilience to water temperatures 28 3 3 impact of pre oxidation on organic characteristics prior to filtration o3 and h2o2 o3 decreased doc by 0 2 0 1 mg l and 0 4 0 1 mg l respectively c0 3 3 4 0 mg l specific uv254 absorbance suva was reduced by 41 3 and 44 2 for o3 and h2o2 o3 respectively the small change in doc and large impact on suva suggests that pre oxidation preferentially oxidized aromatic compounds and that uv254 may serve as a useful parameter for observing the impact of o3 and h2o2 o3 on organic matter 29 30 similarly the application of oxidants has been shown to oxidize larger organics i e biopolymers and humic substances into lmw compounds which may be more amenable to biodegradation 4 throughout the study application of o3 was observed to reduce biopolymers by 10 9 while h2o2 o3 reduced biopolymers by 32 7 irrespective of oxidant dose 2 9 vs 3 4 mg o3 l or aop ratio 0 5 vs 1 0 h2o2 o3 table 2 humic substances were the most prevalent fraction of organics in these samples and were comparably transformed by o3 20 3 and h2o2 o3 18 2 since oxidative processes generally alter organics as opposed to removal increases in the concentration of lower molecular weight fractions were expected generally o3 11 14 and h2o2 o3 19 28 increased the concentration of lmw acids however high variability in the results was observed it is hypothesized that variation in water quality specifically organic composition and temperature impacted the effectiveness of pre oxidation application of pre oxidation on dbp fp was also examined o3 reduced thm fp by 15 9 irrespective of dose conversely h2o2 o3 increased thm fp by up to 52 table 2 this result indicates that h2o2 o3 aop should not be used immediately prior to chlorination as significant increases in dbp formation may be observed similar to organic fractionation the results were highly variable likely due to changes in oxidation preference as a result of seasonality similar to other parameters the impact of o3 on haa fp varied increases of 36 and 59 were observed following o3 doses of 2 9 and 3 4 mg l in the first trial but a 15 reduction was observed in the third trial these increases were consistent with the two fold increases reported by chowdhury et al 21 with respect to haa speciation monochloroacetic acid mcaa increased from below detection limit 5 1 μg l to 19 and 35 μg l dichloroacetic acid dcaa increased from 33 μg l to 44 and 38 μg l for o3 doses of 2 9 and 3 4 mg l respectively this implies that oxidation may form haa precursors such as low molecular weight organic species the impact of h2o2 o3 was consistent across all sampling events with haa fp increases of 20 18 observed these results are in agreement with kleiser and frimmel 31 who concluded that oh increased the potential for nom to form dbps 3 4 impact of biofilter media type two types of experimental controls were used in this study first a conventionally operated filter non biological chlorinated backwash was employed to assess the impact of biological filtration the conventional filter caf showed poor removal 5 of doc uv254 thm fp and haa fp from settled water table 2 non biologically active anthracite media does not have a mechanism for organics removal and similar results have been previously reported for this location 17 a second control existed in the form of an anthracite and gac based biofilters without pre oxidation bafctrl and bacctrl the bafctrl did not remove significantly more doc uv254 thm fp haa fp or aox fp than the caf this indicates that biofilm present on the anthracite media was unable to consume the organics present following coagulation conversely the bacctrl improved the removal on average of doc 6 vs 3 uv254 8 vs 3 thm fp 14 vs 0 haa fp 22 vs 7 and aox fp 25 vs 0 this indicated that the biological processes occurring in the bacctrl filter were capable of degrading additional organics when compared to anthracite filters with or without chlorinated backwash it is possible that the 100 ng atp g media threshold presented by pharand et al 12 is not sufficiently high at this location as biological degradation without pre oxidation was not observed until atp concentrations 300 ng g media as was observed on the gac media throughout the study when o3 2 9 mg o3 l was applied the performance of the biological filters improved relative to the filters without pre oxidation specifically o3 baf increased removal of doc 9 vs 3 uv254 49 vs 3 and thm fp 32 vs 0 eliminating the removals associated to o3 alone baf removed doc 6 uv254 5 and thm fp 26 better than a baf without pre oxidation however o3 baf impaired the removal of haa fp relative to baf without pre oxidation o3 increased the concentration of haa fp by 36 whereas baf only removed 22 resulting in a net increase of 14 relative to settled water combining o3 bac 2 9 mg o3 l improved the removal of doc 15 vs 6 uv254 50 vs 8 thm fp 38 vs 14 haa fp 36 vs 22 and aox fp 33 vs 25 when compared to the bacctrl table 2 examining the impact of bac treating ozonated water compared to settled water showed that ozone improved the biodegradability of doc 8 vs 6 removal thm precursors 22 vs 14 removal and haa precursors 46 vs 22 removal as expected pre ozonation altered organics to allow for increased biodegradation it was particularly notable that the bac was able to remove substantially more haa precursors than the baf 46 vs 22 this indicates that ozone dose must be determined based on subsequent biofilter performance such as doc or dbp fp reductions or negative consequences on treated water quality could result including increased chlorine demand elevated dbp formation and the potential for bacterial regrowth in distribution systems finally 0 5 mg h2o2 mg o3 baf resulted in increased removals of doc 18 vs 3 uv254 56 vs 3 thm fp 8 vs 0 and aox fp 6 vs 0 again haa fp was found to increase across the process 7 which is worse than the 7 decrease achieve by bafctrl table 2 this indicates that the aop produces more haa precursors than can effectively be removed by baf and limits the overall removal of aox fp from settled water to 6 these results indicate that appropriate pre oxidation conditions for gac based systems are likely inappropriate for anthracite based biofiltration haa fp increased by approximately 9 from settled water after oxidation baf gac based filtration reduced haa fp from settled water by 23 under the same oxidation conditions application of 0 5 mg h2o2 mg o3 bac resulted in the highest reduction of doc 23 fig 2 and uv254 58 these results were not as pronounced as those reported by speitel et al 11 who observed doc reductions of 40 when using h2o2 o3 combined with lab scale biofilters 5 min ebct doco 2 7 mg l however despite improved removal of organics achieved using an aop in this study the impact with respect to dbp fp was limited due to the increased formation of precursors associated with the aop 0 5 mg h2o2 mg o3 bac reduced thm fp by 14 haa fp by 21 and aox fp by 22 which is lower than what was achieved by 2 9 mg o3 l bac 38 36 and 33 respectively based on these results no statistical difference was observed between o3 bac and h2o2 o3 bac as such the application of an aop prior to biofiltration is not recommended for the removal of organics and dbp precursors as it does not provide a significant benefit compared to o3 alone despite increased operating costs however h2o2 o3 may be selected for other objectives including bromate control or reducing the footprint of the ozonation system while providing similar oxidation conditions 3 5 importance of organic fractionation it was previously established that pre oxidation alters the composition of organics by degrading large organics such as biopolymers and humic substances into smaller molecular weight organics building blocks lmw acids and lmw neutrals this transformation can be particularly important with respect to dbp formation as lmw compounds have been shown to be precursors to dbps 21 32 to determine if the change in organic fractions impacted dbp fp as a result of pre oxidation correlations between each dbp fp thm haa and aox and specific organic fractions were calculated table 3 in general larger organic fractions biopolymers and humic substances did not correlate with thm fp r2 0 55 or haa fp r2 0 15 when evaluated at three different water temperatures this is in contrast to wassink et al 33 which identified strong linear relationships between humic substances and dbp fp however a strong correlation was observed between lmw acids and thm fp or haa fp table 3 fig 3 r2 for these relationships exceeded 0 8 during 2 out of 3 trials the relationship with small organic fractions lmw acids specifically may be attributed to the pre oxidation applied in this study utilizing the slope of the linear regression equation as an indicator for lmw acid to dbp conversion thm fp conversion ranged from 20 to 53 while the conversion to haa fp ranged from 29 to 42 it is important to consider that conversion of lmw acids to dbp fp may exceed 50 since the use of pre oxidation results in the formation of lmw acids and will directly lead to the formation of dbps if not removed by biofiltration prior to disinfection this relationship further reinforces the importance of pilot testing prior to implementation at full scale when directly comparing pre oxidation with o3 and h2o2 o3 applying 2 9 mg o3 l reduced the concentration of lmw acids by 6 in contrast 0 5 mg h2o2 mg o3 resulted in an increase of 49 as a result applying an aop requires downstream biofilters to remove a much greater concentration of dbp precursors and may result in treated water exceeding dbp regulations during periods when optimal biofiltration performance is not attained 4 conclusions it was determined that lower oxidant doses 2 9 mg o3 l and 0 5 mg h2o2 mg o3 performed as well or better than higher doses based on water quality atp concentrations on filter media anthracite or gac increased with the application of pre oxidation o3 or h2o2 o3 gac biofilter media atp values without pre oxidation were higher than anthracite biofilter media with or without pre oxidation the best overall performance was achieved when applying 2 9 mg o3 l prior to bac biofilters pre treated with h2o2 o3 showed higher removal of doc but lower dbp precursor removal as a result of increased formation associated with the aop since anthracite based biofilters did not perform as well as gac based biofilters the oxidant dose which was optimized for subsequent gac based biofiltration impaired performance in o3 baf and h2o2 o3 baf systems as a result the baf with pre oxidation did not perform as well as the bafctrl with respect to dbp precursor removal lc ocd analyses demonstrated that both o3 and h2o2 o3 enhanced biofiltration by oxidizing large organics into smaller more biodegradable compounds h2o2 o3 biofiltration led to higher doc reduction but o3 biofiltration resulted in better dbp precursor removal for both thms and haas pre oxidation was associated with formation of lmw acids which may serve as dbp precursors as strong correlations between lmw acids and thm fp and haa fp were observed as such increasing the oxidation potential may potentially result in poorer than expected treated water

organic carbon detection lc ocd 2 materials and methods 2 1 source water pilot scale biofiltration studies were conducted using otonabee river water peterborough canada raw water doc varied between 5 0 and 6 3 mg l mean daily water temperatures during the study ranged from 16 2 to 23 3 c coagulated alum 40 mg l flocculated and settled water obtained from the full scale water treatment plant wtp served as influent to o3 o3 h2o2 and pilot filters settled water turbidity ph and doc ranged from 0 16 0 41 ntu 6 9 7 2 and 3 3 3 6 mg l respectively pre chlorination 0 5 mg cl2 l at the intake was applied during the study low concentrations 0 05 mg cl2 l remained in the pilot influent sampling conducted on the pre chlorinated water showed low concentrations 5 μg l of both thms and haas 2 2 pilot plant details 2 2 1 biofiltration pilot the biofiltration pilot consisted of six parallel filters dia 7 6 cm all of which were operated with an empty bed contact time ebct of 10 1 min table 1 three filters contained 50 cm of anthracite effective size d10 0 85 uniformity coefficient uc 1 8 over 50 cm of sand d10 0 5 uc 1 8 the other three filters contained 50 cm of biologically active gac bac filtrasorb 300 calgon carbon over 50 cm of sand d10 0 5 uc 1 8 the bac was deemed to be exhausted following 10 years of operation at full scale anthracite biofilters were acclimated for a period of four months until steady state was observed in terms of adenosine triphosphate atp minimum 100 ng g media 12 doc removal 0 1 mg l and uv254 reduction 0 05 cm 1 all filters were operated at constant head and declining flow one conventional filter was backwashed three times per week using chlorinated water 1 5 mg l residual from the full scale wtp all biofilters were backwashed at the same frequency with their individual unchlorinated effluent this procedure consisted of a low flow backwash 30 fluidization for 2 min b high flow backwash 50 fluidization for 8 min and c low flow backwash 30 fluidization for 4 min to ensure proper media layer separation air scour at collapse pulsing conditions was used when media fluidization could not be achieved using backwash alone azzeh et al 13 previously reported no significant α 0 05 impact of backwash or air scour on filter media atp values which was similar to other studies 14 15 2 2 2 o3 and h2o2 o3 pilot to investigate the impact of oxidation o3 and h2o2 o3 was added prior to biofiltration the o3 pilot consisted of two parallel trains with a residence time of 12 1 min flow rate 11 0 5 l min two different o3 doses were applied in parallel depending on the experimental trial table 1 on average o3 dosages of 2 9 0 1 mg l and 3 4 0 1 mg l were applied to obtain nominal residuals of 0 8 mg l and 1 2 mg l respectively the average transferred dose efficiency was 96 2 o3 demands of 2 1 2 2 mg l after 11 min of contact time immediately prior to quenching remained consistent throughout the study for specific trials an advanced oxidation process aop was employed by adding h2o2 to settled water immediately prior to the o3 contactors h2o2 o3 during aop trials a consistent o3 dose was applied 2 9 mg l based on prior trials while the mass ratio mg l of h2o2 to o3 was adjusted to either 0 5 or 1 0 oxidation concentrations o3 dose of 2 9 and 3 4 mg l as well as h2o2 o3 ratios of 0 5 and 1 0 were selected to achieve a ratio of 1 mg o3 mg doc 16 prior to biofiltration residual oxidant was quenched using sodium thiosulfate sts at a stoichiometric ratio of 3 1 2 3 experimental design this study focused on increasing the biodegradability of filter influent by the application of o3 and h2o2 o3 previous bac studies conducted on the same source water without pre oxidation reported modest doc reductions of 5 10 13 17 in addition it was shown that nutrient enhancement 0 5 mg l n and p had no impact on doc reduction the authors suggested that the fraction of biodegradable carbon may have been limited in the biofilter influents in the present study trial 1 was used to identify an appropriate o3 dose by comparing the performance of bac pre treated with 2 9 and 3 4 mg o3 l the better performing dose 2 9 mg l based on organics reduction and dbp fp control was selected for a subsequent aop study in trial 2 wherein two h2o2 o3 ratios 0 5 and 1 0 were applied while maintaining a constant o3 dose 2 9 mg l the h2o2 o3 ratio was confirmed by measuring peroxide stock solution concentration and flow rate and observing the ozone transfer dose from the pilot system finally trial 3 provided a comparative study using 2 9 mg o3 l with and without 0 5 mg h2o2 mg o3 in summary trial 1 identified a preferred ozone dose whereas trial 2 identified a preferred peroxide dose for subsequent bac treatment trial 3 directly compared operating conditions o3 and aop doses as pre treatment for biofiltration each trial also considered non biological filtration filters backwashed with chlorinated water atp 100 ng g media and biofiltration without pre oxidation treating settled water 2 4 analytical methods doc was measured using a persulfate wet oxidation method as described in standard method 5310 d 18 with an o i corporation model 1010 toc analyzer college station texas usa lc ocd analyses were conducted at the university of waterloo waterloo ontario canada according to the method described by huber et al 19 this technique separates organic compounds into five fractions based on size biopolymers humic substances building blocks low molecular weight lmw acids and lmw neutrals biopolymers humics and building blocks together comprise high molecular weight organics while lmw acids and lmw neutrals are collectively referred to as low molecular weight organics 20 lc ocd analysis was conducted to evaluate changes in organic composition due to oxidation and biological treatment biological density on the filter media was characterized using atp analyses luminultra deposit surface analysis kit fredricton new brunswick canada each filter media sample 1 g as sampled was treated with a proprietary lysing solution dsa kit luminultra ltd upon collection all atp measurements were performed on the cell lysates within 12 h of collection as per the manufacturer s recommendation when performing dbp formation potential fp analyses duplicate samples were chlorinated to a target residual of 1 5 0 5 mg l at 24 h 20 c where ph mimicked full scale conditions 18 free chlorine residuals were measured as per standard method 4500 cl g and quenched with sodium thiosulfate 2 mg mg cl2 18 thm and haa fps were analyzed using liquid liquid extraction and gas chromatography based on standard methods 6232 b and 6251 respectively 18 differences in dbp fps associated with various treatments were attributed to the removal of precursors since all other factors were held constant four thms chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform and nine haas monochloroacetic acid monobromoacetic acid dichloroacetic acid trichloroacetic acid bromochloroacetic acid dibromoacetic acid bromodichloroacetic acid dibromochloroacetic acid and tribromoacetic acid were selected for analysis formation potentials were reported as the sum of concentrations of the four thms and nine haas a hewlett packard 5890 series ii plus gas chromatograph mississauga ontario canada equipped with an electron capture detector gc ecd and a db 5 625 capillary column agilent technologies canada inc mississauga ontario canada was used for both thm and haa analysis adsorbable organic halides aox were analyzed using a titration method based on standard method 5320 with a trace element instruments xplorer organic halogens analyzer delft netherlands 18 duplicate samples were analyzed for each thm haa and aox prepared standards served as a check following every ten samples in accordance with standard method 1020 18 2 5 sampling schedule filter effluent sampling was performed two hours following a backwash as preliminary trials showed doc concentrations and dbp formation potential stabilization within the first hour of backwash for each trial table 1 6 sampling events were conducted lc ocd characterization was performed on the final sample of each trial thms and haas were analyzed twice during the o3 2 9 vs 3 4 mg l dose and the h2o2 o3 0 5 vs 1 0 h2o2 o3 trials three sets of thm and haa samples were collected and analyzed during trial 3 o3 vs h2o2 o3 one set of aox samples were collected during trial 3 atp measurements were performed on media obtained from the top 5 cm of the filter immediately prior to backwash to allow backwashing to redistribute media after sampling at the beginning and end of each trial to assess the impact of pre oxidation on attached microbial biomass 2 6 statistical methods a paired student t test with a significance level of 95 was used to compare treatments all analyses comparison between filters or impact of o3 and h2o2 o3 on filter influent were conducted using two tailed tests 17 reported p values indicate the level of significance for a given relationship 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of optimal pre oxidation conditions the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of different pre oxidants on biofiltration performance during trial 1 o3 doses of 2 9 and 3 4 mg o3 l were selected for evaluation prior to biofiltration based on o3 doc ratios of 0 85 and 1 0 16 increasing the concentration of o3 from 2 9 to 3 4 mg o3 l improved doc removal 15 vs 13 based on increased removal of biopolymers 40 vs 35 and humic substances 33 vs 18 table 2 however higher o3 doses did not provide the same benefits with respect to dbp fp when combined with bac the 2 9 mg o3 l dose removed more thm fp 43 vs 39 and haa fp 27 vs 18 when compared to the 3 4 mg o3 l dose based on previous studies by chowdhury et al 21 it is likely that the improved removal of dbp fp was a result of the lower ozone dose combined with bac resulting in less lmw acids 150 vs 158 μg l since thms and haas are regulated parameters and organic removal was similar for both doses an o3 dose of 2 9 mg o3 l was selected for use in subsequent aop trials 22 23 two different doses of h2o2 0 5 and 1 0 mg h2o2 mg o3 were selected for application prior to biofiltration 16 no significant differences were measured between the two pre oxidation conditions with respect to doc specific ultraviolet absorption suva thm fp or haa fp table s1 based on the fact that no differences existed between the two conditions a h2o2 dose of 0 5 mg mg o3 was chosen for further evaluation 3 2 filter media biomass atp was measured throughout the study to provide an estimate of active microbial biomass on the filter media the conventional anthracite filter caf which was backwashed with chlorinated water residual 1 5 mg l had an atp concentration of 22 9 ng g media fig 1 well below the minimum biological filtration threshold of 100 ng atp g media suggested by pharand et al 12 the biologically operated anthracite filter baf had atp levels 143 11 ng g media fig 1 that were significantly higher α 0 05 table s2 than its caf counterpart baf was run in parallel to caf to examine the potential benefits of operating the full scale anthracite filters in a biological mode by eliminating exposure to chlorinated backwash the atp concentration on baf media downstream of pre oxidation 2 9 mg l o3 or 0 5 h2o2 o3 was on average 43 higher 205 vs 143 ng g media than baf media without pre oxidation this result was expected as oxidation will create organics that are more readily biodegradable and can support higher densities of active biomass the bac control filter did not receive pre oxidized water at any time during the study yet supported more biomass than the baf filters treating pre oxidized water α 0 05 table s2 with atp concentrations of 358 37 ng g media fig 1 this preferential attachment to granular activated carbon has been attributed to its chemical composition and the macro and microporous structure of the media which are more conducive to biofilm attachment growth and retention 35 similar biomass increases on bac media have also been reported using the phospholipid method indicating that bac is a superior media for developing biofilms in biofiltration systems 24 25 a statistically significant α 0 05 table s2 impact of pre oxidation on atp was observed for the bac filters where atp values increased by 41 and 52 when o3 doses of 2 9 and 3 4 mg l were applied when compared to the control bac supplied with settled water fig 1 the addition of h2o2 o3 increased atp concentrations by 14 and 36 compared to the bac without pre oxidation when dose ratios of 0 5 and 1 were applied respectively these results are in agreement with magic knezev and van der kooij 26 who studied 30 different bac biofilters atp range 25 5000 ng cm3 media treating various surface waters 1 8 2 4 mg l doc and reported a 200 300 increase in the bac atp following ozonation our results confirm that oxidative pre treatment can increase the density of active biomass on both bac and baf filters atp concentrations were also examined as a function of water temperature which ranged from 16 to 23 c during the study neither media type anthracite or gac showed strong correlation with temperature r2 0 8 it is likely that changes to pre oxidation conditions in each trial impacted the biomass in such a way that temperature was not the primary factor influencing biofilm development furthermore previous studies have observed that atp may not be directly influenced by temperature evans et al 2005 27 this is especially true with respect to gac media where the media structure provides better protection and resilience to water temperatures 28 3 3 impact of pre oxidation on organic characteristics prior to filtration o3 and h2o2 o3 decreased doc by 0 2 0 1 mg l and 0 4 0 1 mg l respectively c0 3 3 4 0 mg l specific uv254 absorbance suva was reduced by 41 3 and 44 2 for o3 and h2o2 o3 respectively the small change in doc and large impact on suva suggests that pre oxidation preferentially oxidized aromatic compounds and that uv254 may serve as a useful parameter for observing the impact of o3 and h2o2 o3 on organic matter 29 30 similarly the application of oxidants has been shown to oxidize larger organics i e biopolymers and humic substances into lmw compounds which may be more amenable to biodegradation 4 throughout the study application of o3 was observed to reduce biopolymers by 10 9 while h2o2 o3 reduced biopolymers by 32 7 irrespective of oxidant dose 2 9 vs 3 4 mg o3 l or aop ratio 0 5 vs 1 0 h2o2 o3 table 2 humic substances were the most prevalent fraction of organics in these samples and were comparably transformed by o3 20 3 and h2o2 o3 18 2 since oxidative processes generally alter organics as opposed to removal increases in the concentration of lower molecular weight fractions were expected generally o3 11 14 and h2o2 o3 19 28 increased the concentration of lmw acids however high variability in the results was observed it is hypothesized that variation in water quality specifically organic composition and temperature impacted the effectiveness of pre oxidation application of pre oxidation on dbp fp was also examined o3 reduced thm fp by 15 9 irrespective of dose conversely h2o2 o3 increased thm fp by up to 52 table 2 this result indicates that h2o2 o3 aop should not be used immediately prior to chlorination as significant increases in dbp formation may be observed similar to organic fractionation the results were highly variable likely due to changes in oxidation preference as a result of seasonality similar to other parameters the impact of o3 on haa fp varied increases of 36 and 59 were observed following o3 doses of 2 9 and 3 4 mg l in the first trial but a 15 reduction was observed in the third trial these increases were consistent with the two fold increases reported by chowdhury et al 21 with respect to haa speciation monochloroacetic acid mcaa increased from below detection limit 5 1 μg l to 19 and 35 μg l dichloroacetic acid dcaa increased from 33 μg l to 44 and 38 μg l for o3 doses of 2 9 and 3 4 mg l respectively this implies that oxidation may form haa precursors such as low molecular weight organic species the impact of h2o2 o3 was consistent across all sampling events with haa fp increases of 20 18 observed these results are in agreement with kleiser and frimmel 31 who concluded that oh increased the potential for nom to form dbps 3 4 impact of biofilter media type two types of experimental controls were used in this study first a conventionally operated filter non biological chlorinated backwash was employed to assess the impact of biological filtration the conventional filter caf showed poor removal 5 of doc uv254 thm fp and haa fp from settled water table 2 non biologically active anthracite media does not have a mechanism for organics removal and similar results have been previously reported for this location 17 a second control existed in the form of an anthracite and gac based biofilters without pre oxidation bafctrl and bacctrl the bafctrl did not remove significantly more doc uv254 thm fp haa fp or aox fp than the caf this indicates that biofilm present on the anthracite media was unable to consume the organics present following coagulation conversely the bacctrl improved the removal on average of doc 6 vs 3 uv254 8 vs 3 thm fp 14 vs 0 haa fp 22 vs 7 and aox fp 25 vs 0 this indicated that the biological processes occurring in the bacctrl filter were capable of degrading additional organics when compared to anthracite filters with or without chlorinated backwash it is possible that the 100 ng atp g media threshold presented by pharand et al 12 is not sufficiently high at this location as biological degradation without pre oxidation was not observed until atp concentrations 300 ng g media as was observed on the gac media throughout the study when o3 2 9 mg o3 l was applied the performance of the biological filters improved relative to the filters without pre oxidation specifically o3 baf increased removal of doc 9 vs 3 uv254 49 vs 3 and thm fp 32 vs 0 eliminating the removals associated to o3 alone baf removed doc 6 uv254 5 and thm fp 26 better than a baf without pre oxidation however o3 baf impaired the removal of haa fp relative to baf without pre oxidation o3 increased the concentration of haa fp by 36 whereas baf only removed 22 resulting in a net increase of 14 relative to settled water combining o3 bac 2 9 mg o3 l improved the removal of doc 15 vs 6 uv254 50 vs 8 thm fp 38 vs 14 haa fp 36 vs 22 and aox fp 33 vs 25 when compared to the bacctrl table 2 examining the impact of bac treating ozonated water compared to settled water showed that ozone improved the biodegradability of doc 8 vs 6 removal thm precursors 22 vs 14 removal and haa precursors 46 vs 22 removal as expected pre ozonation altered organics to allow for increased biodegradation it was particularly notable that the bac was able to remove substantially more haa precursors than the baf 46 vs 22 this indicates that ozone dose must be determined based on subsequent biofilter performance such as doc or dbp fp reductions or negative consequences on treated water quality could result including increased chlorine demand elevated dbp formation and the potential for bacterial regrowth in distribution systems finally 0 5 mg h2o2 mg o3 baf resulted in increased removals of doc 18 vs 3 uv254 56 vs 3 thm fp 8 vs 0 and aox fp 6 vs 0 again haa fp was found to increase across the process 7 which is worse than the 7 decrease achieve by bafctrl table 2 this indicates that the aop produces more haa precursors than can effectively be removed by baf and limits the overall removal of aox fp from settled water to 6 these results indicate that appropriate pre oxidation conditions for gac based systems are likely inappropriate for anthracite based biofiltration haa fp increased by approximately 9 from settled water after oxidation baf gac based filtration reduced haa fp from settled water by 23 under the same oxidation conditions application of 0 5 mg h2o2 mg o3 bac resulted in the highest reduction of doc 23 fig 2 and uv254 58 these results were not as pronounced as those reported by speitel et al 11 who observed doc reductions of 40 when using h2o2 o3 combined with lab scale biofilters 5 min ebct doco 2 7 mg l however despite improved removal of organics achieved using an aop in this study the impact with respect to dbp fp was limited due to the increased formation of precursors associated with the aop 0 5 mg h2o2 mg o3 bac reduced thm fp by 14 haa fp by 21 and aox fp by 22 which is lower than what was achieved by 2 9 mg o3 l bac 38 36 and 33 respectively based on these results no statistical difference was observed between o3 bac and h2o2 o3 bac as such the application of an aop prior to biofiltration is not recommended for the removal of organics and dbp precursors as it does not provide a significant benefit compared to o3 alone despite increased operating costs however h2o2 o3 may be selected for other objectives including bromate control or reducing the footprint of the ozonation system while providing similar oxidation conditions 3 5 importance of organic fractionation it was previously established that pre oxidation alters the composition of organics by degrading large organics such as biopolymers and humic substances into smaller molecular weight organics building blocks lmw acids and lmw neutrals this transformation can be particularly important with respect to dbp formation as lmw compounds have been shown to be precursors to dbps 21 32 to determine if the change in organic fractions impacted dbp fp as a result of pre oxidation correlations between each dbp fp thm haa and aox and specific organic fractions were calculated table 3 in general larger organic fractions biopolymers and humic substances did not correlate with thm fp r2 0 55 or haa fp r2 0 15 when evaluated at three different water temperatures this is in contrast to wassink et al 33 which identified strong linear relationships between humic substances and dbp fp however a strong correlation was observed between lmw acids and thm fp or haa fp table 3 fig 3 r2 for these relationships exceeded 0 8 during 2 out of 3 trials the relationship with small organic fractions lmw acids specifically may be attributed to the pre oxidation applied in this study utilizing the slope of the linear regression equation as an indicator for lmw acid to dbp conversion thm fp conversion ranged from 20 to 53 while the conversion to haa fp ranged from 29 to 42 it is important to consider that conversion of lmw acids to dbp fp may exceed 50 since the use of pre oxidation results in the formation of lmw acids and will directly lead to the formation of dbps if not removed by biofiltration prior to disinfection this relationship further reinforces the importance of pilot testing prior to implementation at full scale when directly comparing pre oxidation with o3 and h2o2 o3 applying 2 9 mg o3 l reduced the concentration of lmw acids by 6 in contrast 0 5 mg h2o2 mg o3 resulted in an increase of 49 as a result applying an aop requires downstream biofilters to remove a much greater concentration of dbp precursors and may result in treated water exceeding dbp regulations during periods when optimal biofiltration performance is not attained 4 conclusions it was determined that lower oxidant doses 2 9 mg o3 l and 0 5 mg h2o2 mg o3 performed as well or better than higher doses based on water quality atp concentrations on filter media anthracite or gac increased with the application of pre oxidation o3 or h2o2 o3 gac biofilter media atp values without pre oxidation were higher than anthracite biofilter media with or without pre oxidation the best overall performance was achieved when applying 2 9 mg o3 l prior to bac biofilters pre treated with h2o2 o3 showed higher removal of doc but lower dbp precursor removal as a result of increased formation associated with the aop since anthracite based biofilters did not perform as well as gac based biofilters the oxidant dose which was optimized for subsequent gac based biofiltration impaired performance in o3 baf and h2o2 o3 baf systems as a result the baf with pre oxidation did not perform as well as the bafctrl with respect to dbp precursor removal lc ocd analyses demonstrated that both o3 and h2o2 o3 enhanced biofiltration by oxidizing large organics into smaller more biodegradable compounds h2o2 o3 biofiltration led to higher doc reduction but o3 biofiltration resulted in better dbp precursor removal for both thms and haas pre oxidation was associated with formation of lmw acids which may serve as dbp precursors as strong correlations between lmw acids and thm fp and haa fp were observed as such increasing the oxidation potential may potentially result in poorer than expected treated water

14486,hydrophilic modification of alumina microfiltration membranes was achieved by incorporating silica nanoparticles into the alumina matrix the alumina tubular membrane incorporated with silica nanoparticles was tested for cyclohexane in water emulsion separation the incorporated silica nanoparticles increased the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface with the oil contact angles changing from 155 to 165 the alumina membrane treated with a 0 5 wt silica nanoparticle solution yielded a water flux greater than 350 l m 2 h 1 and oil rejection greater than 93 which represented a 20 5 and 6 0 enhancement in water flux and oil rejection compared with the pristine alumina membrane due to the hydrophilic silica nanoparticle incorporation the cyclohexane concentration of the permeate was less than 40 ppm when the cyclohexane concentration of the feed was 500 ppm at 40 c and feed pressure was 43 7 psia this work represents a key advancement toward the use of inorganic membranes to treat marginal water that contains hydrocarbon contaminants keywords microfiltration oil in water emulsion separation silica nanoparticles incorporation hydrophilic modification 1 introduction on a global scale approximately three barrels of produced water a byproduct of oil and gas production containing such impurities as hydrocarbons dissolved inorganic and organic particles are produced for every barrel of oil extracted 1 2 the existence of oil droplets along with surface active agents eventually tends to form stable oil in water emulsions in order to meet the discharge requirements 40 ppm of hydrocarbon in the water phase 3 there is a significant need for efficient cost effective strategies to remove hydrocarbons from produced water the primary technology used by major producers to remove hydrocarbons from produced water relies upon the addition of chemical demulsifiers to remove surface active agents from the oil water interface 4 chemical demulsifiers have to match with the specific chemical profile of the produced fluid due to the lack of a predictive model for choosing appropriate demulsifiers this process can only be accomplished through inefficient trial and error serial testing 4 5 in addition the chemical treatments may also result in the formation of sludge which can cause further pollution 6 ultrafiltration uf polymeric membranes with pore sizes ranging from 0 01 μm to 0 1 μm are commonly selected to separate water from oil in water emulsions by size exclusion the membrane pore size and membrane thickness can be relatively controlled by selecting appropriate materials several studies have been performed on membranes involving oil in water emulsions yang et al 7 coated polydopamine pda and polyethyleneimine pei on a polypropylene membrane to control the pore size at around 0 2 μm an oil rejection of 98 was obtained by optimizing surface structures and properties which in turn determined filtration performance some membranes that were made from natural materials were also studied to realize effective oil water separations including a bioinspired diatomite membrane and a mineral coated polypropylene membrane 8 9 however the polymeric membrane fabrication process takes extensive time due to strict control of temperature and pressure and complicated procedures such as crosslinking salt induced fabrication and nitrogen atmosphere protection 10 12 fouling is a serious issue that causes flux losses of membranes because of contaminants blocking the membrane pores a typical step for removing foulants on a membrane surface is to wash out the remaining oil from the membrane ahmad et al 13 synthesized a polymeric membrane by utilizing polysulfone with sio2 nanoparticles nps for modification based on their research the hydrophilic sio2 nanoparticles were found to be capable of enlarging pore size with a series of interconnected surface pores the bigger pores not only increased anti fouling properties but also increased membrane permeability simultaneously rajasekhar et al 14 proposed a similar method involving the fabrication of poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf and tri block copolymer tbc which are regarded as self cleaning materials different ratios of these two components were investigated with the expectation that membrane properties such as flux oil rejection and fouling resistance would be enhanced yuan et al 15 also used pvdf membrane to realize a 99 oil rejection rate with the water flux of higher than 650 l m2 h for the oil in water emulsion separation although new self cleaning materials are currently used in polymeric membranes 13 14 16 as high as 70 90 of oil droplets can be deposited and adsorbed on the surface of membrane this can be counteracted by washing which can remove as much as 30 40 of oil droplets deposited on the membrane polymeric materials however cannot tolerate corrosive condition such as acidic and basic solutions high temperatures and organic solvents 17 19 in addition swelling due to capillary force or the combination of molecular diffusion and convection in the water filled pores 20 can make the polymeric membranes ineffective under severe environmental conditions because of the many issues involving polymeric membranes researchers have focused on ceramic materials in order to overcome the material based limitations of polymers as shown in table 1 generally ceramic membranes are synthesized and coated on porous supports such as alumina disks or mullite hollow fibers chang et al 6 modified a ceramic alumina membrane by coating nano tio2 on the membrane surface the pore size of a ceramic alumina membrane without modification was found to be appropriate for oil separation in addition tio2 can increase the membrane hydrophilicity thereby increasing the number of water molecules that are allowed to pass through the membrane therefore increasing the membrane flux in some cases materials are synthesized on the surface 21 22 or in the channel 23 of the supports to enhance transport efficiency and separation selectivity chen et al 23 synthesized the carbon nanotubes in the channels of an yttria stabilized zirconia ysz membrane to remove tiny oil droplets from the water under optimal growth conditions for carbon nanotubes the oil rejection of 100 was obtained for industrial applications membrane processes operating under harsh conditions has to be considered when improving the membrane separation efficiency studies have been performed about the use of silica for coating microfiltration membranes 24 26 these silica decorated membranes not only improved hydrophilicity but also corrosion resistance 27 conveniently another benefit of this modification is that a ceramic support can also protect a membrane by enhancing mechanical stability 2 experimental 2 1 membrane synthesis hydrophilic silica nps 16 nm a200 aerosil were added into deionized water resistivity of 18 mω cm 1 and stirred for 2 h to prepare a homogeneous silica nps containing solution at the weight percentage of 0 05 0 5 and 5 the α alumina tubular membrane 70 mm length 11 mm outer diameter 8 mm inner diameter 0 2 μm pore size coorstek was washed with ethanol and water successively and dried in 60 c overnight the dried membrane was then immersed into the silica nps containing solution for a 15 s pre wetting to incorporate silica nps onto the surface after drying at 60 c overnight the above membrane was immersed in the same solution for 15 min with ultra sonication to uniformly incorporate the silica nps on the membrane surface finally after drying overnight at 60 c the membrane was calcined at 350 c for 30 min with the ramping rate of 30 c h to integrate the silica nps firmly onto the membrane surface the alumina membranes immersed in solutions containing 0 05 0 5 and 5 silica nps were named as m0 05 m0 5 m5 and the pristine membrane was named m0 2 2 oil in water emulsion synthesis for preparation of oil in water emulsions cyclohexane 99 purity alfa aesar was used as the dispersed oil phase and di water was used as the continuous aqueous phase sodium dodecyl sulphate sds a water soluble anionic surfactant with an hlb 31 value of 40 as stated by the vendor was used as the surfactant the oil in water emulsions were prepared using an ultra turrax digital homogenizer operating at 10 000 rpm for 5 min initially the surfactant was added to the aqueous phase followed by vigorous shaking to aid in complete mixing of sds with the aqueous phase the dispersed oil phase was added in a drop wise manner to aid in homogenous distribution of water droplets 32 34 the cyclohexane in water emulsion consisted of 500 ppm of cyclohexane and 0 13 wt sds an olympus bx53 cross polarized optical microscope equipped with a high speed camera was used for measuring the droplet size of cyclohexane in water emulsions the schematic of the microscope stage and the procedure to determine the droplet size of the emulsions using image j from the microphotographs can be found elsewhere 35 fig 1 shows the droplet size distribution of the cyclohexane in water emulsion the average droplet size of the emulsion was 2 5 0 7 μm bottle tests confirmed that no phase separation of this emulsion occurred and the emulsion was stable at the investigated temperatures 2 3 emulsion separation experiment in order to investigate the separation capability of the prepared membranes the modified membrane was sealed into the stainless steel module of a once through system with epoxy resin fig 2 300 ml of the emulsion was added to the sample cylinder a pressure of 43 7 psia was then supplied from compressed ar on the feed side of the membrane the separation efficiency is defined according to the following equation 1 η 1 c i c 0 100 where ci is the cyclohexane concentration in the effluent c0 is the cyclohexane concentration in the feed before separation the permeation flux j was calculated as 2 j v a t v l is the volume of the permeate a m2 is the membrane area t h is the separation time 2 4 characterization micro morphological images were obtained by fei quanta 600 field emission gun environmental scanning electron microscope sem with an evex eds x ray microanalysis system and hkl ebsd system cyclohexane that was extracted from the permeate using chloroform chcl3 was measured using a gas chromatography mass spectrometry system 36 shimadzu gc ms qp2010 ei ci sources ps 313 capillary column gc with quadrupole mass analyzer for this technique an automatic liquid sampler with injections of 1 μl was used for injection of all the samples the wettability was measured using a contact angle goniometer core laboratories ift 10 at room temperature and atmospheric pressure 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the membrane the morphology of the membranes after silica nps were incorporated on the alumina membrane is shown in fig 3 the silica nps were incorporated on the surface and in the pore channels of the alumina membrane when the alumina membrane was treated with a 0 5 solution the silica nps were incorporated on the membrane surface fig 3e g which resulted in minimal blocking of membrane channels fig 3h however when the 5 solution was used a continuous layer of silica nps was formed on the membrane surface fig 3i k and aggregated in membrane channels fig 3l which narrowed the membrane pores fig 4 shows the morphology of membranes m0 m0 5 and m5 before and after oil in water emulsion separation edx elemental analysis 1 2 μm depth was performed on the membranes to compare surface composition changes before and after the separations from the edx measurements in table 2 it was found that the atomic of si for m0 5 reduced from 0 59 to 0 45 and the atomic of si for m5 reduced from 16 62 to 7 89 during separations these data show that for the optimal membrane m0 5 the majority of the silica that was originally added to the membrane remained on the membrane during the oil water separation and yielded an improvement in the oil rejection rate for the m5 membrane the silica nps aggregated due to the higher np concentration which decreased the interaction between the silica nps and the alumina surface 37 38 the larger aggregates on the m5 membrane were easier to wash away during the microfiltration compared with the smaller non aggregated silica nps on m0 5 in order to further estimate the membrane stability the permeate solution through the m0 5 was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min no observable particles were found at the bottom of the centrifuge tube which indicated that m0 5 could be regarded as a promising candidate for further oil in water emulsion separation the oil contact angles were measured to investigate the wettability of the membranes at room temperature and atmospheric pressure fig 5 a the contact angle measurements were performed for 1 h the existence of the silica nps increased the contact angle between cyclohexane droplets and the membrane incorporation surface indicating that silica nps enhanced hydrophilicity of the membrane fig 5b 3 2 membrane performance on the oil in water emulsion separation 3 2 1 effect of silica nps concentration membranes modified with three different concentrations of silica np solutions were used to separate the oil in water emulsion fig 6 shows the microphotographs of the feed and permeate no droplet was observed in the permeate which indicated the separation of cyclohexane droplets from the oil in water emulsion as shown in fig 7 silica np modified membranes yielded higher fluxes compared with the unmodified alumina membranes this can be explained by the fact that the silica nps enhanced the membrane hydrophilicity by strongly adsorbing the hydroxyl groups to the surface of the silica nps thereby allowing more water molecules to be absorbed and passed through the membrane which is consistent with recent literature 25 26 as shown in table 3 when the concentration of the precursor solution was 0 5 wt the permeate cyclohexane concentration decreased approximately 50 compared with the one incorporated with lower concentrations indicating the effects of silica nps on repelling oils although more silica nps provide higher hydrophilicity when the concentration of the silica nps precursor solution was 5 wt the membrane channel was narrowed fig 3 due to the presence of agglomerated silica nps thus the flux of m5 was lower than those of m0 05 and m0 5 m0 5 exhibited high flux and high cyclohexane rejection and was therefore selected for further experiments 3 2 2 effect of feed pressure fig 8 shows the effect of trans membrane pressure on the flux according to shokrkar et al 39 flux normally increases with increasing trans membrane pressure when feed pressure was increased from 29 2 to 58 2 psia the driving force increased on the feed side resulting in a higher water flux table 4 3 2 3 effect of feed temperature fig 9 illustrates the effect of feed temperature on the flux over time literature studies on the use of ceramic membranes for membrane distillation applications show that an increase in temperature leads to an increase in flux while maintaining a constant rejection rate 40 42 also water permeability increases with an increase in temperature in accordance with the literature 43 the flux in our work increased at higher feed temperatures fig 9 as shown in table 5 the cyclohexane rejection rates varied less than 2 across the temperature range 20 c 60 c thereby indicating that temperature did not affect the oil rejection performance of m0 5 which is in accordance with the literature 40 42 4 conclusion we demonstrated a novel method to incorporate hydrophilic silica nps into an α alumina microfiltration tubular membrane for oil in water emulsion separation after treating the alumina membrane with a 0 5 wt silica nps precursor solution the water flux was greater than 350 lm 2 h 1 and the oil rejection was greater than 93 this represents a 20 5 and 6 0 enhancement in the flux and the oil rejection compared with the unmodified membrane the contact angles of oil on the modified membranes ranged from approximately 155 to 165 the m0 5 membrane yielded a permeate cyclohexane concentration lower than 40 ppm with an average water flux of approximately 1000 lm 2 h 1 at 43 7 psia and 40 c these data demonstrate the utility of hydrophilic silica nps on enhancing the separation potential of inorganic membranes for oil in water emulsion separation additional scaffolds surface functionalization and

14486,hydrophilic modification of alumina microfiltration membranes was achieved by incorporating silica nanoparticles into the alumina matrix the alumina tubular membrane incorporated with silica nanoparticles was tested for cyclohexane in water emulsion separation the incorporated silica nanoparticles increased the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface with the oil contact angles changing from 155 to 165 the alumina membrane treated with a 0 5 wt silica nanoparticle solution yielded a water flux greater than 350 l m 2 h 1 and oil rejection greater than 93 which represented a 20 5 and 6 0 enhancement in water flux and oil rejection compared with the pristine alumina membrane due to the hydrophilic silica nanoparticle incorporation the cyclohexane concentration of the permeate was less than 40 ppm when the cyclohexane concentration of the feed was 500 ppm at 40 c and feed pressure was 43 7 psia this work represents a key advancement toward the use of inorganic membranes to treat marginal water that contains hydrocarbon contaminants keywords microfiltration oil in water emulsion separation silica nanoparticles incorporation hydrophilic modification 1 introduction on a global scale approximately three barrels of produced water a byproduct of oil and gas production containing such impurities as hydrocarbons dissolved inorganic and organic particles are produced for every barrel of oil extracted 1 2 the existence of oil droplets along with surface active agents eventually tends to form stable oil in water emulsions in order to meet the discharge requirements 40 ppm of hydrocarbon in the water phase 3 there is a significant need for efficient cost effective strategies to remove hydrocarbons from produced water the primary technology used by major producers to remove hydrocarbons from produced water relies upon the addition of chemical demulsifiers to remove surface active agents from the oil water interface 4 chemical demulsifiers have to match with the specific chemical profile of the produced fluid due to the lack of a predictive model for choosing appropriate demulsifiers this process can only be accomplished through inefficient trial and error serial testing 4 5 in addition the chemical treatments may also result in the formation of sludge which can cause further pollution 6 ultrafiltration uf polymeric membranes with pore sizes ranging from 0 01 μm to 0 1 μm are commonly selected to separate water from oil in water emulsions by size exclusion the membrane pore size and membrane thickness can be relatively controlled by selecting appropriate materials several studies have been performed on membranes involving oil in water emulsions yang et al 7 coated polydopamine pda and polyethyleneimine pei on a polypropylene membrane to control the pore size at around 0 2 μm an oil rejection of 98 was obtained by optimizing surface structures and properties which in turn determined filtration performance some membranes that were made from natural materials were also studied to realize effective oil water separations including a bioinspired diatomite membrane and a mineral coated polypropylene membrane 8 9 however the polymeric membrane fabrication process takes extensive time due to strict control of temperature and pressure and complicated procedures such as crosslinking salt induced fabrication and nitrogen atmosphere protection 10 12 fouling is a serious issue that causes flux losses of membranes because of contaminants blocking the membrane pores a typical step for removing foulants on a membrane surface is to wash out the remaining oil from the membrane ahmad et al 13 synthesized a polymeric membrane by utilizing polysulfone with sio2 nanoparticles nps for modification based on their research the hydrophilic sio2 nanoparticles were found to be capable of enlarging pore size with a series of interconnected surface pores the bigger pores not only increased anti fouling properties but also increased membrane permeability simultaneously rajasekhar et al 14 proposed a similar method involving the fabrication of poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf and tri block copolymer tbc which are regarded as self cleaning materials different ratios of these two components were investigated with the expectation that membrane properties such as flux oil rejection and fouling resistance would be enhanced yuan et al 15 also used pvdf membrane to realize a 99 oil rejection rate with the water flux of higher than 650 l m2 h for the oil in water emulsion separation although new self cleaning materials are currently used in polymeric membranes 13 14 16 as high as 70 90 of oil droplets can be deposited and adsorbed on the surface of membrane this can be counteracted by washing which can remove as much as 30 40 of oil droplets deposited on the membrane polymeric materials however cannot tolerate corrosive condition such as acidic and basic solutions high temperatures and organic solvents 17 19 in addition swelling due to capillary force or the combination of molecular diffusion and convection in the water filled pores 20 can make the polymeric membranes ineffective under severe environmental conditions because of the many issues involving polymeric membranes researchers have focused on ceramic materials in order to overcome the material based limitations of polymers as shown in table 1 generally ceramic membranes are synthesized and coated on porous supports such as alumina disks or mullite hollow fibers chang et al 6 modified a ceramic alumina membrane by coating nano tio2 on the membrane surface the pore size of a ceramic alumina membrane without modification was found to be appropriate for oil separation in addition tio2 can increase the membrane hydrophilicity thereby increasing the number of water molecules that are allowed to pass through the membrane therefore increasing the membrane flux in some cases materials are synthesized on the surface 21 22 or in the channel 23 of the supports to enhance transport efficiency and separation selectivity chen et al 23 synthesized the carbon nanotubes in the channels of an yttria stabilized zirconia ysz membrane to remove tiny oil droplets from the water under optimal growth conditions for carbon nanotubes the oil rejection of 100 was obtained for industrial applications membrane processes operating under harsh conditions has to be considered when improving the membrane separation efficiency studies have been performed about the use of silica for coating microfiltration membranes 24 26 these silica decorated membranes not only improved hydrophilicity but also corrosion resistance 27 conveniently another benefit of this modification is that a ceramic support can also protect a membrane by enhancing mechanical stability 2 experimental 2 1 membrane synthesis hydrophilic silica nps 16 nm a200 aerosil were added into deionized water resistivity of 18 mω cm 1 and stirred for 2 h to prepare a homogeneous silica nps containing solution at the weight percentage of 0 05 0 5 and 5 the α alumina tubular membrane 70 mm length 11 mm outer diameter 8 mm inner diameter 0 2 μm pore size coorstek was washed with ethanol and water successively and dried in 60 c overnight the dried membrane was then immersed into the silica nps containing solution for a 15 s pre wetting to incorporate silica nps onto the surface after drying at 60 c overnight the above membrane was immersed in the same solution for 15 min with ultra sonication to uniformly incorporate the silica nps on the membrane surface finally after drying overnight at 60 c the membrane was calcined at 350 c for 30 min with the ramping rate of 30 c h to integrate the silica nps firmly onto the membrane surface the alumina membranes immersed in solutions containing 0 05 0 5 and 5 silica nps were named as m0 05 m0 5 m5 and the pristine membrane was named m0 2 2 oil in water emulsion synthesis for preparation of oil in water emulsions cyclohexane 99 purity alfa aesar was used as the dispersed oil phase and di water was used as the continuous aqueous phase sodium dodecyl sulphate sds a water soluble anionic surfactant with an hlb 31 value of 40 as stated by the vendor was used as the surfactant the oil in water emulsions were prepared using an ultra turrax digital homogenizer operating at 10 000 rpm for 5 min initially the surfactant was added to the aqueous phase followed by vigorous shaking to aid in complete mixing of sds with the aqueous phase the dispersed oil phase was added in a drop wise manner to aid in homogenous distribution of water droplets 32 34 the cyclohexane in water emulsion consisted of 500 ppm of cyclohexane and 0 13 wt sds an olympus bx53 cross polarized optical microscope equipped with a high speed camera was used for measuring the droplet size of cyclohexane in water emulsions the schematic of the microscope stage and the procedure to determine the droplet size of the emulsions using

14487,in this study the removal and recovery of phosphorus p were evaluated on fixed bed column systems using a hybrid adsorbent i e hfeo the effect of flow rates 1 0 2 5 ml min and bed heights 2 6 cm was examined and the experimental data were adjusted to the thomas adams bohart and yoon nelson models the results indicate that for the flow rate of 1 0 ml min and bed height of 2 cm a maximum adsorption capacity of p qth of 53 57 mg g is obtained 6 nacl acts as the best eluting agent with a 97 efficiency of p desorption finally it was found that hfeo is able to support up to three cycles of adsorption desorption decreasing its capacity of p adsorption by 26 with respect to the initial capacity keywords adsorption desorption phosphorus fixed bed column breakthrough curve 1 introduction phosphorus p is a non renewable and essential resource for life it is one of the main nutrients for plants and in turn is primarily responsible for the eutrophication of water the high phosphorus content in surface and groundwater is due to the uncontrolled use of fertilizers and incomplete treatment of domestic and industrial wastewater 1 the excess of p in waste water and the deficiency in the existing waste water treatment plant wwtp methods for p removal negatively affects the biodiversity of aquatic ecosystems 2 5 although eutrophication has gained significant attention around the world this problem is still uncontrolled 1 to solve the problem of increasing concentrations of phosphate in aquatic ecosystems several methods such as biological physical and chemical treatment techniques have been developed for phosphate removal 1 6 adsorption is one of the most promising methods to remove p from aqueous solutions because it is easy to implement affordable cost efficiency selective and reusable moreover its effectiveness depends on the type of adsorbent material 7 various minerals materials and polymers have been used in phosphate removal such as activated carbon 8 zeolite 9 chitosan 10 filters 11 metal hydroxide 12 14 12 14 and so on several studies have reported evidence that metal oxides have high affinity and selectivity in the p adsorption process 9 15 20 because metal ions have one or more empty orbitals they act as lewis acids by accepting an electron pair 1 21 among the different metal oxides iron oxides are frequently encountered in the literature with regards to phosphorus remediation 22 iron fe is an environmentally benign and inexpensive element 23 owing to its hard lewis acid property fe hydr oxides are considered as electron pair acceptors and have ultra strong affinity toward phosphate as lewis base 24 however metal oxides lack the properties necessary for extensive operation in wwtps such as mechanical strength and wear resistance these oxides dissolve in wastewater and lose those adsorption capacity 25 therefore the need has arisen to look for fe supports for improving the efficiency host materials with high specific surface area ssa such as activated carbon 26 exchange ion resins 27 and silica spheres 20 can support a large amount of iron and therefore increase the adsorption capacity with these materials the process of phosphorus recovery it is easy to implement therefore several research papers have studied the performance on phosphate removal using metals immobilized on different support materials li et al 28 used sugar cane residues impregnated with mgo for the removal of p they found an adsorption process controlled by surface electrostatic attraction with mgo zhou et al 29 modified activated carbon fibres with fe oh 3 and found that the presence of the metal improves the efficiency of the p adsorption process nur et al 20 studied the removal of p from aqueous solutions using the purolite ferr ix a33e ion exchange resin as a support material for iron oxide and found an adsorption capacity of 48 mg p g which remains greater than 90 after three adsorption desorption cycles this is because the ion exchange resins exhibit durability and mechanical resistance acelas et al 27 immobilised three different types of metal oxides hfeo hzro and hcuo in a microporous anion exchange resin ira 400 finding removal capacities of 111 1 mg p g 91 74 mg p g and 74 07 mg p g respectively at the same time they found high selectivity towards p in the presence of other competitive anions for example hfeo reduced the amount of p to 83 in a real waste water solution the present paper deals with the evaluation of a hybrid adsorbent i e hfeo produced in our laboratory following the methodology of acelas et al 27 for phosphate removal from aqueous solution in the fixed bed column mode of operations these continuous flow experiments are important for the design and operational improvements of large scale adsorption processes and to predict the breakthrough curve which determines the functional longevity of the adsorbent beds the effects of important design parameters such as bed height and flow rate on breakthrough curves were evaluated the thomas adams bohart and yoon nelson models were used to describe column adsorption data and predict breakthrough curves finally different bases and eluting agents were evaluated to regenerate the adsorbent material for reuse 2 methodology 2 1 adsorbent material in this study hfeo is an anion exchange resin impregnated with iron hydroxide oxides the synthesis procedure can be found in our previous study 27 2 2 experiments in column flow and height variations a known amount of hfeo was placed in a glass column with internal diameter and length of 11 mm and 40 cm respectively to obtain the desired bed heights for the bed heights of 2 4 and 6 cm 1 22 2 50 and 4 24 g of hfeo was used respectively the synthetic solution of 100 mg p l prepared from nah2po4 h2o phyto technology laboratories was passed through the column at flow rates of 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 ml min controlled with a peristaltic pump the effluent solutions of the column were collected and analysed at different time periods fig 1 all of the experiments were performed once and the samples were measured in duplicate the concentration of p in all the experiments was determined by the colorimetry technique wherein orthophosphate reacts with molybdate in an acid medium to producefifigig a mixed phosphate molybdate complex in the presence of vanadium formation of yellow molybdovanadophosphoric acid was observed the intensity of the yellow colour is proportional to the phosphate concentration test results were measured at 420 nm using a vis dr 3900 spectrophotometer hach loveland colorado usa 2 3 theory and data evaluation 2 3 1 calculation of breakthrough curve parameters to evaluate the adsorption performance of a column it is necessary to analyse the breakthrough curve and its prediction is essential to designate continuous adsorption systems the breakthrough times and bed volumes are important to determine the dynamic conditions and operation of an adsorption column the breakthrough curves show the behaviour of p to be removed from the solution in a fixed bed column and are usually expressed in terms of adsorbed p c a d c 0 c t vs the bed volume bv where c 0 is the initial concentration of phosphate in a solution and c t is the amount removed by the bed in time t the breakthrough time t b and the volume treated at breakthrough time v b are determined as the time and volume when the concentration of p exiting the column c t reaches 10 of the initial concentration of p c t c 0 0 1 in the same way the exhaustion time t s and the volume treated at the exhausted time v s are defined as the time and volume when the concentration of p at the exit of the column c t reaches 90 of the initial concentration p c t c 0 0 9 30 31 the total amount of p retained by the column q t o t a l mg p for a flow rate q at a given concentration is equal to the area under the chart curve of c a d vs time t min and is calculated using eq 1 1 q t o t a l q 1000 t 0 t t o t a l c a d d t the maximum capacity of the column q e q mg p g is defined as the total amount of the concentration of p adsorbed q t o t a l per gram of adsorbent m at the end of the time period eq 2 2 q e q q t o t a l m the detection time of hfeo material during fluidisation is calculated using eq 3 3 t h ϑ where t is the detection time h h is the height of the bed of the column m and ϑ is the flow rate m h the efficiency of the adsorbent in the column is indicated by the mass transfer zone mtz which is defined as the length of the adsorption zone in the column and is obtained according using eq 4 32 4 m t z h t s t b t s where h is the height of the bv cm t b the breakthrough time min and t s the exhaustion time min 2 3 2 theoretical models the relationship between concentration and time gives an idea of the affinity of the adsorbent for the adsorbate the surface of the adsorbent and the adsorption routes in addition the successful design of an adsorption column requires the prediction of the concentration profile vs time for the breakthrough curve for this reason various mathematical models have been developed 33 in this study three mathematical models thomas adams bohart and yoon nelson were used to describe the adsorption of p in hfeo in a continuous system these models are able to describe in most cases the breakthrough curves and at the same time report important parameters that can be used to predict the useful time of a column for scaling 2 3 2 1 the thomas model the thomas model 34 is widely used to describe the adsorption process in a packed column this model assumes that adsorption is limited by mass transfer at the interface rather than chemical interactions and that the experimental data follow the langmuir isotherms and the pseudo second order kinetics this model is suitable for describing the complete breakthrough curves and determining the maximum adsorption capacity 32 35 the linear form of the thomas model can be expressed as follows equation 5 5 ln c o c t 1 k t h q t h w q k t h c o t where c 0 and c t mg l are the initial concentration and concentration at time t of p k t h ml mg min is the thomas constant rate q t h mg g is the adsorption capacity for hfeo w g is the amount of adsorbent hfeo in the column and q ml min is the flow using a graph of ln c 0 c t 1 vs the slope and the intercept are used to determine the values of k t h and q t h respectively in this study this model was applied between the breakthrough and saturation points of the experimental breakthrough curves for each system 2 3 2 2 the adams bohart model this model 36 assumes that balance is not reached immediately and that the rate of adsorption is controlled by the external mass transfer this model is appropriate to describe the initial part of the breakthrough curves c t c 0 0 0 5 35 37 the adams bohart equation is expressed as follows eq 6 6 l n c t c o k b a c 0 t k b a n 0 z f where c 0 and c t mg l are the concentration of the adsorbate in the inlet and outlet solution of the column at a given time t respectively kba l mg min is the adams bohart constant rate n0 mg l is the saturation concentration of the column z cm is the height of the bed f cm min is the linear rate and is calculated by dividing the flow rate cm3 min by the area section of the column cm2 k b a and n 0 can be determined from the slope and the intercept of the graph of ln c t c 0 vs t respectively 2 3 2 3 the yoon nelson model this model 38 assumes that the rate of decrease in the probability of adsorption for each adsorbate molecule is proportional to the probability of sorbate sorption and the probability of sorbate breakthrough on the sorbent 35 39 eq 7 7 l n c t c 0 c t k y n t τ k y n where kyn ml mg min is the yoon nelson constant rate τ min is the time required for 50 of the adsorbate breakthrough t min is time c0 mg l is the concentration of the adsorbate in the affluent solution and ct mg l is the concentration of the adsorbate in the effluent solution at a given time t using a graph of l n c t c 0 c t with respect to t values of kyn and τ may be determined using the slope and the intercept respectively 2 4 desorption studies the desorption process was studied to evaluate the potential for recovery of p from hfeo it is well known that adsorption depends on the ph of the solution and acid ph values favour the removal of p therefore to promote the desorption of p different basic solutions regenerative were used including 1 m naoh at 13 65 ph 6 nacl at 8 44 ph and 1 3 solution of 1 m naoh 6 nacl at 13 13 ph the desorption tests were performed at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min using 1 cm 0 61 g of adsorbent previously saturated in the adsorption experiments 2 5 reuse of the adsorbent material to determine the degree of reuse of the adsorbent the adsorption desorption cycle was performed three times using the 6 nacl solution for these experiments the conditions were as follows bed height of 2 cm flow of 1 0 ml min and p concentration of 100 mg l 3 results and discussion 3 1 experiments in column fig 2 shows the effect of flow rate and bed height for p adsorption onto hfeo 3 1 1 effect of flow variation on breakthrough curves fig 2a shows the effect of p adsorption at different flow rates of 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 ml min at a height of 2 cm for hfeo and a p concentration of 100 mg l it is observed that when increasing the flow both ts and tb decrease the time required to reach a saturation of 90 c t c 0 0 9 ts is shown in table 1 specifically it is observed that with the increase in flow from 1 0 to 2 5 ml min ts goes decreases from 1566 to 667 min it indicates that the time required for 90 saturation at a flow of 2 5 ml min is reduced 2 34 times that for at a flow of 1 0 ml min the same trend is observed in tb where the time required for 10 saturation c t c 0 0 1 is 6 2 times smaller at a flow of 2 5 ml min with respect to that at a flow of 1 0 ml min at low flow rates there is a longer contact time between p and the adsorbent material which is in accordance with the detection time table 1 in conclusion high flow rates lead to low residence times and high turbulence which generates weak adsorbate adsorbent interactions on the other hand at low flow rates more contact time ensured and therefore more adsorbate adsorbent interaction the greater phosphate diffusion onto the bed column generates a maximum use for the adsorbent and therefore greater durability in column bed performance as was mentioned in table 2 the phosphate adsorption capacity at different flow rates of 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 ml min 1 were 38 6 35 44 and 40 67 mg g 1 respectively it can be seen that the adsorption capacity is not affected by increasing the flow rate it could be explained as follows the high flow rates load a high amount of phosphate ions in a short period of time but the insufficient contact time causes that phosphate ions leave the column before establishing the adsorption equilibrium 3 1 2 effect of bed height on breakthrough curves fig 2b shows the effect of p adsorption at varying heights of hfeo 2 4 and 6 cm at a flow of 1 ml min and a p concentration of 100 mg l the experimental data indicate that at low bed heights the breakthrough table 1 is faster than at higher heights for example at a height of 2 cm tb is 167 min whereas at a height of 6 cm the tb is 660 min similarly breakthrough volume and exhaustion volume exhibited increasing trend with increased bed height which corresponds to a longer detection time table 1 this indicates that at a higher bed height hfeo there are more active sites with which p can interact thus increasing the total phosphate adsorbed as shown in table 2 furthermore with increasing bed heights the slope of the breakthrough curves became flatter leading to the formation of an expanded mass transfer zone 3 2 theory and data evaluation the values of the experimental breakthrough parameters are shown in table 1 it is observed that the detection time t decreases from 83 to 33 min with the increase of the flow this can be attributed to the fact that at higher flow rates the contact time between p and hfeo is low which is reflected in a low detection time of p from hfeo in contrast when the bed height increases from 2 to 6 cm t increases from 83 to 746 min respectively a similar trend was reported by nur et al 20 for the removal of p from aqueous solutions in contrast the mtz increases both with the increase in flow and with the increase in bed height 3 2 1 kinetic modelling of breakthrough curves 3 2 1 1 application of thomas model table 2 shows the parameters for the thomas adams bohart and yoon nelson models it is observed that for the thomas model there is a good linear data correlation r2 between 0 8834 and 0 9771 which indicates that the experimental data can be represented by this model table 2 it can be said that when the bed height increases kth and qth decrease the behaviour of qth with respect to height might be due to the fact that species availability was unlimited in the column 40 or that the channelling effect increased with increasing depth of the column reducing the column capacity 31 in contrast when the flow increases from 1 0 to 2 5 ml min kth increases from 0 031 10 3 to 0 064 10 3 l mg min and q th decreases from 53 57 to 38 69 mg g the decrease in q th can be attributed to the fact that the availability of active sites is less at higher flow rates 35 various trends have been reported in the literature for the effect of flow on adsorption capacity for example nur et al 2014 20 reported that the amount of p removed was low at lower flow rates due to the low amount of phosphate ions that pass through the column per unit of time in contrast other authors 30 35 41 42 found similar trends as those reported in this study wherein the adsorption capacity decreases with the increase in flow according to hekmatzadeh et al 2014 43 these differences in the trends can be attributed to various experimental conditions such as the type of adsorbent and its interaction with the adsorbate the initial concentration bed height and flow rates 3 2 1 2 application of adams bohart model for the adams bohart model a r2 0 9248 was found which indicate a good fit of the experimental data the increase in height generates a decrease both in the values of kab and in n0 while when increasing the flow from 1 0 to 2 5 ml min the kab constant rate increases from 0 162 to 0 297 ml mg min and the saturation concentration n0 decreases from 2937 22 to 2132 97 mg l these results are in agreement with reports of p adsorption on different materials 20 30 35 41 42 the increase of kab with the increase of the flow indicates that the total kinetics of the system in the initial part of the adsorption c t c 0 0 5 is dominated by external mass transfer in contrast soto et al 2017 44 reported for the adsorption of phenol in a polymeric resin that when increasing the flow kab increases and n0 decreases this last tendency is contrary to that found in our study which may be related to different parameters such as type of adsorbate flow rate initial concentration and nature of the experiments 3 2 1 3 application of yoon nelson model table 2 indicates that the experimental data also present a good fit to the yoon nelson model r2 between 0 8834 and 0 9771 it is observed that with the increase of the feeding flow from 1 0 to 2 5 ml min kyn increases from 0 003 to 0 006 ml mg min and τ decreases from 653 58 to 188 81 min this is because the adsorbent material saturates rapidly as the flow increases therefore the time required for 50 of the breakthrough is reduced the opposite occurs when the bed height increases from 2 to 6 cm where kyn decreases from 0 003 to 0 002 ml mg min and τ increases from 653 58 to 1327 38 min the behaviour of kyn and τ can be attributed to the fact that when the bed height increases there are more active sites that allow p to interact with hfeo therefore the speed rate kyn decreases and the time required for 50 breakthrough increases similar trends have been reported in other studies 30 41 42 3 3 desorption studies it has been reported that among many inorganic anions hydroxide oh is a strong lewis base and aqueous naoh solutions are effective eluting agents 25 in the same way some authors have determined that nacl in addition to being effective in the elution process is affordable 45 therefore in this study both naoh and nacl were evaluated as eluting agents in the p desorption process on hfeo fig 3 shows the p desorption profiles using nacl naoh and nacl naoh as eluting agents it can be seen that 6 nacl is the one that acts as the best eluent solution generating high percentages of recovery during the first bv this indicates that high amount of the adsorbed p is removed using nacl and that the active sites of the adsorbent are again available for another cycle of adsorption of p during the desorption process phosphate removed is concentrated in a small volume of regenerante and the concentrated phosphate solution can be converted into a fertilizer this transformation can overcome the depletion of the natural phosphate rock reserves 3 4 reuse of the adsorbent material fig 4 shows the breakthrough profiles for three adsorption desorption cycles of p from a synthetic solution of 100 mg p l it can be seen that both ts and tb decrease with the increase in the number of adsorption desorption cycle table 3 table 3 shows that the time required for 90 saturation in the first cycle is 1566 min whereas in the third cycle it is 964 min the same trend is observed in tb where the time required for 10 saturation in the first cycle is 167 min and in the third cycle is 90 min this behaviour is attributed mainly to the continuous use of the adsorbent in table 3 it can be seen that the desorption efficiency of p is above 97 for the three adsorption desorption cycles when evaluating the adsorption capacities in each cycle a reduction of 26 with respect to the initial capacity was found further studies need to be conducted for higher number of adsorption desorption cycles to determine the number of such cycles that can be performed without significantly reducing the adsorption capacity 4 conclusions in this study the removal of p on fixed bed column systems from an aqueous solution of 100 mg p l using hfeo as an adsorbent material was evaluated the effect of flow rates and bed height was studied and the experimental data were modelled according to the thomas adams bohart and yoon nelson models the results showed that the adsorption capacity of p is affected by both flow rates and bed heights the maximum adsorption capacity of 53 57 mg g was found at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min and a bed height of 2 cm the experimental data were adjusted to the three prediction models to obtain the breakthrough curves finally the 6 nacl solution acted as the best eluent in the p desorption process with an efficiency higher than 97 allowing the active hfeo sites to be available again for another adsorption process it was also found that after three cycles of adsorption desorption the adsorbent material only loses 26 of its adsorption capacity with respect to the initial capacity

14487,in this study the removal and recovery of phosphorus p were evaluated on fixed bed column systems using a hybrid adsorbent i e hfeo the effect of flow rates 1 0 2 5 ml min and bed heights 2 6 cm was examined and the experimental data were adjusted to the thomas adams bohart and yoon nelson models the results indicate that for the flow rate of 1 0 ml min and bed height of 2 cm a maximum adsorption capacity of p qth of 53 57 mg g is obtained 6 nacl acts as the best eluting agent with a 97 efficiency of p desorption finally it was found that hfeo is able to support up to three cycles of adsorption desorption decreasing its capacity of p adsorption by 26 with respect to the initial capacity keywords adsorption desorption phosphorus fixed bed column breakthrough curve 1 introduction phosphorus p is a non renewable and essential resource for life it is one of the main nutrients for plants and in turn is primarily responsible for the eutrophication of water the high phosphorus content in surface and groundwater is due to the uncontrolled use of fertilizers and incomplete treatment of domestic and industrial wastewater 1 the excess of p in waste water and the deficiency in the existing waste water treatment plant wwtp methods for p removal negatively affects the biodiversity of aquatic ecosystems 2 5 although eutrophication has gained significant attention around the world this problem is still uncontrolled 1 to solve the problem of increasing concentrations of phosphate in aquatic ecosystems several methods such as biological physical and chemical treatment techniques have been developed for phosphate removal 1 6 adsorption is one of the most promising methods to remove p from aqueous solutions because it is easy to implement affordable cost efficiency selective and reusable moreover its effectiveness depends on the type of adsorbent material 7 various minerals materials and polymers have been used in phosphate removal such as activated carbon 8 zeolite 9 chitosan 10 filters 11 metal hydroxide 12 14 12 14 and so on several studies have reported evidence that metal oxides have high affinity and selectivity in the p adsorption process 9 15 20 because metal ions have one or more empty orbitals they act as lewis acids by accepting an electron pair 1 21 among the different metal oxides iron oxides are frequently encountered in the literature with regards to phosphorus remediation 22 iron fe is an environmentally benign and inexpensive element 23 owing to its hard lewis acid property fe hydr oxides are considered as electron pair acceptors and have ultra strong affinity toward phosphate as lewis base 24 however metal oxides lack the properties necessary for extensive operation in wwtps such as mechanical strength and wear resistance these oxides dissolve in wastewater and lose those adsorption capacity 25 therefore the need has arisen to look for fe supports for improving the efficiency host materials with high specific surface area ssa such as activated carbon 26 exchange ion resins 27 and silica spheres 20 can support a large amount of iron and therefore increase the adsorption capacity with these materials the process of phosphorus recovery it is easy to implement therefore several research papers have studied the performance on phosphate removal using metals immobilized on different support materials li et al 28 used sugar cane residues impregnated with mgo for the removal of p they found an adsorption process controlled by surface electrostatic attraction with mgo zhou et al 29 modified activated carbon fibres with fe oh 3 and found that the presence of the metal improves the efficiency of the p adsorption process nur et al 20 studied the removal of p from aqueous solutions using the purolite ferr ix a33e ion exchange resin as a support material for iron oxide and found an adsorption capacity of 48 mg p g which remains greater than 90 after three adsorption desorption cycles this is because the ion exchange resins exhibit durability and mechanical resistance acelas et al 27 immobilised three different types of metal oxides hfeo hzro and hcuo in a microporous anion exchange resin ira 400 finding removal capacities of 111 1 mg p g 91 74 mg p g and 74 07 mg p g respectively at the same time they found high selectivity towards p in the presence of other competitive anions for example hfeo reduced the amount of p to 83 in a real waste water solution the present paper deals with the evaluation of a hybrid adsorbent i e hfeo produced in our laboratory following the methodology of acelas et al 27 for phosphate removal from aqueous solution in the fixed bed column mode of operations these continuous flow experiments are important for the design and operational improvements of large scale adsorption processes and to predict the breakthrough curve which determines the functional longevity of the adsorbent beds the effects of important design parameters such as bed height and flow rate on breakthrough curves were evaluated the thomas adams bohart and yoon nelson models were used to describe column adsorption data and predict breakthrough curves finally different bases and eluting agents were evaluated to regenerate the adsorbent material for reuse 2 methodology 2 1 adsorbent material in this study hfeo is an anion exchange resin impregnated with iron hydroxide oxides the synthesis procedure can be found in our previous study 27 2 2 experiments in column flow and height variations a known amount of hfeo was placed in a glass column with internal diameter and length of 11 mm and 40 cm respectively to obtain the desired bed heights for the bed heights of 2 4 and 6 cm 1 22 2 50 and 4 24 g of hfeo was used respectively the synthetic solution of 100 mg p l prepared from nah2po4 h2o phyto technology laboratories was passed through the column at flow rates of 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 ml min controlled with a peristaltic pump the effluent solutions of the column were collected and analysed at different time periods fig 1 all of the experiments were performed once and the samples were measured in duplicate the concentration of p in all the experiments was determined by the colorimetry technique wherein orthophosphate reacts with molybdate in an acid medium to producefifigig a mixed phosphate molybdate complex in the presence of vanadium formation of yellow molybdovanadophosphoric acid was observed the intensity of the yellow colour is proportional to the phosphate concentration test results were measured at 420 nm using a vis dr 3900 spectrophotometer hach loveland colorado usa 2 3 theory and data evaluation 2 3 1 calculation of breakthrough curve parameters to evaluate the adsorption performance of a column it is necessary to analyse the breakthrough curve and its prediction is essential to designate continuous adsorption systems the breakthrough times and bed volumes are important to determine the dynamic conditions and operation of an adsorption column the breakthrough curves show the behaviour of p to be removed from the solution in a fixed bed column and are usually expressed in terms of adsorbed p c a d c 0 c t vs the bed volume bv where c 0 is the initial concentration of phosphate in a solution and c t is the amount removed by the bed in time t the breakthrough time t b and the volume treated at breakthrough time v b are determined as the time and volume when the concentration of p exiting the column c t reaches 10 of the initial concentration of p c t c 0 0 1 in the same way the exhaustion time t s and the volume treated at the exhausted time v s are defined as the time and volume when the concentration of p at the exit of the column c t reaches 90 of the initial concentration p c t c 0 0 9 30 31 the total amount of p retained by the column q t o t a l mg p for a flow rate q at a given concentration is equal to the area under the chart curve of c a d vs time t min and is calculated using eq 1 1 q t o t a l q 1000 t 0 t t o t a l c a d d t the maximum capacity of the column q e q mg p g is defined as the total amount of the concentration of p adsorbed q t o t a l per gram of adsorbent m at the end of the time period eq 2 2 q e q q t o t a l m the detection time of hfeo material during fluidisation is calculated using eq 3 3 t h ϑ where t is the detection time h h is the height of the bed of the column m and ϑ is the flow rate m h the efficiency of the adsorbent in the column is indicated by the mass transfer zone mtz which is defined as the length of the adsorption zone in the column and is obtained according using eq 4 32 4 m t z h t s t b t s where h is the height of the bv cm t b the breakthrough time min and t s the exhaustion time min 2 3 2 theoretical models the relationship between concentration and time gives an idea of the affinity of the adsorbent for the adsorbate the surface of the adsorbent and the adsorption routes in addition the successful design of an adsorption column requires the prediction of the concentration profile vs time for the breakthrough curve for this reason various mathematical models have been developed 33 in this study three mathematical models thomas adams bohart and yoon nelson were used to describe the adsorption of p in hfeo in a continuous system these models are able to describe in most cases the breakthrough curves and at the same time report important parameters that can be used to predict the useful time of a column for scaling 2 3 2 1 the thomas model the thomas model 34 is widely used to describe the adsorption process in a packed column this model assumes that adsorption is limited by mass transfer at the interface rather than chemical interactions and that the experimental data follow the langmuir isotherms and the pseudo second order kinetics this model is suitable for describing the complete breakthrough curves and determining the maximum adsorption capacity 32 35 the linear form of the thomas model can be expressed as follows equation 5 5 ln c o c t 1 k t h q t h w q k t h c o t where c 0 and c t mg l are the initial concentration and concentration at time t of p k t h ml mg min is the thomas constant rate q t h mg g is the adsorption capacity for hfeo w g is the amount of adsorbent hfeo in the column and q ml min is the flow using a graph of ln c 0 c t 1 vs the slope and the intercept are used to determine the values of k t h and q t h respectively in this study this model was applied between the breakthrough and saturation points of the experimental breakthrough curves for each system 2 3 2 2 the adams bohart model this model 36 assumes that balance is not reached immediately and that the rate of adsorption is controlled by the external mass transfer this model is appropriate to describe the initial part of the breakthrough curves c t c 0 0 0 5 35 37 the adams bohart equation is expressed as follows eq 6 6 l n c t c o k b a c 0 t k b a n 0 z f where c 0 and c t mg l are the concentration of the adsorbate in the inlet and outlet solution of the column at a given time t respectively kba l mg min is the adams bohart constant rate n0 mg l is the saturation concentration of the column z cm is the height of the bed f cm min is the linear rate and is calculated by dividing the flow rate cm3 min by the area section of the column cm2 k b a and n 0 can be determined from the slope and the intercept of the graph of ln c t c 0 vs t respectively 2 3 2 3 the yoon nelson model this model 38 assumes that the rate of decrease in the probability of adsorption for each adsorbate molecule is proportional to the probability of sorbate sorption and the probability of sorbate breakthrough on the sorbent 35 39 eq 7 7 l n c t c 0 c t k y n t τ k y n where kyn ml mg min is the yoon nelson constant rate τ min is the time required for 50 of the adsorbate breakthrough t min is time c0 mg l is the concentration of the adsorbate in the affluent solution and ct mg l is the concentration of the adsorbate in the effluent solution at a given time t using a graph of l n c t c 0 c t with respect to t values of kyn and τ may be determined using the slope and the intercept respectively 2 4 desorption studies the desorption process was studied to evaluate the potential for recovery of p from hfeo it is well known that adsorption depends on the ph of the solution and acid ph values favour the removal of p therefore to promote the desorption of p different basic solutions regenerative were used including 1 m naoh at 13 65 ph 6 nacl at 8 44 ph and 1 3 solution of 1 m naoh 6 nacl at 13 13 ph the desorption tests were performed at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min using 1 cm 0 61 g of adsorbent previously saturated in the adsorption experiments 2 5 reuse of the adsorbent material to determine the degree of reuse of the adsorbent the adsorption desorption cycle was performed three times using the 6 nacl solution for these experiments the conditions were as follows bed height of 2 cm flow of 1 0 ml min and p concentration of 100 mg l 3 results and discussion 3 1 experiments in column fig 2 shows the effect of flow rate and bed height for p adsorption onto hfeo 3 1 1 effect of flow variation on breakthrough curves fig 2a shows the effect of p adsorption at different flow rates of 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 ml min at a height of 2 cm for hfeo and a p concentration of 100 mg l it is observed that when increasing the flow both ts and tb decrease the time required to reach a saturation of 90 c t c 0 0 9 ts is shown in table 1 specifically it is observed that with the increase in flow from 1 0 to 2 5 ml min ts goes decreases from 1566 to 667 min it indicates that the time required for 90 saturation at a flow of 2 5 ml min is reduced 2 34 times that for at a flow of 1 0 ml min the same trend is observed in tb where the time required for 10 saturation c t c 0 0 1 is 6 2 times smaller at a flow of 2 5 ml min with respect to that at a flow of 1 0 ml min at low flow rates there is a longer contact time between p and the adsorbent material which is in accordance with the detection time table 1 in conclusion high flow rates lead to low residence times and high turbulence which generates weak adsorbate adsorbent interactions on the other hand at low flow rates more contact time ensured and therefore more adsorbate adsorbent interaction the greater phosphate diffusion onto the bed column generates a maximum use for the adsorbent and therefore greater durability in column bed performance as was mentioned in table 2 the phosphate adsorption capacity at different flow rates of 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 ml min 1 were 38 6 35 44 and 40 67 mg g 1 respectively it can be seen that the adsorption capacity is not affected by increasing the flow rate it could be explained as follows the high flow rates load a high amount of phosphate ions in a short period of time but the insufficient contact time causes that phosphate ions leave the column before establishing the adsorption equilibrium 3 1 2 effect of bed height on breakthrough curves fig 2b shows the effect of p adsorption at varying heights of hfeo 2 4 and 6 cm at a flow of 1 ml min and a p concentration of 100 mg l the experimental data indicate that at low bed heights the breakthrough table 1 is faster than at higher heights for example at a height of 2 cm tb is 167 min whereas at a height of 6 cm the tb is 660 min similarly breakthrough volume and exhaustion volume exhibited increasing trend with increased bed height which corresponds to a longer detection time table 1 this indicates that at a higher bed height hfeo there are more active sites with which p can interact thus increasing the total phosphate adsorbed as shown in table 2 furthermore with increasing bed heights the slope of the breakthrough curves became flatter leading to the formation of an expanded mass transfer zone 3 2 theory and data evaluation the values of the experimental breakthrough parameters are shown in table 1 it is observed that the detection time t decreases from 83 to 33 min with the increase of the flow this can be attributed to the fact that at higher flow rates the contact time between p and hfeo is low which is reflected in a low detection time of p from hfeo in contrast when the bed height increases from 2 to 6 cm t increases from 83 to 746 min respectively a similar trend was reported by nur et al 20 for the removal of p from aqueous solutions in contrast the mtz increases both with the increase in flow and with the increase in bed height 3 2 1 kinetic modelling of breakthrough curves 3 2 1 1 application of thomas model table 2 shows the parameters for the thomas adams bohart and yoon nelson models it is observed that for the thomas model there is a good linear data correlation r2 between 0 8834 and 0 9771 which indicates that the experimental data can be represented by this model table 2 it can be said that when the bed height increases kth and qth decrease the behaviour of qth with respect to height might be due to the fact that species availability was unlimited in the column 40 or that the channelling effect increased with increasing depth of the column reducing the column capacity 31 in contrast when the flow increases from 1 0 to 2 5 ml min kth increases from 0 031 10 3 to 0 064 10 3 l mg min and q th decreases from 53 57 to 38 69 mg g the decrease in q th can be attributed to the fact that the availability of active sites is less at higher flow rates 35 various trends have been reported in the literature for the effect of flow on adsorption capacity for example nur et al 2014 20 reported that the amount of p removed was low at lower flow rates due to the low amount of phosphate ions that pass through the column per unit of time in contrast other authors 30 35 41 42 found similar trends as those reported in this study wherein the adsorption capacity decreases with the increase in flow according to hekmatzadeh et al 2014 43 these differences in the trends can be attributed to various experimental conditions such as the type of adsorbent and its interaction with the adsorbate the initial concentration bed height and flow rates 3 2 1 2 application of adams bohart model for the adams bohart model a r2 0 9248 was found which indicate a good fit of the experimental data the increase in height generates a decrease both in the values of kab and in n0 while when increasing the flow from 1 0 to 2 5 ml min the kab constant rate increases from 0 162 to 0 297 ml mg min and the saturation concentration n0 decreases from 2937 22 to 2132 97 mg l these results are in agreement with reports of p adsorption on different materials 20 30 35 41 42 the increase of kab with the increase of the flow indicates that the total kinetics of the system in the initial part of the adsorption c t c 0 0 5 is dominated by external mass transfer in contrast soto et al 2017 44 reported for the adsorption of phenol in a polymeric resin that when increasing the flow kab increases and n0 decreases this last tendency is contrary to that found in our study which may be related to different parameters such as type of adsorbate flow rate initial concentration and nature of the experiments 3 2 1 3 application of yoon nelson model table 2 indicates that the experimental data also present a good fit to the yoon nelson model r2 between 0 8834 and 0 9771 it is observed that with the increase of the feeding flow from 1 0 to 2 5 ml min kyn increases from 0 003 to 0 006 ml mg min and τ decreases from 653 58 to 188 81 min this is because the adsorbent material saturates rapidly as the flow increases therefore the time required for 50 of the breakthrough is reduced the opposite occurs when the bed height increases from 2 to 6 cm where kyn decreases from 0 003 to 0 002 ml mg min and τ increases from 653 58 to 1327 38 min the behaviour of kyn and τ can be attributed to the fact that when the bed height increases there are more active sites that allow p to interact with hfeo therefore the speed rate kyn decreases and the time required for 50 breakthrough increases similar trends have been reported in other studies 30 41 42 3 3 desorption studies it has been reported that among many inorganic anions hydroxide oh is a strong lewis base and aqueous naoh solutions are effective eluting agents 25 in the same way some authors have determined that nacl in addition to being effective in the elution process is affordable 45 therefore in this study both naoh and nacl were evaluated as eluting agents in the p desorption process on hfeo fig 3 shows the p desorption profiles using nacl naoh and nacl naoh as eluting agents it can be seen that 6 nacl is the one that acts as the best eluent solution generating high percentages of recovery during the first bv this indicates that high amount of the adsorbed p is removed using nacl and that the active sites of the adsorbent are again available for another cycle of adsorption of p during the desorption process phosphate removed is concentrated in a small volume of regenerante and the concentrated phosphate solution can be converted into a fertilizer this transformation can overcome the depletion of the natural phosphate rock reserves 3 4 reuse of the adsorbent material fig 4 shows the breakthrough profiles for three adsorption desorption cycles of p from a synthetic solution of 100 mg p l it can be seen that both ts and tb decrease with the increase in the number of adsorption desorption cycle table 3 table 3 shows that the time required for 90 saturation in the first cycle is 1566 min whereas in the third cycle it is 964 min the same trend is observed in tb where the time required for 10 saturation in the first cycle is 167 min and in the third cycle is 90 min this behaviour is attributed mainly to the continuous use of the adsorbent in table 3 it can be seen that the desorption efficiency of p is above 97 for the three adsorption desorption cycles when evaluating the adsorption capacities in each cycle a reduction of 26 with respect to the initial capacity was found further studies need to be conducted for higher number of adsorption desorption cycles to determine the number of such cycles that can be performed without significantly reducing the adsorption capacity 4 conclusions in this study the removal of p on fixed bed column systems from an aqueous solution of 100 mg p l using hfeo as an adsorbent material was evaluated the effect of flow rates and bed height was studied and the experimental data were modelled according to the thomas adams bohart and yoon nelson models the results showed that the adsorption capacity of p is affected by both flow rates and bed heights the maximum adsorption capacity of 53 57 mg g was found at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min and a bed height of 2 cm the experimental data were adjusted to the three prediction models to obtain the breakthrough curves finally the 6 nacl solution acted as the best eluent in the p desorption process with an efficiency higher than 97 allowing the active hfeo sites to be available again for

efficient technique for the removal of recalcitrant and toxic chlorinated organic compounds cocs dissolved in groundwater groundwater was obtained from bailin s landfill sabiñanigo spain where liquid and solid wastes of an old lindane factory were uncontrollably dumped during decades 28 cocs were identified and quantified by gas chromatographic analysis five isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane α β ε γ δ hch benzene 10 chlorobenzenes and 12 cyclic non aromatic organochlorine compounds σcocs 93 mg l 1 batch wise and column experiments were carried out using soil and groundwater from the polluted landfill it was found that the dechlorination rate increases with the chlorine content of the organic molecule non aromatic cocs with high chlorine content from 5 to 7 atoms as well as hchs were very rapidly eliminated in the presence of zvim via dechloroelimination while conversions from 60 to 80 were obtained for chlorobenzenes at the end of the treatment the last ones dechlorinated via hydrogenolysis it has been proved that zvim appears as an efficient stable and cost effective treatment for cocs reduction and the results obtained in the laboratory can be used at full scale therefore it was concluded that zvim can be used for the on site treatment of the pumped groundwater and also for the in situ treatment as permeable reactive barriers prbs of the groundwater leading to the complete degradation of the most toxic cocs those with higher chlorine content less aromaticity and lower vapor pressure keywords lindane cocs chlorobenzenes zero valent iron iscr 1 introduction lindane γ hexachlorocyclohexane or γ hch is a very effective pesticide produced on a worldwide scale between 1945 and 1980 and extensively used for agricultural purposes during this period 1 2 however due to its high toxicity and persistence in the environment the use of this chemical was very controversial regarding its effects on human health it is known to harm the nervous system and suspected to be a carcinogen and teratogen 3 additionally concerning the environment lindane has a great large lifetime and can be transported over long distances being accumulated in the food chain 4 6 therefore it has been included in the list of persistent organic pollutants pops in the stockholm convention 7 and consequently banned in the countries that signed this agreement unfortunately although the use of lindane as a pesticide has been phased out in most countries it is still easily detected in agricultural soils 8 moreover large accumulations of this pesticide and its wastes a mixture of hch isomers mainly α hch β hch δ hch γ hch and ε hch different chlorobenzenes coming from chlorination failed reactions and organic solvents used in the purification process of lindane can be found in the surroundings of the pesticide production sites 2 9 10 this is the case of sabiñánigo 11 12 a small industrial city located in the north of spain where inquinosa a lindane manufacturing company operated from 1975 to 1988 as a result of poor waste management approximately 115 000 to 160 000 tonnes of hchs waste were uncontrollably dumped in two unlined landfills located in sardas and bailín both in the vicinity of the former production site 13 polluting the groundwater with a high risk of contamination of the gállego river 14 dioxins and furans formation has been recently identified in the landfills which has been associated with these wastes 15 besides a dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl of very high toxicity coming from the residue of incomplete chlorination reactions and distillation tails was detected at very variable depths in the landfill subsurface 11 the dnapl migrates through the fissures of a vertical sandstone bed generating a groundwater plume the polluting capacity of this phase is enormous it is estimated that 1 l of dnapl ρ 1 5 1 8 kg l 1 can potentially contaminate 1 000 000 m3 of groundwater the main cocs detected in the dnapl and therefore in the associated groundwater were pentachlorocyclohexenes hch isomers chlorobenzene trichlorobenzenes and tetrachlorobenzenes 11 16 nowadays sabiñánigo is considered the most serious case of soil contamination in spain and one of the most important in the world 11 12 the removal of lindane in aqueous medium has been addressed by using several alternatives as biological technologies 17 18 different advanced oxidation processes aops including fenton process 19 and activated persulfate 5 10 and recently advanced electrooxidation processes eaops such as electrooxidation 20 and electro fenton 21 23 an interesting and updated report about potential techniques for lindane remediation was commissioned by the european parliament s policy department for citizens rights and constitutional affairs 12 however most of the treatments collected in that document except in situ chemical oxidation isco and in situ biological remediation can be only applicable for the ex situ treatment of polluted groundwater whereas in situ remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater continuoes to be a priority in this sense chemical reduction cr of chlorinated organic compounds cocs over zero valent metals has emerged as a very promising alternative 24 27 zero valent iron zvi is the preferred metal used for this purpose since iron is the most abundant transition metal and the fourth most plentiful element in the earth crust 28 moreover it is non toxic cheap easy to produce and its reduction process requires little maintenance 27 in addition to having proven to be an efficient catalyst in oxidation treatments heterogeneous fenton 29 30 zvi is an effective reductant when reacting with oxidized contaminants standard redox potential e 0 44 v the removal mechanism of contaminants by zvi concerns the directional transfer of electrons from zvi to the contaminants transforming the latter into non toxic or less toxic species 27 therefore the use of zvi for the treatment of toxic contaminants has received wide attention and encouraging efficiencies have been documented for inorganic species such as hexavalent chromium dichromates and nitrates 31 33 as well as for a large number of cocs such as dichloroethane 34 trichloroethane 35 vinyl chloride 34 carbon tetrachloride 36 hexachlorobenzene 26 and lindane 37 among others most of them for the ex situ treatment of polluted synthetic water 26 35 37 commercial zvi microparticles zvim have been successfully tested for lindane dechlorination in previous works 38 40 hch isomers showed different behavior vs dechlorination according to the axial equatorial position of chlorines lindane was completely degraded by reductive dehalogenation obtaining benzene and chloride as final products 39 zvim showed excellent stability both in continuous and discontinuous mode and the presence of the most common salts in groundwater chlorides sulfates and carbonates seems not to affect the efficiency of the process making this technology a potential approach for the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by lindane 39 nevertheless while most studies have been focused on testing zvim for the treatment of synthetic solutions of hchs the greater potential or advantage of zvim appears to be for in situ chemical reduction iscr of contaminated soil and groundwater a first approach to deal with the treatment of groundwater coming from the bailin s landfill by zvim has been recently carried out 38 although only preliminary results were obtained it seems that hch isomers can be partially reduced aerobic conditions were set after the dechlorination treatment but the biodegradation of the remaining chlorobenzenes was not achieved 38 in order to establish the most suitable operating conditions further research is required thus the objective of the present work is to demonstrate the viability of zvim in real applications which involves particular concerns that must be addressed the competitive effect when different cocs are simultaneously present in real matrices groundwater from the polluted landfill has been studied the effect of the matrix has been analyzed by comparing the results obtained with those corresponding to the treatment of synthetic polluted water moreover in order to test the behavior of zvim in the subsurface in iscr treatments experiments feeding the groundwater to a column filled with soil from the landfill and zvim operating in continuous mode have been performed 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents synthetic contaminated water sw was prepared by dissolving standards of the hch isomers α hch β hch γ hch and δ hch all of them provided by fluka in acetone sigma aldrich 10 g l 1 and diluted in milli q water to the desired concentration solutions of 0 5 mg l 1 of each isomer and a solution containing the four hch isomers with σhchs 2 mg l 1 polluted groundwater gw was obtained from an extraction well located at bailin s landfill working standard solutions of benzene chlorobenzene 1 2 dichlorobenzene 1 3 dichlorobenzene 1 4 dichlorobenzene 1 2 3 trichlorobenzene 1 2 4 trichlorobenzene 1 2 3 4 tetrachlorobenzene 1 2 4 5 tetrachlorobenzene 1 2 3 5 tetrachlorobenzene pentachlorobenzene all of them from sigma aldrich and hch isomers α hch β hch ε hch γ hch and δ hch were prepared for their identification and quantification by gas chromatography coupled with a flame ionization and electron capture detectors cg fid ecd respectively nacl sigma aldrich was used for ion chromatography ic calibration other reagents and materials used were h2so4 fisher c3h6o na2co3 nahco3 panreac c6h14 scharlau and sio2 sigma aldrich butyl cyclohexane c10h20 and tetrachloroethane c2h2cl4 both of them from sigma aldrich were used as internal standard compounds istd all reagents were of analytical grade solutions were prepared with high purity water obtained from a millipore direct q system with resistivity 18 mω cm at 25 c 2 2 zero valent iron microparticles zvim were supplied by höganäs and directly used in dechlorination experiments zvim consist in zero state iron 99 with traces of c 0 003 o 0 12 s 0 01 p 0 008 and mn 0 18 this material was selected in a previous work among five types of commercial zvim due to its higher activity in hchs dechlorination 39 zvim present a specific surface sbet of 0 035 m2 g 1 and a particle diameter of 70 μm more detailed characterization of zvim can be found elsewhere 39 2 3 groundwater from the bailín s landfill the gw treated in the present work comes from a well close to the base of the old bailin s landfill this landfill was used by inquinosa between 1985 and 1989 to uncontrollably dispose of the generated hch wastes 11 it is estimated that 10 m3 of dnapl still remain accumulated in the fissures of the sandstone and conglomerate vertical beds of the landfill subsoil with an associated groundwater plume the gw was stored in glass bottles without gas headspace and refrigerated 4 c until its treatment 2 4 soil from the bailín s landfill the dumpsite is located on the top of an interbedded vertical sequence of sandstone and fine grained limonite layer 11 the groundwater flows through the fractures of the sandstone layer to reproduce these conditions sandstone from the landfill was used to fill the column after being milled to a size lower than 2 mm the soil organic matter som content was lower than 0 5 mineral composition was carbonates 600 g kg 1 calcium 220 g kg 1 potassium 0 96 g kg 1 magnesium 8 8 g kg 1 and iron fe3 17 g kg 1 silica and alumina complete the mineral composition of the soil data provided by the department of agriculture livestock and environment of the government of aragon the standard deviation of the analysis is less than 10 2 5 dechlorination reactions 2 5 1 batch experiments batch experiments were carried out in 10 ml gc gas chromatography glass vials with teflon caps shaken in a constant temperature bath 20 c at an equivalent stirring velocity of 100 rpm 10 ml of sw or gw at its natural ph 7 were added to the reactor containing 50 mg of zvim 5 g l 1 the concentration of zvim was selected in previous works in order to achieve the required conversion values for the hch isomers in reasonable times 39 40 it has to be point out that working with high concentrations of iron does not entail any inconvenience and decreases reaction times in order to minimize the loss of volatile compounds during reaction the headspace of the vials was eliminated experiments without zvim addition were also performed to evaluate possible changes in the composition of the sample during reaction time aqueous liquid samples were extracted from the vial through a needle separated from zvim by filtration 0 45 μm nylon filter extracted with n hexane and immediately analyzed in order to follow the evolution of the reaction several identical vials were prepared and one vial was sacrificed for each experimental point 2 5 2 continuous column experiments continuous experiments were performed by using a teflon fixed bed reactor 20 cm length x 0 8 cm internal diameter with a zvim loading of 4 g bulk density of zvim is about 2 99 g cm 3 mixed with 14 g of soil 10 from bailín s landfill and 90 of commercial sand sigma aldrich the gw from the landfill was stored in a glass bottle submerged in a thermostated bath 15 c and it was pumped upwards through the column by a positive displacement pump simdos covering the wzvim ql 1 range of 0 2500 g h l 1 where wzvim is the mass of zero valent iron microparticles g and ql is the liquid flow of gw l h 1 once column achieved the steady state for a given flow the gw liquid flow ql was maintained during a time on stream of 1 day and no changes in the effluent composition were noticed during this period thus for each wzvim ql 1 value tested a conversion value for each individual coc was obtained after that the liquid flow rate was modified and a new experiment performed maintaining zvim in the fixed bed reactor without any treatment samples were periodically taken at the entrance and exit of the column using a three way valve through a needle extracted in n hexane and immediately analyzed during reduction experiments in continuous mode the composition of the starting gw was stable when the concentration of volatile compounds such as cb decreased ccoc j 90 ccoc j t 0 the inlet vessel was replaced with new gw considering that the degradation of cocs in the presence of zvim is a heterogeneous reaction that takes place over the microparticles surface as occurs in the case of lindane 39 the disappearance rate for each compound j cocj can be expressed by a simple power law rate model 1 r c o c j k w j c c o c j m m g c o c j g z v i m h where rcocj is the rate of cocj disappearance kwj the rate constant related to zvim mass l gzvim 1 h 1 ccocj the concentration of the compound j mg l 1 and m the reaction order with respect to cocj concentration taking into consideration the mass balance for each cocj eq 1 can be expressed as eqs 2 and 3 in discontinuous stirred batch reactor and continuous column reactor mode respectively 2 d c c o c j d w z v i m t v l r c o c j k w j c c o c j m 3 d c c o c j d w z v i m q l r c o c j k w j c c o c j m where wzvim is the mass of zero valent iron microparticles g vl and t the reactor volume l constant and reaction time h in batch experiments and ql the liquid flow of gw l h 1 in column experiments thus data obtained in batch and column experiments can be compared using the following terms g h l 1 obtained from eqs 2 and 3 4 w z v i m t v l b a t c h w z v i m q l c o l u m n all the dechlorination experiments were performed by duplicate the standard deviation being always less than 10 table 1 summarizes the dechlorination runs carried out both in batch and column experiments with the corresponding wzvim t vl 1 or wzvim ql 1 range as well as the main variables for each experiment type of polluted water sw or gw type of coc coc concentration and number of uses of zvim where applicable 2 6 analytical methods the identification of cocs in the starting gw was carried out by gas chromatography coupled with a mass spectrometric detector gc ms as described elsewhere 16 where the identification and quantification of cocs present in different dnapl samples obtained at sabiñanigo s landfills were carried out for this purpose a gas chromatograph agilent 6890 n with an hp5973 mass spectrometric detector was used the chromatograph was equipped with an hp 5 ms column 30 m 0 25 mm i d 5 phenol methyl siloxane and a ctc combypal sampler once identified hch isomers as well as other chlorinated compounds were quantified by gas chromatography coupled with a flame ionization detector fid and an electron capture detector ecd 16 the column hp 5 ms exit was split to both detectors fid and ecd and simultaneously measured helium was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 2 8 ml min 1 the gc injection port temperature was set at 180 c the injection volume was 2 μl the program temperature started at 80 c followed by a temperature ramp of 10 c min 1 to 310 c and then held constant for 1 min prior to analyses water samples were extracted with the same mass of n hexane liquid liquid extraction in order to minimize experimental errors in cocs quantification butyl cyclohexane and tetrachloroethane were added to the extracted samples as internal standard compounds istds for the fid and ecd analyses respectively cocs calibration in the range 0 025 20 mg l 1 was previously performed by dissolving standards of commercial cocs directly in n hexane gc fid response factors used for cocs without commercial standards available such as pentachlorocyclohexenes coming from hchs hydrolysis heptachlorocyclohexenes and hexachlorocyclohexenes coming from heptachlorocyclohexenes hydrolysis were obtained of other commercial compounds with similar chemical structure and number of chlorines the presence of other chlorinated compounds at a significant amount both in the starting gw and in the samples obtained during the reduction treatment was discarded by gc ecd analyses benzene in the water samples after reaction could not be properly quantified due to its high volatility 41 no other non chlorinated compounds were detected by gc fid in the case of sw the dechlorination degree was also evaluated in terms of chlorides released to the liquid phase which were quantified by ic metrohm 761 compact ic with anionic chemical suppression using a conductivity detector a metrosep a supp5 5 250 column 25 cm length 4 mm diameter was used as stationary phase and 0 7 ml min 1 of an aqueous solution 3 2 mm of na2co3 and 1 mm of nahco3 as the mobile phase sample injection 250 μl included an online filtering system 0 45 μm 3 results and discussion 3 1 preliminary results effect of water composition and zvim stability the conversion x profiles of the main hch isomers vs wzvim t vl 1 in sw when these compounds are individually treated runs 1 4 and when they are mixed run 5 data extracted from a previous work 39 are collected in fig 1 a control experiment without zvim was also performed obtaining negligible changes in hchs concentration during reaction time data not shown therefore hchs volatilization or adsorption over the walls and the cap of the reactor were discarded as can be seen in fig 1 hch isomers were progressively degraded by zvim with reaction time as a result of a surface mediated reaction which is in agreement with that previously reported in the literature 41 42 these compounds are adsorbed over the zero valent iron surface which donates electrons to their reductive dechlorination the disappearance rate of each hch was not affected by the presence of other hch isomers in solution obtaining very similar profiles when the isomers were treated individually hch 0 5 mg l 1 or mixed σhch 2 mg l 1 therefore there was not a competitive effect between these compounds independent reactions probably because the reducing agent zvim is in great excess respect to the organic compounds as demonstrated in a previous work hch isomers reactivity depends on the chlorines position and it may be also related to the different water solubility of these compounds thus the following activity order γ hch α hch δ hch β hch was obtained 39 otherwise the chloride balance calculated as the concentration of cl released to the bulk respect to the total chlorine content of the starting sample according to the stoichiometry of the reduction reaction eq 5 was quite well accomplished 90 at the end of the experiments from 0 3 to 0 35 and 1 35 mg l 1 of cl were measured in runs 1 4 and 5 when the initial concentration of chlorine was 0 37 and 1 46 mg l 1 respectively 5 c6h6cl6 3 fe0 c6h6 3 fe2 6 cl the stability and reusability of zvim were thoroughly studied in a previous work dealing with the treatment of synthetic water contaminated with lindane 39 firstly identical conversion profiles of lindane were obtained three consecutive reaction cycles secondly to have a more realistic approach of the process and simulate the performance of zvim into the subsurface the stability of zvim was also corroborated in continuous mode 70 of lindane conversion working at a ratio wzvim ql 1 167 g h l 1 during a time on stream 10 days moreover a constant value for chlorine concentration was always obtained to check the stability of zvim when a mixture of hch is treated three consecutive reaction cycles were carried out in the present work runs 5 7 after each experiment zvi microparticles were separated by filtration oven dried at 60 c for 24 h and reused in a new cycle without any treatment after the third cycle above 95 of the initial zvim mass was recovered the conversion of each hch isomer obtained at 360 g h l 1 is shown in fig 2 as can be seen the activity of zvim remained unaltered during the three reaction cycles regardless of the hch isomer conversions of 85 57 99 and 75 were obtained for α hch β hch γ hch and δ hch respectively as previously commented the concentration of zvim is in high excess in relation to the pollutants one in each reaction cycle only a negligible percentage of the initial fe is lost as a consequence of its oxidation to fe2 the stoichiometric concentration with respect to the chlorine content of the contaminant and therefore can be used in a new reaction cycle the characterization of zvim before and after dechlorination reactions was reported in a previous work 39 concluding that in spite of the initial changes suffered in the textural properties of zvim it appears that zvim characteristics are modified in the early stages of reaction when contact with the aqueous solution and then they remain unchanged this material shows very high stability maintaining its activity in the long term 3 2 characterization of groundwater the groundwater treated in the present work is a colorless liquid sample with an unpleasant odor and a conductivity of approx 2400 μs cm 2 t 18 c it is characterized by a neutral ph ph 7 total organic carbon toc of 254 mg l 1 and chemical oxygen demand cod of 857 mg l 1 the main inorganic species are chlorides 510 mg l 1 sulfates 33 mg l 1 and bicarbonates 641 mg l 1 as anions and calcium 346 mg l 1 magnesium 77 mg l 1 and sodium 8 mg l 1 as cations cocs present in the gw were quantified by gc fid as previously explained in the experimental section the corresponding gc fid chromatogram of a representative sample of the starting gw is shown in fig 3 starting gw cocs have been grouped by families benzene and chlorobenzenes in green heptachlorocyclohexanes and their hydrolysis products hexachlorocyclohexenes in blue and hch isomers and their hydrolysis products pentachlorocyclohexenes in red table 2 collects information about the chlorinated compounds identified in the gw the chemical formula the acronym used for each coc the acquisition time and the concentration values of each compound expressed as mg l 1 in total 28 coc compounds have been identified and quantified the sum of cocs is around 94 mg l 1 representing a toc concentration of 50 mg l 1 20 of the toc since no other chlorinated and or aromatic organic compounds could be identified by gc msd gc fid and gc ecd it is assumed that low carbon chain alcohols such as methanol organic acids acetic acid butyric acid etc and esters complete the organic matter 11 the total concentration of cocs is quite high indicating that the groundwater was highly affected by the presence of the dnapl nearby among the identified cocs special attention has to be paid in cocs with high chlorine content low aromaticity and low vapor pressure due to their higher toxicity and persistence viz hchs heptachlorocyclohexanes hexachlorocyclohexenes and pentachloroxychlohexenes the concentration of each hch isomer is close to its solubility in water with a total concentration of hch of 9 07 mg l 1 as can be seen β hch is the isomer with the lowest concentration the concentration of the other non aromatic cocs heptachlorocyclohexanes hexachlorocyclohexenes and pentachloroxychlohexenes was 14 55 mg l 1 3 3 chemical reduction of cocs present in groundwater by zvim 3 3 1 batch experiments the experiments using gw were carried out in a significantly higher wzvim t vl 1 range 0 2500 g h l 1 than those corresponding to sw 0 700 g h l 1 due to the higher complexity of the aqueous matrix high number of cocs high cocs concentration possible residues of organic solvents inorganic salts etc the results in terms of cocs conversion have been classified according to the type of coc in order to facilitate the discussion of the results only cocs with a significant concentration 0 5 mg l 1 have been taken into account the conversion profiles of α ε γ and δ hch isomers are depicted in fig 4 it was not possible to represent the conversion profiles corresponding to the pcxs because these compounds had already disappeared for the minimum wzvim t vl 1 value 100 g h l 1 highlighting their great reactivity towards dechlorination when they are in contact with zvim thus a figure showing their complete conversion at 100 g h l 1 has been included as an inset in fig 4 the reactivity order of hch isomers towards dechlorination in the gw was maintained with respect to the obtained when they were dissolved in sw see fig 1 on the other side the degradation rate of these compounds increased in the case of the gw the co existence of common ions in solution such as hco3 641 mg l 1 and cl 510 mg l 1 could promote the dechlorination process as was previously found for lindane reduction with zvim 40 when dealing with gw lindane was once again the isomer with the highest degradation rate δ hch determined the required value of wzvim t vl 1 to achieve the complete hch removal degradation rate γ hch α hch ε hch δ hch it should be noted that all hch isomers and their hydrolyzed byproducts pcxs were completely eliminated when working with wzvim t vl 1 values above 2000 g h l 1 as well as pentachlorocyclohexenes heptachlorocyclohexanes 3 isomers and hexachlorocyclohexenes 4 isomers resulted to be also very reactive compounds towards dechlorination and they were completely degraded at 100 g h l 1 data not shown to the best of our knowledge the reduction of these cocs is reported for the first time the chloride balance couldn t be accomplished in this case due to the high content of chloride in the starting gw 510 mg l 1 nevertheless an increase in the concentration of this anion was observed at the end of the experiment as a result of dechlorination reactions in the same way benzene concentration increased with the wzvim t vl 1 ratio although its quantification could not be carried out due to its high volatility 41 no other chlorinated compounds that those initially present in the gw were detected during the dechlorination of these cocs and therefore it is assumed that dechlorination reactions of these compounds are very fast with benzene and chloride as the final reduction products as occurs with hchs 39 in a previous work it was demonstrated that the preferable degradation route of lindane in the presence of zvim is the dechloroelimination loss of 2 cl also known as β elimination 43 owing to the electron exchange between hch molecule and zvi 39 thus lindane degradation involves three consecutive dechloroelimination steps the pollutant is firstly dechlorinated to form tecch which is successively degraded to 3 4 dichlorocyclohexadiene dcchd and then finally reduced to benzene it should be noted that tecch and dcchd are highly reactive transient intermediates and therefore they are rapidly reduced to benzene based on the obtained results very rapid elimination of non aromatic cocs and the literature studies it is expected that the hpcxs hcxs and pcxs follow also the β elimination dechlorination pathway fig 5 collects the conversion profiles of the most representative chlorobenzenes present in the gw cb dcbs tcbs vs wzvim t vl 1 these compounds have been grouped by families according to the number of chlorines similar conversion profiles have been obtained for the different isomers of each family as can be seen the complete elimination of chlorobenzenes was not achieved under the operating conditions used room temperature 2500 g h l 1 this fact highlights the greater refractoriness of these compounds towards zvim reduction with respect to the non aromatic cocs hchs pcxs hcxs and hpcxs as was previously reported 38 aromatic chlorinated compounds are dechlorinated via hydrogenolysis 43 45 whereby a carbon chlorine single bond is cleaved by hydrogen in solution the hydrogenolysis pathway is slower than dechloroelimination and less chlorinated intermediates are produced and subsequently degraded thus the dechlorination of a given chlorobenzene results in the sequential formation and subsequent degradation of chlorobenzenes with decreasing number of chlorines 26 46 47 for example the dechlorination of hexachlorobenzene would lead to the progressive generation of pcbs ttcbs tcbs dcbs cb and eventually benzene thus the concentration of dcbs at a given wzvim t vl 1 value is determined not only by their initial concentrations and degradation rates but also by the generation rates of dcbs from tcbs dechlorination and therefore by the initial concentrations of tcbs and their degradation rates the same occurs in the case of cb taking into account this scheme of reactions in series a plateau or even a maximum in the concentration of intermediate compounds dcbs and cb could be expected however since the initial concentration of cb 38 21 mg l 1 is considerably higher than that of dcbs 10 03 mg l 1 and much greater than the corresponding to tcbs 3 61 mg l 1 the generation of dcbs from tcbs is negligible compared to its degradation to cb and therefore a maximum in the concentration of this compound or a minimum in its conversion was not appreciated at the reaction conditions tested this same reasoning would explain the behavior observed for cb hence the dechlorination of chlorobenzenes in gw follows a complex series and parallel scheme of reactions in order to describe this phenomenon in detail namely knowing the degradation rate of each compound k w j eq 1 and thus the dependence of the dechlorination degree on the chlorines number of the starting molecule it would be necessary to study the dechlorination of each compound individually conversion of chlorobenzenes slightly increased with the chlorine content of the starting compound achieving conversions of cb dcbs and tcbs of 65 67 and 72 respectively at 2500 g h l 1 according to the literature the specificity of dehalogenation is dependent on the position and number of halogens on the aromatic ring generally higher halogenated compounds tend to be more readily dehalogenated than their lesser halogenated congeners 48 as occurs in the reduction of chlorinated methanes by zvi nanoparticles 49 this aspect is interesting from a practical point of view since chlorobenzenes with low chlorination degree are generally less toxic than the highly substituted ones 26 for example the values of the half maximal effective concentration ec50 of hcb pcb ttcb tcb and dcb for diatom cyclotella meneghiniana were 2 8 1390 2830 and 23 330 μg l 1 respectively 50 furthermore these low chlorinated chlorobenzenes can be more easily biodegraded or photo degraded in the environment 26 summarizing most of cocs initially present in the gw were readily and efficiently degraded by zvim hchs and derived non aromatic cocs with high chlorine content 5 pcxs hcxs and hpcxs were completely degraded via dechloroelimination only tcbs 0 72 mg l 1 dcbs 3 31 mg l 1 and cb 15 20 mg l 1 were detected in the final effluent the gc fid chromatogram obtained at the end of the experiment 2500 g h l 1 is shown in fig 3 treated gw as observed the chromatographic peaks corresponding to pcxs hcxs and hpcxs disappeared whereas those corresponding to tcbs dcbs and cb were significantly reduced the main signals of this chromatogram correspond to the istds used and benzene which area is greatly increased respect to that of the starting gw the permanence of chlorobenzenes with low chlorine number cb dcbs and tcbs in the aqueous phase after the reduction treatment is much less worrisome than that of the hchs pcxs hcxs and hpcxs chlorobenzenes have a much higher vapor pressure than hchs between 3 and 6 orders of magnitude table 3 meaning that their persistence in the environment is much lower moreover their higher vapor pressures suggest that these compounds could be easily removed by soil vapor extraction otherwise the maximum contaminant level mcl level of protection based on the best available science to prevent potential health problems which gives us an idea of the dangerousness of a determined compound of these compounds in drinking water is between 2 and 3 orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding one to hchs table 3 51 as example the mcl value is 500 3000 and 350 times higher for cb 1 2 cb and 1 2 4 tcb than for lindane 0 0002 mg l 1 3 3 2 continuous column experiments as discussed in the introduction section the implementation of a technology for the degradation of hchs and other cocs in gw as the case of bailin s landfill usually requires an in situ treatment thereby to get a more realistic approach of the process and study the performance of zvim as prbs or directly injected into the subsurface to decontaminate the polluted groundwater plume several experiments have been carried out in continuous mode thus the gw was pumped through the column filled with soil from bailin s landfill and zvim using different ratios of zvim weights to aqueous flow rate wzvim ql 1 0 2500 g h l 1 the results here obtained run 9 in situ treatment in terms of cocs conversion have been compared to those corresponding to the treatment of gw in batch conditions run 8 on site treatment and those previously obtained working with sw run 5 at 500 and 2500 g h l 1 fig 6 the efficiency of the reduction treatment with zvim increased with the chlorine content of the coc and decreased with its aromaticity obtaining the following order of reactivity grouped by families when appropriate cb dcb tcb β hch δ hch ε hch α hch γ hch pcxs hcxs hpcxs in general terms similar conversion values were obtained regardless of the initial cocs concentration and the applied treatment in situ or on site this fact indicates that the reaction order m in eq 1 is close to unity m 1 therefore not only lindane γ hch follows first order kinetics with respect to the pollutant concentration 40 but also the other hch isomers moreover the presence of soil from the landfill does not affect the efficiency of the reduction process therefore it can be concluded that laboratory results can be used to design the application of zvim at field scale for their use as pbr or directly injected into the subsurface thus reduction with zvim can be considered a cost effective treatment due to i the economic price of iron microparticles ii its high availability and iii durability 27 52 53 iv the low operation and maintenance costs associated to its use 54 as well as v the high environmental risk associated to the cocs treated for the superficial waters in the nearby 4 conclusions a gw coming from

isomers of heptachlorocyclohexane and 5 isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane α β ε δ and γ hch resulting in a final cocs concentration of 93 3 mg l 1 cocs were progressive dechlorinated in the presence of zvim obtaining benzene and chloride as end products no other chlorinated or aromatic byproducts were detected the efficiency of the reduction treatment generally increased with the chlorine content of the starting pollutant obtaining the following reactivity order cb dcb tcb β hch δ hch ε hch α hch γ hch pcxs hcxs hpcxs pcxs and hcxs coming from hchs and hpcxs hydrolysis respectively as well as

efficient technique for the removal of recalcitrant and toxic chlorinated organic compounds cocs dissolved in groundwater groundwater was obtained from bailin s landfill sabiñanigo spain where liquid and solid wastes of an old lindane factory were uncontrollably dumped during decades 28 cocs were identified and quantified by gas chromatographic analysis five isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane α β ε γ δ hch benzene 10 chlorobenzenes and 12 cyclic non aromatic organochlorine compounds σcocs 93 mg l 1 batch wise and column experiments were carried out using soil and groundwater from the polluted landfill it was found that the dechlorination rate increases with the chlorine content of the organic molecule non aromatic cocs with high chlorine content from 5 to 7 atoms as well as hchs were very rapidly eliminated in the presence of zvim via dechloroelimination while conversions from 60 to 80 were obtained for chlorobenzenes at the end of the treatment the last ones dechlorinated via hydrogenolysis it has been proved that zvim appears as an efficient stable and cost effective treatment for cocs reduction and the results obtained in the laboratory can be used at full scale therefore it was concluded that zvim can be used for the on site treatment of the pumped groundwater and also for the in situ treatment as permeable reactive barriers prbs of the groundwater leading to the complete degradation of the most toxic cocs those with higher chlorine content less aromaticity and lower vapor pressure keywords lindane cocs chlorobenzenes zero valent iron iscr 1 introduction lindane γ hexachlorocyclohexane or γ hch is a very effective pesticide produced on a worldwide scale between 1945 and 1980 and extensively used for agricultural purposes during this period 1 2 however due to its high toxicity and persistence in the environment the use of this chemical was very controversial regarding its effects on human health it is known to harm the nervous system and suspected to be a carcinogen and teratogen 3 additionally concerning the environment lindane has a great large lifetime and can be transported over long distances being accumulated in the food chain 4 6 therefore it has been included in the list of persistent organic pollutants pops in the stockholm convention 7 and consequently banned in the countries that signed this agreement unfortunately although the use of lindane as a pesticide has been phased out in most countries it is still easily detected in agricultural soils 8 moreover large accumulations of this pesticide and its wastes a mixture of hch isomers mainly α hch β hch δ hch γ hch and ε hch different chlorobenzenes coming from chlorination failed reactions and organic solvents used in the purification process of lindane can be found in the surroundings of the pesticide production sites 2 9 10 this is the case of sabiñánigo 11 12 a small industrial city located in the north of spain where inquinosa a lindane manufacturing company operated from 1975 to 1988 as a result of poor waste management approximately 115 000 to 160 000 tonnes of hchs waste were uncontrollably dumped in two unlined landfills located in sardas and bailín both in the vicinity of the former production site 13 polluting the groundwater with a high risk of contamination of the gállego river 14 dioxins and furans formation has been recently identified in the landfills which has been associated with these wastes 15 besides a dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl of very high toxicity coming from the residue of incomplete chlorination reactions and distillation tails was detected at very variable depths in the landfill subsurface 11 the dnapl migrates through the fissures of a vertical sandstone bed generating a groundwater plume the polluting capacity of this phase is enormous it is estimated that 1 l of dnapl ρ 1 5 1 8 kg l 1 can potentially contaminate 1 000 000 m3 of groundwater the main cocs detected in the dnapl and therefore in the associated groundwater were pentachlorocyclohexenes hch isomers chlorobenzene trichlorobenzenes and tetrachlorobenzenes 11 16 nowadays sabiñánigo is considered the most serious case of soil contamination in spain and one of the most important in the world 11 12 the removal of lindane in aqueous medium has been addressed by using several alternatives as biological technologies 17 18 different advanced oxidation processes aops including fenton process 19 and activated persulfate 5 10 and recently advanced electrooxidation processes eaops such as electrooxidation 20 and electro fenton 21 23 an interesting and updated report about potential techniques for lindane remediation was commissioned by the european parliament s policy department for citizens rights and constitutional affairs 12 however most of the treatments collected in that document except in situ chemical oxidation isco and in situ biological remediation can be only applicable for the ex situ treatment of polluted groundwater whereas in situ remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater continuoes to be a priority in this sense chemical reduction cr of chlorinated organic compounds cocs over zero valent metals has emerged as a very promising alternative 24 27 zero valent iron zvi is the preferred metal used for this purpose since iron is the most abundant transition metal and the fourth most plentiful element in the earth crust 28 moreover it is non toxic cheap easy to produce and its reduction process requires little maintenance 27 in addition to having proven to be an efficient catalyst in oxidation treatments heterogeneous fenton 29 30 zvi is an effective reductant when reacting with oxidized contaminants standard redox potential e 0 44 v the removal mechanism of contaminants by zvi concerns the directional transfer of electrons from zvi to the contaminants transforming the latter into non toxic or less toxic species 27 therefore the use of zvi for the treatment of toxic contaminants has received wide attention and encouraging efficiencies have been documented for inorganic species such as hexavalent chromium dichromates and nitrates 31 33 as well as for a large number of cocs such as dichloroethane 34 trichloroethane 35 vinyl chloride 34 carbon tetrachloride 36 hexachlorobenzene 26 and lindane 37 among others most of them for the ex situ treatment of polluted synthetic water 26 35 37 commercial zvi microparticles zvim have been successfully tested for lindane dechlorination in previous works 38 40 hch isomers showed different behavior vs dechlorination according to the axial equatorial position of chlorines lindane was completely degraded by reductive dehalogenation obtaining benzene and chloride as final products 39 zvim showed excellent stability both in continuous and discontinuous mode and the presence of the most common salts in groundwater chlorides sulfates and carbonates seems not to affect the efficiency of the process making this technology a potential approach for the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by lindane 39 nevertheless while most studies have been focused on testing zvim for the treatment of synthetic solutions of hchs the greater potential or advantage of zvim appears to be for in situ chemical reduction iscr of contaminated soil and groundwater a first approach to deal with the treatment of groundwater coming from the bailin s landfill by zvim has been recently carried out 38 although only preliminary results were obtained it seems that hch isomers can be partially reduced aerobic conditions were set after the dechlorination treatment but the biodegradation of the remaining chlorobenzenes was not achieved 38 in order to establish the most suitable operating conditions further research is required thus the objective of the present work is to demonstrate the viability of zvim in real applications which involves particular concerns that must be addressed the competitive effect when different cocs are simultaneously present in real matrices groundwater from the polluted landfill has been studied the effect of the matrix has been analyzed by comparing the results obtained with those corresponding to the treatment of synthetic polluted water moreover in order to test the behavior of zvim in the subsurface in iscr treatments experiments feeding the groundwater to a column filled with soil from the landfill and zvim operating in continuous mode have been performed 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents synthetic contaminated water sw was prepared by dissolving standards of the hch isomers α hch β hch γ hch and δ hch all of them provided by fluka in acetone sigma aldrich 10 g l 1 and diluted in milli q water to the desired concentration solutions of 0 5 mg l 1 of each isomer and a solution containing the four hch isomers with σhchs 2 mg l 1 polluted groundwater gw was obtained from an extraction well located at bailin s landfill working standard solutions of benzene chlorobenzene 1 2 dichlorobenzene 1 3 dichlorobenzene 1 4 dichlorobenzene 1 2 3 trichlorobenzene 1 2 4 trichlorobenzene 1 2 3 4 tetrachlorobenzene 1 2 4 5 tetrachlorobenzene 1 2 3 5 tetrachlorobenzene pentachlorobenzene all of them from sigma aldrich and hch isomers α hch β hch ε hch γ hch and δ hch were prepared for their identification and quantification by gas chromatography coupled with a flame ionization and electron capture detectors cg fid ecd respectively nacl sigma aldrich was used for ion chromatography ic calibration other reagents and materials used were h2so4 fisher c3h6o na2co3 nahco3 panreac c6h14 scharlau and sio2 sigma aldrich butyl cyclohexane c10h20 and tetrachloroethane c2h2cl4 both of them from sigma aldrich were used as internal standard compounds istd all reagents were of analytical grade solutions were prepared with high purity water obtained from a millipore direct q system with resistivity 18 mω cm at 25 c 2 2 zero valent iron microparticles zvim were supplied by höganäs and directly used in dechlorination experiments zvim consist in zero state iron 99 with traces of c 0 003 o 0 12 s 0 01 p 0 008 and mn 0 18 this material was selected in a previous work among five types of commercial zvim due to its higher activity in hchs dechlorination 39 zvim present a specific surface sbet of 0 035 m2 g 1 and a particle diameter of 70 μm more detailed characterization of zvim can be found elsewhere 39 2 3 groundwater from the bailín s landfill the gw treated in the present work comes from a well close to the base of the old bailin s landfill this landfill was used by inquinosa between 1985 and 1989 to uncontrollably dispose of the generated hch wastes 11 it is estimated that 10 m3 of dnapl still remain accumulated in the fissures of the sandstone and conglomerate vertical beds of the landfill subsoil with an associated groundwater plume the gw was stored in glass bottles without gas headspace and refrigerated 4 c until its treatment 2 4 soil from the bailín s landfill the dumpsite is located on the top of an interbedded vertical sequence of sandstone and fine grained limonite layer 11 the groundwater flows through the fractures of the sandstone layer to reproduce these conditions sandstone from the landfill was used to fill the column after being milled to a size lower than 2 mm the soil organic matter som content was lower than 0 5 mineral composition was carbonates 600 g kg 1 calcium 220 g kg 1 potassium 0 96 g kg 1 magnesium 8 8 g kg 1 and iron fe3 17 g kg 1 silica and alumina complete the mineral composition of the soil data provided by the department of agriculture livestock and environment of the government of aragon the standard deviation of the analysis is less than 10 2 5 dechlorination reactions 2 5 1 batch experiments batch experiments were carried out in 10 ml gc gas chromatography glass vials with teflon caps shaken in a constant temperature bath 20 c at an equivalent stirring velocity of 100 rpm 10 ml of sw or gw at its natural ph 7 were added to the reactor containing 50 mg of zvim 5 g l 1 the concentration of zvim was selected in previous works in order to achieve the required conversion values for the hch isomers in reasonable times 39 40 it has to be point out that working with high concentrations of iron does not entail any inconvenience and decreases reaction times in order to minimize the loss of volatile compounds during reaction the headspace of the vials was eliminated experiments without zvim addition were also performed to evaluate possible changes in the composition of the sample during reaction time aqueous liquid samples were extracted from the vial through a needle separated from zvim by filtration 0 45 μm nylon filter extracted with n hexane and immediately analyzed in order to follow the evolution of the reaction several identical vials were prepared and one vial was sacrificed for each experimental point 2 5 2 continuous column experiments continuous experiments were performed by using a teflon fixed bed reactor 20 cm length x 0 8 cm internal diameter with a zvim loading of 4 g bulk density of zvim is about 2 99 g cm 3 mixed with 14 g of soil 10 from bailín s landfill and 90 of commercial sand sigma aldrich the gw from the landfill was stored in a glass bottle submerged in a thermostated bath 15 c and it was pumped upwards through the column by a positive displacement pump simdos covering the wzvim ql 1 range of 0 2500 g h l 1 where wzvim is the mass of zero valent iron microparticles g and ql is the liquid flow of gw l h 1 once column achieved the steady state for a given flow the gw liquid flow ql was maintained during a time on stream of 1 day and no changes in the effluent composition were noticed during this period thus for each wzvim ql 1 value tested a conversion value for each individual coc was obtained after that the liquid flow rate was modified and a new experiment performed maintaining zvim in the fixed bed reactor without any treatment samples were periodically taken at the entrance and exit of the column using a three way valve through a needle extracted in n hexane and immediately analyzed during reduction experiments in continuous mode the composition of the starting gw was stable when the concentration of volatile compounds such as cb decreased ccoc j 90 ccoc j t 0 the inlet vessel was replaced with new gw considering that the degradation of cocs in the presence of zvim is a heterogeneous reaction that takes place over the microparticles surface as occurs in the case of lindane 39 the disappearance rate for each compound j cocj can be expressed by a simple power law rate model 1 r c o c j k w j c c o c j m m g c o c j g z v i m h where rcocj is the rate of cocj disappearance kwj the rate constant related to zvim mass l gzvim 1 h 1 ccocj the concentration of the compound j mg l 1 and m the reaction order with respect to cocj concentration taking into consideration the mass balance for each cocj eq 1 can be expressed as eqs 2 and 3 in discontinuous stirred batch reactor and continuous column reactor mode respectively 2 d c c o c j d w z v i m t v l r c o c j k w j c c o c j m 3 d c c o c j d w z v i m q l r c o c j k w j c c o c j m where wzvim is the mass of zero valent iron microparticles g vl and t the reactor volume l constant and reaction time h in batch experiments and ql the liquid flow of gw l h 1 in column experiments thus data obtained in batch and column experiments can be compared using the following terms g h l 1 obtained from eqs 2 and 3 4 w z v i m t v l b a t c h w z v i m q l c o l u m n all the dechlorination experiments were performed by duplicate the standard deviation being always less than 10 table 1 summarizes the dechlorination runs carried out both in batch and column experiments with the corresponding wzvim t vl 1 or wzvim ql 1 range as well as the main variables for each experiment type of polluted water sw or gw type of coc coc concentration and number of uses of zvim where applicable 2 6 analytical methods the identification of cocs in the starting gw was carried out by gas chromatography coupled with a mass spectrometric detector gc ms as described elsewhere 16 where the identification and quantification of cocs present in different dnapl samples obtained at sabiñanigo s landfills were carried out for this purpose a gas chromatograph agilent 6890 n with an hp5973 mass spectrometric detector was used the chromatograph was equipped with an hp 5 ms column 30 m 0 25 mm i d 5 phenol methyl siloxane and a ctc combypal sampler once identified hch isomers as well as other chlorinated compounds were quantified by gas chromatography coupled with a flame ionization detector fid and an electron capture detector ecd 16 the column hp 5 ms exit was split to both detectors fid and ecd and simultaneously measured helium was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 2 8 ml min 1 the gc injection port temperature was set at 180 c the injection volume was 2 μl the program temperature started at 80 c followed by a temperature ramp of 10 c min 1 to 310 c and then held constant for 1 min prior to analyses water samples were extracted with the same mass of n hexane liquid liquid extraction in order to minimize experimental errors in cocs quantification butyl cyclohexane and tetrachloroethane were added to the extracted samples as internal standard compounds istds for the fid and ecd analyses respectively cocs calibration in the range 0 025 20 mg l 1 was previously performed by dissolving standards of commercial cocs directly in n hexane gc fid response factors used for cocs without commercial standards available such as pentachlorocyclohexenes coming from hchs hydrolysis heptachlorocyclohexenes and hexachlorocyclohexenes coming from heptachlorocyclohexenes hydrolysis were obtained of other commercial compounds with similar chemical structure and number of chlorines the presence of other chlorinated compounds at a significant amount both in the starting gw and in the samples obtained during the reduction treatment was discarded by gc ecd analyses benzene in the water samples after reaction could not be properly quantified due to its high volatility 41 no other non chlorinated compounds were detected by gc fid in the case of sw the dechlorination degree was also evaluated in terms of chlorides released to the liquid phase which were quantified by ic metrohm 761 compact ic with anionic chemical suppression using a conductivity detector a metrosep a supp5 5 250 column 25 cm length 4 mm diameter was used as stationary phase and 0 7 ml min 1 of an aqueous solution 3 2 mm of na2co3 and 1 mm of nahco3 as the mobile phase sample injection 250 μl included an online filtering system 0 45 μm 3 results and discussion 3 1 preliminary results effect of water composition and zvim stability the conversion x profiles of the main hch isomers vs wzvim t vl 1 in sw when these compounds are individually treated runs 1 4 and when they are mixed run 5 data extracted from a previous work 39 are collected in fig 1 a control experiment without zvim was also performed obtaining negligible changes in hchs concentration during reaction time data not shown therefore hchs volatilization or adsorption over the walls and the cap of the reactor were discarded as can be seen in fig 1 hch isomers were progressively degraded by zvim with reaction time as a result of a surface mediated reaction which is in agreement with that previously reported in the literature 41 42 these compounds are adsorbed over the zero valent iron surface which donates electrons to their reductive dechlorination the disappearance rate of each hch was not affected by the presence of other hch isomers in solution obtaining very similar profiles when the isomers were treated individually hch 0 5 mg l 1 or mixed σhch 2 mg l 1 therefore there was not a competitive effect between these compounds independent reactions probably because the reducing agent zvim is in great excess respect to the organic compounds as demonstrated in a previous work hch isomers reactivity depends on the chlorines position and it may be also related to the different water solubility of these compounds thus the following activity order γ hch α hch δ hch β hch was obtained 39 otherwise the chloride balance calculated as the concentration of cl released to the bulk respect to the total chlorine content of the starting sample according to the stoichiometry of the reduction reaction eq 5 was quite well accomplished 90 at the end of the experiments from 0 3 to 0 35 and 1 35 mg l 1 of cl were measured in runs 1 4 and 5 when the initial concentration of chlorine was 0 37 and 1 46 mg l 1 respectively 5 c6h6cl6 3 fe0 c6h6 3 fe2 6 cl the stability and reusability of zvim were thoroughly studied in a previous work dealing with the treatment of synthetic water contaminated with lindane 39 firstly identical conversion profiles of lindane were obtained three consecutive reaction cycles secondly to have a more realistic approach of the process and simulate the performance of zvim into the subsurface the stability of zvim was also corroborated in continuous mode 70 of lindane conversion working at a ratio wzvim ql 1 167 g h l 1 during a time on stream 10 days moreover a constant value for chlorine concentration was always obtained to check the stability of zvim when a mixture of hch is treated three consecutive reaction cycles were carried out in the present work runs 5 7 after each experiment zvi microparticles were separated by filtration oven dried at 60 c for 24 h and reused in a new cycle without any treatment after the third cycle above 95 of the initial zvim mass was recovered the conversion of each hch isomer obtained at 360 g h l 1 is shown in fig 2 as can be seen the activity of zvim remained unaltered during the three reaction cycles regardless of the hch isomer conversions of 85 57 99 and 75 were obtained for α hch β hch γ hch and δ hch respectively as previously commented the concentration of zvim is in high excess in relation to the pollutants one in each reaction cycle only a negligible percentage of the initial fe is lost as a consequence of its oxidation to fe2 the stoichiometric concentration with respect to the chlorine content of the contaminant and therefore can be used in a new reaction cycle the characterization of zvim before and after dechlorination reactions was reported in a previous work 39 concluding that in spite of the initial changes suffered in the textural properties of zvim it appears that zvim characteristics are modified in the early stages of reaction when contact with the aqueous solution and then they remain unchanged this material shows very high stability maintaining its activity in the long term 3 2 characterization of groundwater the groundwater treated in the present work is a colorless liquid sample with an unpleasant odor and a conductivity of approx 2400 μs cm 2 t 18 c it is characterized by a neutral ph ph 7 total organic carbon toc of 254 mg l 1 and chemical oxygen demand cod of 857 mg l 1 the main inorganic species are chlorides 510 mg l 1 sulfates 33 mg l 1 and bicarbonates 641 mg l 1 as anions and calcium 346 mg l 1 magnesium 77 mg l 1 and sodium 8 mg l 1 as cations cocs present in the gw were quantified by gc fid as previously explained in the experimental section the corresponding gc fid chromatogram of a representative sample of the starting gw is shown in fig 3 starting gw cocs have been grouped by families benzene and chlorobenzenes in green heptachlorocyclohexanes and their hydrolysis products hexachlorocyclohexenes in blue and hch isomers and their hydrolysis products pentachlorocyclohexenes in red table 2 collects information about the chlorinated compounds identified in the gw the chemical formula the acronym used for each coc the acquisition time and the concentration values of each compound expressed as mg l 1 in total 28 coc compounds have been identified and quantified the sum of cocs is around 94 mg l 1 representing a toc concentration of 50 mg l 1 20 of the toc since no other chlorinated and or aromatic organic compounds could be identified by gc msd gc fid and gc ecd it is assumed that low carbon chain alcohols such as methanol organic acids acetic acid butyric acid etc and esters complete the organic matter 11 the total concentration of cocs is quite high indicating that the groundwater was highly affected by the presence of the dnapl nearby among the identified cocs special attention has to be paid in cocs with high chlorine content low aromaticity and low vapor pressure due to their higher toxicity and persistence viz hchs heptachlorocyclohexanes hexachlorocyclohexenes and pentachloroxychlohexenes the concentration of each hch isomer is close to its solubility in water with a total concentration of hch of 9 07 mg l 1 as can be seen β hch is the isomer with the lowest concentration the concentration of the other non aromatic cocs heptachlorocyclohexanes hexachlorocyclohexenes and pentachloroxychlohexenes was 14 55 mg l 1 3 3 chemical reduction of cocs present in groundwater by zvim 3 3 1 batch experiments the experiments using gw were carried out in a significantly higher wzvim t vl 1 range 0 2500 g h l 1 than those corresponding to sw 0 700 g h l 1 due to the higher complexity of the aqueous matrix high number of cocs high cocs concentration possible residues of organic solvents inorganic salts etc the results in terms of cocs conversion have been classified according to the type of coc in order to facilitate the discussion of the results only cocs with a significant concentration 0 5 mg l 1 have been taken into account the conversion profiles of α ε γ and δ hch isomers are depicted in fig 4 it was not possible to represent the conversion profiles corresponding to the pcxs because these compounds had already disappeared for the minimum wzvim t vl 1 value 100 g h l 1 highlighting their great reactivity towards dechlorination when they are in contact with zvim thus a figure showing their complete conversion at 100 g h l 1 has been included as an inset in fig 4 the reactivity order of hch isomers towards dechlorination in the gw was maintained with respect to the obtained when they were dissolved in sw see fig 1 on the other side the degradation rate of these compounds increased in the case of the gw the co existence of common ions in solution such as hco3 641 mg l 1 and cl 510 mg l 1 could promote the dechlorination process as was previously found for lindane reduction with zvim 40 when dealing with gw lindane was once again the isomer with the highest degradation rate δ hch determined the required value of wzvim t vl 1 to achieve the complete hch removal degradation rate γ hch α hch ε hch δ hch it should be noted that all hch isomers and their hydrolyzed byproducts pcxs were completely eliminated when working with wzvim t vl 1 values above 2000 g h l 1 as well as pentachlorocyclohexenes heptachlorocyclohexanes 3 isomers and hexachlorocyclohexenes 4 isomers resulted to be also very reactive compounds towards dechlorination and they were completely degraded at 100 g h l 1 data not shown to the best of our knowledge the reduction of these cocs is reported for the first time the chloride balance couldn t be accomplished in this case due to the high content of chloride in the starting gw 510 mg l 1 nevertheless an increase in the concentration of this anion was observed at the end of the experiment as a result of dechlorination reactions in the same way benzene concentration increased with the wzvim t vl 1 ratio although its quantification could not be carried out due to its high volatility 41 no other chlorinated compounds that those initially present in the gw were detected during the dechlorination of these cocs and therefore it is assumed that dechlorination reactions of these compounds are very fast with benzene and chloride as the final reduction products as occurs with hchs 39 in a previous work it was demonstrated that the preferable degradation route of lindane in the presence of zvim is the dechloroelimination loss of 2 cl also known as β elimination 43 owing to the electron exchange between hch molecule and zvi 39 thus lindane degradation involves three consecutive dechloroelimination steps the pollutant is firstly dechlorinated to form tecch which is successively degraded to 3 4 dichlorocyclohexadiene dcchd and then finally reduced to benzene it should be noted that tecch and dcchd are highly reactive transient intermediates and therefore they are rapidly reduced to benzene based on the obtained results very rapid elimination of non aromatic cocs and the literature studies it is expected that the hpcxs hcxs and pcxs follow also the β elimination dechlorination pathway fig 5 collects the conversion profiles of the most representative chlorobenzenes present in the gw cb dcbs tcbs vs wzvim t vl 1 these compounds have been grouped by families according to the number of chlorines similar conversion profiles have been obtained for the different isomers of each family as can be seen the complete elimination of chlorobenzenes was not achieved under the operating conditions used room temperature 2500 g h l 1 this fact highlights the greater refractoriness of these compounds towards zvim reduction with respect to the non aromatic cocs hchs pcxs hcxs and hpcxs as was previously reported 38 aromatic chlorinated compounds are dechlorinated via hydrogenolysis 43 45 whereby a carbon chlorine single bond is cleaved by hydrogen in solution the hydrogenolysis pathway is slower than dechloroelimination and less chlorinated intermediates are produced and subsequently degraded thus the dechlorination of a given chlorobenzene results in the sequential formation and subsequent degradation of chlorobenzenes with decreasing number of chlorines 26 46 47 for example the dechlorination of hexachlorobenzene would lead to the progressive generation of pcbs ttcbs tcbs dcbs cb and eventually benzene thus the concentration of dcbs at a given wzvim t vl 1 value is determined not only by their initial concentrations and degradation rates but also by the generation rates of dcbs from tcbs dechlorination and therefore by the initial concentrations of tcbs and their degradation rates the same occurs in the case of cb taking into account this scheme of reactions in series a plateau or even a maximum in the concentration of intermediate compounds dcbs and cb could be expected however since the initial concentration of cb 38 21 mg l 1 is considerably higher than that of dcbs 10 03 mg l 1 and much greater than the corresponding to tcbs 3 61 mg l 1 the generation of dcbs from tcbs is negligible compared to its degradation to cb and therefore a maximum in the concentration of this compound or a minimum in its conversion was not appreciated at the reaction conditions tested this same reasoning would explain the behavior observed for cb hence the dechlorination of chlorobenzenes in gw follows a complex series and parallel scheme of reactions in order to describe this phenomenon in detail namely knowing the degradation rate of each compound k w j eq 1 and thus the dependence of the dechlorination degree on the chlorines number of the starting molecule it would be necessary to study the dechlorination of each compound individually conversion of chlorobenzenes slightly increased with the chlorine content of the starting compound achieving conversions of cb dcbs and tcbs of 65 67 and 72 respectively at 2500 g h l 1 according to the literature the specificity of dehalogenation is dependent on the position and number of halogens on the aromatic ring generally higher halogenated compounds tend to be more readily dehalogenated than their lesser halogenated congeners 48 as occurs in the reduction of chlorinated methanes by zvi nanoparticles 49 this aspect is interesting from a practical point of view since chlorobenzenes with low chlorination degree are generally less toxic than the highly substituted ones 26 for example the values of the half maximal effective concentration ec50 of hcb pcb ttcb tcb and dcb for diatom cyclotella meneghiniana were 2 8 1390 2830 and 23 330 μg l 1 respectively 50 furthermore these low chlorinated chlorobenzenes can be more easily biodegraded or photo degraded in the environment 26 summarizing most of cocs initially present in the gw were readily and efficiently degraded by zvim hchs and derived non aromatic cocs with high chlorine content 5 pcxs hcxs and hpcxs were completely degraded via dechloroelimination only tcbs 0 72 mg l 1 dcbs 3 31 mg l 1 and cb 15 20 mg l 1 were detected in the final effluent the gc fid chromatogram obtained at the end of the experiment 2500 g h l 1 is shown in fig 3 treated gw as observed the chromatographic peaks corresponding to pcxs hcxs and hpcxs disappeared whereas those corresponding to tcbs dcbs and cb were significantly reduced the main signals of this chromatogram correspond to the istds used and benzene which area is greatly increased respect to that of the starting gw the permanence of chlorobenzenes with low chlorine number cb dcbs and tcbs in the aqueous phase after the reduction treatment is much less worrisome than that of the hchs pcxs hcxs and hpcxs chlorobenzenes have a much higher vapor pressure than hchs between 3 and 6 orders of magnitude table 3 meaning that their persistence in the environment is much lower moreover their higher vapor pressures suggest that these compounds could be easily removed by soil vapor extraction otherwise the maximum contaminant level mcl level of protection based on the best available science to prevent potential health problems which gives us an idea of the dangerousness of a determined compound of these compounds in drinking water is between 2 and 3 orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding one to hchs table 3 51 as example the mcl value is 500 3000 and 350 times higher for cb 1 2 cb and 1 2 4 tcb than for lindane 0 0002 mg l 1 3 3 2 continuous column experiments as discussed in the introduction section the implementation of a technology for the degradation of hchs and other cocs in gw as the case of bailin s landfill usually requires an in situ treatment thereby to get a more realistic approach of the process and study the performance of zvim as prbs or directly injected into the subsurface to decontaminate the polluted groundwater plume several experiments have been carried out in continuous mode thus the gw was pumped through the column filled with soil from bailin s landfill and zvim using different ratios of zvim weights to aqueous flow rate wzvim ql 1 0 2500 g h l 1 the results here obtained run 9 in situ treatment in terms of cocs conversion have been compared to those corresponding to the treatment of gw in batch conditions run 8 on site treatment and those previously obtained working with sw run 5 at 500 and 2500 g h l 1 fig 6 the efficiency of the reduction treatment with zvim increased with the chlorine content of the coc and decreased with its aromaticity obtaining the following order of reactivity grouped by families when appropriate cb dcb tcb β hch δ hch ε hch α hch γ hch pcxs hcxs hpcxs in general terms similar conversion values were obtained regardless of the initial cocs concentration and the applied treatment in situ or on site this fact indicates that the reaction order m in eq 1 is close to unity m 1 therefore not only lindane γ hch follows first order kinetics with respect to the pollutant concentration 40 but also the other hch isomers moreover the presence of soil from the landfill does not affect the efficiency of the reduction process therefore it can be concluded that laboratory results can be used to design the application of zvim at field scale for their use as pbr or directly injected into the subsurface thus reduction with zvim can be considered a cost effective treatment due to i the economic price of iron microparticles ii its high availability and iii durability 27 52 53 iv the low operation and maintenance costs associated to its use 54 as well as v the high environmental risk associated to the cocs treated for the superficial waters in the nearby 4 conclusions a gw coming from sabiñánigo s landfill with high content in hchs 9 mg l 1 and other cocs has been efficiently treated by chemical reduction with zvim 28 cocs have been identified in the starting gw benzene chlorobenzene 3 isomers of dichlorobenzene 3 isomers of trichlorobenzene 2 isomers of tetrachlorobenzene pentachlorobenzene 5 isomers of pentachlorocyclohexene 4 isomers of hexachlorocyclohexene 3 isomers of heptachlorocyclohexane and 5 isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane α β ε δ and γ hch resulting in a final cocs concentration of 93 3 mg l 1 cocs were progressive dechlorinated in the presence of zvim obtaining benzene and chloride as end products no other chlorinated or aromatic byproducts were detected the efficiency of the reduction treatment generally increased with the chlorine content of the starting pollutant obtaining the following reactivity order cb dcb tcb β hch δ hch ε hch α hch γ hch pcxs hcxs hpcxs pcxs and hcxs coming from hchs and hpcxs hydrolysis respectively as well as hpcxs were completely eliminated via dechloroelimination at the lowest czvim t vl 1 tested 100 g h l 1 at 2000 g h l 1 an effluent completely free of hchs and cocs with high chlorine content 5 was obtained zvim acts as a cost effective stable and efficient electron donor for the reductive dechlorination of cocs as the most toxic cocs with lowest vapor pressure values were readily removed by zvim the complete abatement of the remaining chlorobenzenes cb dcbs and tcbs could be achieved by coupling other technologies as vapor extraction or biodegradation acknowledgments the authors

14489,pharmaceutically active compounds are a real threat all around the world conventional water and wastewater treatment are not efficient in removing this kind of organic micropollutants of emerging concern advanced treatment processes seem to be a good alternative for phacs removal either in drinking water or wastewater membrane separation processes were proved to be a good treatment option since they are able to produce a high quality permeate without increasing its toxicity microfiltration ultrafiltration and membrane bioreactor can be applied to the treatment of wastewater due to the high concentration of organic matter nanofiltration and reverse osmosis are mainly applied for water treatment their rejection mechanisms and the interactions between phacs and nom or inorganic salts are well understood it is consensual that tighter nf membranes are more efficient than looser membranes reaching 99 of removal membrane distillation is a relatively new technology especially because of its robustness in dealing with a broad spectrum of pollutants however only a few studied are focused on the application of md in removing phacs from water and wastewater and few are known about the rejection mechanisms and the interaction between phacs nom inorganic salts and membrane msp specially md is a very promising technology to be applied in order to prevent public health and environmental problems caused by the release of phacs in the environment abbreviations aop advanced oxidation process dcmd direct contact membrane distillation fo forward osmosis hrt hydraulic

nanofiltration reverse osmosis mbr membrane distillation 1 introduction in recent years pharmaceutical products such as analgesics anti inflammatory drugs antibiotics lipid regulators beta blockers and x rays contrast media have become more and more a part of the daily routine life being used in human and animal for health treatment in order to improve life quality and to increase their life span worldwide this scenario is due specially to improvements in health standards which implies in a consumption increase of pharmaceutically active compounds phacs 1 phacs reach water systems from different sources such as human excretion sewage wrongful disposal landfill leachate drain water or from industries 2 although it has been reported that phacs are found in the environment at low concentration ng l to μg l range the constant production consumption and therefore discharge to the environment phacs has been raising global attention and concern over 200 different phacs were observed in surface ground water and sewage 3 4 and it is still unclear the levels and effects as well as the fate of these compounds in the human health and wildlife however it has been found their potential to cause aquatic toxicity development of resistance in pathogenic microbes genotoxicity and endocrine disruption 4 6 also the release of phacs in the environment is not regulated and covered by the existing water quality in many countries around the world 7 whether it is a developing or developed country some worldwide recognised agencies have been trying to either banish or stimulate the establishment of limits of the usage or discharge of some phacs for instance the european union water framework directive and the u s food and drug administration fda usa publicized directions for the evaluation of human drugs the presence of phacs in the environment and their impact on human and wildlife health may be far more extent than it is reported since the analytical methods for the quantification and monitoring of these compounds so as to understand and determine their fate and behaviour within the environment are expensive complicated and time consuming which may compromise the knowledge of the full extent of phacs impact a large spectrum of pollutants from industrial domestic and farming activities arrives diluted in water in conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps their main goal is to remove organic matter and nutrients from the effluent in the order of g l to mg l thus the complete removal of phacs during conventional wwtp is quite a challenge due to several factors such as low volatility different hydrophobicity complex structures extremely low concentration influencing the microorganisms interaction with other solutes and the separation medium membrane sludge etc 8 since they are not completely eliminated during treatment processes and complex outlets may be formed phacs are discharged into waterbodies 9 according to archer et al 2 the concentration of some phacs in the effluent has increased during the treatment in wwtps if compared with the influent as a consequence of their transformation into conjugates it has been reported that some phacs are persistent throughout the drinking water treatment process mostly due to the phacs small size and polarity which makes them highly soluble in water and very mobile in the environment and extremely difficult to remove by conventional treatment 10 11 thus phacs can return to human body through water cycle and food chain which may potentiate human health risks 12 in face of such limitations associated with conventional treatment processes the demand to achieve phacs removal have led to explore alternatives technologies among them can be highlighted membrane separation processes msp due to their high efficiency in removing organic matter salts metal and therefore phacs and other emerging contaminants 13 15 despite their high efficiency in removing compounds even in trace concentration a major drawback is that filtration processes are basically designed to concentrate but not to degrade pollutants and require the disposal of wastes stream and since the rejection of phacs depends on the concentration of them in the feed stream if it increases the efficiency in the removal of pharmaceutically active compounds by the membrane may decrease reducing the overall efficiency thus the concentrate generated in one of the msp applications requires further treatment in order to breakdown phacs molecules and eliminate the threat increasing its efficiency thus this paper reviews the potentials and challenges of the removal of phacs from water and wastewater by membrane separation processes the treatment options for membrane concentrate rich in phacs and future prospects several review papers were published about removal of phacs contaminants through membrane however a general overview of the application and the rejection of phacs including all membrane separations processes as well as membrane distillation is still needed thus a research on scopus was done in order to rise how many studies have been carried out in the last decade 2008 2018 about the subject using the key words phacs pharmaceutically active compounds microfiltration ultrafiltration microbioreactor nanofiltration reverse osmosis and membrane distillation it was found 78 published papers on the subject the majority of the studies are focused on the application of nf and ro fig 1 therefore it was selected papers published no earlier than 2000 2 membrane separation processes msp toward phacs removal from water and wastewater membrane separation processes msp have become an important alternative to produce good quality water reaching the drinking water standards due to their higher removal rate of low mw organic pollutants minimizing the risk associated with the source and its contaminants as well as its modularity and ability to integrate with other systems microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf and membrane bioreactor mbr which is the association of mf or uf with biological treatment are mainly applied to the treatment of raw effluent 16 18 and nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro as a polishing step in order to produce water for reuse nf ro and membrane distillation md can also be considered as advanced treatment which generates water with high quality 13 14 19 it has been reported that membranes have three mechanisms of removing micropollutants which is either by size exclusion electrostatic repulsion or adsorption 11 20 21 thus the prediction of the phacs removal efficiency is quite difficult because it is dependent on physico chemical properties of the compound membrane properties such as pore size molecular weight cut off and zeta potential membrane solute interactions and also influent matrix 4 2 1 mf and uf membranes although the application and operation of mf and uf is relatively simple fig 2 if compared to other msps since it uses lower transmembrane pressure the application of microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf technology is limited to their pores size and molecular weight cutoff mwco which is larger than the molecular weight mw of most phacs mwco ranging from 1 to 200 kda for mf and uf this factor plays a major role in the rejection of phacs considering that mf and uf technology is based on the separation mainly associated with the size difference also associated with the high solubility of pharmaceutical compounds the mf and uf efficiency is considered very little or none in removing dissolved solutes in the aquatic media table 1 yoon et al 22 evaluated the interactions between phacs and uf membrane which membrane had a molecular weight cut off value of 100 kda and the investigated pharmaceuticals had a molecular weight less than 0 4 kg mol 0 4 kda the uf membrane was not able to block phacs passage similar results can be observed in the study conducted by snyder et al 18 besides size exclusion membrane surface adsorption is another one of the major mechanisms for uf to remove dissolved pollutants the pharmaceutical adsorption on the membrane surface is related to the log kow value when this value is low usually log kow 2 8 pharmaceuticals have low lipophilicity and high hydrophilicity which indicates that these contaminants are not likely to be adsorbed on the membrane surface and therefore pass through the membrane barrier with the permeate 22 24 however on the other hand when pharmaceuticals have high log kow usually log kow 2 8 the opposite effect is obtained being these compounds likely to be adsorbed on membrane surfaces 22 24 this result agrees with those obtained in an experimental work developed by fernández et al 24 which assessed the interactions between phacs and a uf membrane this study showed a high membrane retention for carbamazepine 70 gemfibrozil 51 and metoprolol 39 in contrast although several other compounds including diclofenac ibuprofen and naproxen also have relatively high log kow values table 1 both the retention and adsorption caused by the membrane were almost negligible this is presumably due to the hydrophobicity of these compounds that may reduce once they are deprotonated similar results were obtained by yoon et al 22 for these reasons mf and uf processes are mostly employed as pretreatment to remove colloids and natural organic matter nom 18 according to garcia ivars et al 16 who assessed the performance of ceramic uf membrane on the treatment of wwtp secondary effluent in order to remove phacs have found that during the filtration experiments it is formed a foulant layer by adsorbed organic and inorganic compounds onto the ceramic uf membrane which might act as a second barrier for separation and increases the efficiency of the process the fouling layer formed on the membrane surface is characterized by its hydrophobicity and negatively charged particles on the surface this reduces both the porosity and pore size of the ceramic membrane mainly because both complete and intermediate pore blocking occurred during the first stages of the filtration 25 as a result the rejection of some phacs are improved compared to those obtained for cleaner membranes 16 also applying uf membrane to the treatment of rich organic matter om effluents can be even more improved assuming that phacs can be associated with om in the effluent and led to form complexes that could be the result of hydrogen bonding and electrostatic attraction between the polar moieties of phac molecules and the phenolic or carboxylic groups of the humic like substances these complexes are rejected by sieving effect or charge repulsion between them and the membrane surface 16 still phacs polarity and hydrophobicity as well as the membrane nominal pore size retention values were found to be higher for membrane with smaller mwco 16 play a major role in phacs rejection 2 2 membrane bioreactors mbrs membrane bioreactors comprise the association of aerobic anoxic or anaerobic biological treatment processes and a low pressure membrane such as mf or uf according to fig 3 although the number of bioreactors that integrate the biological process to forward osmosis and membrane distillation processes is increasing the membrane acts as a physical hindrance to contain microorganisms replacing the secondary settling tank reducing the sludge production and increasing the global efficiency of the two separated processes in the removal of micro pollutant producing a permeate with negligible presence of suspended solids this is the only msp which is able to degrade and not concentrate the compounds according to tiwari et al 26 the application of mbr technology in hospital wastewater treatment has become a common practice in the previous decades although mf and uf are porous membranes the integration of the membrane and the biological reactor propitiates the increase in the sludge retention time srt implicating in the rise of the efficiency in removing phacs it reflects in the better conditions for the growth of specialized microbial community efficient in micropollutant biodegradation which lead to the higher removal rate of these compounds 26 according to dawas massalha et al 27 high nitrifying activity increases the degradation of pharmaceutical residues which is enhanced by mbrs by providing a higher srt as the nitrification rate increases the ph of the mbr system tends to decrease in this way it was verified that for the ph of 6 the degradation of ibuprofen reached 90 when evaluating ketoprofen a degradation of up to 70 in mbr was observed when the ph reached values below 5 28 de gusseme et al 29 reported 99 removal of 17β ethinylestradiol in nitrifier enriched biomass of mbr snyder et al 18 when studying the role of msp in treating raw primary secondary and tertiary effluent demonstrated that when applying mbr in order to treat primary effluent concentrations of caffeine acetaminophen sulfamethoxazole carbamazepine and gemfibrozil decreased with removal efficiencies varying between 99 1 sulfamethoxazole and 99 9 acetaminophen radjenovic et al 17 found no elimination of gemfibrozil by the conventional activated sludge treatment whereas the mbr was able to eliminate 30 40 of this compound once more it was observed higher removal efficiencies by the mbr technology 81 than by the conventional activated sludge 75 of sulfamethoxazole kimura et al 30 when comparing the efficiency of mbr and the conventional activated sludge concluded that mbr system showed higher removal of ketoprofen and naproxen whereas it was not observed any significant difference in removal efficiency of clofibric acid ibuprofen diclofenac and mefenamic acid in cas and mbr the persistence and low removal of phacs in the effluent of both treatment systems could be due to the presence of the aromatic ring or chlorine group in their structure mbr system is remarkably more efficient according to table 2 when compared to conventional activated sludge treatment 26 for the removal of persistent micro pollutant in a such a small concentration especially for those compounds that are not readily degradable due to the possibility of growth of more specialized biomass in degrading those compounds as already stated srt is one of the most important parameters influencing the removal of phacs in biological treatment systems which includes mbr from table 2 it is possible to note that it significantly affects the removal rates of diclofenac ketoprofen gemfibrozil trimethoprim and erythromycin many studies have been carried out assessing the influence of srt on the efficiency rate of removal of phacs for instance bernhard et al 31 noted that by increasing the srt from 20 days to 62 days the removal rate of diclofenac improved from 8 to 59 also kimura et al proved that the mbr with longer srt of 65 days had better performance than the mbr with a shorter srt of 15 days so that the removal rates of ketoprofen and diclofenac improved from 82 to 98 and from 50 to 82 respectively 30 corroborating with these results maeng et al found that when srt was increased from 20 to 80 days the removal rates of gemfibrozil and ketoprofen improved from 41 to 88 and from 64 to 90 respectively 32 one of the most important characteristics associated with mbr treatment is the possibility of slow growth of nitrifying microorganisms within a reactor with biomass already established as well as a community more specific in degrading a certain type of pollutant and also the retention capacity of hydrophobic compounds these characteristics make mbr a powerful technique for treating domestic effluents 33 many studies 17 31 34 observed that with high srt mbr process had a better removal of polar compounds such as diclofenac sulfophenyl carboxylate and mecoprop as well as hormones like estrogen the degradation efficiency of pharmaceuticals compounds in mbr is more pronounced than the efficiency of cas for like diclofenac metoprolol and clofibric acid was 87 4 58 7 and 71 8 respectively in mbr whereas in cas process only 50 for diclofenac and 27 for clofibric acid 17 however a few studies have shown that increasing srt had no significant impact on the increase of removal of some phacs such as ibuprofen bezafibrate naproxen carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole 35 for example tambosi et al observed that by increasing the srt from 15 to 30 days the degradation rate of naproxen remained in the range of 85 90 36 this shows that 15 days of srt is already enough for its removal similar behaviour was observed for sulfamethoxazole and its metabolites while srt changed from 16 to 81 days 37 this may occur due to the hydrophilic nature of the compound log kow 1 with two ionizable amine groups as a result in an aqueous solution sulfamethoxazole can be present in positive neutral and negative forms these physicochemical properties give an indication that in the mbr system studied by tambosi et al 36 ph 7 2 the sludge adsorption mechanism played a negligible role due to electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged groups of the compound and the negatively charged surfaces of the sludge therefore biodegradation can be considered as the main mechanism responsible for the removal however this process will be hindered by the antibacterial properties of this compound also carbamazepine was shown to be resistant to biodegradation regardless of increasing srt 32 another important parameter is the hydraulic retention time hrt which is related to the useful volume of the reactor and consequently has an impact directly proportional to capital and operating costs however some studies indicate that hrt has no significant effect on the removal of phacs reif et al 38 evaluated the removal of ibuprofen naproxen and erythromycin and noted that the increase in hrt did not affect the rate of removal of these compounds as well as the mbr permeate quality in addition from the reading of table 2 comparing the results of different researchers hrt had no effect on the removal of acetaminophen bezafibrate ofloxacin gemfibrozil and metronidazole however the reduction of hrt may increase membrane fouling 39 ph is an important parameter in the degradation of phacs since reducing the ph can increase the hydrophobicity of the ionizable compounds and subsequently improve their adsorption capacity to the sludge particles this implies that a time available for biodegradation is increased and consequently the rates of removal however this behaviour should be applied to ionizable compounds with no change in the rate of removal of non ionizable compounds at ph variation expected tadkaew et al 28 did not observe a significant increase in the removal of ionizable diclofenac ibuprofen sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine that are non ionizable compounds 28 in the study conducted by tadkaew et al 28 which evaluated the ketoprofen compound that is ionizable it was observed a higher removal rate at ph 9 and ph 5 than ph 7 similar there are reports that there point to the sorption of hydrophilic antibiotics in the sludge which is expected to occur 40 kim et al 41 investigated the removal of pharmaceutical products in mbr and reported that sorption processes were the major mechanism of antibiotics removal such as tetracycline norfloxacin ciprofloxacin while azithromycin and sulfamethoxazole were removed by degradation the difference in the findings between the studies of kim et al 41 and tambosi et al 36 for the same phac when sorption is concern may be associated with the microorganism culture applied as well as different conditions of temperature and ph for the temperature it is expected that with its increase also occurs the increase in the biodegration of the compounds by the increase in the metabolic activity in addition to influence the mechanism of sorption since these compounds are expected to be stable to a wide facade of temperature variation hai et al 42 studied the effect of temperature variation on the removal of micropollutants and noted that the removal of most of the hydrophobic compounds was stable in the temperature range of 10 35 c but the removal of less hydrophobic micropollutants log d 3 2 were significantly influenced by the temperature variation below and above 20 c as above listed physicochemical properties such as solubility volatility photo degradation and biodegradability of phacs pollutants associated with the wwtp operational parameters like srt hydraulic retention time hrt ph and temperature play a crucial role in controlling the fate and removal efficiency of target pollutants in the wastewater pharmaceutical pollutant with high sorption potential has higher removal rate than the compounds with low sorption potential thus mbrs can effectively eliminate hydrophobic and readily biodegradable compounds and they are less effective in removal of hydrophilic and biologically persistent materials 40 43 phacs typically either because of their complex structure characteristics or toxic effects render the wide variety of microorganisms bacteria and fungi applied in conventional sewage treatment systems not efficiently sufficient in the degradation of some phacs 44 for example carbamazepine and diclofenac removal rates are 13 8 and 15 respectively 45 46 in this way some studies are already being done in order to find new groups of microorganisms that are able to efficiently oxidize these compounds white rot fungi and their unique extracellular enzymes termed lignin peroxidase manganese peroxidase and laccase are known to play an important role in the ecosystem by the degradation of lignin some studies have evaluated the application of these enzymes to the elimination of phacs such as diclofenac naproxen and ketoprofen by these fungi 47 49 nguyen et al 46 investigated the efficiency of a mixed culture of bacteria and fungi of white rot in the removal of organic contaminants in the mbr system and noted that this system can achieve a better removal than a system containing only fungi or bacteria removal rates were increased from 15 to 50 for diclofenac and from 65 to 94 for ketoprofen 46 yang et al 50 investigated a fungal mbr inoculated with white rot fungus trametes versicolor and operated in non sterile conditions more than 55 removal of diclofenac was achieved 50 zhang and geiben 49 analysed the removal of phacs under non sterile conditions using t versicolor and reported the high removal rate 60 80 for carbamazepine unobserved results in mbr operated with bacteria it has been observed that sufficient nutrient supply is crucial for effective removal 49 still applying the fungus t versicolor jelic et al 50 mg l the removal rate is 61 while at a higher concentration 9 mg l the removal rate may reach 94 51 hata et al found that repeated treatments of carbamazepine with laccase in the presence of the redox mediator 1 hydroxybenzotriazole hbt may increase the rate of removal from 22 to 60 52 in addition murugesan et al confirmed that the presence of hbt may increase the rate of triclosan removal from 56 to 90 53 it is possible to notice that the mbr systems do not present regular results regarding the removal of phacs this behaviour may be associated with structural complexity of phacs and also their side effects under different species of microorganisms from table 2 it is possible to state that mbrs remove acetaminophen ibuprofen ketoprofen gemfibrozil bezafibrate and naproxen efficiently 90 while carbamazepine and diclofenac removal rates are low 40 for other compounds removal rates are in the mid range 40 70 or sometimes there is insufficient data for judgment 2 3 nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro processes have been demonstrating promising results on the rejection of phacs and other emerging micropollutants 13 54 tables 3 and 4 like mf and uf the schematic draw for nf and ro is quite similar fig 2 however the applied transmembrane pressure is much higher for nf and ro operation which implies in an increase in the energy consumption this is due to the membrane configuration nf and ro are denser membranes which propitiate a greater efficiency in phacs removal as well as energy requirement this also explains the majority of papers published in this subject in the last decade fig 1 unlike the reverse osmosis process nf in addition to having a greater permeate flux and being able to work at lower pressures does not promote the complete removal of ions being a preferable process to ro in cases where there is no such need since it is expected of showing effective removal organic pollutants 55 including phacs and edcs the majority of the phacs have molecular weight within 150 500 da which is in the range of the molecular weight cut off mwco for most commercial 100 2000 da 56 thus these compounds are expected to be widely retained by physical sieving if their molecular weights are larger than the membrane mwco in order to study the ability of ro membranes to retain phacs kimura et al 57 showed that membranes composed of polyamide showed better rejection than cellulose acetate membranes table 4 the results indicate that electrostatic exclusion is the predominant phenomenon in these membranes and because of this rejection of negatively charged pharmaceutical compounds was effective and exceeded 95 by ro membranes 58 59 khan et al 60 also found that the treatment with ro was the most successful in the removal of phacs ozaki and li 61 investigated the rejection of several products among them phacs by nf and ro polyamide membranes and showed that the rejection of organic compounds by ultra low pressure ro ulpro increased linearly with molecular weight and molecular weight of the compound evaluated a number of studies 54 58 59 have shown that the rejection of phacs by the nf process is governed by several mechanisms such as steric effect electrostatic repulsion hydrophobic interactions partitioning and diffusion which are highly dependent on the physico chemical properties of the feed solution ions concentration ph molecular weight molecular geometry charge hydrophobicity hydrophilicity and membrane properties such as mwco surface charge morphology porosity and hydrophobicity several types of nf membranes have already been studied and tested in the application for rejection of a large number of phacs table 4 however in general the conclusion is that nf is not always as effective a process for the removal of all evaluated phacs as one might suppose the study carried out by yoon et al 22 who used a nf membrane with a nominal mwco of 200 da the rejection ratios for 52 endocrine disrupting compounds among them several phacs both synthetic solution and real surface water ranged from 0 to more than 90 radjenović et al 62 applied a nf membrane with a nominal mwco of 200 da in a full scale potable water treatment plant this experiment showed high rejections greater than 95 of 9 out of the 12 pharmaceutical products assessed however slight rejection 50 was observed for acetaminophen gemfibrozil and mefenamic acid this was attributed to its hydrophilic behaviour and or low mw of the phacs generally low rejection is mainly encountered when nf membranes with relatively large mwco are applied which are not effective in the removal of low mw phacs nf was found to be effective in the removal of carbamazepine which is considered to be a human active indicator 63 a dependence on filtration time and the rejection ratio of phacs by nf to uncharged compounds was noted 58 64 this strongly suggests that the mechanism of adsorption of these compounds on the membrane surface directly affects the performance of the rejection membranes with less polar characteristics indicated by low dipole moment and solutions with more hydrophobic compounds indicated by high kow generally present preferentially adsorption 65 adsorption generally impairs the performance of phacs rejection after the nf membrane adsorption sites are exhausted 66 the hydrophobicity of phacs is one of the major factors influencing the performance of nf membranes the hydrophobic compounds initially have tendencies to be adsorbed onto the membrane surface layer and into the pores and diffused into their matrix 4 the higher hydrophobicity of compound the greater is its ability to be adsorbed on the membrane surface especially when the compounds are electrostatically neutral 20 the initial adsorption of the phacs on the membrane causes a high initial rejection of the compound as the adsorption occurs free active sites are occupied the membrane tends to change its charge which affects the transport of solutes to the permeate reducing its rejection capacity compared to hydrophilic compounds of the same size 67 68 after electrostatic equilibrium the next mechanisms that prevail in the rejection of phacs are size exclusion and charge repulsion 22 however in observing these mechanisms it is possible that these are overestimated since most of the studies were conducted for a short period of time 24 h in addition to using small sample volumes 10 l 58 69 70 the hydrophilic compounds otherwise remain dissolved in the aqueous phase and consequently their effective diameter may be larger taheran et al 2016 thus when the size exclusion mechanism prevails the hydrophilic compound can be rejected more effectively than the hydrophobic ones 71 the effect of hydrophobicity was more prominent for nf membranes having larger pores than those with smaller pores since the larger pores facilitate passage of the phacs to the adsorption sites in the skin layer backing layer and pores of the membrane however according to studies carried out by yoon et al 22 the phenomenon of adsorption on the nf membrane is more prominent than the uf membrane verliefde et al 11 in turn concluded that in the case of the negatively charged nf membrane the rejection of positively charged neutral charged phacs is reduced with increased hydrophobicity since these compounds have higher tendencies to adsorbed onto the membrane surface however it was concluded that there was no clear relationship between the hydrophobicity of negatively charged phacs and their rejection due to the repulsion of the charge that prevented the solutes from approaching the membrane surface 11 the ionic state of phacs will depend on the ph solution and on acidic properties of solutes thus changes in feedwater ph will significantly affect the phacs rejection by nf ro membranes by changing their ionic state of the phacs another variable which plays an important role in determining the ionic state of the compound is the value of the acid dissociation constant pka if the pka value of the solute is below the investigated ph range the solute will be negatively charged otherwise the solute will be positively charged or a neutral and positively charged solute mixture vergili 72 applied a nf membrane fm np010 in cross flow filtration equipment for the removal of three phacs carbamazepine diclofenac and ibuprofen of samples from a drinking water treatment plant using surface water this study showed that the overall rejection was approximately 31 39 for ionic diclofenac and ibuprofen and 55 61 for neutral carbamazepine the low to moderate rejection values observed for the phacs were most likely due to small molecular sizes i e mw mwco typically the surface of most nf and ro membranes are negatively charged when in contact with solutions of neutral ph due to deprotonation of their functional groups 4 therefore the charge of the phac molecules as a consequence and possible electrostatic interaction with the surface of the membrane can contribute significantly to its removal in the case of compounds having positive charges attractive forces between the solutes and the surface of the negatively charged membrane will prevail causing an increase in the solute concentration near the membrane surface and therefore results in lower rejections because it induces greater passage of the pollutants from the membrane otherwise when the compounds are negatively charged repulsive forces are predominant between the solutes and the surface of the membrane which have similar charges this implies the reduction of the solute concentration on the membrane surface and therefore generates an increase in the rejection of the phacs 17 57 73 even neutral molecules which have a high dipole moment tend to align with membrane pores due to electrostatic interactions with the membrane charge and therefore permeate more easily through the membrane 74 76 some studies have been carried out to verify the effect of the electrostatic interactions between the membrane and the compound nghiem et al 75 77 for example found this effect on nf membrane considered to be negatively charged loose when subjected to solution with ph values above 5 it was observed that the retention of ionizable phacs such as ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole increased because with the increase in the ph value of the solution as a result of the pka value caused a change in the compound charge from neutral to negative however when evaluating non ionizable phacs such as carbamazepine they were found to be relatively independent of solution chemistry 75 77 although in the study conducted by verliefde et al 68 investigated the removal of phacs using a system of negatively charged nf with small 10 and higher recovery rates 80 it was concluded that the exclusion due to the size of the particle that is the phenomena of sieving was the main mechanism for the rejection of the neutral solute however larger and smaller rejections of negatively or positively arrayed solutes were attributed to phenomena of repulsion and electrostatic attractions respectively it was also concluded that when the system is operated at a low recovery rate 10 high removal efficiencies 95 are achieved for all evaluated phacs however these efficiencies decreased when analysing a higher recovery 80 phenomena that can be attributed to the increase in the mean concentration of phacs in the feed solution as a result of internal recycling of the concentrate 68 78 bellona et al 79 evaluated the effect of surface charges fouling layers on the nf membrane on the rejection of acidic solutes and observed that the presence of calcium in feed water can reduce the surface charge of the membrane due to adsorption of ca2 in the fouling layer but the rejection of negatively charged solutes was lower only in membranes whose mwco is higher than the mw of the solutes 80 its conclusion contrasts with the results obtained by comerton et al 70 which observed a reduction in gemfibrozil removal rate mw 250 da and unchanged removal rate for acetaminophen mw 151 da using an nf membrane mwco 200 da and a ro membrane after the addition of divalent cations in the feed solution however no significant changes was observed for ro rejections 80 in addition dolar et al studied the effect of the influent matrix on rejection of phacs across the nf and ro membrane using four different water sources namely milli q water synthetic water and drug solution tap water and actual pharmaceutical wastewater and noted that the phacs rejection was higher in the synthetic solution and tap water than in milli q water due to the adsorption of ions into the membrane pores that strengthened the size exclusion effect 81 the process of retention of solutes by the membrane due to the complexity of phenomena that occur on its surface should not be considered as a simple filtration process the sieving phenomenon is not the only one to affect the transport and the convection of solutes through membranes other phenomena such as liquid absorption at the membrane solute interface and transport within the membrane can significantly influence the removal efficiency of compounds 82 in turn liquid absorption and preferential transport are influenced by other parameters such as charge repulsion and hydrophobic interaction generally the size exclusion phenomenon plays an important role in the rejection of neutral and non hydrated solutes besides being able to present high rejections i e 85 for compounds with mw greater than mwco of nf ro membranes radjenovic et al 62 evaluated the rejection of several phacs by real scale nf ro membranes in a real drinking water treatment plant it was concluded that since the mw of acetaminophen was lower than the mwco of the nf and ro membranes used and also did not present in its ionic state at neutral ph its rejection rate varied 44 8 73 not elevated however when observing diclofenac which has higher mw and negatively charged at neutral ph had the highest rejection rate however the low rejection rate of gemfibrozil despite high mw and the presence of charge repulsion effect was unexpected 62 quintanilla et al 83 concluded that the rejection of hydrophilic neutral solutes may correlate linearly with the physical characteristics of the compound such as its molar volume and molecular length however no correlation was observed between its rejections and equivalent width 83 in turn agenson et al 82 observed a better correlation between rejection and molecular width pronk et al 84 assigned the highest removal rate of some phacs to their complexation with oxalic acid uric acid amino acids and humic acid which led to an increase in their size giving rise to the possibility of sieving effect 84 kim et al 85 applied methacrylic acid ethylenediamine and succinic acid to modify the surface of the commercial nf membrane and found that methacrylic acid can increase hydrophilicity steric hindrance and negative surface charge of the membrane and therefore it is possible to increase the rejection of the ibuprofen and salicylic acid by approximately 1 however application of ethylenediamine reduced the surface charge and had a negative effect on rejection of charged phacs 85 nghiem and coleman 86 verified the effect of scaling in ro and nf membranes using synthetic solutions with hydrophobic and hydrophilic impurities in the rejection of triclosan and concluded that when applied to hydrophilic colloidal silica no change in permeate flow or rejection of triclosan was observed however hydrophobic impurities such as alginate significantly reduce flow and increase triclosan rejection 86 when applying nf or ro process in treating natural water or also treated effluent nom in natural matrices may influence the rejection of organic compounds traces by two main mechanisms fouling or interactions between the membrane surface and the feed solution compounds or interactions between solute molecules solute solute interactions 13 membrane fouling caused by the organic matter presents in the effluent results in a decrease in permeate flux throughout the filtration operation and can either increase or decrease solute rejection depending on the interaction between the membrane and the fouling layer ionic neutral hydrophobic and hydrophilic compared to clean membranes 87 this phenomenon occurs by modifying the surface characteristics of the membrane which also changes the adsorption phenomenon of organic compounds in the fouling layer 88 same trends were found by nghiem et al 89 bellona et al 79 found rejections by nf when assessing the membrane nf 270 considered a loose membrane process were markedly lower of non ionic phacs acetaminophen carbamazepine etc when previously fouled with efom this result was attributed to an increase in hydrophobicity and a decrease in surface charge being linked to the cake enhanced polarization concentration cecp phenomena 79 however when analysing the membrane nf90 considered a tight membrane the rejection of the same studied phacs was found to be relatively unaffected by efom where it was observed a decrease in hydrophobicity and an increase in surface charge 79 this is a phenomenon that is considered as the diffusion barrier of which the solute located on the surface of the membrane may suffer upon returning to the feed solution due to the presence of a porous cake layer 90 this can be responsible of the increase of organic compounds concentration and therefore promoting an alteration of membrane surface charge and by consequence its rejection agenson and urase 91 reconfirming the previous results have suggested that the adsorption and diffusion of compounds having larger mw through ro and nf membranes fouled by leachate these compounds also present higher rejections by the virgin membranes on the contrary zazouli et al 92 observed an increasing rejection for phacs with higher mw while compounds with smaller mw and with moderate polarity such as acetaminophen were found to be less rejected due to the polymeric fouling layer applying alginate as a model compound hajibabania et al 88 found that the rejections of the hydrophilic non ionic and ionic solute are negatively impacted when membranes are fouled with humic acids and even more with alginates the rejection of hydrophobic compounds was found to be not influenced by the type of studied foulants thus in addition to the type of solutes and soils the mwco of the membranes or the pore size of the membrane determines whether the scale will have a beneficial or negative influence on the rejection of phacs either through the pore restriction or cecp 63 79 as many of these studies illustrate it is clear that membrane fouling has the potential to affect rejection mechanisms of organic solutes as a result of modified electrostatic steric and hydrophobic hydrophilic solute membrane interactions 87 though reported results are difficult to generalize since the characteristics of the feed solutions and therefore the composite nature of foulants and particular interactions with each membrane type leads to a diversity of scenarios in terms of phacs rejection understanding the fouling effect requires a comprehensive characterization of the contaminated membrane and the physicochemical properties of the selected phacs 87 according to the study conducted by azais et al 87 the rejection of neutral phacs by the virgin and pre fouled membrane in the case of the nf 90 membrane was attributed to steric hindrance which explains a nearly constant rejection yield for all the compounds whatever the surface state of the membrane or the type of phacs shape and geometry and then was little influenced by the fouling the rejection by pre fouled nf 270 membrane was lower in comparison to the virgin membrane probably due to the establishment of cecp that facilitated the transport of small mw nonionic organic compounds in addition the nf 270 membrane is strongly influenced by the chemical structure of the phacs also it was observed that the geometry and charge of the compound also plays an important role in this same study azais et al 87 have also shown that solute solute interactions in the tertiary effluent matrix significantly increased the rejection of phacs especially when loose nf was used for which the association of phacs with organic macromolecule was the reason for this better rejection due to steric hindrance the second mechanism involved in drug rejection when involving a matrix composed of organic matter is through the binding of compounds several studies 13 suggest that the mechanism that promotes greater rejection is the formation of compound om complexes this is attributed to the increase in molecule size and a negative charge if compared to the compound alone it has been observed that the presence of om whether natural or from a synthetic solution increases the removal of hormone estrogens 93 and phacs 94 through solute solute interactions the formation of om compounds complexes due to the adsorption of phacs into organic macromolecules may depend on the types of solutes and macromolecules involved in the process and on their binding capability 88 in addition the calcium concentration present in the solution can influence both membrane fouling reducing permeate flow and phac retention when applied nf when the feed solution is rich in divalent cations there may be competition between these elements and phacs by active adsorption sites in organic matter to form complexes with om resulting in lower rejections of phacs 13 in particular when calcium is abundant in the solution studies have reported that the carboxylic groups of humic substances and polysaccharides are neutralized which promotes denser fouling 95 however when it exceeds a critical calcium concentration the complexation of these elements with om may also occur in the solution bulk complexation leading to aggregate formation and lower organic fouling 96 reznik et al 97 studied the seasonal effects on the rejection of carbamazepine and found that the rejection of ro membranes was not affected by seasonal change but the rejection of carbamazepine by nf membrane decreased from 92 in summer to 50 in winter they concluded that reducing the temperature can affect metabolic rate which consequently affects organic matter degradation and their interaction with solutes 97 the type of fouling the ionic state and pre treatment used in the sample strongly affects the cleaning period of the membrane the chemicals to be applied and consequently the cost of cleaning 4 in general the membranes are cleaned when a 10 15 drop in the permeate flux is observed a 10 15 increase in solute concentration in the permeate or a 15 20 drop in pressure in a vessel of pressure as a general rule the usual cleaning frequency rotates around once every four times a year and in terms of cost this operation should revolve around 5 20 of the operating costs 98 in one case study the total ro membrane cleaning costs including labor chemicals and loss of production were calculated in orange county water district s groundwater replenishment system according to data provided for a total capacity of 265 000 m3 day operated with a recovery rate of 85 the total cost of cleaning was us 15 929 which should be multiplied by the cleaning number per year 99 2 4 membrane distillation membrane distillation md is a low temperature distillation process that operates transporting water in vapour phase through a microporous and hydrophobic membrane on the distillate product side according to fig 4 this process has a theoretical 100 retention of non volatile components due to the temperature difference between the feed and distillate side only the most volatile compound typically water vaporizes passing through the pore openings at the feed membrane interface and then condenses at the distillate membrane interface direct contact membrane distillation dcmd is considered the most widely studied md system configuration due to its simple operation 102 in dcmd the feed solution is maintained at a higher temperature than the distillate thus creating a difference in vapor pressure between the feed and the distillate the membrane separates the liquid phase from the feed and distillation streams but allows the water vapor to flow freely through its dry microporous which is maintained dry due to the membrane s hydrophobicity thus it prevents wetting of the pores by the liquid or distilled feed solution in normal operational conditions since mass transfer can only occur in the gaseous phase it is possible to achieve complete rejection of all non volatile solutes such as inorganic salts and pathogenic microorganisms in addition md is less susceptible to fouling due to the absence of the need to apply a hydraulic pressure to the process execution 103 even when the fouling development is observed it occurs in a less compacted and easily removed layer 103 as a result until the present date much of the effort in md research has focused on desalination applications 102 104 it was also observed several studies that explored the application of md for food processing such as recovery of whey protein in dairy processing 105 recovery of polyphenolic antioxidants from olive oil wastewater 106 and orange juice concentration 107 separation of fermentation broth 108 as well as treatment of wastewater from the textile and petrochemical industries 109 111 and municipal reuse of water 112 113 and even radioactive wastewater 114 as md works under low temperature thus it is possible to use renewable energy as solar or any other low quality as a source of energy 102 115 given the advantages of high separation efficiency low propensity to scale and potentially low energy consumption when low heat quality is readily available the md process can be applied to a wide variety of applications besides brackish water desalination and sea water it was observed several studies that explored the application of md for food processing such as recovery of whey protein in dairy processing 116 recovery of polyphenolic antioxidants from olive oil wastewater 117 and orange juice concentration 118 separation of fermentation broth 119 as well as treatment of wastewater from the textile and petrochemical industries 120 and municipal reuse of water 104 115 however only a few studies are focused on evaluating the application of md for the removal of phacs 14 121 wijekoon et al 121 verified the feasibility of applying the membrane distillation process aiming at the removal of trace organic compounds trocs including active pharmaceutical compounds during the treatment of water and wastewater first of all it was not observed any difference in the performance of the md process with respect to the water flux and conductivity rejection when either the synthetic solution or mbr effluent was used as the feed a total of 29 compounds were evaluated including 11 phacs which occur ubiquitously in municipal wastewater the results reported in the study suggest that the main mechanism of rejection fate and transport of the compounds during the md processes are governed by their intrinsic characteristics being more expressive the volatility and to a lesser extent by hydrophobicity all phacs with pkh 9 which can be classified as non volatile were well removed by the md ie they were concentrated in the feed solution otherwise phacs with pkh 9 such as for example triclosan pkh 6 18 losses were observed either by adsorption or evaporation the results indicate that the rejection of compounds with pkh 9 can be governed by the interaction between their hydrophobicity and volatility 121 further the transport of the compounds during the md process was also investigated hydrophilic compounds with negligible volatility were concentrated in the feed while hydrophobic compounds with moderate volatility were substantially lost by evaporation or adsorption 121 when the md process was integrated with a thermophilic mbr high removal 95 of all compounds investigated in this study was observed despite their various physicochemical properties i e hydrophobicity persistence and volatility the results suggest that md could be a promising post treatment to be used in conjunction with thermophilic mbr for micropollutant removal 121 han et al 14 evaluated the application of md for the rejection of ibuprofen in the presence of nom and inorganic salts of a synthetic solution of water which simulates surface water and well water again no flux reduction was observed throughout the test with humic acid concentrations up to 160 mg l nacl 20 mmol l and cacl2 in concentrations of up to 11 mmol l approximately 90 of ibuprofen rejection was also observed for both di water and the synthetic solution in the ph range of 2 6 11 the results indicate that the presence of humic acid or the deposition of humic acid on the surface of the membrane have negligible effect on the rejection of ibuprofen in contrast to other processes of membrane separation which apply pressure as a driving force where rejection of contaminants can vary significantly with respect to scale as the observed detection of ibuprofen which is also non volatile in the permeate is similar to that observed from the passage of humic acids to the permeate suggesting a possible hydrophobic interaction with the membrane han et al 14 also states in the study that there is still the feasibility of implementing md at reasonable flows e g below critical flow for long term continuous operation for treatment of surface or recovered wastewater in spite of the presence of different components in real feeds bench scale experiments tend to focus mainly on a target contaminant such as boron 122 arsenic 123 124 and organic trace compounds 121 forgetting the influence of inorganic salts and natural organic matter inevitably present in natural waters therefore these results make it impossible to fully understand the rejection of organic micropollutants according to the characteristics of the feed in particular some studies point to the occurrence of membrane fouling by nom in md which becomes a critical issue that still requires considerable research effort mainly in the understanding of this mechanism 125 126 in fact other studies indicate that the decline in the permeate flux caused by humic acids is insignificant due to the ionic concentration of nacl cacl2 127 the opposite is observed by srisurichan et al 128 which found a significant decline in flux up to 40 due to calcium ion induced humic acid scaling referred to as ca2 carboxylate complexation which was shown to be ph dependent 128 these divergent conclusions on the effect of fouling due to humic acid and the impact on the permeate flux of the md process imply that the study of organic contaminant rejection should be given in parallel with that of membrane fouling and or wetting of pores by nom many studies have already been published on the impact of fouling on the rejection of contaminants in relation to the nf fo and ed processes which for md a further research is still necessary studies focusing on the effect of nom and organic salts concentration on the md membrane scale as well as on the rejection processes of the micropollutants especially the phacs are necessary in view of the differentiated motive power and mechanism of transport for md 3 treatment options for membrane concentrate rich in phacs besides from the mbr msp is only meant to promote a separation generating a concentrate rich in the target pollutant and in general this concentrate is still in need of treatment in order to breakdown the retained molecules the final disposal of the concentrate generated in the filtration process is a serious problem in wastewater treatment reclamation plants employing msp 129 advanced oxidation processes have been studied due to their capability of breaking down the organic matter and therefore eliminating the phac also since apos are more efficient when applied to higher concentrations the utilization of these processes to the concentrate is more effective 20 the smaller volumes to be treated is also important due to the reduction of the cost associated with the chemicals used abdelmelek et al 130 assessed the application of ozonation on the treatment of ro concentrate and the results indicated that aop can effectively remove phacs from the ro retentate reaching removal rates of 94 95 98 and 94 for gemfibrozil naproxen erythromycin and atenolol respectively benner et al 131 also used ozonation in order to treat ro concentrate experiments showed that an ozone concentration of only 5 mg l resulted in a quantitative removal of propranolol in 0 8 s and 10 mg o3 l oxidized 70 of metoprolol in only 1 2 s the combination of msp and fenton s process is considered to be more efficient on the removal of phacs than photo fenton alone 20 miralles cuevas et al 132 for instance assessed the efficiency of combined nf and photo fenton and photo fenton alone as a tertiary treatment for removal of some phacs from water it was demonstrated that the combined nf and photo fenton treatment used less reagent hydrogen peroxide per contaminants mass because of elevated contaminants concentration reduced the photo fenton treatment time as well as the water volume treated thus this arrangement was found to be a promising approach for wastewater containing extremely low concentrations of microcontaminants photocatalysis is typically applied as post treatment stage for the msp retentate and most studies investigated the removal of organics in the concentrate stream to allow proper disposal in the environment 20 westerhoff et al 133 investigated the feasibility of applying uv tio2 photocatalysis and uv tio2 photocatalysis followed by simple biological system sand filter as post treatment stages for oxidation of organics present in ro concentrate from wastewater reuse facilities uv tio2 treatment achieved up to 95 doc removal at 10 4 kw h m 3 uv doses which was nearly independent of both catalyst dose between 1 and 5 g l 1 and addition of h2o2 despite the general removal of specific effects by aops there is a concern about the unspecific toxicity of the mostly unknown transformation products which rises up possible problems with the application of oaps and the consequences to human health as well as to the wild life also the cost associated with most of these processes is high due to the necessity of application of reagents as well as the generation of a sludge which still needs treatment and proper destination 4 future prospects regarding the mbr systems it is possible to affirm that there are still gaps in the knowledge requiring future studies in the deepening and clarification of these questions which can be mentioned the types sorts mechanisms of the phacs in the sludges how occurs the degradation in phase solid and mainly the effects of the phacs on the microbial activity existing in the mbr that consequently affect the fouling and the rejection of compounds by the membrane in addition there is a need for continued studies to identify microorganisms that are resistant to phacs and that favour the removal of pharmaceutical products in mbr in addition to their degradation mechanisms in addition it is necessary to migrate from the benchtop experiments to the full scale application in order to verify the actual performance of the system in terms of removal of phacs since bench scale mbrs are not likely to predict the performance of mbrs on a large scale 4 nf and ro are very well understood processes and proved to have good and reliable performances on the removal of phacs however closer attention has to be paid to their concentrate generated during the operational processes which is rich in phacs increasing the risks and also the related toxicity mbr can be studied an alternative in order to promote the biodegradation of the nf ro concentrates reducing the phacs contents in the concentrate as well as the risk associated with the formation of toxic bioproducts produced in case of applying aops in addition an economic assessment is still necessary to analyse the feasibility of the conjugation of nf ro and mbr processes md is a technology which is still in need of many improvements for instance breakthroughs in material development and membrane fabrication however development of membranes made from low cost materials with good thermal stability and high hydrophobicity are still needed and in order to reduce prices coupling md with renewable energy like solar energy is also required to improve the possibility of application of this technology towards large scale application 124 still md process is a very promising technology in order to be applied to in the treatment of water and wastewater and pursuit of high purity permeate however it is in need of much more efforts in order to understand its mechanisms and how they interact with the phacs as well as more efforts in order to elucidate its benefits high efficiency and low fouling propensity and avoid the drawback of the technology such as high energy consumption increasing its real potential application for water production and wastewater reclamation 5 conclusion phacs are a real threat around the world conventional water and wastewater treatment are not efficient in removing these kinds of micropollutants organics which ends up being realised in the environment the short and long time effects of these compounds on the wild life and public health are not fully understood or predicted especially the effect of a phacs mix msp is a very promising technology to be applied in order to prevent public health and environmental problems caused by the release of phacs in the environment since they are able to produce a high quality permeate without increasing its toxicity due to the lack of adding chemicals also it can be scalable and applied to a broad range of contaminants however it concentrates the contaminants reducing the efficiency throughout the test and needing further treatment for the concentrate mf and uf although there are some attempts of application on real wastewater effluents in general the efficiency isn t remarkable their efficiency however is increased when applied coupled with a biological reactor the association of these technologies increases the hrt and srt which improves the overall efficiency of the process more studies should be focused on the indication of the best microorganism culture to be applied on the phacs biodegradation nf and ro are mainly applied for water treatment due to their high propensity of fouling their rejection mechanisms and interactions between phacs and nom or inorganic salts are well understood however there are still some controversial results when nf is concerned although it is consensual that tighter nf membranes are more efficient than looser membranes reaching 99 of efficiency the tighter the membrane the greater is the flux decline md is a relatively new technology however because of its robustness in dealing with a broad spectrum of pollutants many studies have focused on the application of md however only a few studied the application of md in order to remove phacs from water and wastewater and few are known about the rejection mechanisms and the interaction between phacs nom inorganic salts and membrane studies are needed in order to cover these gaps to open access to the application of this technology in full scale especially in order to develop new materials and to assess the feasibility of using renewable energy source for phacs removal as well as investigating how the cake layer interacts with the micropollutants also md when using low cost renewable energy its cost can be comparable to nf technology which makes md much more preferable to be applied in long term run due to the much smaller flux decline 
14489,pharmaceutically active compounds are a real threat all around the world conventional water and wastewater treatment are not efficient in removing this kind of organic micropollutants of

and x rays contrast media have become more and more a part of the daily routine life being used in human and animal for health treatment in order to improve life quality and to increase their life span worldwide this scenario is due specially to improvements in health standards which implies in a consumption increase of pharmaceutically active compounds phacs 1 phacs reach water systems from different sources such as human excretion sewage wrongful disposal landfill leachate drain water or from industries 2 although it has been reported that phacs are found in the environment at low concentration ng l to μg l range the constant production consumption and therefore discharge to the environment phacs has been raising global attention and concern over 200 different phacs were observed in surface ground water and sewage 3 4 and it is still unclear the levels and effects as well as the fate of these compounds in the human health and wildlife however it has been found their potential to cause aquatic toxicity development of resistance in pathogenic microbes genotoxicity and endocrine disruption 4 6 also the release of phacs in the environment is not regulated and covered by the existing water quality in many countries around the world 7 whether it is a developing or developed country some worldwide recognised agencies have been trying to either banish or stimulate the establishment of limits of the usage or discharge of some phacs for instance the european union water framework directive and the u s food and drug administration fda usa publicized directions for the evaluation of human drugs the presence of phacs in the environment and their impact on human and wildlife health may be far more extent than it is reported since the analytical methods for the quantification and monitoring of these compounds so as to understand and determine their fate and behaviour within the environment are expensive complicated and time consuming which may compromise the knowledge of the full extent of phacs impact a large spectrum of pollutants from industrial domestic and farming activities arrives diluted in water in conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps their main goal is to remove organic matter and nutrients from the effluent in the order of g l to mg l thus the complete removal of phacs during conventional wwtp is quite a challenge due to several factors such as low volatility different hydrophobicity complex structures extremely low concentration influencing the microorganisms interaction with other solutes and the separation medium membrane sludge etc 8 since they are not completely eliminated during treatment processes and complex outlets may be formed phacs are discharged into waterbodies 9 according to archer et al 2 the concentration of some phacs in the effluent has increased during the treatment in wwtps if compared with the influent as a consequence of their transformation into conjugates it has been reported that some phacs are persistent throughout the drinking water treatment process mostly due to the phacs small size and polarity which makes them highly soluble in water and very mobile in the environment and extremely difficult to remove by conventional treatment 10 11 thus phacs can return to human body through water cycle and food chain which may potentiate human health risks 12 in face of such limitations associated with conventional treatment processes the demand to achieve phacs removal have led to explore alternatives technologies among them can be highlighted membrane separation processes msp due to their high efficiency in removing organic matter salts metal and therefore phacs and other emerging contaminants 13 15 despite their high efficiency in removing compounds even in trace concentration a major drawback is that filtration processes are basically designed to concentrate but not to degrade pollutants and require the disposal of wastes stream and since the rejection of phacs depends on the concentration of them in the feed stream if it increases the efficiency in the removal of pharmaceutically active compounds by the membrane may decrease reducing the overall efficiency thus the concentrate generated in one of the msp applications requires further treatment in order to breakdown phacs molecules and eliminate the threat increasing its efficiency thus this paper reviews the potentials and challenges of the removal of phacs from water and wastewater by membrane separation processes the treatment options for membrane concentrate rich in phacs and future prospects several review papers were published about removal of phacs contaminants through membrane however a general overview of the application and the rejection of phacs including all membrane separations processes as well as membrane distillation is still needed thus a research on scopus was done in order to rise how many studies have been carried out in the last decade 2008 2018 about the subject using the key words phacs pharmaceutically active compounds microfiltration ultrafiltration microbioreactor nanofiltration reverse osmosis and membrane distillation it was found 78 published papers on the subject the majority of the studies are focused on the application of nf and ro fig 1 therefore it was selected papers published no earlier than 2000 2 membrane separation processes msp toward phacs removal from water and wastewater membrane separation processes msp have become an important alternative to produce good quality water reaching the drinking water standards due to their higher removal rate of low mw organic pollutants minimizing the risk associated with the source and its contaminants as well as its modularity and ability to integrate with other systems microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf and membrane bioreactor mbr which is the association of mf or uf with biological treatment are mainly applied to the treatment of raw effluent 16 18 and nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro as a polishing step in order to produce water for reuse nf ro and membrane distillation md can also be considered as advanced treatment which generates water with high quality 13 14 19 it has been reported that membranes have three mechanisms of removing micropollutants which is either by size exclusion electrostatic repulsion or adsorption 11 20 21 thus the prediction of the phacs removal efficiency is quite difficult because it is dependent on physico chemical properties of the compound membrane properties such as pore size molecular weight cut off and zeta potential membrane solute interactions and also influent matrix 4 2 1 mf and uf membranes although the application and operation of mf and uf is relatively simple fig 2 if compared to other msps since it uses lower transmembrane pressure the application of microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf technology is limited to their pores size and molecular weight cutoff mwco which is larger than the molecular weight mw of most phacs mwco ranging from 1 to 200 kda for mf and uf this factor plays a major role in the rejection of phacs considering that mf and uf technology is based on the separation mainly associated with the size difference also associated with the high solubility of pharmaceutical compounds the mf and uf efficiency is considered very little or none in removing dissolved solutes in the aquatic media table 1 yoon et al 22 evaluated the interactions between phacs and uf membrane which membrane had a molecular weight cut off value of 100 kda and the investigated pharmaceuticals had a molecular weight less than 0 4 kg mol 0 4 kda the uf membrane was not able to block phacs passage similar results can be observed in the study conducted by snyder et al 18 besides size exclusion membrane surface adsorption is another one of the major mechanisms for uf to remove dissolved pollutants the pharmaceutical adsorption on the membrane surface is related to the log kow value when this value is low usually log kow 2 8 pharmaceuticals have low lipophilicity and high hydrophilicity which indicates that these contaminants are not likely to be adsorbed on the membrane surface and therefore pass through the membrane barrier with the permeate 22 24 however on the other hand when pharmaceuticals have high log kow usually log kow 2 8 the opposite effect is obtained being these compounds likely to be adsorbed on membrane surfaces 22 24 this result agrees with those obtained in an experimental work developed by fernández et al 24 which assessed the interactions between phacs and a uf membrane this study showed a high membrane retention for carbamazepine 70 gemfibrozil 51 and metoprolol 39 in contrast although several other compounds including diclofenac ibuprofen and naproxen also have relatively high log kow values table 1 both the retention and adsorption caused by the membrane were almost negligible this is presumably due to the hydrophobicity of these compounds that may reduce once they are deprotonated similar results were obtained by yoon et al 22 for these reasons mf and uf processes are mostly employed as pretreatment to remove colloids and natural organic matter nom 18 according to garcia ivars et al 16 who assessed the performance of ceramic uf membrane on the treatment of wwtp secondary effluent in order to remove phacs have found that during the filtration experiments it is formed a foulant layer by adsorbed organic and inorganic compounds onto the ceramic uf membrane which might act as a second barrier for separation and increases the efficiency of the process the fouling layer formed on the membrane surface is characterized by its hydrophobicity and negatively charged particles on the surface this reduces both the porosity and pore size of the ceramic membrane mainly because both complete and intermediate pore blocking occurred during the first stages of the filtration 25 as a result the rejection of some phacs are improved compared to those obtained for cleaner membranes 16 also applying uf membrane to the treatment of rich organic matter om effluents can be even more improved assuming that phacs can be associated with om in the effluent and led to form complexes that could be the result of hydrogen bonding and electrostatic attraction between the polar moieties of phac molecules and the phenolic or carboxylic groups of the humic like substances these complexes are rejected by sieving effect or charge repulsion between them and the membrane surface 16 still phacs polarity and hydrophobicity as well as the membrane nominal pore size retention values were found to be higher for membrane with smaller mwco 16 play a major role in phacs rejection 2 2 membrane bioreactors mbrs membrane bioreactors comprise the association of aerobic anoxic or anaerobic biological treatment processes and a low pressure membrane such as mf or uf according to fig 3 although the number of bioreactors that integrate the biological process to forward osmosis and membrane distillation processes is increasing the membrane acts as a physical hindrance to contain microorganisms replacing the secondary settling tank reducing the sludge production and increasing the global efficiency of the two separated processes in the removal of micro pollutant producing a permeate with negligible presence of suspended solids this is the only msp which is able to degrade and not concentrate the compounds according to tiwari et al 26 the application of mbr technology in hospital wastewater treatment has become a common practice in the previous decades although mf and uf are porous membranes the integration of the membrane and the biological reactor propitiates the increase in the sludge retention time srt implicating in the rise of the efficiency in removing phacs it reflects in the better conditions for the growth of specialized microbial community efficient in micropollutant biodegradation which lead to the higher removal rate of these compounds 26 according to dawas massalha et al 27 high nitrifying activity increases the degradation of pharmaceutical residues which is enhanced by mbrs by providing a higher srt as the nitrification rate increases the ph of the mbr system tends to decrease in this way it was verified that for the ph of 6 the degradation of ibuprofen reached 90 when evaluating ketoprofen a degradation of up to 70 in mbr was observed when the ph reached values below 5 28 de gusseme et al 29 reported 99 removal of 17β ethinylestradiol in nitrifier enriched biomass of mbr snyder et al 18 when studying the role of msp in treating raw primary secondary and tertiary effluent demonstrated that when applying mbr in order to treat primary effluent concentrations of caffeine acetaminophen sulfamethoxazole carbamazepine and gemfibrozil decreased with removal efficiencies varying between 99 1 sulfamethoxazole and 99 9 acetaminophen radjenovic et al 17 found no elimination of gemfibrozil by the conventional activated sludge treatment whereas the mbr was able to eliminate 30 40 of this compound once more it was observed higher removal efficiencies by the mbr technology 81 than by the conventional activated sludge 75 of sulfamethoxazole kimura et al 30 when comparing the efficiency of mbr and the conventional activated sludge concluded that mbr system showed higher removal of ketoprofen and naproxen whereas it was not observed any significant difference in removal efficiency of clofibric acid ibuprofen diclofenac and mefenamic acid in cas and mbr the persistence and low removal of phacs in the effluent of both treatment systems could be due to the presence of the aromatic ring or chlorine group in their structure mbr system is remarkably more efficient according to table 2 when compared to conventional activated sludge treatment 26 for the removal of persistent micro pollutant in a such a small concentration especially for those compounds that are not readily degradable due to the possibility of growth of more specialized biomass in degrading those compounds as already stated srt is one of the most important parameters influencing the removal of phacs in biological treatment systems which includes mbr from table 2 it is possible to note that it significantly affects the removal rates of diclofenac ketoprofen gemfibrozil trimethoprim and erythromycin many studies have been carried out assessing the influence of srt on the efficiency rate of removal of phacs for instance bernhard et al 31 noted that by increasing the srt from 20 days to 62 days the removal rate of diclofenac improved from 8 to 59 also kimura et al proved that the mbr with longer srt of 65 days had better performance than the mbr with a shorter srt of 15 days so that the removal rates of ketoprofen and diclofenac improved from 82 to 98 and from 50 to 82 respectively 30 corroborating with these results maeng et al found that when srt was increased from 20 to 80 days the removal rates of gemfibrozil and ketoprofen improved from 41 to 88 and from 64 to 90 respectively 32 one of the most important characteristics associated with mbr treatment is the possibility of slow growth of nitrifying microorganisms within a reactor with biomass already established as well as a community more specific in degrading a certain type of pollutant and also the retention capacity of hydrophobic compounds these characteristics make mbr a powerful technique for treating domestic effluents 33 many studies 17 31 34 observed that with high srt mbr process had a better removal of polar compounds such as diclofenac sulfophenyl carboxylate and mecoprop as well as hormones like estrogen the degradation efficiency of pharmaceuticals compounds in mbr is more pronounced than the efficiency of cas for like diclofenac metoprolol and clofibric acid was 87 4 58 7 and 71 8 respectively in mbr whereas in cas process only 50 for diclofenac and 27 for clofibric acid 17 however a few studies have shown that increasing srt had no significant impact on the increase of removal of some phacs such as ibuprofen bezafibrate naproxen carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole 35 for example tambosi et al observed that by increasing the srt from 15 to 30 days the degradation rate of naproxen remained in the range of 85 90 36 this shows that 15 days of srt is already enough for its removal similar behaviour was observed for sulfamethoxazole and its metabolites while srt changed from 16 to 81 days 37 this may occur due to the hydrophilic nature of the compound log kow 1 with two ionizable amine groups as a result in an aqueous solution sulfamethoxazole can be present in positive neutral and negative forms these physicochemical properties give an indication that in the mbr system studied by tambosi et al 36 ph 7 2 the sludge adsorption mechanism played a negligible role due to electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged groups of the compound and the negatively charged surfaces of the sludge therefore biodegradation can be considered as the main mechanism responsible for the removal however this process will be hindered by the antibacterial properties of this compound also carbamazepine was shown to be resistant to biodegradation regardless of increasing srt 32 another important parameter is the hydraulic retention time hrt which is related to the useful volume of the reactor and consequently has an impact directly proportional to capital and operating costs however some studies indicate that hrt has no significant effect on the removal of phacs reif et al 38 evaluated the removal of ibuprofen naproxen and erythromycin and noted that the increase in hrt did not affect the rate of removal of these compounds as well as the mbr permeate quality in addition from the reading of table 2 comparing the results of different researchers hrt had no effect on the removal of acetaminophen bezafibrate ofloxacin gemfibrozil and metronidazole however the reduction of hrt may increase membrane fouling 39 ph is an important parameter in the degradation of phacs since reducing the ph can increase the hydrophobicity of the ionizable compounds and subsequently improve their adsorption capacity to the sludge particles this implies that a time available for biodegradation is increased and consequently the rates of removal however this behaviour should be applied to ionizable compounds with no change in the rate of removal of non ionizable compounds at ph variation expected tadkaew et al 28 did not observe a significant increase in the removal of ionizable diclofenac ibuprofen sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine that are non ionizable compounds 28 in the study conducted by tadkaew et al 28 which evaluated the ketoprofen compound that is ionizable it was observed a higher removal rate at ph 9 and ph 5 than ph 7 similar there are reports that there point to the sorption of hydrophilic antibiotics in the sludge which is expected to occur 40 kim et al 41 investigated the removal of pharmaceutical products in mbr and reported that sorption processes were the major mechanism of antibiotics removal such as tetracycline norfloxacin ciprofloxacin while azithromycin and sulfamethoxazole were removed by degradation the difference in the findings between the studies of kim et al 41 and tambosi et al 36 for the same phac when sorption is concern may be associated with the microorganism culture applied as well as different conditions of temperature and ph for the temperature it is expected that with its increase also occurs the increase in the biodegration of the compounds by the increase in the metabolic activity in addition to influence the mechanism of sorption since these compounds are expected to be stable to a wide facade of temperature variation hai et al 42 studied the effect of temperature variation on the removal of micropollutants and noted that the removal of most of the hydrophobic compounds was stable in the temperature range of 10 35 c but the removal of less hydrophobic micropollutants log d 3 2 were significantly influenced by the temperature variation below and above 20 c as above listed physicochemical properties such as solubility volatility photo degradation and biodegradability of phacs pollutants associated with the wwtp operational parameters like srt hydraulic retention time hrt ph and temperature play a crucial role in controlling the fate and removal efficiency of target pollutants in the wastewater pharmaceutical pollutant with high sorption potential has higher removal rate than the compounds with low sorption potential thus mbrs can effectively eliminate hydrophobic and readily biodegradable compounds and they are less effective in removal of hydrophilic and biologically persistent materials 40 43 phacs typically either because of their complex structure characteristics or toxic effects render the wide variety of microorganisms bacteria and fungi applied in conventional sewage treatment systems not efficiently sufficient in the degradation of some phacs 44 for example carbamazepine and diclofenac removal rates are 13 8 and 15 respectively 45 46 in this way some studies are already being done in order to find new groups of microorganisms that are able to efficiently oxidize these compounds white rot fungi and their unique extracellular enzymes termed lignin peroxidase manganese peroxidase and laccase are known to play an important role in the ecosystem by the degradation of lignin some studies have evaluated the application of these enzymes to the elimination of phacs such as diclofenac naproxen and ketoprofen by these fungi 47 49 nguyen et al 46 investigated the efficiency of a mixed culture of bacteria and fungi of white rot in the removal of organic contaminants in the mbr system and noted that this system can achieve a better removal than a system containing only fungi or bacteria removal rates were increased from 15 to 50 for diclofenac and from 65 to 94 for ketoprofen 46 yang et al 50 investigated a fungal mbr inoculated with white rot fungus trametes versicolor and operated in non sterile conditions more than 55 removal of diclofenac was achieved 50 zhang and geiben 49 analysed the removal of phacs under non sterile conditions using t versicolor and reported the high removal rate 60 80 for carbamazepine unobserved results in mbr operated with bacteria it has been observed that sufficient nutrient supply is crucial for effective removal 49 still applying the fungus t versicolor jelic et al 50 mg l the removal rate is 61 while at a higher concentration 9 mg l the removal rate may reach 94 51 hata et al found that repeated treatments of carbamazepine with laccase in the presence of the redox mediator 1 hydroxybenzotriazole hbt may increase the rate of removal from 22 to 60 52 in addition murugesan et al confirmed that the presence of hbt may increase the rate of triclosan removal from 56 to 90 53 it is possible to notice that the mbr systems do not present regular results regarding the removal of phacs this behaviour may be associated with structural complexity of phacs and also their side effects under different species of microorganisms from table 2 it is possible to state that mbrs remove acetaminophen ibuprofen ketoprofen gemfibrozil bezafibrate and naproxen efficiently 90 while carbamazepine and diclofenac removal rates are low 40 for other compounds removal rates are in the mid range 40 70 or sometimes there is insufficient data for judgment 2 3 nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro processes have been demonstrating promising results on the rejection of phacs and other emerging micropollutants 13 54 tables 3 and 4 like mf and uf the schematic draw for nf and ro is quite similar fig 2 however the applied transmembrane pressure is much higher for nf and ro operation which implies in an increase in the energy consumption this is due to the membrane configuration nf and ro are denser membranes which propitiate a greater efficiency in phacs removal as well as energy requirement this also explains the majority of papers published in this subject in the last decade fig 1 unlike the reverse osmosis process nf in addition to having a greater permeate flux and being able to work at lower pressures does not promote the complete removal of ions being a preferable process to ro in cases where there is no such need since it is expected of showing effective removal organic pollutants 55 including phacs and edcs the majority of the phacs have molecular weight within 150 500 da which is in the range of the molecular weight cut off mwco for most commercial 100 2000 da 56 thus these compounds are expected to be widely retained by physical sieving if their molecular weights are larger than the membrane mwco in order to study the ability of ro membranes to retain phacs kimura et al 57 showed that membranes composed of polyamide showed better rejection than cellulose acetate membranes table 4 the results indicate that electrostatic exclusion is the predominant phenomenon in these membranes and because of this rejection of negatively charged pharmaceutical compounds was effective and exceeded 95 by ro membranes 58 59 khan et al 60 also found that the treatment with ro was the most successful in the removal of phacs ozaki and li 61 investigated the rejection of several products among them phacs by nf and ro polyamide membranes and showed that the rejection of organic compounds by ultra low pressure ro ulpro increased linearly with molecular weight and molecular weight of the compound evaluated a number of studies 54 58 59 have shown that the rejection of phacs by the nf process is governed by several mechanisms such as steric effect electrostatic repulsion hydrophobic interactions partitioning and diffusion which are highly dependent on the physico chemical properties of the feed solution ions concentration ph molecular weight molecular geometry charge hydrophobicity hydrophilicity and membrane properties such as mwco surface charge morphology porosity and hydrophobicity several types of nf membranes have already been studied and tested in the application for rejection of a large number of phacs table 4 however in general the conclusion is that nf is not always as effective a process for the removal of all evaluated phacs as one might suppose the study carried out by yoon et al 22 who used a nf membrane with a nominal mwco of 200 da the rejection ratios for 52 endocrine disrupting compounds among them several phacs both synthetic solution and real surface water ranged from 0 to more than 90 radjenović et al 62 applied a nf membrane with a nominal mwco of 200 da in a full scale potable water treatment plant this experiment showed high rejections greater than 95 of 9 out of the 12 pharmaceutical products assessed however slight rejection 50 was observed for acetaminophen gemfibrozil and mefenamic acid this was attributed to its hydrophilic behaviour and or low mw of the phacs generally low rejection is mainly encountered when nf membranes with relatively large mwco are applied which are not effective in the removal of low mw phacs nf was found to be effective in the removal of carbamazepine which is considered to be a human active indicator 63 a dependence on filtration time and the rejection ratio of phacs by nf to uncharged compounds was noted 58 64 this strongly suggests that the mechanism of adsorption of these compounds on the membrane surface directly affects the performance of the rejection membranes with less polar characteristics indicated by low dipole moment and solutions with more hydrophobic compounds indicated by high kow generally present preferentially adsorption 65 adsorption generally impairs the performance of phacs rejection after the nf membrane adsorption sites are exhausted 66 the hydrophobicity of phacs is one of the major factors influencing the performance of nf membranes the hydrophobic compounds initially have tendencies to be adsorbed onto the membrane surface layer and into the pores and diffused into their matrix 4 the higher hydrophobicity of compound the greater is its ability to be adsorbed on the membrane surface especially when the compounds are electrostatically neutral 20 the initial adsorption of the phacs on the membrane causes a high initial rejection of the compound as the adsorption occurs free active sites are occupied the membrane tends to change its charge which affects the transport of solutes to the permeate reducing its rejection capacity compared to hydrophilic compounds of the same size 67 68 after electrostatic equilibrium the next mechanisms that prevail in the rejection of phacs are size exclusion and charge repulsion 22 however in observing these mechanisms it is possible that these are overestimated since most of the studies were conducted for a short period of time 24 h in addition to using small sample volumes 10 l 58 69 70 the hydrophilic compounds otherwise remain dissolved in the aqueous phase and consequently their effective diameter may be larger taheran et al 2016 thus when the size exclusion mechanism prevails the hydrophilic compound can be rejected more effectively than the hydrophobic ones 71 the effect of hydrophobicity was more prominent for nf membranes having larger pores than those with smaller pores since the larger pores facilitate passage of the phacs to the adsorption sites in the skin layer backing layer and pores of the membrane however according to studies carried out by yoon et al 22 the phenomenon of adsorption on the nf membrane is more prominent than the uf membrane verliefde et al 11 in turn concluded that in the case of the negatively charged nf membrane the rejection of positively charged neutral charged phacs is reduced with increased hydrophobicity since these compounds have higher tendencies to adsorbed onto the membrane surface however it was concluded that there was no clear relationship between the hydrophobicity of negatively charged phacs and their rejection due to the repulsion of the charge that prevented the solutes from approaching the membrane surface 11 the ionic state of phacs will depend on the ph solution and on acidic properties of solutes thus changes in feedwater ph will significantly affect the phacs rejection by nf ro membranes by changing their ionic state of the phacs another variable which plays an important role in determining the ionic state of the compound is the value of the acid dissociation constant pka if the pka value of the solute is below the investigated ph range the solute will be negatively charged otherwise the solute will be positively charged or a neutral and positively charged solute mixture vergili 72 applied a nf membrane fm np010 in cross flow filtration equipment for the removal of three phacs carbamazepine diclofenac and ibuprofen of samples from a drinking water treatment plant using surface water this study showed that the overall rejection was approximately 31 39 for ionic diclofenac and ibuprofen and 55 61 for neutral carbamazepine the low to moderate rejection values observed for the phacs were most likely due to small molecular sizes i e mw mwco typically the surface of most nf and ro membranes are negatively charged when in contact with solutions of neutral ph due to deprotonation of their functional groups 4 therefore the charge of the phac molecules as a consequence and possible electrostatic interaction with the surface of the membrane can contribute significantly to its removal in the case of compounds having positive charges attractive forces between the solutes and the surface of the negatively charged membrane will prevail causing an increase in the solute concentration near the membrane surface and therefore results in lower rejections because it induces greater passage of the pollutants from the membrane otherwise when the compounds are negatively charged repulsive forces are predominant between the solutes and the surface of the membrane which have similar charges this implies the reduction of the solute concentration on the membrane surface and therefore generates an increase in the rejection of the phacs 17 57 73 even neutral molecules which have a high dipole moment tend to align with membrane pores due to electrostatic interactions with the membrane charge and therefore permeate more easily through the membrane 74 76 some studies have been carried out to verify the effect of the electrostatic interactions between the membrane and the compound nghiem et al 75 77 for example found this effect on nf membrane considered to be negatively charged loose when subjected to solution with ph values above 5 it was observed that the retention of ionizable phacs such as ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole increased because with the increase in the ph value of the solution as a result of the pka value caused a change in the compound charge from neutral to negative however when evaluating non ionizable phacs such as carbamazepine they were found to be relatively independent of solution chemistry 75 77 although in the study conducted by verliefde et al 68 investigated the removal of phacs using a system of negatively charged nf with small 10 and higher recovery rates 80 it was concluded that the exclusion due to the size of the particle that is the phenomena of sieving was the main mechanism for the rejection of the neutral solute however larger and smaller rejections of negatively or positively arrayed solutes were attributed to phenomena of repulsion and electrostatic attractions respectively it was also concluded that when the system is operated at a low recovery rate 10 high removal efficiencies 95 are achieved for all evaluated phacs however these efficiencies decreased when analysing a higher recovery 80 phenomena that can be attributed to the increase in the mean concentration of phacs in the feed solution as a result of internal recycling of the concentrate 68 78 bellona et al 79 evaluated the effect of surface charges fouling layers on the nf membrane on the rejection of acidic solutes and observed that the presence of calcium in feed water can reduce the surface charge of the membrane due to adsorption of ca2 in the fouling layer but the rejection of negatively charged solutes was lower only in membranes whose mwco is higher than the mw of the solutes 80 its conclusion contrasts with the results obtained by comerton et al 70 which observed a reduction in gemfibrozil removal rate mw 250 da and unchanged removal rate for acetaminophen mw 151 da using an nf membrane mwco 200 da and a ro membrane after the addition of divalent cations in the feed solution however no significant changes was observed for ro rejections 80 in addition dolar et al studied the effect of the influent matrix on rejection of phacs across the nf and ro membrane using four different water sources namely milli q water synthetic water and drug solution tap water and actual pharmaceutical wastewater and noted that the phacs rejection was higher in the synthetic solution and tap water than in milli q water due to the adsorption of ions into the membrane pores that strengthened the size exclusion effect 81 the process of retention of solutes by the membrane due to the complexity of phenomena that occur on its surface should not be considered as a simple filtration process the sieving phenomenon is not the only one to affect the transport and the convection of solutes through membranes other phenomena such as liquid absorption at the membrane solute interface and transport within the membrane can significantly influence the removal efficiency of compounds 82 in turn liquid absorption and preferential transport are influenced by other parameters such as charge repulsion and hydrophobic interaction generally the size exclusion phenomenon plays an important role in the rejection of neutral and non hydrated solutes besides being able to present high rejections i e 85 for compounds with mw greater than mwco of nf ro membranes radjenovic et al 62 evaluated the rejection of several phacs by real scale nf ro membranes in a real drinking water treatment plant it was concluded that since the mw of acetaminophen was lower than the mwco of the nf and ro membranes used and also did not present in its ionic state at neutral ph its rejection rate varied 44 8 73 not elevated however when observing diclofenac which has higher mw and negatively charged at neutral ph had the highest rejection rate however the low rejection rate of gemfibrozil despite high mw and the presence of charge repulsion effect was unexpected 62 quintanilla et al 83 concluded that the rejection of hydrophilic neutral solutes may correlate linearly with the physical characteristics of the compound such as its molar volume and molecular length however no correlation was observed between its rejections and equivalent width 83 in turn agenson et al 82 observed a better correlation between rejection and molecular width pronk et al 84 assigned the highest removal rate of some phacs to their complexation with oxalic acid uric acid amino acids and humic acid which led to an increase in their size giving rise to the possibility of sieving effect 84 kim et al 85 applied methacrylic acid ethylenediamine and succinic acid to modify the surface of the commercial nf membrane and found that methacrylic acid can increase hydrophilicity steric hindrance and negative surface charge of the membrane and therefore it is possible to increase the rejection of the ibuprofen and salicylic acid by approximately 1 however application of ethylenediamine reduced the surface charge and had a negative effect on rejection of charged phacs 85 nghiem and coleman 86 verified the effect of scaling in ro and nf membranes using synthetic solutions with hydrophobic and hydrophilic impurities in the rejection of triclosan and concluded that when applied to hydrophilic colloidal silica no change in permeate flow or rejection of triclosan was observed however hydrophobic impurities such as alginate significantly reduce flow and increase triclosan rejection 86 when applying nf or ro process in treating natural water or also treated effluent nom in natural matrices may influence the rejection of organic compounds traces by two main mechanisms fouling or interactions between the membrane surface and the feed solution compounds or interactions between solute molecules solute solute interactions 13 membrane fouling caused by the organic matter presents in the effluent results in a decrease in permeate flux throughout the filtration operation and can either increase or decrease solute rejection depending on the interaction between the membrane and the fouling layer ionic neutral hydrophobic and hydrophilic compared to clean membranes 87 this phenomenon occurs by modifying the surface characteristics of the membrane which also changes the adsorption phenomenon of organic compounds in the fouling layer 88 same trends were found by nghiem et al 89 bellona et al 79 found rejections by nf when assessing the membrane nf 270 considered a loose membrane process were markedly lower of non ionic phacs acetaminophen carbamazepine etc when previously fouled with efom this result was attributed to an increase in hydrophobicity and a decrease in surface charge being linked to the cake enhanced polarization concentration cecp phenomena 79 however when analysing the membrane nf90 considered a tight membrane the rejection of the same studied phacs was found to be relatively unaffected by efom where it was observed a decrease in hydrophobicity and an increase in surface charge 79 this is a phenomenon that is considered as the diffusion barrier of which the solute located on the surface of the membrane may suffer upon returning to the feed solution due to the presence of a porous cake layer 90 this can be responsible of the increase of organic compounds concentration and therefore promoting an alteration of membrane surface charge and by consequence its rejection agenson and urase 91 reconfirming the previous results have suggested that the adsorption and diffusion of compounds having larger mw through ro and nf membranes fouled by leachate these compounds also present higher rejections by the virgin membranes on the contrary zazouli et al 92 observed an increasing rejection for phacs with higher mw while compounds with smaller mw and with moderate polarity such as acetaminophen were found to be less rejected due to the polymeric fouling layer applying alginate as a model compound hajibabania et al 88 found that the rejections of the hydrophilic non ionic and ionic solute are negatively impacted when membranes are fouled with humic acids and even more with alginates the rejection of hydrophobic compounds was found to be not influenced by the type of studied foulants thus in addition to the type of solutes and soils the mwco of the membranes or the pore size of the membrane determines whether the scale will have a beneficial or negative influence on the rejection of phacs either through the pore restriction or cecp 63 79 as many of these studies illustrate it is clear that membrane fouling has the potential to affect rejection mechanisms of organic solutes as a result of modified electrostatic steric and hydrophobic hydrophilic solute membrane interactions 87 though reported results are difficult to generalize since the characteristics of the feed solutions and therefore the composite nature of foulants and particular interactions with each membrane type leads to a diversity of scenarios in terms of phacs rejection understanding the fouling effect requires a comprehensive characterization of the contaminated membrane and the physicochemical properties of the selected phacs 87 according to the study conducted by azais et al 87 the rejection of neutral phacs by the virgin and pre fouled membrane in the case of the nf 90 membrane was attributed to steric hindrance which explains a nearly constant rejection yield for all the compounds whatever the surface state of the membrane or the type of phacs shape and geometry and then was little influenced by the fouling the rejection by pre fouled nf 270 membrane was lower in comparison to the virgin membrane probably due to the establishment of cecp that facilitated the transport of small mw nonionic organic compounds in addition the nf 270 membrane is strongly influenced by the chemical structure of the phacs also it was observed that the geometry and charge of the compound also plays an important role in this same study azais et al 87 have also shown that solute solute interactions in the tertiary effluent matrix significantly increased the rejection of phacs especially when loose nf was used for which the association of phacs with organic macromolecule was the reason for this better rejection due to steric hindrance the second mechanism involved in drug rejection when involving a matrix composed of organic matter is through the binding of compounds several studies 13 suggest that the mechanism that promotes greater rejection is the formation of compound om complexes this is attributed to the increase in molecule size and a negative charge if compared to the compound alone it has been observed that the presence of om whether natural or from a synthetic solution increases the removal of hormone estrogens 93 and phacs 94 through solute solute interactions the formation of om compounds complexes due to the adsorption of phacs into organic macromolecules may depend on the types of solutes and macromolecules involved in the process and on their binding capability 88 in addition the calcium concentration present in the solution can influence both membrane fouling reducing permeate flow and phac retention when applied nf when the feed solution is rich in divalent cations there may be competition between these elements and phacs by active adsorption sites in organic matter to form complexes with om resulting in lower rejections of phacs 13 in particular when calcium is abundant in the solution studies have reported that the carboxylic groups of humic substances and polysaccharides are neutralized which promotes denser fouling 95 however when it exceeds a critical calcium concentration the complexation of these elements with om may also occur in the solution bulk complexation leading to aggregate formation and lower organic fouling 96 reznik et al 97 studied the seasonal effects on the rejection of carbamazepine and found that the rejection of ro membranes was not affected by seasonal change but the rejection of carbamazepine by nf membrane decreased from 92 in summer to 50 in winter they concluded that reducing the temperature can affect metabolic rate which consequently affects organic matter degradation and their interaction with solutes 97 the type of fouling the ionic state and pre treatment used in the sample strongly affects the cleaning period of the membrane the chemicals to be applied and consequently the cost of cleaning 4 in general the membranes are cleaned when a 10 15 drop in the permeate flux is observed a 10 15 increase in solute concentration in the permeate or a 15 20 drop in pressure in a vessel of pressure as a general rule the usual cleaning frequency rotates around once every four times a year and in terms of cost this operation should revolve around 5 20 of the operating costs 98 in one case study the total ro membrane cleaning costs including labor chemicals and loss of production were calculated in orange county water district s groundwater replenishment system according to data provided for a total capacity of 265 000 m3 day operated with a recovery rate of 85 the total cost of cleaning was us 15 929 which should be multiplied by the cleaning number per year 99 2 4 membrane distillation membrane distillation md is a low temperature distillation process that operates transporting water in vapour phase through a microporous and hydrophobic membrane on the distillate product side according to fig 4 this process has a theoretical 100 retention of non volatile components due to the temperature difference between the feed and distillate side only the most volatile compound typically water vaporizes passing through the pore openings at the feed membrane interface and then condenses at the distillate membrane interface direct contact membrane distillation dcmd is considered the most widely studied md system configuration due to its simple operation 102 in dcmd the feed solution is maintained at a higher temperature than the distillate thus creating a difference in vapor pressure between the feed and the distillate the membrane separates the liquid phase from the feed and distillation streams but allows the water vapor to flow freely through its dry microporous which is maintained dry due to the membrane s hydrophobicity thus it prevents wetting of the pores by the liquid or distilled feed solution in normal operational conditions since mass transfer can only occur in the gaseous phase it is possible to achieve complete rejection of all non volatile solutes such as inorganic salts and pathogenic microorganisms in addition md is less susceptible to fouling due to the absence of the need to apply a hydraulic pressure to the process execution 103 even when the fouling development is observed it occurs in a less compacted and easily removed layer 103 as a result until the present date much of the effort in md research has focused on desalination applications 102 104 it was also observed several studies that explored the application of md for food processing such as recovery of whey protein in dairy processing 105 recovery of polyphenolic antioxidants from olive oil wastewater 106 and orange juice concentration 107 separation of fermentation broth 108 as well as treatment of wastewater from the textile and petrochemical industries 109 111 and municipal reuse of water 112 113 and even radioactive wastewater 114 as md works under low temperature thus it is possible to use renewable energy as solar or any other low quality as a source of energy 102 115 given the advantages of high separation efficiency low propensity to scale and potentially low energy consumption when low heat quality is readily available the md process can be applied to a wide variety of applications besides brackish water desalination and sea water it was observed several studies that explored the application of md for food processing such as recovery of whey protein in dairy processing 116 recovery of polyphenolic antioxidants from olive oil wastewater 117 and orange juice concentration 118 separation of fermentation broth 119 as well as treatment of wastewater from the textile and petrochemical industries 120 and municipal reuse of water 104 115 however only a few studies are focused on evaluating the application of md for the removal of phacs 14 121 wijekoon et al 121 verified the feasibility of applying the membrane distillation process aiming at the removal of trace organic compounds trocs including active pharmaceutical compounds during the treatment of water and wastewater first of all it was not observed any difference in the performance of the md process with respect to the water flux and conductivity rejection when either the synthetic solution or mbr effluent was used as the feed a total of 29 compounds were evaluated including 11 phacs which occur ubiquitously in municipal wastewater the results reported in the study suggest that the main mechanism of rejection fate and transport of the compounds during the md processes are governed by their intrinsic characteristics being more expressive the volatility and to a lesser extent by hydrophobicity all phacs with pkh 9 which can be classified as non volatile were well removed by the md ie they were concentrated in the feed solution otherwise phacs with pkh 9 such as for example triclosan pkh 6 18 losses were observed either by adsorption or evaporation the results indicate that the rejection of compounds with pkh 9 can be governed by the interaction between their hydrophobicity and volatility 121 further the transport of the compounds during the md process was also investigated hydrophilic compounds with negligible volatility were concentrated in the feed while hydrophobic compounds with moderate volatility were substantially lost by evaporation or adsorption 121 when the md process was integrated with a thermophilic mbr high removal 95 of all compounds investigated in this study was observed despite their various physicochemical properties i e hydrophobicity persistence and volatility the results suggest that md could be a promising post treatment to be used in conjunction with thermophilic mbr for micropollutant removal 121 han et al 14 evaluated the application of md for the rejection of ibuprofen in the presence of nom and inorganic salts of a synthetic solution of water which simulates surface water and well water again no flux reduction was observed throughout the test with humic acid concentrations up to 160 mg l nacl 20 mmol l and cacl2 in concentrations of up to 11 mmol l approximately 90 of ibuprofen rejection was also observed for both di water and the synthetic solution in the ph range of 2 6 11 the results indicate that the presence of humic acid or the deposition of humic acid on the surface of the membrane have negligible effect on the rejection of ibuprofen in contrast to other processes of membrane separation which apply pressure as a driving force where rejection of contaminants can vary significantly with respect to scale as the observed detection of ibuprofen which is also non volatile in the permeate is similar to that observed from the passage of humic acids to the permeate suggesting a possible hydrophobic interaction with the membrane han et al 14 also states in the study that there is still the feasibility of implementing md at reasonable flows e g below critical flow for long term continuous operation for treatment of surface or recovered wastewater in spite of the presence of different components in real feeds bench scale experiments tend to focus mainly on a target contaminant such as boron 122 arsenic 123 124 and organic trace compounds 121 forgetting the influence of inorganic salts and natural organic matter inevitably present in natural waters therefore these results make it impossible to fully understand the rejection of organic micropollutants according to the characteristics of the feed in particular some studies point to the occurrence of membrane fouling by nom in md which becomes a critical issue that still requires considerable research effort mainly in the understanding of this mechanism 125 126 in fact other studies indicate that the decline in the permeate flux caused by humic acids is insignificant due to the ionic concentration of nacl cacl2 127 the opposite is observed by srisurichan et al 128 which found a significant decline in flux up to 40 due to calcium ion induced humic acid scaling referred to as ca2 carboxylate complexation which was shown to be ph dependent 128 these divergent conclusions on the effect of fouling due to humic acid and the impact on the permeate flux of the md process imply that the study of organic contaminant rejection should be given in parallel with that of membrane fouling and or wetting of pores by nom many studies have already been published on the impact of fouling on the rejection of contaminants in relation to the nf fo and ed processes which for md a further research is still necessary studies focusing on the effect of nom and organic salts concentration on the md membrane scale as well as on the rejection processes of the micropollutants especially the phacs are necessary in view of the differentiated motive power and mechanism of transport for md 3 treatment options for membrane concentrate rich in phacs besides from the mbr msp is only meant to promote a separation generating a concentrate rich in the target pollutant and in general this concentrate is still in need of treatment in order to breakdown the retained molecules the final disposal of the concentrate generated in the filtration process is a serious problem in wastewater treatment reclamation plants employing msp 129 advanced oxidation processes have been studied due to their capability of breaking down the organic matter and therefore eliminating the phac also since apos are more efficient when applied to higher concentrations the utilization of these processes to the concentrate is more effective 20 the smaller volumes to be treated is also important due to the reduction of the cost associated with the chemicals used abdelmelek et al 130 assessed the application of ozonation on the treatment of ro concentrate and the results indicated that aop can effectively remove phacs from the ro retentate reaching removal rates of 94 95 98 and 94 for gemfibrozil naproxen erythromycin and atenolol respectively benner et al 131 also used ozonation in order to treat ro concentrate experiments showed that an ozone concentration of only 5 mg l resulted in a quantitative removal of propranolol in 0 8 s and 10 mg o3 l oxidized 70 of metoprolol in only 1 2 s the combination of msp and fenton s process is considered to be more efficient on the removal of phacs than photo fenton alone 20 miralles cuevas et al 132 for instance assessed the efficiency of combined nf and photo fenton and photo fenton alone as a tertiary treatment for removal of some phacs from water it was demonstrated that the combined nf and photo fenton treatment used less reagent hydrogen peroxide per contaminants mass because of elevated contaminants concentration reduced the photo fenton treatment time as well as the water volume treated thus this arrangement was found to be a promising approach for wastewater containing extremely low concentrations of microcontaminants photocatalysis is typically applied as post treatment stage for the msp retentate and most studies investigated the removal of organics in the concentrate stream to allow proper disposal in the environment 20 westerhoff et al 133 investigated the feasibility of applying uv tio2 photocatalysis and uv tio2 photocatalysis followed by simple biological system sand filter as post treatment stages for oxidation of organics present in ro concentrate from wastewater reuse facilities uv tio2 treatment achieved up to 95 doc removal at 10 4 kw h m 3 uv doses which was nearly independent of both catalyst dose between 1 and 5 g l 1 and addition of h2o2 despite the general removal of specific effects by aops there is a concern about the unspecific toxicity of the mostly unknown transformation products which rises up possible problems with the application of oaps and the consequences to human health as well as to the wild life also the cost associated with most of these processes is high due to the necessity of application of reagents as well as the generation of a sludge which still needs treatment and proper destination 4 future prospects regarding the mbr systems it is possible to affirm that there are still gaps in the knowledge requiring future studies in the deepening and clarification of these questions which can be mentioned the types sorts mechanisms of the phacs in the sludges how occurs the degradation in phase solid and mainly the effects of the phacs on the microbial activity existing in the mbr that consequently affect the fouling and the rejection of compounds by the membrane in addition there is a need for continued studies to identify microorganisms that are resistant to phacs and that favour the removal of pharmaceutical products in mbr in addition to their degradation mechanisms in addition it is necessary to migrate from the benchtop experiments to the full scale application in order to verify the actual performance of the system in terms of removal of phacs since bench scale mbrs are not likely to predict the performance of mbrs on a large scale 4 nf and ro are very well understood processes and proved to have good and reliable performances on the removal of phacs however closer attention has to be paid to their concentrate generated during the operational processes which is rich in phacs increasing the risks and also the related toxicity mbr can be studied an alternative in order to promote the biodegradation of the nf ro concentrates reducing the phacs contents in the concentrate as well as the risk associated with the formation of toxic bioproducts produced in case of applying aops in addition an economic assessment is still necessary to analyse the feasibility of the conjugation of nf ro and mbr processes md is a technology which is still in need of many improvements for instance breakthroughs in material development and membrane fabrication however development of membranes made from low cost materials with good thermal stability and high hydrophobicity are still needed and in order to reduce prices coupling md with renewable energy like solar energy is also required to improve the possibility of application of this technology towards large scale application 124 still md process is a very promising technology in order to be applied to in the treatment of water and wastewater and pursuit of high purity permeate however it is in need of much more efforts in order to understand its mechanisms and how they interact with the phacs as well as more efforts in order to elucidate its benefits high efficiency and low fouling propensity and avoid the drawback of the technology such as high energy consumption increasing its real potential application for water production and wastewater reclamation 5 conclusion phacs are a real threat around the world conventional water and wastewater treatment are not efficient in removing these kinds of micropollutants organics which ends up being realised in the environment the short and long time effects of these compounds on the wild life and public health are not fully understood or predicted especially the effect of a phacs mix msp is a very promising technology to be applied in order to prevent public health and environmental problems caused by the release of phacs in the environment since they are able to produce a high quality permeate without increasing its toxicity due to the lack of adding chemicals also it can be scalable and applied to a broad range of contaminants however it concentrates the contaminants reducing the efficiency throughout the test and needing further treatment for the concentrate mf and uf although there are some attempts of application on real wastewater effluents in general the efficiency isn t remarkable their efficiency however is increased when applied coupled with a biological reactor the association of these technologies increases the hrt and srt which improves the overall efficiency of the process more studies should be focused on the indication of the best microorganism culture to be applied on the phacs biodegradation nf and ro are mainly applied for water treatment due to their high propensity of fouling their rejection mechanisms and interactions between phacs and nom or inorganic salts are well understood however there are still some controversial results when nf is concerned although it is consensual that tighter nf membranes are more efficient than looser membranes reaching 99 of efficiency the tighter the membrane the greater is the flux decline md is a relatively new technology however because of its robustness in dealing with a broad spectrum of pollutants many studies have focused on the application of md however only a few studied the application of md in order to remove phacs from water and wastewater and few are known about the rejection mechanisms and the interaction between phacs nom inorganic salts and membrane studies are needed in order to cover these gaps to open access to the application of this technology in full scale especially in order to develop new materials and to assess the feasibility of using renewable energy source for phacs removal as well as investigating how the cake layer interacts with the micropollutants also md when using low cost renewable energy its cost can be comparable to nf technology which makes md much more preferable to be applied in long term run due to the much smaller flux decline
