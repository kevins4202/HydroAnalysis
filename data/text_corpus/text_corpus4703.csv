23515,studies on scientific winches installed on oceanographic fisheries research vessels orvs and frvs respectively are distinguished by the winches unique design features and the important role they play with scientific experiments it is impossible to draw general conclusions when analysing scientific winches used for fisheries sampling experiments on recently built orvs few vessels are built each year and their dimensions and mission vary greatly thus to consider the concept of traction factor and the possible ways in which equipment on fishing trawlers could be arranged and manoeuvred a statistical analysis was carried out on newly built and refitted vessels from spanish shipyards the starting point was a sample of 125 boats to which linear regression models were adjusted to explain the relationship between total traction and the traction for the fishing winch as a result three regression models one for each kind of arrangement were obtained the next step involved analysing and modelling the dependence of the auxiliary winch traction on fishing winch traction keywords oceanography oceanographic research vessels fisheries science biological sampling manoeuvres scientific winches statistical learning 1 introduction 1 1 general considerations oceanographic research vessels research fleets are crucial in meeting scientific objectives and completing the tasks that enhance understanding of high sea processes for this reason oceanography depends on a mobile platform to carry out the experiments necessary for its research activity the oceanographic research vessel orv adler 2014 studies how the research vessel has evolved in its role as a scientific instrument he argues the orv has gone from being a mere tool to reaching an intermediate stage in which it served as a laboratory vessel in its current state it is an invisible technician whose mission is to deploy remote sensing equipment and collect data which will not be analysed on board its mission is vital to oceanography in turn the orv plays an essential role in supporting this work and the full range of research procedures except for those needing satellite back up carral et al 2015b research vessels can be roughly divided into three main groups those used for physical or chemical oceanography research fisheries research vessels frv for biological oceanography and vessels for geological oceanography on the whole these vessels have general oceanographic research capacities and then simply do specialised work in a particular field for a set time period according to the needs of the countries and or universities that hire them carral et al 2015b moreover their building and running costs are high for this reason optimisation and functionality objectives are taken into account when these vessels are being designed and operated oliveira et al 2014 the end result is a versatile vessel designed with extremely multipurpose features garcía del valle 2007 one factor to take into account includes the requirements of the scientific equipment they have other factors will also define the characteristics of frvs depending on the scope of their activity for example there is the number of scientists and crew members on board and the range required these data determine the classification information found in table 1 in all three orv categories found in table 1 mounted and portable scientific winches make it possible for research instruments to be manoeuvred with lines for this reason this equipment is of vital importance carral et al 2015b scientific winches are electrically or hydraulically powered they have drums to handle towlines nets or umbilical cables with measuring sensors a characteristic common to all these kinds of equipment is that they handle extensive lengths of line with a high degree of accuracy to adjust the rendering and hauling speed moreover stowage and handling can be carried out with great care to perform a unique function working with the coaxial cables that transmit data carral et al 2015b as for its arrangement on board all this equipment is normally found in a winch room with a common drive unit instead of individual operating systems garcía del valle 2007 1 2 scenarios and scientific missions in the case of the multipurpose approach mentioned earlier vessels take on specialised functions in varying scenarios for a limited period of time in this way they can take part in research campaigns across several fields fig 1 in one branch of oceanography marine biology oliveira et al 2014 the work involves collecting and analysing phytoplankton zooplankton and fish taking benthic and pelagic samples and carrying out an integrated study of ecosystems as well as fisheries research garcía del valle 2007 oliveira et al 2014 point out that research work within the marine biology environment entails adapting the vessel s equipment and services to scientific activity in a study on increasing operational versatility and diversifying the characteristics of their facilities oliveira et al 2014 rosenblatt 1960 ecorys 2014 define the common requirements for designing these vessels so that state of the art devices and research procedures can be used one requirement that stands out is that these vessels must have winches and cranes with high functionality when considering fishing gear and fisheries research from a practical point of view it is useful to distinguish between trawling gear involved in work along the seabed and the gear used in mid depth pelagic waters this study will focus on benthonic species lying along the seabed demersal ones living near the ocean floor or pelagic ones which live in intermediate depths at the same time a wide range of variants come into play in bottom trawling depending on depth and type of manoeuvre being carried out carral et al 2015a santos and núñez 1994 1 3 objectives the aim of this work is to analyse how winches were arranged on deck within a sample of 125 fishing vessels either newly built or refitted in spanish shipyards between 1999 and 2003 carral et al 2015a this was the last time the fleet had been renewed in this country in this study the concept of total traction value for their winches was formulated to propose a relationship between the fishing winch and auxiliary winches thus a proposal could be made to determine the traction necessary for carrying out biological sampling experiment in fisheries science 2 oceanographic winches for fisheries science biological sampling design and specific operational features trends in whichever setting or scenario they are working orvs have winches with drums capable of handling the total amount of line needed to carry out experiments drums are driven by an electric or hydraulic engine whose revolutions and torque are adapted to the required hauling speed and traction through the use of a multistage reducer fig 2 the equipment has a band brake necessary for immobilising the drum whilst the vessel hauls the scientific apparatus 2 1 specific features of their design for this reason winch design is adapted to the type of line rope or cable that is being handled and the scientific device that is pulled at its end carral 2005 on specific occasions special coaxial conductor cables are handled whilst they are involved in hauling these cables transmit sensor information to the vessel carral et al 2017 therefore care must be taken in how they are operated and stowed nsf 2001 amongst the unique design features of scientific winches outlined by carral et al 2015b the ones that are most relevant to fisheries science research will be the focus of this study among these are the characteristics that help them work with extensive lengths of metal cable and the fact that at all times the traction produced by the equipment is known other characteristics are of a more general nature the noiseless way they work and the inalterability of the materials used in their manufacture winches are classified according to their function and the type of experiments that they are involved with table 2 in this table traction value ranges capacity and speeds are determined it is important to mention that in the more elevated ranges of traction value the two main ways in which line traction is produced are through direct traction and friction drive chapter 11 nsf 2001 direct traction means that the drum stores and pulls the line it is commonly used when the traction is not extreme friction drive relies on additional pulleys which pull the coiled cable whilst the main drum serves as storage when the latter system is used the line has an extended service life carral et al 2015b 2 2 trends table 2 shows the relationship between the experiments that are to be carried out and the oceanographic winches involved however the research protocols for doing those experiments have changed over time and winches have been affected by this change pepin and shears 1997 weinberg et al 2002 baumgartner 2003 nishimura and studervant 2011 nishimura and studervant 2011 mention different areas of innovation such as advances in sample net design siler 1983 choat et al 1993 oceanographic sample instruments rudnick and klinke 2007 remotely operated vehicles and acoustic equipment those changes have led to new developments in the mechanisms that electronically control winch sensors theses mechanisms have been integrated into electric hydraulic and mechanical devices dempke and griffin 1997 gordon et al 1998 hooker and maritorena 2000 nishimura and studervant 2011 also point out that an increase in oceanic research in southern seas and ultra deep waters has had an impact on winch design in these conditions winches have to work harder in terms of power and performance griffin and nishimura 2007 griffin 2009 3 winches for fisheries science sampling fishing winches auxiliary winches and net drum arrangement and manoeuvring options 3 1 winches for biological sampling through trawling with a ramp on the transom the sampling method entails towing the sample net over the fishing winch brake after trawling has taken place for a period of time the net is cast by means of the ramp on the transom it is then completely spread out on deck the winches used for fishing ground sampling are the same ones needed for manoeuvring fishing gear warp line traction is maintained with a fishing winch also involved are the bridle winch which handles the bridles cod end turning and paying out winches and the net drum in which the net is stored on board carral et al 2015a however not all of these winches in the list are installed other arrangements exist with different combinations of winches as shown in table 3 several auxiliary components such as blocks carral et al 2015c davits and bipod bows also come into play with the help of auxiliary winches fig 3 and the fishing winch fig 5 the cod end will be hauled and turned on deck for this manoeuvre the deck must be long enough for the net to be used there must also be enough room to fasten the trawling winch along the side of that deck another option is to use a net drum fig 4 which simplifies the retrieval manoeuvre and has room for its stowage during sailing in the attempt to simplify the winch system other arrangements have been developed these are found on deck and make it possible to carry out net manoeuvres 3 2 arrangement options for the manoeuvre as is the case with fishing vessels carral 2005 the way in which the biological sampling equipment is positioned on deck means there are three possible arrangements table 3 the first possibility the type a arrangement fig 6 is to position the fishing winches fig 5 on each side whilst the auxiliary winches fig 3 are placed on the sides of the deck so that they can retrieve and pay out the net the testing net will be stored in a suitable place on deck this arrangement involves a manoeuvre by means of fishing winch and auxiliary winches in a variation of this first option the same winch fig 5 lower section groups together the functions of both a fishing and bridle winch this system is located on the centreline of the vessel with the next possibility the type b arrangement fig 7 split fishing winches are placed on each side fig 5 or the drums are grouped together into one unit at the centreline of the ship in both cases there is a net drum fig 4 on deck above the fishing winch auxiliary winches are not used the net drum will do their work the name of this arrangement is the fishing winch with net drum in the last possibility the type c arrangement fig 8 there is only one centrally located winch it has pulling drums on each side to leave space in the middle for the net drum fig 9 carral 2005 carral et al 2015a it is called the combined winch arrangement with the second and third option the trawling line and bridles can be stowed together in the same drums alternatively the bridle can be stowed in a separate drum santos and nuñez 1994 p 138 fig 5 as for the turning winch the cod end is usually kept to one side on the deck whilst the paying out winch is placed at one end of the stern this means that the three arrangements have winches in common carral et al 2015a 3 3 arrangement considerations there is a clear interaction among all the equipment units that take part in fisheries science sample manoeuvres in this respect it is essential to pay close attention to the following items winches davits warpblocks net drum stern side ramp and winches bipod bows snatch blocks carral 2005 in the first case the winches davits and warp blocks the horizontal and vertical angles determined by the cable with respect to the vessel s longitudinal axis must be kept within the values shown in table 4 4 determining winch traction by defining the traction factor 4 1 determining in theoretical terms the traction factor for biological research vessels the reference carral et al 2016 introduces the traction factor concept for winches located on the deck of an anchor handling tug supply ahts vessel both the ahts and fisheries vessels are manoeuvred along similar lines a main winch is required and its work is facilitated by auxiliary or secondary winches therefore the same traction factor concept can be applied when determining traction for the fishing winch and its auxiliary equipment such as the bridle gilson cod end turning and paying out winches and net drum table 3 the total traction tt of the installed winches mentioned earlier will be an indicator of its capacity to carry out net trawling and manoeuvring operations there must be a reasonable relationship between this and the vessel s towing capacity at low speed expression 1 determines the value of this variable

the coefficients that will have different values as seen in table 5 depending on the arrangement option that is chosen for the scientific winches on deck scientific winches installed on newly built orvs have been analysed in carral et al 2015b however as only a small number of vessels are built each year and their dimensions and missions vary greatly it impossible to draw generalised conclusions about fisheries science sample winches for this reason the winch arrangement options mentioned above were considered in an effort to determine the variation in the value that the total traction tt takes according to each of these options this task involved carrying out a statistical analysis on the trawling vessels built or refitted in spanish shipyards in the five years between 1999 and 2003 carral et al 2015a table 6 outlines those results with data on the number of vessels studied as well as on the fishing winch and auxiliary winches in each case on 48 8 of the fleet in this study the arrangement consisted of fishing winches and a split net drum type b on the rest of the fleet auxiliary or combined winches were installed in equal numbers types a and c larger vessels with a greater total traction value belong to the first category type a smaller vessels have simpler equipment costs types b and c and therefore lower installation and maintenance costs linear regression models were adjusted to explain the relationship between total traction and fishing winch traction as a result three regression models were obtained one for each arrangement type using the determination coefficient r2 as the goodness of fit measurement it can be asserted that in all three cases the relationship between the two variables is linear moreover the resulting models are reliable for estimating the total traction in accordance with the fishing winch traction r2 0 9 in all cases in the significance analysis for each model all parameters are significantly different from zero in fig 10 it can be observed that the type of arrangement influences the total traction dependence according to the fishing winch traction in fact the linear relationship between these two quantitative variables defined by linear regression adjustments is significantly different depending on the type of arrangement chosen the rate of change for the total traction value is higher in type a than it is in type c and b arrangements respectively as there is a similarity between linear regression lines for types c and b the goodness of fit contrast test for linear regression proposed by domowitz was applied domowitz 1982 using the computational tools provided by the plrmodels package of r software aneiros and lópez cheda 2015 a null hypothesis was defined the regression parameter linear trend slope obtained from sample corresponding to the type c is equal to the one obtained from the data for the type b arrangement in other words h0 βc βb where h0 means statistical null hypothesis whereas βc and βb are the linear regression parameters slopes for c and b arrangements respectively using the q test statistic domowitz 1982 distributed as a χ 2 the result is significant with a p value 0 01 corresponding to a q ˆ 0 09 test statistic value obtained from the sample i e the regression parameters could be assumed statistically different the h0 is rejected so that the models for the type b and c arrangements are different for further information about q statistic see domowitz 1982 taking into account how the type of arrangement can play a role a multivariate linear regression model is proposed the aim here is to estimate the total traction according to the fishing winch traction a quantitative variable and the arrangement type a qualitative variable table 7 shows the parameters estimated from the model and their significance all parameters are significant p value 0 05 97 total traction changes can be explained through a linear function of changes in the winch traction and the arrangement type fig 11 shows how the fishing winch traction and type of arrangement affect the answer a higher winch traction means a higher total traction for a rate of change of 2 28 t f per winch t f as shown in table 7 and fig 11 vessels with a type a arrangement have a total traction of 40 611 t f more than boats with a type b arrangement and 33 336 t f more than boats with a type c arrangement type b and c arrangements have been defined as dichotomous or dummy variables 4 2 split auxiliary winch traction fishing bridle gilson and cod end turning and paying out winches by considering a type a arrangement it is possible to study the correlation that exists between fishing winches and split ones bridle gilson turning and retreiving winches table 3 through a statistical analysis of the vessel sample mentioned earlier by implementing and carrying out further analysis on the linear regression models shown in fig 12 one can reveal the strong linear dependence between the gilson and bridle winch traction with respect to the fishing winch in fact linear models in accordance with the fishing winch traction can account for variations of 82 and 83 in bridle and gilson winch tractions respectively on the other hand the significance analysis shows that significance parameters are noteworthy fig 12 provides all the significantly nonzero parameters in the end fishing winch traction has a great influence on the bridle and gilson winch tractions reliable models are obtained for estimating these last two variables however the regression coefficient for the linear modelling of the turning paying out winches traction with respect to the fishing winch traction is not significantly different from zero that is there is no clear linear dependence between the two variables as the determination coefficient is close to zero the main reason has to do with secondary equipment cod end turning and paying out winches playing a lesser role in the manoeuvre as a result the standard winches that are installed are not always specially adapted to each case 4 3 split net drum traction the maximum traction that this equipment must have will depend on the effort required for hoisting the cod end in the transom ramp in this way its width slope and shape will have an influence conditioning the pulling required according to carral 2005 the traction needed by this equipment can be estimated as 1 5 times the pull of the fishing winch once the sample is examined fig 13 top panel for all types of arrangements a linear line is obtained with a high level of uncertainty in this particular case it is not possible to verify the linear dependence of the variables in a statistical way if the type of manoeuvre is taken into account the relationship between the two variables is slightly different from the result for the linear modelling fig 13 bottom panel it seems that it is possible to estimate the net drum traction accurately from the fishing winch traction as long as the manoeuvre is performed with arrangement c regarding the net hauling speed a wide variation range must be shown to allow for the different gear components as a general rule the average speed values that are displayed can fall between 45 and 90 m min carral 2005 once the hauling operation has been completed the gear is stowed in the drum that is the reason why the operation of each vessel is influenced by how one or several drums are positioned when it comes to choosing the best stowage capacity operators may follow any number of approaches thus there can be a range of solutions using a single set of gear or stowing different nets fig 14 shows that the variables are independent 4 4 combined winch traction on this piece of equipment several drums are combined two of these drums will hold the line and carry out auxiliary tasks another two will hold the net drums will be arranged in a cascade distribution in which the lower ones will be used for storing the net fig 9 this unit is operated through a single power system which can be electric or hydraulic nowadays this equipment is usually incorporated into in fishing winch unit carral 2005 which affects the winch the function which the net drums have to carry out during the fishing operation means that they must be as close to the deck as possible a marked change from the traditional winch arrangement this change leads to two results fig 9 net drums will be located in the front part of the winch so that the rest of the device is relegated to a second level the device will increase in height as the other drums used for the line must be raised above the front section in order to carry out their work the traction can be distributed between the net and line drums as desired it is normally the case that 50 of the traction is distributed to the line drums whereas the traction in the net drums is exclusively directed to only one drum the operator can decide which net drum receives the traction 5 conclusions among the unique design features of the winches used for fisheries science research are their high traction values extensive cable length and reduced noise levels another aspect is that the traction value exerted by the equipment is known throughout the operation however it is also necessary to analyse the different ways that winches can be arranged for the task of fishing an analysis was thus carried out on how the winches were arranged on deck as is the case with fishing vessels the biological sampling devices on orvs can have three types of arrangement on deck on 48 8 of the fleet that was studied fishing winches with a split net drum corresponding with a type b arrangement were installed as for the rest of the fleet there is an equal number with auxiliary and combined winches a type a and type c arrangement respectively serving as starting point the proposal for the concept of total traction and the relationship between the main and auxiliary winches make it possible to define the equipment used for scientific sampling this calculation method helps determine which scientific winch components are to be involved in the fisheries sample process one must take into account the traction value for the fishing winch as well as the type of arrangement used to estimate the total traction and the auxiliary winches traction with a type a arrangement through the statistical analysis of the vessel sample the fishing winch pull value determines the tractions of the primary equipment gilson and bridle winches however there is a weak correlation when winches related to secondary manoeuvre operations like turning and paying out are considered in this case the ship owner turns to a standard design that is commercially available nevertheless a wide deck is best for the use of this manoeuvre when the type b arrangement is used the net drum takes part in a double operation it pulls the gear whilst it is hoisting the net and stows the net in its drum moreover a correlation exists between net drum traction and the total traction of fishing winches when the net drum capacity is being determined statistical analysis shows there is little correlation between this and the fishing winch traction this can be explained by the fact that with each vessel and operator different solutions are adopted for example the traction or stowage of a single device may be chosen or several nets may be stored the fact there are low and medium traction values indicates that this arrangement is most suitable for mid or small sized vessels or those with a limited deck length a combined fisheries sample winch or type c arrangement offers unquestionable advantages for fishing operations however when it is used for scientific purposes it appears to have low versatility which makes it less interesting when compared with type a and b arrangements the combined winch might be determined by the high correlation that exists between the total traction value of the equipment and the fishing winch traction

in a separate drum santos and nuñez 1994 p 138 fig 5 as for the turning winch the cod end is usually kept to one side on the deck whilst the paying out winch is placed at one end of the stern this means that the three arrangements have winches in common carral et al 2015a 3 3 arrangement considerations there is a clear interaction among all the equipment units that take part in fisheries science sample manoeuvres in this respect it is essential to pay close attention to the following items winches davits warpblocks net drum stern side ramp and winches bipod bows snatch blocks carral 2005 in the first case the winches davits and warp blocks the horizontal and vertical angles determined by the cable with respect to the vessel s longitudinal axis must be kept within the values shown in table 4 4 determining winch traction by defining the traction factor 4 1 determining in theoretical terms the traction factor for biological research vessels the reference carral et al 2016 introduces the traction factor concept for winches located on the deck of an anchor handling tug supply ahts vessel both the ahts and fisheries vessels are manoeuvred along similar lines a main winch is required and its work is facilitated by auxiliary or secondary winches therefore the same traction factor concept can be applied when determining traction for the fishing winch and its auxiliary equipment such as the bridle gilson cod end turning and paying out winches and net drum table 3 the total traction tt of the installed winches mentioned earlier will be an indicator of its capacity to carry out net trawling and manoeuvring operations there must be a reasonable relationship between this and the vessel s towing capacity at low speed expression 1 determines the value of this variable

the coefficients that will have different values as seen in table 5 depending on the arrangement option that is chosen for the scientific winches on deck scientific winches installed on newly built orvs have been analysed in carral et al 2015b however as only a small number of vessels are built each year and their dimensions and missions vary greatly it impossible to draw generalised conclusions about fisheries science sample winches for this reason the winch arrangement options mentioned above were considered in an effort to determine the variation in the value that the total traction tt takes according to each of these options this task involved carrying out a statistical analysis on the trawling vessels built or refitted in spanish shipyards in the five years between 1999 and 2003 carral et al 2015a table 6 outlines those results with data on the number of vessels studied as well as on the fishing winch and auxiliary winches in each case on 48 8 of the fleet in this study the arrangement consisted of fishing winches and a split net drum type b on the rest of the fleet auxiliary or combined winches were installed in equal numbers types a and c larger vessels with a greater total traction value belong to the first category type a smaller vessels have simpler equipment costs types b and c and therefore lower installation and maintenance costs linear regression models were adjusted to explain the relationship between total traction and fishing winch traction as a result three regression models were obtained one for each arrangement type using the determination coefficient r2 as the goodness of fit measurement it can be asserted that in all three cases the relationship between the two variables is linear moreover the resulting models are reliable for estimating the total traction in accordance with the fishing winch traction r2 0 9 in all cases in the significance analysis for each model all parameters are significantly different from zero in fig 10 it can be observed that the type of arrangement influences the total traction dependence according to the fishing winch traction in fact the linear relationship between these two quantitative variables defined by linear regression adjustments is significantly different depending on the type of arrangement chosen the rate of change for the total traction value is higher in type a than it is in type c and b arrangements respectively as there is a similarity between linear regression lines for types c and b the goodness of fit contrast test for linear regression proposed by domowitz was applied domowitz 1982 using the computational tools provided by the plrmodels package of r software aneiros and lópez cheda 2015 a null hypothesis was defined the regression parameter linear trend slope obtained from sample corresponding to the type c is equal to the one obtained from the data for the type b arrangement in other words h0 βc βb where h0 means statistical null hypothesis whereas βc and βb are the linear regression parameters slopes for c and b arrangements respectively using the q test statistic domowitz 1982 distributed as a χ 2 the result is significant with a p value 0 01 corresponding to a q ˆ 0 09 test statistic value obtained from the sample i e the regression parameters could be assumed statistically different the h0 is rejected so that the models for the type b and c arrangements are different for further information about q statistic see domowitz 1982 taking into account how the type of arrangement can play a role a multivariate linear regression model is proposed the aim here is to estimate the total traction according to the fishing winch traction a quantitative variable and the arrangement type a qualitative variable table 7 shows the parameters estimated from the model and their significance all parameters are significant p value 0 05 97 total traction changes can be explained through a linear function of changes in the winch traction and the arrangement type fig 11 shows how the fishing winch traction and type of arrangement affect the answer a higher winch traction means a higher total traction for a rate of change of 2 28 t f per winch t f as shown in table 7 and fig 11 vessels with a type a arrangement have a total traction of 40 611 t f more than boats with a type b arrangement and 33 336 t f more than boats with a type c arrangement type b and c arrangements have been defined as dichotomous or dummy variables 4 2 split auxiliary winch traction fishing bridle gilson and cod end turning and paying out winches by considering a type a arrangement it is possible to study the correlation that exists between fishing winches and split ones bridle gilson turning and retreiving winches table 3 through a statistical analysis of the vessel sample mentioned earlier by implementing and carrying out further analysis on the linear regression models shown in fig 12 one can reveal the strong linear dependence between the gilson and bridle winch traction with respect to the fishing winch in fact linear models in accordance with the fishing winch traction can account for variations of 82 and 83 in bridle and gilson winch tractions respectively on the other hand the significance analysis shows that significance parameters are noteworthy fig 12 provides all the significantly nonzero parameters in the end fishing winch traction has a great influence on the bridle and gilson winch tractions reliable models are obtained for estimating these last two variables however the regression coefficient for the linear modelling of the turning paying out winches traction with respect to the fishing winch traction is not significantly different from zero that is there is no clear linear dependence between the two variables as the determination coefficient is close to zero the main reason has to do with secondary equipment cod end turning and paying out winches playing a lesser role in the manoeuvre as a result the standard winches that are installed are not always specially adapted to each case 4 3 split net drum traction the maximum traction that this equipment must have will depend on the effort required for hoisting the cod end in the transom ramp in this way its width slope and shape will have an influence conditioning the pulling required according to carral 2005 the traction needed by this equipment can be estimated as 1 5 times the pull of the fishing winch once the sample is examined fig 13 top panel for all types of arrangements a linear line is obtained with a high level of uncertainty in this particular case it is not possible to verify the linear dependence of the variables in a statistical way if the type of manoeuvre is taken into account the relationship between the two variables is slightly different from the result for the linear modelling fig 13 bottom panel it seems that it is possible to estimate the net drum traction accurately from the fishing winch traction as long as the manoeuvre is performed with arrangement c regarding the net hauling speed a wide variation range must be shown to allow for the different gear components as a general rule the average speed values that are displayed can fall between 45 and 90 m min carral 2005 once the hauling operation has been completed the gear is stowed in the drum that is the reason why the operation of each vessel is influenced by how one or several drums are positioned when it comes to choosing the best stowage capacity operators may follow any number of approaches thus there can be a range of solutions using a single set of gear or stowing different nets fig 14 shows that the variables are independent 4 4 combined winch traction on this piece of equipment several drums are combined two of these drums will hold the line and carry out auxiliary tasks another two will hold the net drums will be arranged in a cascade distribution in which the lower ones will be used for storing the net fig 9 this unit is operated through a single power system which can be electric or hydraulic nowadays this equipment is usually incorporated into in fishing winch unit carral 2005 which affects the winch the function which the net drums have to carry out during the fishing operation means that they must be as close to the deck as possible a marked change from the traditional winch arrangement this change leads to two results fig 9 net drums will be located in the front part of the winch so that the rest of the device is relegated to a second level the device will increase in height as the other drums used for the line must be raised above the front section in order to carry out their work the traction can be distributed between the net and line drums as desired it is normally the case that 50 of the traction is distributed to the line drums whereas the traction in the net drums is exclusively directed to only one drum the operator can decide which net drum receives the traction 5 conclusions among the unique design features of the winches used for fisheries science research are their high traction values extensive cable length and reduced noise levels another aspect is that the traction value exerted by the equipment is known throughout the operation however it is also necessary to analyse the different ways that winches can be arranged for the task of fishing an analysis was thus carried out on how the winches were arranged on deck as is the case with fishing vessels the biological sampling devices on orvs can have three types of arrangement on deck on 48 8 of the fleet that was studied fishing winches with a split net drum corresponding with a type b arrangement were installed as for the rest of the fleet there is an equal number with auxiliary and combined winches a type a and type c arrangement respectively serving as starting point the proposal for the concept of total traction and the relationship between the main and auxiliary winches make it possible to define the equipment used for scientific sampling this calculation method helps determine which scientific winch components are to be involved in the fisheries sample process one must take into account the traction value for the fishing winch as well as the type of arrangement used to estimate the total traction and the auxiliary winches traction with a type a arrangement through the statistical analysis of the vessel sample the fishing winch pull value determines the tractions of the primary equipment gilson and bridle winches however there is a weak correlation when winches related to secondary manoeuvre operations like turning and paying out are considered in this case the ship owner turns to a standard design that is commercially available nevertheless a wide deck is best for the use of this manoeuvre when the type b arrangement is used the net drum takes part in a double operation it pulls the gear whilst it is hoisting the net and stows the net in its drum moreover a correlation exists between net drum traction and the total traction of fishing winches when the net drum capacity is being determined statistical analysis shows there is little correlation between this and the fishing winch traction this can be explained by the fact that with each vessel and operator different solutions are adopted for example the traction or stowage of a single device may be chosen or several nets may be stored the fact there are low and medium traction values indicates that this arrangement is most suitable for mid or small sized vessels or those with a limited deck length a combined fisheries sample winch or type c arrangement offers unquestionable advantages for fishing operations however when it is used for scientific purposes it appears to have low versatility which makes it less interesting when compared with type a and b arrangements the combined winch might be determined by the high correlation that exists between the total traction value of the equipment and the fishing winch traction 
23516,the pressure distribution and the hydrodynamic forces on a circular cylinder placed near a plane boundary are investigated experimentally over a range of reynolds numbers re of 1 1 105 4 3 105 and gap g to cylinder diameter d ratio g d of 0 1 0 the objective of the study is to quantify the influence of g d on the force coefficients when the boundary layer on the cylinder surface transits from laminar to turbulent the hydrodynamic forces acting on the cylinder are obtained by integrating the measured pressure around the cylinder surface a significant drag reduction from about 0 9 to 0 35 is observed for g d 0 5 in the range of re 1 9 105 2 7 105 at smaller g d values of 0 25 and 0 1 the drag coefficient shows much less reduction than those observed at larger g d values no obvious

angular position on the cylinder surface 1 introduction offshore pipelines are key infrastructures for transporting oil and gas products across the seabed and are often installed on the seabed directly in medium and deep waters costs for offshore pipelines are often very high partly due to the expensive stabilization measures which can amount up to 30 of the total cost for pipelines the estimated drag acting on pipelines under extreme storm conditions has a significant bearing on the stabilization costs the common practice for estimating hydrodynamic forces on pipelines is to use morrison equation and generally the reynolds number effect is not considered the flow around a smooth circular cylinder is mainly governed by the reynolds number defined as r e u d ν where u is the free stream flow velocity d is the diameter of the cylinder and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the flow the wake flow around a circular cylinder goes through a series of transitions from laminar to turbulent states with the increase of re a pair of stable symmetric vortices is formed in the wake of the cylinder at r e 5 47 which is referred to as the symmetrical mode batchelor 1967 as r e is increased further regular two dimensional vortex shedding is observed at r e 194 williamson 1989 jiang et al 2016 with a further increase of re three dimensional instability occurs in the wake but flow is still in laminar regime up to re 300 williamson 1989 the vortex street in the wake transits to turbulence at higher re bloor 1964 the turbulent flow in the wake is further classified into five different regimes namely the subcritical critical supercritical upper transition and trans critical regimes based on the development of turbulence in the wake and around the cylinder surface the corresponding critical re values for transitions to the critical supercritical upper transition and trans critical regimes are 3 0 105 3 5 105 1 5 106 and 4 106 respectively as summarized by sumer and fredsøe 1997 however it should be noted that these critical re values for different flow regimes are sensitive to a number of factors such as free stream turbulence cylinder surface roughness aspect ratio of the model cylinder blockage ratio of the physical experimental set up etc this causes a certain level of discrepancies among the reported critical re values in the literature turbulence only exists in the wake in the subcritical regime in this flow regime drag coefficient c d and normalized vortex shedding frequency show little dependence on re in the critical flow regime the boundary layer shows intermittent transitions to the turbulent state the transition often starts from one side while the other side remains in the laminar state c d experiences a dramatic reduction from about 1 2 to 0 3 this reduction is named as the drag crisis which is normally referred to the sudden reduction of the drag coefficient as re increases a summary of the drag crisis reported in the literature is given in fig 1 the scatter of the data presented in fig 1 is attributed to the differences in the test setups such as free stream turbulence cylinder end conditions surface roughness blockage ratio etc due to the asymmetric boundary layer transition on the two sides of the cylinder in the critical regime a strong non zero mean lift force on the cylinder is often observed achenbach and heinecke 1981 schewe 1983 cadot et al 2015 reported a study in the range of re 1 25 105 3 75 105 and found that different flow regimes could co exist under the same re values in the range of 3 4 105 3 75 105 with intermittent transitions between different regimes frequently in the supercritical regime with re ranging from 3 5 105 to 1 5 106 turbulent separations occur on both sides of the cylinder the energy of vortices in the wake reduces significantly and c d remains around 0 3 schewe 1983 found when r e is increased from 1 30 105 to 7 2 105 the energy of the dominating frequency is reduced by a factor of 300 in the upper transition regime with re ranging from 1 5 106 to 4 106 the turbulence propagates towards the front stagnation point and the boundary layer becomes fully turbulent on one side of the cylinder but remains partially laminar on the other side at the same time c d experiences a recovery rising from 0 3 to about 0 8 with a further increase of re the boundary layers on the cylinder surface become fully turbulent and the flow enters the transcritical regime the boundary layer transition process for an isolated circular cylinder has been extensively investigated e g zdravkovich 1997 but still remains as an active research topic due to its engineering significance and academic values the influence of free stream turbulence intensity has been studied by many researchers fage 1929 cheung and melbourne 1983 norberg and sunden 1987 blackburn and melbourne 1996 it is found that a high free stream turbulence intensity leads to an early transition to turbulence in the boundary layers on the cylinder surface with a less obvious drag reduction during the drag crisis surface roughness k s of the cylinder also affects the appearance of the drag crisis the critical value of r e for drag crisis decreases with the increase of k s d but the reduction of c d becomes less obvious achenbach and heinecke 1981 the shift of critical value of r e with the increase in k s d is due to the change of separation locations induced by the surface roughness the blockage ratio and the aspect ratio in the experiments also affect the boundary layer transition as investigated by many researchers nishioka and sato 1974 hiwada et al 1979 1983 ramamurthy and lee 1973 richter and naudascher 1976 hiwada et al 1983 west and apelt 1982 richter and naudascher 1976 found that when the blockage ratio is increased to 25 and 50 the transition to supercritical regime happens at r e 2 0 10 5 and 1 1 10 5 respectively this is much lower than the value observed by bearman 1969 which is r e 3 9 10 5 with a blockage ratio of 8 4 the effect of a plane boundary on the flow around a circular cylinder has also attracted substantial research interests in the past a few decades kiya 1968 roshko et al 1975 bearman and zdravkovich 1978 zdravkovich 1985 jensen et al 1990 buresti and lanciotti 1992 lei et al 1999 for a near wall cylinder the flow around the cylinder and hydrodynamic forces acting on the cylinder are affected by the gap to diameter ratio g d plane wall boundary layer thickness to diameter ratio δ d and the turbulence intensity in the boundary layer on the wall bearman and zdravkovich 1978 visualized flow around a circular cylinder near a plane boundary and measured pressure distributions on the cylinder surface and the plane wall at r e 4 5 104 it was reported that vortex shedding was suppressed for g d 0 3 it was also found that c d increases with g d up to a certain value of g d and remains a constant for further increase of g d which links to the influence of the boundary layer thickness in the work of bearman and zdravkovich 1978 a non zero mean lift c l is observed as the cylinder moves close to a plane boundary and c l increases dramatically as g d asymptotes to 0 fredsøe et al 1987 and thomschke 1971 attributed the increase of c l with the reduction of g d to the large suction pressure on the free stream side of the cylinder due to the blockage effect the transition of the boundary layers on a near wall cylinder has not been reported most of the existing studies for a near wall cylinder were carried out in the subcritical regime buresti and lanciotti 1992 measured force coefficients of a near wall cylinder with r e 0 9 105 2 8 105 and g d 0 1 5 among the published work related to a cylinder close to a plane boundary the highest tested r e value was 2 8 105 buresti and lanciotti 1992 but no boundary layer transition on the cylinder was observed or discussed the boundary layer transition process for a near wall cylinder in steady currents remain unknown the influence of g d on the transition process remains an open question from an engineering application point of view the drag crisis remains as an uncertainty to the design of subsea pipelines and power cables because boundary layer transition process for an isolated circular cylinder is associated with a substantial decrease of mean drag an increase of mean lift and a substantial change of vortex shedding frequency although dnv 2010 suggested the drag crisis should be considered for calculating hydrodynamic forces on subsea pipelines no quantitative recommendations are provided for pipeline conditions dnv gl 2017 suggested a drag coefficient of c d 1 to be used for a pipeline installed on a flat seabed with zero gap and zero embedment without any considerations for the effect of r e this drag coefficient seems to be conservative for pipeline stability design based on the drag coefficient reported by buresti and lanciotti 1992 in this work the boundary layer transition on a cylinder close to a plane boundary is investigated through physical experiments a series of model tests were carried out to measure the hydrodynamic forces acting on a smooth circular cylinder in the ranges of re 1 1 105 to 4 1 105 and g d 0 0 01 0 1 0 25 0 5 0 7 and 1 the effects of re and g d on the force coefficients are quantified 2 testing facility and model setup the physical experiments reported in this paper were conducted in the o tube facility at the university of western australia the o tube is a fully closed circulating water channel driven by an axial flow pump the rectangular test section has dimensions of 17 m 1 m 1 m length width depth in which various flow conditions can be generated by controlling the pump speed a detailed introduction about the o tube facility was given by an et al 2013 the model pipe used in the experiments has a diameter of 196 mm and a length of 998 mm the model pipe was installed at the middle of the test section with two supporting arms from an actuator system as shown in fig 2 the actuator system is controlled by a computer and allows the model pipe being fixed at different locations vertically and horizontally two flow laminators were installed at the two ends of the test section to smooth the flow the distance from the laminator to the model pipe was 8 5 m the model pipe was equipped with 16 pore pressure transducers uniformly distributed along the middle cross section the transducers are piezo resistive silicon pressure sensors which use silicon oil to transfer pressure from stainless steel diaphragm to the pressure sensor a filter cover was used for each pressure sensor and the filter surface was machined to maintain a smooth curvature of the model pipe fig 3 a shows a sketch of the setup of the model pipe above a plane wall the centre of the coordinate system is set on the plane wall with x 0 at the centre of the model pipe and the z axis is along the water depth and pointing upwards the angular position on the cylinder surface is defined as θ with θ 0 on the upstream side a photo of the model pipe installed in the test section is given in fig 3 b the hydrodynamic forces on the model pipe was obtained by integrating the measured pressure distributions around the pipe surface a data acquisition system was located in the chamber of the model pipe as shown in fig 3 c a sampling rate of was used in the tests 30 h z the bed beneath the cylinder was made of pvc panels a smooth surface a nortek adv vectrino ii profiler was used to measure flow velocity profiles the adv measures a velocity profile within 35 mm range with a cell size of 1 mm simultaneously the measuring locations were 40 mm 75 mm below the probe of the adv the signal correlation of the adv probes is an important parameter indicating the quality of the data in the present experiments it was found that the first 25 points in the measurement normally have correlation values higher than 90 and the correlation values drop with the increase of the distance to the probe for the other 10 points in the analysis the samples with correlation lower than 90 were removed in this work different free stream flow velocity values were tested from 0 54 m s to 1 98 m s the test at each velocity increment was maintained for 150 s the sampling rate of the adv was set as 50 hz 3 test results 3 1 boundary layer and turbulent intensity measurement the mean velocity and the corresponding turbulence intensity profiles in the boundary layer above the plane boundary of the test section with the cylinder removed are presented in fig 4 a simple regression analysis suggests that velocity profiles within z 0 250 mm follow a logarithmic profile with z 0 on the plane wall the mean flow velocity approaches to the free stream flow velocity for z 250 mm the turbulence intensity i u shown in fig 4 is defined by as i u u 2 u in which u 2 is the root mean square value of the velocity fluctuation and u is the mean value of the free stream velocity it can be seen from fig 4 b that the turbulence intensity increases with the decrease of z for z 120 mm with i u value reaching around 10 11 near the base of the test section while for z 120 mm i u remains about 4 5 in this work the surface of the plane wall is smooth it has been known that the roughness on a plane wall influences the development of the boundary layer profile on the wall schultz and flack 2007 conducted measurements of the rough wall turbulent boundary layer with different roughness height it was found that with the increase of roughness height the boundary layer thickness increases and the tubulent intensity within the boundary layer also increases therefore the drag crisis is expected to be less significant over a rough wall than that over a smooth wall 3 2 pressure distributions around the cylinder the hydrodynamic pressure around the cylinder is investigated in this section to achieve a better understanding of flow regime transitions the pressure coefficient c p is defined as c p p p 0 0 5 ρ u 2 where the reference pressure p 0 is taken as the pressure at θ 0 ρ is water density 1 000 kg m3 for an isolated cylinder in steady currents the distribution of c p around a cylinder has been well investigated and understood the minimum value of c p defined as c p m i n is around 1 5 2 in the subcritical regime and shows a significant reduction to around 3 5 in the supercritical regime zdravkovich 1997 in the critical regime the pressure drop only happens to one side and leads to an asymmetry distribution of c p when the transition only occurs on one side of the cylinder surface based on the above feature the distributions of c p and c p m i n are used to examine the state of the boundary layer on the cylinder surface fig 5 shows a comparison of the pressure distributions measured at re 1 1 105 in this work with that presented by bearman and zdravkovich 1978 a reasonable agreement is observed the discrepancy is attributed to the difference in the boundary layer profiles in the two works the mean pressure distributions around the cylinder at nine different r e values and different gap ratios are shown in fig 6 the pressure distributions are classified into two groups according to the influence level of the plane boundary on flow regime transitions the first group includes the cases with g d 1 0 0 7 and 0 5 where the flow regime transition is clearly identified based on the c p distribution in the second group g d 0 25 0 1 0 01 and 0 the flow regime transition is less obvious than that shown in the first group see fig 7 in the first group where g d is relatively large the influence of re has on the pressure distributions is obvious for example in the case with g d 1 0 shown in fig 6 a c p b experiences only a slight change from about 2 2 to about 1 75 as r e increases from 1 1 105 to 1 9 105 the c p b is defined as the average value of the nearly constant pressure coefficient in the wake region following güven et al 1980 as re increases from 1 9 105 to 2 7 105 the pressure distribution experiences the following changes 1 significant drop happens to c p m i n 2 an increase of c p b is observed 3 c p min t o p is lower than c p m i n g a p and this becomes more pronounced as g d is reduced the three changes are the typical characteristics of the boundary layer transition to turbulence for an isolated circular cylinder zdravkovich 1997 based on the features observed above the flow with g d 1 0 is deemed in the critical regime for re 1 9 105 to 2 7 105 with a further increase of re from 2 7 105 the pressure distributions change little this indicates that the flow is in the supercritical regime the trends observed in the cases with g d 0 7 and 0 5 are very similar to that observed with g d 1 0 in the second group fig 6 d e f and g the gap ratios are relatively small and the effect of r e on the distribution of c p is less obvious only a minor change to the pressure distribution is observed from r e 1 1 105 to 1 9 105 for the cases with g d 0 25 and 0 1 for g d 0 01 r e only affects c p m i n g a p measured at θ 270 however it is noticed that c p m i n g a p at g d 0 01 is still comparable to that at g d 0 1 when the gap is fully closed g d 0 c p m i n g a p recovers significantly and the overall distribution of c p is not affected by r e this indicates that the lift force is very sensitive to g d at small g d which will be explained in the following section the flow regime transition to the supercritical is identified through the feature of c p curves given in the first group fig 6 a b and c based on the similar features observed from an isolated cylinder such a transition feature is expected for all gap ratios from 0 to for g d 1 not tested in this work the influence of the plane wall is expected to be minor and the regime transition of flow around the cylinder is similar to the isolated cylinder condition the flow for g d 0 25 tested in this work are mostly in the supercritical regime justified from c p m i n values no subcritical regime flows at these low gap ratio conditions the second group were captured within the tested range of r e the existing studies in the literature reported the existence of the subcritical state at low g d conditions bearman and zdravkovich 1978 reported a detailed measurement of pressure coefficients for a cylinder with g d 0 3 and r e 0 48 105 fig 7 the c p m i n t o p value achieved by bearman and zdravkovich 1978 was 1 1 at g d 0 and 1 6 at g d 0 1 respectively these two values are significantly lower than the values measured in the present study with r e 1 1 105 for g d 0 and 0 1 this suggests that the flows investigated by bearman and zdravkovich 1978 were in the subcritical regime and the corresponding ones in this work are in the supercritical regime this allows us to believe that the transition from the subcritical to the supercritical regime exists at all gap ratios the critical r e value for the transition to the supercritical regime defined as r e c r is identified based on the pressure distributions shown in fig 6 for most of the g d values except for g d 0 and 0 01 a summary of r e c r is given in fig 8 it can be seen that r e c r is a constant value of 2 6 105 for g d 0 5 and reduces with the reduction of g d for g d 0 5 it is believed that this due to the increase of turbulence intensity as shown in fig 4 for z d 0 6 this is similar to the effect of the free stream turbulence level on the flow regime transition for an isolated cylinder when the cylinder is close to the plane wall the wall proximity affects the distribution of c p based on the fitted curves of the data points in fig 6 the angular position of c p m i n g a p shifts towards downstream direction when g d is reduced from 1 to 0 01 for most of the r e values this indicates that the separation point on the gap side moves towards downstream direction since the separation point is normally about 10 downstream of the location of the c p m i n as reported by tani 1964 it has been known that the flow separation from a cylinder surface is due to the adverse pressure gradient clancy 1975 if the pressure shows a reduction trend along the flow direction it tends to stabilize the flow from separation and this is called a favorable pressure gradient as an example the area with adverse pressure gradient on the gap side are marked between line 1 and 2 in fig 6 f and the favorable pressure gradient is labelled between line 2 and 3 the favorable pressure gradient on the gap side is due to the wall proximity and this postpones the flow separation on the gap side for g d 0 1 and 0 01 fig 6 e and f the favorable pressure gradient is obviously stronger on the gap side than that on the top side hiwada et al 1986 demonstrated a very similar feature of the separation point shift with the reduction of g d at re 2 104 it should be noted that c p m i n is determined from the fitted curves and the separation points are deduced from the locations of c p m i n it is admitted that such a method may not be always accurate more accurate results could be achieved by refining the measurement of c p or using a shear stress probe directly on the cylinder surface it is noted that for g d 0 25 shown in fig 6 d only the lower side of the cylinder surface is at the level of high turbulence intensity z d 0 6 as shown in fig 4 however transition also happens on the top side in this case this is attributed to the following reason when the cylinder is placed closing to the plane wall the stagnation point moves towards to the gap side sumer and fredsøe 1997 because of the wall proximity due to this feature a part of the flow with relatively high turbulent intensity will be deviated to the top side of the cylinder cheung and melbourne 1983 demonstrated that boundary layer transition on the cylinder surface happens at a lower re value when the upstream turbulence intensity is increased this explains the early transition on the top side at a relatively low r e value of 1 1 105 some key features of the pressure distribution are summarized in fig 9 which includes the c p m i n the difference between base pressure and minimum pressure c p b c p m i n and the wake width φ which is the angle distance between two turbulent separation points corresponding to a near constant c p in the wake c p b for an isolated cylinder the wake width depends on states of the boundary layer on the cylinder surface as summarized by zdravkovich 1997 these three values c p m i n c p b c p m i n and φ are often used in identifying the transition from the subcritical to the supercritical regime in the literature for an isolated cylinder c p b experiences a dramatic change when the drag crisis happens it has been known that the negative base pressure on the downstream side of the cylinder is induced by the vortices formed after flow separations the vortices in the wake of a cylinder in the supercritical regime are much weaker than that in the subcritical regime therefore the base pressure coefficient is higher than that of the supercritical flow the increase of the base pressure is also the reason for the reduction of the drag coefficient related to the drag crisis the effect of re on the base pressure is also observed in the present test results for example at g d 1 0 c p b 2 05 is observed at re 1 1 105 this is in a close agreement with that of an isolated cylinder c p b 2 2 at re 1 1 105 as reported by achenbach 1968 an increase of the base pressure can be observed in the range of re 1 1 105 to 2 7 105 the c p b remains almost a constant value of 1 25 for re 2 7 105 this suggests that the flow transition to the supercritical regime happens at around r e 2 7 105 for g d 1 for g d 0 75 and 0 5 the trend of c p b is very similar to that of g d 1 and the transition to supercritical regime happens at the same r e but c p b in the supercritical regime is about 1 4 slightly lower than that of g d 1 for g d 0 25 the recovery of c p b with re also happens but in a more gradual manner for g d 0 0 01 and 0 1 only very minor increases are observed in the range of r e 1 1 105 to 1 4 105 this also indicates that the transition to the supercritical regime happens at lower re values than the minimum re tested for g d 0 25 the minimum pressure coefficient c p m i n is also sensitive to g d and re as shown in fig 6 as discussed by achenbach 1968 roshko 1961 and van nunen 1974 c p b c p m i n represents the adverse pressure recovery in the wake since the flow is asymmetrical on the top and bottom sides of the cylinder c p b c p m i n t o p and c p b c p m i n g a p are presented separately in fig 9 b and c for g d 1 0 7 0 5 and 0 25 c p b c p m i n t o p increases with re and reaches the maximum value around 2 0 at r e 2 7 105 and then a minor reduction happens with further increase of re once again this demonstrates that the transition to the supercritical regime occurs at r e 2 7 105 for g d 0 25 for g d 0 1 0 01 and 0 no clear transition is observed this is consistent with the observations from the pressure distributions shown in fig 6 fig 9 b and c show similar features the wake width φ decreases from around 180 to 110 for g d 0 5 0 75 and 1 as re falls into the supercritical regime which is caused by the delay of flow separations for g d 0 25 φ keeps almost constant at around 115 regardless of re which suggests that the transition has had occurred in this range of r e for these g d conditions 3 3 drag and lift force coefficients the force coefficients on the cylinder are examined in this section the incoming flow velocity is increased in steps as shown in fig 10 a the drag and lift coefficient are defined as c d f d 0 5 ρ d u 2 and c l f l 0 5 ρ d u 2 respectively where f d and f l are the instantaneous hydrodynamic force in the horizontal and vertical directions drag and lift and are calculated based on the pressure distribution measured along the middle cross section of the model pipe the time histories of the measured drag coefficient for g d 1 0 25 and 0 are presented in fig 10 b c and d respectively the following features are observed firstly the reduction trend of c d with the increase of flow velocity indicates the existence of drag crisis for a near wall cylinder except for g d 0 the other feature shown in fig 10 is that the fluctuations of the drag forces become rather weak after the reduction of c d which suggests weak vortex shedding in this range of re the mean drag and lift force coefficients c d and c l are calculated and further analyzed fig 11 shows the comparison of the present c d for g d 1 with c d for an isolated circular cylinder cheung and melbourne 1983 schewe 1983 cadot et al 2015 the turbulence intensity values measured in the independent test cases were 4 4 0 4 and 0 1 respectively the present result is in a good agreement with cheung and melbourne 1983 but shows obvious differences from those reported by schewe 1983 and cadot et al 2015 this is mainly attributed to the high turbulence intensity i u 4 5 in this study which is very close to the value in tests by cheung and melbourne 1983 the variation trends of c d with g d and re are shown in fig 12 a some common features are observed for cases with g d 0 5 0 7 and 1 0 firstly c d experiences a minor reduction from about 1 12 to about 0 91 as re increases from 1 1 105 to 1 9 105 the flow is believed to be in the subcritical regime up to 1 9 105 for g d 0 5 0 7 and 1 0 the reduction of c d is due to the weakening of the vortex shedding in the wake as observed by cadot et al 2015 secondly more significant rapid reductions from 0 91 to about 0 35 are observed in the range of re 1 9 105 to 2 7 105 the observed rapid drag reduction with the increase of re is a typical feature of drag crisis for an isolated cylinder this drag reduction is induced by the recovery of the negative pressure on the rear side of the cylinder fig 6 a associated with the boundary layer transition achenbach 1968 this observation leads to the same conclusion that the transition from the subcritical regime to the critical regime occurs in the range of re 1 9 105 to 2 7 105 as that derived based on the distribution of c p thirdly as re further increases from 2 7 105 c d is not sensitive to the variation of re within the tested range suggesting the flow is in the supercritical regime lastly the regime transition from the subcritical to the supercritical happens in a narrow range of r e for g d 0 5 0 7 and 1 0 for the case with g d 0 25 shown in fig 12 a unlike the cases with g d 0 25 a continuous reduction trend of c d is observed for re 1 1 105 2 7 105 and c d remains around a constant of 0 4 for re 2 7 105 the drag reduction rate with re is still substantial for 1 1 105 re 1 9 105 although it is smaller than those for cases with g d 0 5 0 7 and 1 0 judging on this it is believed that the transition to turbulence in the cylinder boundary layers does occur in the range of 1 1 105 re 2 7 105 for the case with g d 0 25 although the exact critical r e for the onset of this transition is not known a similar variation trend of c d is also observed for the case with g d 0 1 where c d is reduced from 0 8 to 0 52 in the range of re 1 1 105 1 9 105 and c d remains around a constant of 0 52 for re 1 9 105 therefore it is believed that the boundary transition to turbulence also occurs for the case with g d 0 1 the c d shows a small reduction rate and amplitude for g d 0 01 from 0 64 to about 0 56 over re 1 1 105 1 5 105 for the case with g d 0 c d keeps almost a constant of 0 71 within the tested range of r e this appears to support the conclusion that no boundary layer transition occurs in the range of re tested in this study for g d 0 0 and 0 01 the following generalizations are made based on the above observations 1 the critical re for the onset of transition decreases with the decrease of g d 2 the reduction rate and the reduction amplitude of c d during transition decrease with the decrease of g d and 3 the critical re for the supercritical regime also decreases with the decrease of g d the above features are very similar to the effect of free stream turbulence level on the c d values for an isolated cylinder cheung and melbourne 1983 therefore the turbulence level in the wall boundary layer plays an important role for the boundary layer transition process for a near wall cylinder for an isolated cylinder c l remains zero for flows in the subcritical and supercritical regimes but a significant non zero c l value up to 1 exists in the critical regime due to the different boundary layer states on the two sides of the cylinder surface laminar state on one side and turbulent state on the other side schewe 1983 cadot et al 2015 this non zero c l was only observed when the free stream turbulence level is very low for example i u 0 4 and 0 1 for schewe 1983 and cadot et al 2015 respectively the non zero c l was not observed in the critical regime by cheung and melbourne 1983 for the flow with i u 4 4 9 1 or so and savkar 1981 for flow with i u 9 5 this indicates that c l is not affected by r e for relatively high i u conditions even in the re range of transition from the subcritical to the critical and then to the super critical regime in the present work with i u 4 10 it is therefore not expected that c l would experience a significant change due to flow regime transitions fig 12 b shows the effect of g d on c l at different r e values as expected there is not a significant change of c l with r e when the flow regime transition happens however local peaks of c l are found in the range of re 2 3 10 5 3 9 10 5 for g d 1 0 25 it is suspected that the boundary layer on the plane wall could experience certain changes within the range of re and this triggers the variation of c l although this needs to be confirmed by a detailed measurement of pressure and shear stress on the plane wall for a certain g d value c l increases with the reduction of g d in general which agrees quite well with the results of buresti and lanciotti 1992 and thomschke 1971 it should be realized that the force coefficients shown in fig 11 are corresponding to the boundary layer conditions given in fig 4 different boundary layer profiles will lead to a change of c d c l and the flow structures around the cylinder fredsøe and hansen 1987 compared c l at two different boundary layer thickness δ d 0 and 5 over the range of g d 0 0 25 it was found that c l is significantly higher for δ d 0 in the range of g d 0 0 1 lei et al 1999 measured c d and c l at 6 different wall boundary layer thickness δ d 0 14 2 89 and found that the boundary layer influences the flow around the circular cylinder in two ways displacing the front stagnation point and varying the base pressure it is speculated that the velocity profiles in the boundary layer also affects the transition process this will be further investigated in future work 4 engineering implications the present work is relevant to the engineering application of hydrodynamic forces on a free spanning subsea pipeline the results show that the boundary layer transition has a significant effect on the force coefficients on pipelines which are the key parameters required in the stability design of offshore pipelines holloway et al 2001 presented the measurement of tidal flow at the north west shelf region of australia a peak tidal current of 0 2 m s was measured in the water depth of 200 m 400 m in this water depth the surface wave induced flow is less significant due to the large water depth therefore the hydrodynamic force on a subsea pipeline is dominated by steady currents the diameter of a subsea pipeline is normally in the range of 3 inches 76 mm for flow lines to 72 inches 1 8 m for high capacity trunk lines dean 2010 this corresponds to a re range of 1 56 104 3 0 105 for a current velocity of 0 2 m s on the other hand the turbulence measured in the present work is about 10 near the plane wall which is close to the near seabed turbulence intensity in tidal flow measured by bowden 1962 12 15 it can be seen that the re range and the flow turbulence intensity investigated in this work are well representative of those in prototype applications based on the r e c r shown in fig 8 a series of curve for u d ν r e c r are plotted in fig 13 the curves provide the threshold velocity magnitudes beyond which the drag crisis is expected for a range of pipeline diameters and gap ratios 5 conclusions a series of model tests were conducted using the o tube facility to investigate the drag and lift coefficients under the effect of boundary layer transition for a circular cylinder near a plane boundary the pressure around the cylinder was measured in the range of r e 1 1 105 4 3 105 and the force coefficients were analyzed the main conclusions are summarized as below a for g d 0 5 drag crisis happens in the range of r e 1 9 105 2 7 105 c d reduces to about 0 35 after the drag crisis b for g d 0 25 drag crisis still exists but happens at lower re values than the minimum re tested in the present study the reduction of r e c r for small gap ratios is mainly due to the high turbulence intensity close to the plane boundary for the smallest gap ratio tested in this work g d 0 c d value is around 0 71 and it shows a very low sensitivity to re within the tested range of re c reynolds number has a less effect on lift coefficient than on drag coefficient the general trend found in this work is that the lift coefficient reduces with the increase of gap ratio no flow asymmetry due to successive transition is observed in the critical regime g d d the wall proximity effect tends to delay the gap side separation on the cylinder surface due to the favorable pressure gradient this is a common feature for flow with boundary layer in both laminar and turbulent state e the testing conditions covered in this work are in the range of

23516,the pressure distribution and the hydrodynamic forces on a circular cylinder placed near a plane boundary are investigated experimentally over a range of reynolds numbers re of 1 1 105 4 3 105 and gap g to cylinder diameter d ratio g d of 0 1 0 the objective of the study is to quantify the influence of g d on the force coefficients when the boundary layer on the cylinder surface transits from laminar to turbulent the hydrodynamic forces acting on the cylinder are obtained by integrating the measured pressure around the cylinder surface a significant drag reduction from about 0 9 to 0 35 is observed for g d 0 5 in the range of re 1 9 105 2 7 105 at smaller g d values of 0 25 and 0 1 the drag coefficient shows much less reduction than those observed at larger g d values no obvious

angular position on the cylinder surface 1 introduction offshore pipelines are key infrastructures for transporting oil and gas products across the seabed and are often installed on the seabed directly in medium and deep waters costs for offshore pipelines are often very high partly due to the expensive stabilization measures which can amount up to 30 of the total cost for pipelines the estimated drag acting on pipelines under extreme storm conditions has a significant bearing on the stabilization costs the common practice for estimating hydrodynamic forces on pipelines is to use morrison equation and generally the reynolds number effect is not considered the flow around a smooth circular cylinder is mainly governed by the reynolds number defined as r e u d ν where u is the free stream flow velocity d is the diameter of the cylinder and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the flow the wake flow around a circular cylinder goes through a series of transitions from laminar to turbulent states with the increase of re a pair of stable symmetric vortices is formed in the wake of the cylinder at r e 5 47 which is referred to as the symmetrical mode batchelor 1967 as r e is increased further regular two dimensional vortex shedding is observed at r e 194 williamson 1989 jiang et al 2016 with a further increase of re three dimensional instability occurs in the wake but flow is still in laminar regime up to re 300 williamson 1989 the vortex street in the wake transits to turbulence at higher re bloor 1964 the turbulent flow in the wake is further classified into five different regimes namely the subcritical critical supercritical upper transition and trans critical regimes based on the development of turbulence in the wake and around the cylinder surface the corresponding critical re values for transitions to the critical supercritical upper transition and trans critical regimes are 3 0 105 3 5 105 1 5 106 and 4 106 respectively as summarized by sumer and fredsøe 1997 however it should be noted that these critical re values for different flow regimes are sensitive to a number of factors such as free stream turbulence cylinder surface roughness aspect ratio of the model cylinder blockage ratio of the physical experimental set up etc this causes a certain level of discrepancies among the reported critical re values in the literature turbulence only exists in the wake in the subcritical regime in this flow regime drag coefficient c d and normalized vortex shedding frequency show little dependence on re in the critical flow regime the boundary layer shows intermittent transitions to the turbulent state the transition often starts from one side while the other side remains in the laminar state c d experiences a dramatic reduction from about 1 2 to 0 3 this reduction is named as the drag crisis which is normally referred to the sudden reduction of the drag coefficient as re increases a summary of the drag crisis reported in the literature is given in fig 1 the scatter of the data presented in fig 1 is attributed to the differences in the test setups such as free stream turbulence cylinder end conditions surface roughness blockage ratio etc due to the asymmetric boundary layer transition on the two sides of the cylinder in the critical regime a strong non zero mean lift force on the cylinder is often observed achenbach and heinecke 1981 schewe 1983 cadot et al 2015 reported a study in the range of re 1 25 105 3 75 105 and found that different flow regimes could co exist under the same re values in the range of 3 4 105 3 75 105 with intermittent transitions between different regimes frequently in the supercritical regime with re ranging from 3 5 105 to 1 5 106 turbulent separations occur on both sides of the cylinder the energy of vortices in the wake reduces significantly and c d remains around 0 3 schewe 1983 found when r e is increased from 1 30 105 to 7 2 105 the energy of the dominating frequency is reduced by a factor of 300 in the upper transition regime with re ranging from 1 5 106 to 4 106 the turbulence propagates towards the front stagnation point and the boundary layer becomes fully turbulent on one side of the cylinder but remains partially laminar on the other side at the same time c d experiences a recovery rising from 0 3 to about 0 8 with a further increase of re the boundary layers on the cylinder surface become fully turbulent and the flow enters the transcritical regime the boundary layer transition process for an isolated circular cylinder has been extensively investigated e g zdravkovich 1997 but still remains as an active research topic due to its engineering significance and academic values the influence of free stream turbulence intensity has been studied by many researchers fage 1929 cheung and melbourne 1983 norberg and sunden 1987 blackburn and melbourne 1996 it is found that a high free stream turbulence intensity leads to an early transition to turbulence in the boundary layers on the cylinder surface with a less obvious drag reduction during the drag crisis surface roughness k s of the cylinder also affects the appearance of the drag crisis the critical value of r e for drag crisis decreases with the increase of k s d but the reduction of c d becomes less obvious achenbach and heinecke 1981 the shift of critical value of r e with the increase in k s d is due to the change of separation locations induced by the surface roughness the blockage ratio and the aspect ratio in the experiments also affect the boundary layer transition as investigated by many researchers nishioka and sato 1974 hiwada et al 1979 1983 ramamurthy and lee 1973 richter and naudascher 1976 hiwada et al 1983 west and apelt 1982 richter and naudascher 1976 found that when the blockage ratio is increased to 25 and 50 the transition to supercritical regime happens at r e 2 0 10 5 and 1 1 10 5 respectively this is much lower than the value observed by bearman 1969 which is r e 3 9 10 5 with a blockage ratio of 8 4 the effect of a plane boundary on the flow around a circular cylinder has also attracted substantial research interests in the past a few decades kiya 1968 roshko et al 1975 bearman and zdravkovich 1978 zdravkovich 1985 jensen et al 1990 buresti and lanciotti 1992 lei et al 1999 for a near wall cylinder the flow around the cylinder and hydrodynamic forces acting on the cylinder are affected by the gap to diameter ratio g d plane wall boundary layer thickness to diameter ratio δ d and the turbulence intensity in the boundary layer on the wall bearman and zdravkovich 1978 visualized flow around a circular cylinder near a plane boundary and measured pressure distributions on the cylinder surface and the plane wall at r e 4 5 104 it was reported that vortex shedding was suppressed for g d 0 3 it was also found that c d increases with g d up to a certain value of g d and remains a constant for further increase of g d which links to the influence of the boundary layer thickness in the work of bearman and zdravkovich 1978 a non zero mean lift c l is observed as the cylinder moves close to a plane boundary and c l increases dramatically as g d asymptotes to 0 fredsøe et al 1987 and thomschke 1971 attributed the increase of c l with the reduction of g d to the large suction pressure on the free stream side of the cylinder due to the blockage effect the transition of the boundary layers on a near wall cylinder has not been reported most of the existing studies for a near wall cylinder were carried out in the subcritical regime buresti and lanciotti 1992 measured force coefficients of a near wall cylinder with r e 0 9 105 2 8 105 and g d 0 1 5 among the published work related to a cylinder close to a plane boundary the highest tested r e value was 2 8 105 buresti and lanciotti 1992 but no boundary layer transition on the cylinder was observed or discussed the boundary layer transition process for a near wall cylinder in steady currents remain unknown the influence of g d on the transition process remains an open question from an engineering application point of view the drag crisis remains as an uncertainty to the design of subsea pipelines and power cables because boundary layer transition process for an isolated circular cylinder is associated with a substantial decrease of mean drag an increase of mean lift and a substantial change of vortex shedding frequency although dnv 2010 suggested the drag crisis should be considered for calculating hydrodynamic forces on subsea pipelines no quantitative recommendations are provided for pipeline conditions dnv gl 2017 suggested a drag coefficient of c d 1 to be used for a pipeline installed on a flat seabed with zero gap and zero embedment without any considerations for the effect of r e this drag coefficient seems to be conservative for pipeline stability design based on the drag coefficient reported by buresti and lanciotti 1992 in this work the boundary layer transition on a cylinder close to a plane boundary is investigated through physical experiments a series of model tests were carried out to measure the hydrodynamic forces acting on a smooth circular cylinder in the ranges of re 1 1 105 to 4 1 105 and g d 0 0 01 0 1 0 25 0 5 0 7 and 1 the effects of re and g d on the force coefficients are quantified 2 testing facility and model setup the physical experiments reported in this paper were conducted in the o tube facility at the university of western australia the o tube is a fully closed circulating water channel driven by an axial flow pump the rectangular test section has dimensions of 17 m 1 m 1 m length width depth in which various flow conditions can be generated by controlling the pump speed a detailed introduction about the o tube facility was given by an et al 2013 the model pipe used in the experiments has a diameter of 196 mm and a length of 998 mm the model pipe was installed at the middle of the test section with two supporting arms from an actuator system as shown in fig 2 the actuator system is controlled by a computer and allows the model pipe being fixed at different locations vertically and horizontally two flow laminators were installed at the two ends of the test section to smooth the flow the distance from the laminator to the model pipe was 8 5 m the model pipe was equipped with 16 pore pressure transducers uniformly distributed along the middle cross section the transducers are piezo resistive silicon pressure sensors which use silicon oil to transfer pressure from stainless steel diaphragm to the pressure sensor a filter cover was used for each pressure sensor and the filter surface was machined to maintain a smooth curvature of the model pipe fig 3 a shows a sketch of the setup of the model pipe above a plane wall the centre of the coordinate system is set on the plane wall with x 0 at the centre of the model pipe and the z axis is along the water depth and pointing upwards the angular position on the cylinder surface is defined as θ with θ 0 on the upstream side a photo of the model pipe installed in the test section is given in fig 3 b the hydrodynamic forces on the model pipe was obtained by integrating the measured pressure distributions around the pipe surface a data acquisition system was located in the chamber of the model pipe as shown in fig 3 c a sampling rate of was used in the tests 30 h z the bed beneath the cylinder was made of pvc panels a smooth surface a nortek adv vectrino ii profiler was used to measure flow velocity profiles the adv measures a velocity profile within 35 mm range with a cell size of 1 mm simultaneously the measuring locations were 40 mm 75 mm below the probe of the adv the signal correlation of the adv probes is an important parameter indicating the quality of the data in the present experiments it was found that the first 25 points in the measurement normally have correlation values higher than 90 and the correlation values drop with the increase of the distance to the probe for the other 10 points in the analysis the samples with correlation lower than 90 were removed in this work different free stream flow velocity values were tested from 0 54 m s to 1 98 m s the test at each velocity increment was maintained for 150 s the sampling rate of the adv was set as 50 hz 3 test results 3 1 boundary layer and turbulent intensity measurement the mean velocity and the corresponding turbulence intensity profiles in the boundary layer above the plane boundary of the test section with the cylinder removed are presented in fig 4 a simple regression analysis suggests that velocity profiles within z 0 250 mm follow a logarithmic profile with z 0 on the plane wall the mean flow velocity approaches to the free stream flow velocity for z 250 mm the turbulence intensity i u shown in fig 4 is defined by as i u u 2 u in which u 2 is the root mean square value of the velocity fluctuation and u is the mean value of the free stream velocity it can be seen from fig 4 b that the turbulence intensity increases with the decrease of z for z 120 mm with i u value reaching around 10 11 near the base of the test section while for z 120 mm i u remains about 4 5 in this work the surface of the plane wall is smooth it has been known that the roughness on a plane wall influences the development of the boundary layer profile on the wall schultz and flack 2007 conducted measurements of the rough wall turbulent boundary layer with different roughness height it was found that with the increase of roughness height the boundary layer thickness increases and the tubulent intensity within the boundary layer also increases therefore the drag crisis is expected to be less significant over a rough wall than that over a smooth wall 3 2 pressure distributions around the cylinder the hydrodynamic pressure around the cylinder is investigated in this section to achieve a better understanding of flow regime transitions the pressure coefficient c p is defined as c p p p 0 0 5 ρ u 2 where the reference pressure p 0 is taken as the pressure at θ 0 ρ is water density 1 000 kg m3 for an isolated cylinder in steady currents the distribution of c p around a cylinder has been well investigated and understood the minimum value of c p defined as c p m i n is around 1 5 2 in the subcritical regime and shows a significant reduction to around 3 5 in the supercritical regime zdravkovich 1997 in the critical regime the pressure drop only happens to one side and leads to an asymmetry distribution of c p when the transition only occurs on one side of the cylinder surface based on the above feature the distributions of c p and c p m i n are used to examine the state of the boundary layer on the cylinder surface fig 5 shows a comparison of the pressure distributions measured at re 1 1 105 in this work with that presented by bearman and zdravkovich 1978 a reasonable agreement is observed the discrepancy is attributed to the difference in the boundary layer profiles in the two works the mean pressure distributions around the cylinder at nine different r e values and different gap ratios are shown in fig 6 the pressure distributions are classified into two groups according to the influence level of the plane boundary on flow regime transitions the first group includes the cases with g d 1 0 0 7 and 0 5 where the flow regime transition is clearly identified based on the c p distribution in the second group g d 0 25 0 1 0 01 and 0 the flow regime transition is less obvious than that shown in the first group see fig 7 in the first group where g d is relatively large the influence of re has on the pressure distributions is obvious for example in the case with g d 1 0 shown in fig 6 a c p b experiences only a slight change from about 2 2 to about 1 75 as r e increases from 1 1 105 to 1 9 105 the c p b is defined as the average value of the nearly constant pressure coefficient in the wake region following güven et al 1980 as re increases from 1 9 105 to 2 7 105 the pressure distribution experiences the following changes 1 significant drop happens to c p m i n 2 an increase of c p b is observed 3 c p min t o p is lower than c p m i n g a p and this becomes more pronounced as g d is reduced the three changes are the typical characteristics of the boundary layer transition to turbulence for an isolated circular cylinder zdravkovich 1997 based on the features observed above the flow with g d 1 0 is deemed in the critical regime for re 1 9 105 to 2 7 105 with a further increase of re from 2 7 105 the pressure distributions change little this indicates that the flow is in the supercritical regime the trends observed in the cases with g d 0 7 and 0 5 are very similar to that observed with g d 1 0 in the second group fig 6 d e f and g the gap ratios are relatively small and the effect of r e on the distribution of c p is less obvious only a minor change to the pressure distribution is observed from r e 1 1 105 to 1 9 105 for the cases with g d 0 25 and 0 1 for g d 0 01 r e only affects c p m i n g a p measured at θ 270 however it is noticed that c p m i n g a p at g d 0 01 is still comparable to that at g d 0 1 when the gap is fully closed g d 0 c p m i n g a p recovers significantly and the overall distribution of c p is not affected by r e this indicates that the lift force is very sensitive to g d at small g d which will be explained in the following section the flow regime transition to the supercritical is identified through the feature of c p curves given in the first group fig 6 a b and c based on the similar features observed from an isolated cylinder such a transition feature is expected for all gap ratios from 0 to for g d 1 not tested in this work the influence of the plane wall is expected to be minor and the regime transition of flow around the cylinder is similar to the isolated cylinder condition the flow for g d 0 25 tested in this work are mostly in the supercritical regime justified from c p m i n values no subcritical regime flows at these low gap ratio conditions the second group were captured within the tested range of r e the existing studies in the literature reported the existence of the subcritical state at low g d conditions bearman and zdravkovich 1978 reported a detailed measurement of pressure coefficients for a cylinder with g d 0 3 and r e 0 48 105 fig 7 the c p m i n t o p value achieved by bearman and zdravkovich 1978 was 1 1 at g d 0 and 1 6 at g d 0 1 respectively these two values are significantly lower than the values measured in the present study with r e 1 1 105 for g d 0 and 0 1 this suggests that the flows investigated by bearman and zdravkovich 1978 were in the subcritical regime and the corresponding ones in this work are in the supercritical regime this allows us to believe that the transition from the subcritical to the supercritical regime exists at all gap ratios the critical r e value for the transition to the supercritical regime defined as r e c r is identified based on the pressure distributions shown in fig 6 for most of the g d values except for g d 0 and 0 01 a summary of r e c r is given in fig 8 it can be seen that r e c r is a constant value of 2 6 105 for g d 0 5 and reduces with the reduction of g d for g d 0 5 it is believed that this due to the increase of turbulence intensity as shown in fig 4 for z d 0 6 this is similar to the effect of the free stream turbulence level on the flow regime transition for an isolated cylinder when the cylinder is close to the plane wall the wall proximity affects the distribution of c p based on the fitted curves of the data points in fig 6 the angular position of c p m i n g a p shifts towards downstream direction when g d is reduced from 1 to 0 01 for most of the r e values this indicates that the separation point on the gap side moves towards downstream direction since the separation point is normally about 10 downstream of the location of the c p m i n as reported by tani 1964 it has been known that the flow separation from a cylinder surface is due to the adverse pressure gradient clancy 1975 if the pressure shows a reduction trend along the flow direction it tends to stabilize the flow from separation and this is called a favorable pressure gradient as an example the area with adverse pressure gradient on the gap side are marked between line 1 and 2 in fig 6 f and the favorable pressure gradient is labelled between line 2 and 3 the favorable pressure gradient on the gap side is due to the wall proximity and this postpones the flow separation on the gap side for g d 0 1 and 0 01 fig 6 e and f the favorable pressure gradient is obviously stronger on the gap side than that on the top side hiwada et al 1986 demonstrated a very similar feature of the separation point shift with the reduction of g d at re 2 104 it should be noted that c p m i n is determined from the fitted curves and the separation points are deduced from the locations of c p m i n it is admitted that such a method may not be always accurate more accurate results could be achieved by refining the measurement of c p or using a shear stress probe directly on the cylinder surface it is noted that for g d 0 25 shown in fig 6 d only the lower side of the cylinder surface is at the level of high turbulence intensity z d 0 6 as shown in fig 4 however transition also happens on the top side in this case this is attributed to the following reason when the cylinder is placed closing to the plane wall the stagnation point moves towards to the gap side sumer and fredsøe 1997 because of the wall proximity due to this feature a part of the flow with relatively high turbulent intensity will be deviated to the top side of the cylinder cheung and melbourne 1983 demonstrated that boundary layer transition on the cylinder surface happens at a lower re value when the upstream turbulence intensity is increased this explains the early transition on the top side at a relatively low r e value of 1 1 105 some key features of the pressure distribution are summarized in fig 9 which includes the c p m i n the difference between base pressure and minimum pressure c p b c p m i n and the wake width φ which is the angle distance between two turbulent separation points corresponding to a near constant c p in the wake c p b for an isolated cylinder the wake width depends on states of the boundary layer on the cylinder surface as summarized by zdravkovich 1997 these three values c p m i n c p b c p m i n and φ are often used in identifying the transition from the subcritical to the supercritical regime in the literature for an isolated cylinder c p b experiences a dramatic change when the drag crisis happens it has been known that the negative base pressure on the downstream side of the cylinder is induced by the vortices formed after flow separations the vortices in the wake of a cylinder in the supercritical regime are much weaker than that in the subcritical regime therefore the base pressure coefficient is higher than that of the supercritical flow the increase of the base pressure is also the reason for the reduction of the drag coefficient related to the drag crisis the effect of re on the base pressure is also observed in the present test results for example at g d 1 0 c p b 2 05 is observed at re 1 1 105 this is in a close agreement with that of an isolated cylinder c p b 2 2 at re 1 1 105 as reported by achenbach 1968 an increase of the base pressure can be observed in the range of re 1 1 105 to 2 7 105 the c p b remains almost a constant value of 1 25 for re 2 7 105 this suggests that the flow transition to the supercritical regime happens at around r e 2 7 105 for g d 1 for g d 0 75 and 0 5 the trend of c p b is very similar to that of g d 1 and the transition to supercritical regime happens at the same r e but c p b in the supercritical regime is about 1 4 slightly lower than that of g d 1 for g d 0 25 the recovery of c p b with re also happens but in a more gradual manner for g d 0 0 01 and 0 1 only very minor increases are observed in the range of r e 1 1 105 to 1 4 105 this also indicates that the transition to the supercritical regime happens at lower re values than the minimum re tested for g d 0 25 the minimum pressure coefficient c p m i n is also sensitive to g d and re as shown in fig 6 as discussed by achenbach 1968 roshko 1961 and van nunen 1974 c p b c p m i n represents the adverse pressure recovery in the wake since the flow is asymmetrical on the top and bottom sides of the cylinder c p b c p m i n t o p and c p b c p m i n g a p are presented separately in fig 9 b and c for g d 1 0 7 0 5 and 0 25 c p b c p m i n t o p increases with re and reaches the maximum value around 2 0 at r e 2 7 105 and then a minor reduction happens with further increase of re once again this demonstrates that the transition to the supercritical regime occurs at r e 2 7 105 for g d 0 25 for g d 0 1 0 01 and 0 no clear transition is observed this is consistent with the observations from the pressure distributions shown in fig 6 fig 9 b and c show similar features the wake width φ decreases from around 180 to 110 for g d 0 5 0 75 and 1 as re falls into the supercritical regime which is caused by the delay of flow separations for g d 0 25 φ keeps almost constant at around 115 regardless of re which suggests that the transition has had occurred in this range of r e for these g d conditions 3 3 drag and lift force coefficients the force coefficients on the cylinder are examined in this section the incoming flow velocity is increased in steps as shown in fig 10 a the drag and lift coefficient are defined as c d f d 0 5 ρ d u 2 and c l f l 0 5 ρ d u 2 respectively where f d and f l are the instantaneous hydrodynamic force in the horizontal and vertical directions drag and lift and are calculated based on the pressure distribution measured along the middle cross section of the model pipe the time histories of the measured drag coefficient for g d 1 0 25 and 0 are presented in fig 10 b c and d respectively the following features are observed firstly the reduction trend of c d with the increase of flow velocity indicates the existence of drag crisis for a near wall cylinder except for g d 0 the other feature shown in fig 10 is that the fluctuations of the drag forces become rather weak after the reduction of c d which suggests weak vortex shedding in this range of re the mean drag and lift force coefficients c d and c l are calculated and further analyzed fig 11 shows the comparison of the present c d for g d 1 with c d for an isolated circular cylinder cheung and melbourne 1983 schewe 1983 cadot et al 2015 the turbulence intensity values measured in the independent test cases were 4 4 0 4 and 0 1 respectively the present result is in a good agreement with cheung and melbourne 1983 but shows obvious differences from those reported by schewe 1983 and cadot et al 2015 this is mainly attributed to the high turbulence intensity i u 4 5 in this study which is very close to the value in tests by cheung and melbourne 1983 the variation trends of c d with g d and re are shown in fig 12 a some common features are observed for cases with g d 0 5 0 7 and 1 0 firstly c d experiences a minor reduction from about 1 12 to about 0 91 as re increases from 1 1 105 to 1 9 105 the flow is believed to be in the subcritical regime up to 1 9 105 for g d 0 5 0 7 and 1 0 the reduction of c d is due to the weakening of the vortex shedding in the wake as observed by cadot et al 2015 secondly more significant rapid reductions from 0 91 to about 0 35 are observed in the range of re 1 9 105 to 2 7 105 the observed rapid drag reduction with the increase of re is a typical feature of drag crisis for an isolated cylinder this drag reduction is induced by the recovery of the negative pressure on the rear side of the cylinder fig 6 a associated with the boundary layer transition achenbach 1968 this observation leads to the same conclusion that the transition from the subcritical regime to the critical regime occurs in the range of re 1 9 105 to 2 7 105 as that derived based on the distribution of c p thirdly as re further increases from 2 7 105 c d is not sensitive to the variation of re within the tested range suggesting the flow is in the supercritical regime lastly the regime transition from the subcritical to the supercritical happens in a narrow range of r e for g d 0 5 0 7 and 1 0 for the case with g d 0 25 shown in fig 12 a unlike the cases with g d 0 25 a continuous reduction trend of c d is observed for re 1 1 105 2 7 105 and c d remains around a constant of 0 4 for re 2 7 105 the drag reduction rate with re is still substantial for 1 1 105 re 1 9 105 although it is smaller than those for cases with g d 0 5 0 7 and 1 0 judging on this it is believed that the transition to turbulence in the cylinder boundary layers does occur in the range of 1 1 105 re 2 7 105 for the case with g d 0 25 although the exact critical r e for the onset of this transition is not known a similar variation trend of c d is also observed for the case with g d 0 1 where c d is reduced from 0 8 to 0 52 in the range of re 1 1 105 1 9 105 and c d remains around a constant of 0 52 for re 1 9 105 therefore it is believed that the boundary transition to turbulence also occurs for the case with g d 0 1 the c d shows a small reduction rate and amplitude for g d 0 01 from 0 64 to about 0 56 over re 1 1 105 1 5 105 for the case with g d 0 c d keeps almost a constant of 0 71 within the tested range of r e this appears to support the conclusion that no boundary layer transition occurs in the range of re tested in this study for g d 0 0 and 0 01 the following generalizations are made based on the above observations 1 the critical re for the onset of transition decreases with the decrease of g d 2 the reduction rate and the reduction amplitude of c d during transition decrease with the decrease of g d and 3 the critical re for the supercritical regime also decreases with the decrease of g d the above features are very similar to the effect of free stream turbulence level on the c d values for an isolated cylinder cheung and melbourne 1983 therefore the turbulence level in the wall boundary layer plays an important role for the boundary layer transition process for a near wall cylinder for an isolated cylinder c l remains zero for flows in the subcritical and supercritical regimes but a significant non zero c l value up to 1 exists in the critical regime due to the different boundary layer states on the two sides of the cylinder surface laminar state on one side and turbulent state on the other side schewe 1983 cadot et al 2015 this non zero c l was only observed when the free stream turbulence level is very low for example i u 0 4 and 0 1 for schewe 1983 and cadot et al 2015 respectively the non zero c l was not observed in the critical regime by cheung and melbourne 1983 for the flow with i u 4 4 9 1 or so and savkar 1981 for flow with i u 9 5 this indicates that c l is not affected by r e for relatively high i u conditions even in the re range of transition from the subcritical to the critical and then to the super critical regime in the present work with i u 4 10 it is therefore not expected that c l would experience a significant change due to flow regime transitions fig 12 b shows the effect of g d on c l at different r e values as expected there is not a significant change of c l with r e when the flow regime transition happens however local peaks of c l are found in the range of re 2 3 10 5 3 9 10 5 for g d 1 0 25 it is suspected that the boundary layer on the plane wall could experience certain changes within the range of re and this triggers the variation of c l although this needs to be confirmed by a detailed measurement of pressure and shear stress on the plane wall for a certain g d value c l increases with the reduction of g d in general which agrees quite well with the results of buresti and lanciotti 1992 and thomschke 1971 it should be realized that the force coefficients shown in fig 11 are corresponding to the boundary layer conditions given in fig 4 different boundary layer profiles will lead to a change of c d c l and the flow structures around the cylinder fredsøe and hansen 1987 compared c l at two different boundary layer thickness δ d 0 and 5 over the range of g d 0 0 25 it was found that c l is significantly higher for δ d 0 in the range of g d 0 0 1 lei et al 1999 measured c d and c l at 6 different wall boundary layer thickness δ d 0 14 2 89 and found that the boundary layer influences the flow around the circular cylinder in two ways displacing the front stagnation point and varying the base pressure it is speculated that the velocity profiles in the boundary layer also affects the transition process this will be further investigated in future work 4 engineering implications the present work is relevant to the engineering application of hydrodynamic forces on a free spanning subsea pipeline the results show that the boundary layer transition has a significant effect on the force coefficients on pipelines which are the key parameters required in the stability design of offshore pipelines holloway et al 2001 presented the measurement of tidal flow at the north west shelf region of australia a peak tidal current of 0 2 m s was measured in the water depth of 200 m 400 m in this water depth the surface wave induced flow is less significant due to the large water depth therefore the hydrodynamic force on a subsea pipeline is dominated by steady currents the diameter of a subsea pipeline is normally in the range of 3 inches 76 mm for flow lines to 72 inches 1 8 m for high capacity trunk lines dean 2010 this corresponds to a re range of 1 56 104 3 0 105 for a current velocity of 0 2 m s on the other hand the turbulence measured in the present work is about 10 near the plane wall which is close to the near seabed turbulence intensity in tidal flow measured by bowden 1962 12 15 it can be seen that the re range and the flow turbulence intensity investigated in this work are well representative of those in prototype applications based on the r e c r shown in fig 8 a series of curve for u d ν r e c r are plotted in fig 13 the curves provide the threshold velocity magnitudes beyond which the drag crisis is expected for a range of pipeline diameters and gap ratios 5 conclusions a series of model tests were conducted using the o tube facility to investigate the drag and lift coefficients under the effect of boundary layer transition for a circular cylinder near a plane boundary the pressure around the cylinder was measured in the range of r e 1 1 105 4 3 105 and the force coefficients were analyzed the main conclusions are summarized as below a for g d 0 5 drag crisis happens in the range of r e 1 9 105 2 7 105 c d reduces to about 0 35 after the drag crisis b for g d 0 25 drag crisis still exists but happens at lower re values than the minimum re tested in the present study the reduction of r e c r for small gap ratios is mainly due to the high turbulence intensity close to the plane boundary for the smallest gap ratio tested in this work g d 0 c d value is around 0 71 and it shows a very low sensitivity to re within the tested range of re c reynolds number has a less effect on lift coefficient than on drag coefficient the general trend found in this work is that the lift coefficient reduces with the increase of gap ratio no flow asymmetry due to successive transition is observed in the critical regime g d d the wall proximity effect tends to delay the gap side separation on the cylinder surface due to the favorable pressure gradient this is a common feature for flow with boundary layer in both laminar and turbulent state e the testing conditions covered in this work are in the range of prototype field conditions and the results have the potential to influence engineering practices in future acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the support from the national key r d

23517,accurate predictions of free surface and pressure are devoted to the design and optimization of ship hull the present study focuses on a comparison of numerical results from different methods on steady wave making problem of a standard wigley hull especially for pressure distribution on the hull two numerical approaches are employed a higher order boundary element method which uses rankine panel method based on potential flow theory and a computational fluid dynamics model based on the software fine marine the computed results of the wave profile along the hull wave pattern around the hull pressure distribution on the hull and wave making resistance are validated by comparing them with experimental measurements and show favorable agreements through above comparisons it is confirmed that the inclusion of nonlinear and viscosity effects improves the accuracy of numerical results for predicting free surface and pressure distribution in spite of heavy computation keywords hydrodynamic wave making problem rankine panel method hobem cfd fine marine 1 introduction the prediction of wave making resistance plays an important role in ship design over the past two decades numerical calculation method in ship hydrodynamics has been rapidly developed with the development of computer science and technology and it becomes an effective tool for ship design and hull optimization by applying it to hydrodynamic performance analysis and forecast the numerical methods can be divided into two categories namely the potential flow based method and the viscous flow based method the traditional methods based on the potential flow theory have been developed early and widely used for predicting wave loads and ship motions in industry since they require much less computing resources up to now these methods are still widely adopted by industry due to their merits of being fast and easy to implement such as zakerdoost et al 2013 peng et al 2014 ginnis et al 2014 and so forth the strip theory is the most popular one which is a 2 d method and has limitations in predicting reliable hydrodynamic forces at high froude number and low frequency waves then 3 d methods became popular in seakeeping research the available 3 d method can be broadly categorized into two major group the free surface green function method and the rankine panel method rpm however the free surface temporal green function is time consuming in long term simulation in time domain analysis in the last two decades continual efforts have been made to improve the accuracy and efficiency of these methods such as lin and yue 1991 bingham et al 1994 and so forth the rpm is widely employed in seakeeping analysis nowadays since it is flexible in treatment of the complicated free surface conditions raven 1996 developed an iterative code based on the rpm on the raised free surface to solve the fully nonlinear wave resistance problem markov and suzuki 2000 used b spline scheme in the higher order rankine source method for solving 3 d steady ship wave problem kara et al 2007 solved the three dimensional fully nonlinear steady body wave interaction problem in time domain based on the rankine source method he 2013 and 2014 used a higher order boundary element method hobem to solve the steady and unsteady seakeeping problems a principal disadvantage of the above potential flow based methods should be noted that it can not take the influence of viscosity into account to improve the efficiency and accuracy of numerical simulation as close to actual physical phenomena the research on viscous flow then becomes essential and important it is necessary to tackle highly distorted or broken free surface conventional numerical methods based on potential flow theory are not applicable to extremely nonlinear problems the development of computational fluid dynamics cfd was limited at early stage due to its extensive requirement of computing resources however the problem of heavy computations is solved benefiting from rapid evolution of computer capability compared with potential flow theory cfd is more capable of handling with nonlinear and or viscous free surface flow problems which are closer to physical phenomena yang and löhner 2002 calculated ship sinkage and trim using a finite element method and unstructured grids based on euler solver and obtained more satisfactory prediction by considering nonlinear ship waves effects gradually the cfd techniques have been widely used in the simulation of ship resistance and motions by solving navier stokes equations biausser et al 2003 analyzed the internal kinematics and dynamics of three dimensional breaking waves on slopes by numerical method rhee 2005 made research on unstructured grid based reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method for liquid tank sloshing hu and kashiwagi 2009 adopted a constrained interpolation profile based cartesian grid method for strongly nonlinear wave body interaction problems and validated the method by a newly designed experiment in a two dimensional wave channel benefiting from the previous progress in cfd techniques many softwares are developed and applied to scientific research and production such as fluent wang and zou 2014 cfx židonis et al 2015 star ccm cinosi et al 2014 openfoam yang et al 2011 and so forth numerical wave tank based on viscous flow theory has been developed and extended to unsteady seakeeping problems he et al 2011 ferrer et al 2016 fine marine numeca 2013 is an integrated cfd software environment for the simulation of mono fluid and multi fluid flows around kinds of vessels developed by numeca it specializes in solving the complex free surface problems the rans and continuity equations are solved with k ω sst menter turbulence model gamma differencing scheme jasak 1996 is adopted in discretizing the momentum equation free surface is obtained by blend reconstruction interface capturing schemebrics fine marine has been applied to vehicle and propeller industry in recent years nevertheless the research of differences in hydrodynamics analysis compared with other numerical methods is rarely reported in the present paper two 3 d time domain numerical models based on hobem and fine marine are established for steady wave making problem respectively a standard wigley hull was selected to perform the numerical comparisons due to its detailed experimental measurements especially for pressure distribution first the mathematical formulation of numerical methods are described after convergence studies with respect to ramp function domain size and grid number the steady waves generated by the hull are simulated by both numerical models the computed wave profile wave pattern pressure distribution and wave making resistance at several froude numbers are illustrated and compared with measured data reported by kajitani et al 1983 the comparison between two numerical methods is discussed and provides an indication about the influence of nonlinear and viscosity effects an understanding of differences is expected from viscous and potential flow methods which make their complementary application useful for predicting resistance and pressure of ship in still water 2 model description an hobem based rpm he and kashiwagi 2014a and a cfd method based on fine marine are adopted in the comparative study on numerical simulation of steady wave making problem in simulation a rectangular computation domain is introduced as fig 1 a cartesian coordinate system x y z fixed to a ship in steady motion is introduced the horizontal x y plane is set on the still water surface with its origin placed on the center of the body and the z axis is positive upward a ship is translating at constant forward speed u with respect to a space fixed reference frame x 0 y 0 z 0 2 1 the higher order boundary element method for self containing and clarity the formulations of the numerical model used in he and kashiwagi 2014a 2014b is outlined here the fluid is assumed to be incompressible and inviscid with irrotational motion the velocity potential can be introduced and the total potential is divided into basis φ b disturbed ϕ d and incident wave ϕ i potentials 1 ψ φ b ϕ d ϕ i 2 ζ ζ d ζ i where ζ is the elevation of free surface subscripts b d and i denote the basis disturbed and incident wave flows respectively the basis flow is assumed to be the largest component with its order φ b o 1 and the disturbed ϕ d and incident ϕ i flows are assumed small with their order o ε the basis flow is expressed as 3 φ b u x φ this flow can be either neumann kelvin flow or double body flow in the present study the former case is considered the disturbed potential ϕ d is also governed by the laplace equation and satisfies the following boundary and initial conditions 4 t u φ ζ d 2 φ z 2 ζ d ϕ d z t u φ ϕ d g ζ d u φ 1 2 φ φ on s f 5 ϕ d n j 1 6 ξ j t n j ξ j m j on s b 6 ϕ d n 0 on the water

positive when pointing into body from the boundary surface and m j denotes the j th component of the so called m term which can be expressed as 8 m 1 m 2 m 3 n u φ m 4 m 5 m 6 n u φ x m 2 1 1 steady problem the steady ship wave problem in the neumann kelvin linearization is focused in the present study without considering the sinkage and trim then eq 4 can be simplified as follows 9 t u x ζ d ϕ d z t u x ϕ d g ζ d on s f by eliminating the wave elevation ζ d in eq 9 and combining into a single equation the well known linearized free surface condition in the neumann kelvin problem is recovered in the form 10 t u x 2 ϕ d g ϕ d z 0 on s f 2 1 2 linearized pressure after solving the boundary integral equation based on hobem the pressure on the body can be calculated by using the decomposed form of the total potential ψ in eq 1 11 p p a ρ ϕ i ϕ d t 1 2 φ b ϕ d ϕ i φ b ϕ d ϕ i 1 2 u 2 g z on s b for convenience set p a 0 then the linearized pressure is decomposed into the steady p s unsteady p u and hydrostatic p c pressure components in the following form 12 p p s p u p c a generalized force can be obtained by the pressure integral on the wetted surface of the body as follows 13

2 1 governing equations the incompressible unsteady rans equation is adopted in the flow solver which is based on the finite volume method to build the spatial discretization of the transport equations the pressure field is extracted from the mass conservation constraint or continuity equation then transformed into a pressure equation the velocity field is obtained from the momentum conservation equations considering incompressible flow of viscous fluid in the multi phase continuum under isothermal conditions mass momentum and volume fraction conservation equations can be written

1 2 x l 2 1 z d 2 where l b d are the length beam and standard draft of the ship respectively the length to beam ratio is l b 10 and length to draft ratio is l d 16 the experimental measurements for a 2 5 m standard wigley model were carried out by kajitani et al 1983 at the university of tokyo the experiments were separately performed and cooperatively analyzed 1 resistance test 2 wave pattern 3 wake survey 4 wave profile measurement 5 pressure measurement on hull surface the present study selects the results of wave profile pressure distribution and wave making resistance for comparison over a series of froude numbers the hull is fixed to sink and trim for ease of comparison the hydrodynamic forces and moment acting on the hull wave elevation and time are plotted in a nondimensional form as follows 22 f x f z f 1 f 3 0 5 ρ u 2 s m y f 5 0 5 ρ u 2 s l 23 ζ g z u 2 24 t t g l here f x f z and m y shown in the following comparisons denote surge force heave force and pitch moment respectively ρ is the density of fluid u f n g l is the forward speed of the ship s is the area of mean wetted surface of the ship z is the free surface height 3 numerical simulation to avoid scale effect the length of wigley hull l 2 5 m the same length as the experiment was adopted in the present cfd simulation its three dimensional model of the wigley hull is shown in fig 3 where the mid plane of the ship was located at y 0 and ship bottom was at z d the stern was at x l 2 and the bow at x l 2 due to the symmetry of flow only half of the hull and domain was considered in numerical calculation for saving computational time the details of meshing of the wigley hull for cfd and rpm simulation are illustrated in fig 4 an unstructured hexahedral mesh was used for the cfd simulation and the corresponding grids of whole computational domain for both cfd and rpm simulation are shown in fig 5 in cfd simulation the mesh near the free surface and around the ship hull was refined locally in order to well capture the free surface and solve the complex flow around the hull while the mesh became coarse toward the top and bottom of the tank to keep simulation stable the forward speed of the ship was gradually increased from a state of rest to a specified constant value u the wigley hull was fixed to sink and trim and advanced at constant forward speed in calm water the mean wetted hull surface was assumed unchanged during the whole simulation 3 1 convergence study as a vital stage in validation of numerical model convergence studies with respect to ramp function computational domain size and grid number were systematically carried out by the wave making resistance acting on the wigley hull take the cfd method for example the convergence study was performed as follows the convergence study of the rpm has been carried out in a similar way as well so the details for the rpm is omitted for clarity 3 1 1 ramp function as mentioned previously the ship speed was gradually increased from zero to a specified constant value of u a ramp function α t was adopted in the acceleration period until the ship reaches the steady speed u t α t u the ramp function α t is expressed as follows 25 α t 0 5 1 0 cos t t r π t t r 1 0 t t r where u denotes the target forward speed of the ship and t r means the ramp interval fig 6 shows time histories of hydrodynamic forces and moment f x f z and m y acting on the hull from fig 6 it is clear that the oscillation amplitude is larger and the oscillation period of hydrodynamic forces is longer when the ramp interval is shorter all numerical simulations for different ramp intervals are converged to the same value herein the longest ramp interval t r 9 903 is employed in the following study 3 1 2 computational domain a general computational domain is set as 4 0 l 6 0 l in the x axis 0 5 l 2 0 l in the y axis and 3 0 l in the z axis according to the recommendation of fine marine manual numeca 2013 respectively in the present study four cases with different computational domain length and width were selected to confirm the domain size convergence of total resistance in calm water fig 7 shows time histories of f x f z and m y of the wigley hull with f n 0 316 from fig 7 it can be obviously seen that there is no obvious discrepancy between the four different cases while the case of 4 0 l in length and 0 5 l in width is underestimated from other cases it is confirmed that the numerical simulation is convergent with respect to domain size so it is adequate to use the domain length of 4 0 l and width of 1 0 l in the following studies 3 1 3 grid as we all known the grid size has significant impacts on the convergence of the hydrodynamic forces prediction results in general it is easier to obtain more accurate results in cfd simulation with finer mesh however the increase of grid number will give rise to the increase of computer time cost dramatically and deprive the efficiency of cfd method in the present study there are three different cases of model named as coarse medium and fine whose grid numbers were 642279 998715 1434946 respectively time histories of hydrodynamic forces and moment of the wigley hull with f n 0 316 are shown in fig 8 from fig 8 it can be found that there is no obvious discrepancy among the three different cases the numerical simulation for all different cases is convergent it is confirmed that it is sufficient to adopt the coarse model of grid number 642279 in the following simulations for sake of time saving from above convergence studies for cfd method the computational domain was set to 2 5 l 1 5 l in the x axis 0 1 0 l in the y axis and 1 0 l 0 5 l in the z axis where l is the ship length respectively the numerical model of coarse mesh was adopted it took t r 9 903 for the wigley hull accelerating from a state of rest to a specified constant value of u in a similar way the size of domain in the rpm was set to 2 3 l 0 9 l in the x axis 0 1 2 l in the y axis and 2 5 l 0 in the z axis the number of panels used in the present study consisted of 25 6 on half of the ship hull the panels on free surface were uniform in the x direction with 25 elements l and are non uniform in the y direction the panel size increased with expansion ratio q 1 1 along the y direction with the same size as that in the x direction δ y δ x around the body the time step was equal to β δ x δ t g 20 0 and an iterative scheme was employed at each time step to achieve accurate and stable results 3 2 wave profile the accuracy of capturing free surface in numerical simulation is an essential criterion for measuring numerical methods and the wave profile along the hull is a great reflection of free surface capturing the wave patterns were generated by the wigley hull with forward speed of f n 0 250 0 267 0 289 0 316 0 354 and 0 408 respectively a comparison of wave profiles along the surface of the wigley hull between cfd and rpm based on the potential flow theory is shown in fig 9 the experimental measurements measured by kajitani et al 1983 are also illustrated in these figures for comparison which are shown as the solid lines from fig 9 the tendencies of the cfd results and rpm results are in satisfactory agreement with the measured data for both phase and amplitude of wave elevation overall the results of aft body are superior to the fore body the cfd results based viscous flow theory are closer to the experimental measurements than that based on potential flow theory in particular at the first crest and trough near the wigley s bow it is evident that the rpm obtained overestimated value at the first trough and underestimated value the second crest from the bow with the increase of forward speed the waves generated by the hull tend to be smooth and the discrepancy of wave elevation between the first crest and trough from the ship s bow is decreased the discrepancy of both numerical methods results compared with measured data tend to be eliminated the advantages over computed wave elevation of the cfd method confirmed that the inclusion of nonlinear and viscous effect can improve the numerical accuracy of wave profile as reported in raven 1996 3 3 wave pattern there is also a evident difference of wave patterns generated by the wigley hull using the rpm and cfd methods the wave patterns generated by the hull with forward speed of f n 0 250 and 0 316 were selected to illustrated as shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively the upper are the cfd simulation while the lower are the rpm results for a clear view from figs 10 and 11 it can be found that 1 the wave patterns of both the cfd and rpm are similar to that in open water and no wave reflected from all boundaries of computational domain 2 the good coincidence is obtained between the cfd and rpm for the position of both crests and troughs 3 the ship waves in the downstream simulated by the cfd model is dissipated quickly than that from rpm due to the mesh after the hull grow coarse gradually in cfd calculation 4 from the bow of ship the kelvin wave is more evident in cfd computed wave pattern than that in rpm 5 with the increase of forward speed the waves generated by the ship propagate farther downstream with large wave amplitude and it is more accessible to identify the kelvin wave 3 4 pressure distribution the distribution of pressure on the hull in y direction with different drafts z d has been rarely reported by scholars and engineers in this section the comparative study of distribution of pressure coefficient on the standard wigley hull at various forward speeds by three methods is made and illustrated in fig 12 the experimental data with a standard model of ut the university of tokyo are shown as the solid lines the rpm results are shown as dash lines with triangular scatters for comparison for convenience the pressure coefficient results of fore body x 0 1 are shown on the right side and the aft body s x 1 0 are on the left side the pressure coefficient is defined as 26 c p p p 0 5 ρ u 2 where p is the pressure at infinity fig 12 shows a satisfactory agreement in the tendencies of pressure distribution pattern between the numerical results and experimental measurements for all froude numbers shown however the numerical results are somewhat overestimated near the bow 2 y b 0 0 2 as a whole the results of aft body agree better than fore body with the experiment since the flow changes rapidly around fore body than aft body overall cfd demonstrated a better agreement with measured data than rpm in the fore body which is similar with the situation of wave profile along the ship hull in the region near the free surface z d 0 0 20 the rpm results are overestimated near the bow and underestimated near the mid ship section by comparison the cfd numerical results are much closer to measured data compared with the rpm results since the nonlinear and viscous effects are considered in the cfd model with integration on the real hull wetted surface in medium depth z d 0 36 and 0 52 it is evident the rpm obtained overestimated results from bow to stern in contrast in deeper water near the bottom of ship z d 0 68 and 0 84 both the cfd and rpm simulations are close to the experimental measurements moreover comparing the figures with varied forward speeds the discrepancy between the numerical results and experimental data is smaller at lower froude number 3 5 wave making resistance the wave making resistance of the wigley hull was calculated at forward speed f n 0 15 0 4 in present study a comparison of wave making resistance coefficients between present numerical results and experimental measurements is given in fig 13 the wave making resistance coefficients are nondimensionalized by 0 5 ρ u 2 s the experimental data are presented three wave making resistance coefficients 1 c w is the wave making resistance coefficients derived from the towing test in the university of tokyo by kajitani et al 1983 2 c w p is derived from wave pattern analysis 3 c p r is the experimental data obtained by pressure integration over the hull wetted surface the three expressions of resistance coefficient are derived from the processing of different experimental data the c w is obtained by resistance test in towing tank not self propulsion test the c w p is obtained by positioning wave gauge sensors at a longitudinal cut near the ship trajectory and collecting the ship wave information including the wave contours and phase when the ship advances more details can be found in raven and prins 1998 baba 1972 and so forth this method is mostly applied to linear problem so it is applicable in wave making resistance the c p r is obtained by integrating the pressure over the ship hull wetted surface which is also measured in experimental test therefore the principle of this method is similar to numerical calculation process the pressure integration method needs much more data in tests than the other methods similarly to the cases for wave profile and pressure distribution the rpm results are given as triangle scatters and the cfd results are in circle scatters in fig 13 for comparison according to hughes classification of resistance the total resistance r t is defined as 27 r t r f r f r w with r f the viscous resistance which depends from the reynolds number r f the form resistance and r w the wave resistance which depends from the froude number besides r f k r f k being the form factor in the notion of outputs from fine marine force of f in x direction f x f x v f x p where f x v corresponds to the viscous resistance r f f x p corresponds to the sum of the form resistance r f and the wave resistance r w as a result there is a discrepancy of form resistance r f which is related to hull bending in the magnitude of wave making resistance a form effect correction factor k f is introduced but without acknowledged correcting method herein by default it is not accessible to distinguish and correction of form effect is absent in general however to eliminate the form resistance effect as far as possible in the present paper the wave making resistance of cfd method is obtained by conducting the simulations with and without free surface elevation i e by computing the drag d 1 for a mono fluid computation and the drag d 2 for a multi fluid computation the different of drag d 2 d 1 will give much more exact intensity of the wave making resistance whereas the computed total resistance is the wave making resistance in numerical computation based on potential theory from fig 13 a good agreement is found between numerical results from the cfd and rpm both methods obtained satisfactory results in predicting the wave making resistance compared with the error introduced by the different data processing on experimental measurements 4 conclusion in present study two numerical approaches were applied to predict the steady wave making resistance on a standard wigley hull a rpm based on hobem codes and a cfd method based on software fine marine in the case of rankine source based hobem the velocity potential on the ship hull and normal velocity on the free surface were solved at each time instant for cfd solver fine marine the rans and continuity equations were solved with k ω sst menter turbulence model both of them were applied to simulate the wave profile along the ship hull wave patterns pressure distribution on the hull and wave making resistance and validated by comparing them with experimental data in a reasonable agreement from present study the following conclusions can be obtained 1 for wave profile prediction overall tendencies of both numerical methods were similar to each other and show a good agree with experimental measurements the cfd method had an advantage in obtaining closer results to measured data than rpm at the first crest and trough from the ship s bow because the nonlinear and viscous effects were taken into consideration 2 as for pressure distribution the calculated results by both methods showed reasonable correspondence with the experimental data however obvious discrepancy can be observed at the depth near free surface and near the bow or stern of the ship by rpm the cfd did much better than rpm in predicting pressure distribution on ship hull accurately 3 according to the comparisons of wave pattern and wave making resistance between the rpm and cfd both numerical methods gave reasonable results for the standard wigley good agreements were obtained at the positions of humps and hollows the accuracy of numerical methods was validated by comparing them with each other the present paper focused on not only wave making resistance but also pressure distribution on the hull from above research and analyses cfd method s preponderance in estimating the pressure distribution and capturing free surface made it reach the potential in playing an effective role in ship design e g the intensity determination and selection of structure design optimization of ship form and so forth therefore viscous and potential flow methods could be complementary for prediction of hydrodynamic performance in future work more sophisticated cfd methods e g fluent cfx other developed codes and so on will be applied to investigate possible viscous and or nonlinear effects on some vessels with more complex configuration acknowledgments this work was supported by national natural science foundation of china 51579058 shandong provincial natural

23517,accurate predictions of free surface and pressure are devoted to the design and optimization of ship hull the present study focuses on a comparison of numerical results from different methods on steady wave making problem of a standard wigley hull especially for pressure distribution on the hull two numerical approaches are employed a higher order boundary element method which uses rankine panel method based on potential flow theory and a computational fluid dynamics model based on the software fine marine the computed results of the wave profile along the hull wave pattern around the hull pressure distribution on the hull and wave making resistance are validated by comparing them with experimental measurements and show favorable agreements through above comparisons it is confirmed that the inclusion of nonlinear and viscosity effects improves the accuracy of numerical results for predicting free surface and pressure distribution in spite of heavy computation keywords hydrodynamic wave making problem rankine panel method hobem cfd fine marine 1 introduction the prediction of wave making resistance plays an important role in ship design over the past two decades numerical calculation method in ship hydrodynamics has been rapidly developed with the development of computer science and technology and it becomes an effective tool for ship design and hull optimization by applying it to hydrodynamic performance analysis and forecast the numerical methods can be divided into two categories namely the potential flow based method and the viscous flow based method the traditional methods based on the potential flow theory have been developed early and widely used for predicting wave loads and ship motions in industry since they require much less computing resources up to now these methods are still widely adopted by industry due to their merits of being fast and easy to implement such as zakerdoost et al 2013 peng et al 2014 ginnis et al 2014 and so forth the strip theory is the most popular one which is a 2 d method and has limitations in predicting reliable hydrodynamic forces at high froude number and low frequency waves then 3 d methods became popular in seakeeping research the available 3 d method can be broadly categorized into two major group the free surface green function method and the rankine panel method rpm however the free surface temporal green function is time consuming in long term simulation in time domain analysis in the last two decades continual efforts have been made to improve the accuracy and efficiency of these methods such as lin and yue 1991 bingham et al 1994 and so forth the rpm is widely employed in seakeeping analysis nowadays since it is flexible in treatment of the complicated free surface conditions raven 1996 developed an iterative code based on the rpm on the raised free surface to solve the fully nonlinear wave resistance problem markov and suzuki 2000 used b spline scheme in the higher order rankine source method for solving 3 d steady ship wave problem kara et al 2007 solved the three dimensional fully nonlinear steady body wave interaction problem in time domain based on the rankine source method he 2013 and 2014 used a higher order boundary element method hobem to solve the steady and unsteady seakeeping problems a principal disadvantage of the above potential flow based methods should be noted that it can not take the influence of viscosity into account to improve the efficiency and accuracy of numerical simulation as close to actual physical phenomena the research on viscous flow then becomes essential and important it is necessary to tackle highly distorted or broken free surface conventional numerical methods based on potential flow theory are not applicable to extremely nonlinear problems the development of computational fluid dynamics cfd was limited at early stage due to its extensive requirement of computing resources however the problem of heavy computations is solved benefiting from rapid evolution of computer capability compared with potential flow theory cfd is more capable of handling with nonlinear and or viscous free surface flow problems which are closer to physical phenomena yang and löhner 2002 calculated ship sinkage and trim using a finite element method and unstructured grids based on euler solver and obtained more satisfactory prediction by considering nonlinear ship waves effects gradually the cfd techniques have been widely used in the simulation of ship resistance and motions by solving navier stokes equations biausser et al 2003 analyzed the internal kinematics and dynamics of three dimensional breaking waves on slopes by numerical method rhee 2005 made research on unstructured grid based reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method for liquid tank sloshing hu and kashiwagi 2009 adopted a constrained interpolation profile based cartesian grid method for strongly nonlinear wave body interaction problems and validated the method by a newly designed experiment in a two dimensional wave channel benefiting from the previous progress in cfd techniques many softwares are developed and applied to scientific research and production such as fluent wang and zou 2014 cfx židonis et al 2015 star ccm cinosi et al 2014 openfoam yang et al 2011 and so forth numerical wave tank based on viscous flow theory has been developed and extended to unsteady seakeeping problems he et al 2011 ferrer et al 2016 fine marine numeca 2013 is an integrated cfd software environment for the simulation of mono fluid and multi fluid flows around kinds of vessels developed by numeca it specializes in solving the complex free surface problems the rans and continuity equations are solved with k ω sst menter turbulence model gamma differencing scheme jasak 1996 is adopted in discretizing the momentum equation free surface is obtained by blend reconstruction interface capturing schemebrics fine marine has been applied to vehicle and propeller industry in recent years nevertheless the research of differences in hydrodynamics analysis compared with other numerical methods is rarely reported in the present paper two 3 d time domain numerical models based on hobem and fine marine are established for steady wave making problem respectively a standard wigley hull was selected to perform the numerical comparisons due to its detailed experimental measurements especially for pressure distribution first the mathematical formulation of numerical methods are described after convergence studies with respect to ramp function domain size and grid number the steady waves generated by the hull are simulated by both numerical models the computed wave profile wave pattern pressure distribution and wave making resistance at several froude numbers are illustrated and compared with measured data reported by kajitani et al 1983 the comparison between two numerical methods is discussed and provides an indication about the influence of nonlinear and viscosity effects an understanding of differences is expected from viscous and potential flow methods which make their complementary application useful for predicting resistance and pressure of ship in still water 2 model description an hobem based rpm he and kashiwagi 2014a and a cfd method based on fine marine are adopted in the comparative study on numerical simulation of steady wave making problem in simulation a rectangular computation domain is introduced as fig 1 a cartesian coordinate system x y z fixed to a ship in steady motion is introduced the horizontal x y plane is set on the still water surface with its origin placed on the center of the body and the z axis is positive upward a ship is translating at constant forward speed u with respect to a space fixed reference frame x 0 y 0 z 0 2 1 the higher order boundary element method for self containing and clarity the formulations of the numerical model used in he and kashiwagi 2014a 2014b is outlined here the fluid is assumed to be incompressible and inviscid with irrotational motion the velocity potential can be introduced and the total potential is divided into basis φ b disturbed ϕ d and incident wave ϕ i potentials 1 ψ φ b ϕ d ϕ i 2 ζ ζ d ζ i where ζ is the elevation of free surface subscripts b d and i denote the basis disturbed and incident wave flows respectively the basis flow is assumed to be the largest component with its order φ b o 1 and the disturbed ϕ d and incident ϕ i flows are assumed small with their order o ε the basis flow is expressed as 3 φ b u x φ this flow can be either neumann kelvin flow or double body flow in the present study the former case is considered the disturbed potential ϕ d is also governed by the laplace equation and satisfies the following boundary and initial conditions 4 t u φ ζ d 2 φ z 2 ζ d ϕ d z t u φ ϕ d g ζ d u φ 1 2 φ φ on s f 5 ϕ d n j 1 6 ξ j t n j ξ j m j on s b 6 ϕ d n 0 on the water bottom 7 ϕ d t 0 0 ϕ d n t 0 0 at the initial time where ξ j in eq 5 denotes the displacement of ship in the j th mode of motion and n j is the j th component of normal vector which is defined positive when pointing into body from the boundary surface and m j denotes the j th component of the so called m term which can be expressed as 8 m 1 m 2 m 3 n u φ m 4 m 5 m 6 n u φ x m 2 1 1 steady problem the steady ship wave problem in the neumann kelvin linearization is focused in the present study without considering the sinkage and trim then eq 4 can be simplified as follows 9 t u x ζ d ϕ d z t u x ϕ d g ζ d on s f by eliminating the wave elevation ζ d in eq 9 and combining into a single equation the well known linearized free surface condition in the neumann kelvin problem is recovered in the form 10 t u x 2 ϕ d g ϕ d z 0 on s f 2 1 2 linearized pressure after solving the boundary integral equation based on hobem the pressure on the body can be calculated by using the decomposed form of the total potential ψ in eq 1 11 p p a ρ ϕ i ϕ d t 1 2 φ b ϕ d ϕ i φ b ϕ d ϕ i 1 2 u 2 g z on s b for convenience set p a 0 then the linearized pressure is decomposed into the steady p s unsteady p u and hydrostatic p c pressure components in the following form 12 p p s p u p c a generalized force can be obtained by the pressure integral on the wetted surface of the body as follows 13

2 1 governing equations the incompressible unsteady rans equation is adopted in the flow solver which is based on the finite volume method to build the spatial discretization of the transport equations the pressure field is extracted from the mass conservation constraint or continuity equation then transformed into a pressure equation the velocity field is obtained from the momentum conservation equations considering incompressible flow of viscous fluid in the multi phase continuum under isothermal conditions mass momentum and volume fraction conservation equations can be written as using the generalized form of gauss theorem 14 t v ρ d v s ρ u u d n d s 0 t v ρ u i d v s ρ u i u u d n d s 15 s τ i j i j p i i n d s v ρ g i d v 16 t v c i d v s c i u u d n d s 0 where v is the

1 2 x l 2 1 z d 2 where l b d are the length beam and standard draft of the ship respectively the length to beam ratio is l b 10 and length to draft ratio is l d 16 the experimental measurements for a 2 5 m standard wigley model were carried out by kajitani et al 1983 at the university of tokyo the experiments were separately performed and cooperatively analyzed 1 resistance test 2 wave pattern 3 wake survey 4 wave profile measurement 5 pressure measurement on hull surface the present study selects the results of wave profile pressure distribution and wave making resistance for comparison over a series of froude numbers the hull is fixed to sink and trim for ease of comparison the hydrodynamic forces and moment acting on the hull wave elevation and time are plotted in a nondimensional form as follows 22 f x f z f 1 f 3 0 5 ρ u 2 s m y f 5 0 5 ρ u 2 s l 23 ζ g z u 2 24 t t g l here f x f z and m y shown in the following comparisons denote surge force heave force and pitch moment respectively ρ is the density of fluid u f n g l is the forward speed of the ship s is the area of mean wetted surface of the ship z is the free surface height 3 numerical simulation to avoid scale effect the length of wigley hull l 2 5 m the same length as the experiment was adopted in the present cfd simulation its three dimensional model of the wigley hull is shown in fig 3 where the mid plane of the ship was located at y 0 and ship bottom was at z d the stern was at x l 2 and the bow at x l 2 due to the symmetry of flow only half of the hull and domain was considered in numerical calculation for saving computational time the details of meshing of the wigley hull for cfd and rpm simulation are illustrated in fig 4 an unstructured hexahedral mesh was used for the cfd simulation and the corresponding grids of whole computational domain for both cfd and rpm simulation are shown in fig 5 in cfd simulation the mesh near the free surface and around the ship hull was refined locally in order to well capture the free surface and solve the complex flow around the hull while the mesh became coarse toward the top and bottom of the tank to keep simulation stable the forward speed of the ship was gradually increased from a state of rest to a specified constant value u the wigley hull was fixed to sink and trim and advanced at constant forward speed in calm water the mean wetted hull surface was assumed unchanged during the whole simulation 3 1 convergence study as a vital stage in validation of numerical model convergence studies with respect to ramp function computational domain size and grid number were systematically carried out by the wave making resistance acting on the wigley hull take the cfd method for example the convergence study was performed as follows the convergence study of the rpm has been carried out in a similar way as well so the details for the rpm is omitted for clarity 3 1 1 ramp function as mentioned previously the ship speed was gradually increased from zero to a specified constant value of u a ramp function α t was adopted in the acceleration period until the ship reaches the steady speed u t α t u the ramp function α t is expressed as follows 25 α t 0 5 1 0 cos t t r π t t r 1 0 t t r where u denotes the target forward speed of the ship and t r means the ramp interval fig 6 shows time histories of hydrodynamic forces and moment f x f z and m y acting on the hull from fig 6 it is clear that the oscillation amplitude is larger and the oscillation period of hydrodynamic forces is longer when the ramp interval is shorter all numerical simulations for different ramp intervals are converged to the same value herein the longest ramp interval t r 9 903 is employed in the following study 3 1 2 computational domain a general computational domain is set as 4 0 l 6 0 l in the x axis 0 5 l 2 0 l in the y axis and 3 0 l in the z axis according to the recommendation of fine marine manual numeca 2013 respectively in the present study four cases with different computational domain length and width were selected to confirm the domain size convergence of total resistance in calm water fig 7 shows time histories of f x f z and m y of the wigley hull with f n 0 316 from fig 7 it can be obviously seen that there is no obvious discrepancy between the four different cases while the case of 4 0 l in length and 0 5 l in width is underestimated from other cases it is confirmed that the numerical simulation is convergent with respect to domain size so it is adequate to use the domain length of 4 0 l and width of 1 0 l in the following studies 3 1 3 grid as we all known the grid size has significant impacts on the convergence of the hydrodynamic forces prediction results in general it is easier to obtain more accurate results in cfd simulation with finer mesh however the increase of grid number will give rise to the increase of computer time cost dramatically and deprive the efficiency of cfd method in the present study there are three different cases of model named as coarse medium and fine whose grid numbers were 642279 998715 1434946 respectively time histories of hydrodynamic forces and moment of the wigley hull with f n 0 316 are shown in fig 8 from fig 8 it can be found that there is no obvious discrepancy among the three different cases the numerical simulation for all different cases is convergent it is confirmed that it is sufficient to adopt the coarse model of grid number 642279 in the following simulations for sake of time saving from above convergence studies for cfd method the computational domain was set to 2 5 l 1 5 l in the x axis 0 1 0 l in the y axis and 1 0 l 0 5 l in the z axis where l is the ship length respectively the numerical model of coarse mesh was adopted it took t r 9 903 for the wigley hull accelerating from a state of rest to a specified constant value of u in a similar way the size of domain in the rpm was set to 2 3 l 0 9 l in the x axis 0 1 2 l in the y axis and 2 5 l 0 in the z axis the number of panels used in the present study consisted of 25 6 on half of the ship hull the panels on free surface were uniform in the x direction with 25 elements l and are non uniform in the y direction the panel size increased with expansion ratio q 1 1 along the y direction with the same size as that in the x direction δ y δ x around the body the time step was equal to β δ x δ t g 20 0 and an iterative scheme was employed at each time step to achieve accurate and stable results 3 2 wave profile the accuracy of capturing free surface in numerical simulation is an essential criterion for measuring numerical methods and the wave profile along the hull is a great reflection of free surface capturing the wave patterns were generated by the wigley hull with forward speed of f n 0 250 0 267 0 289 0 316 0 354 and 0 408 respectively a comparison of wave profiles along the surface of the wigley hull between cfd and rpm based on the potential flow theory is shown in fig 9 the experimental measurements measured by kajitani et al 1983 are also illustrated in these figures for comparison which are shown as the solid lines from fig 9 the tendencies of the cfd results and rpm results are in satisfactory agreement with the measured data for both phase and amplitude of wave elevation overall the results of aft body are superior to the fore body the cfd results based viscous flow theory are closer to the experimental measurements than that based on potential flow theory in particular at the first crest and trough near the wigley s bow it is evident that the rpm obtained overestimated value at the first trough and underestimated value the second crest from the bow with the increase of forward speed the waves generated by the hull tend to be smooth and the discrepancy of wave elevation between the first crest and trough from the ship s bow is decreased the discrepancy of both numerical methods results compared with measured data tend to be eliminated the advantages over computed wave elevation of the cfd method confirmed that the inclusion of nonlinear and viscous effect can improve the numerical accuracy of wave profile as reported in raven 1996 3 3 wave pattern there is also a evident difference of wave patterns generated by the wigley hull using the rpm and cfd methods the wave patterns generated by the hull with forward speed of f n 0 250 and 0 316 were selected to illustrated as shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively the upper are the cfd simulation while the lower are the rpm results for a clear view from figs 10 and 11 it can be found that 1 the wave patterns of both the cfd and rpm are similar to that in open water and no wave reflected from all boundaries of computational domain 2 the good coincidence is obtained between the cfd and rpm for the position of both crests and troughs 3 the ship waves in the downstream simulated by the cfd model is dissipated quickly than that from rpm due to the mesh after the hull grow coarse gradually in cfd calculation 4 from the bow of ship the kelvin wave is more evident in cfd computed wave pattern than that in rpm 5 with the increase of forward speed the waves generated by the ship propagate farther downstream with large wave amplitude and it is more accessible to identify the kelvin wave 3 4 pressure distribution the distribution of pressure on the hull in y direction with different drafts z d has been rarely reported by scholars and engineers in this section the comparative study of distribution of pressure coefficient on the standard wigley hull at various forward speeds by three methods is made and illustrated in fig 12 the experimental data with a standard model of ut the university of tokyo are shown as the solid lines the rpm results are shown as dash lines with triangular scatters for comparison for convenience the pressure coefficient results of fore body x 0 1 are shown on the right side and the aft body s x 1 0 are on the left side the pressure coefficient is defined as 26 c p p p 0 5 ρ u 2 where p is the pressure at infinity fig 12 shows a satisfactory agreement in the tendencies of pressure distribution pattern between the numerical results and experimental measurements for all froude numbers shown however the numerical results are somewhat overestimated near the bow 2 y b 0 0 2 as a whole the results of aft body agree better than fore body with the experiment since the flow changes rapidly around fore body than aft body overall cfd demonstrated a better agreement with measured data than rpm in the fore body which is similar with the situation of wave profile along the ship hull in the region near the free surface z d 0 0 20 the rpm results are overestimated near the bow and underestimated near the mid ship section by comparison the cfd numerical results are much closer to measured data compared with the rpm results since the nonlinear and viscous effects are considered in the cfd model with integration on the real hull wetted surface in medium depth z d 0 36 and 0 52 it is evident the rpm obtained overestimated results from bow to stern in contrast in deeper water near the bottom of ship z d 0 68 and 0 84 both the cfd and rpm simulations are close to the experimental measurements moreover comparing the figures with varied forward speeds the discrepancy between the numerical results and experimental data is smaller at lower froude number 3 5 wave making resistance the wave making resistance of the wigley hull was calculated at forward speed f n 0 15 0 4 in present study a comparison of wave making resistance coefficients between present numerical results and experimental measurements is given in fig 13 the wave making resistance coefficients are nondimensionalized by 0 5 ρ u 2 s the experimental data are presented three wave making resistance coefficients 1 c w is the wave making resistance coefficients derived from the towing test in the university of tokyo by kajitani et al 1983 2 c w p is derived from wave pattern analysis 3 c p r is the experimental data obtained by pressure integration over the hull wetted surface the three expressions of resistance coefficient are derived from the processing of different experimental data the c w is obtained by resistance test in towing tank not self propulsion test the c w p is obtained by positioning wave gauge sensors at a longitudinal cut near the ship trajectory and collecting the ship wave information including the wave contours and phase when the ship advances more details can be found in raven and prins 1998 baba 1972 and so forth this method is mostly applied to linear problem so it is applicable in wave making resistance the c p r is obtained by integrating the pressure over the ship hull wetted surface which is also measured in experimental test therefore the principle of this method is similar to numerical calculation process the pressure integration method needs much more data in tests than the other methods similarly to the cases for wave profile and pressure distribution the rpm results are given as triangle scatters and the cfd results are in circle scatters in fig 13 for comparison according to hughes classification of resistance the total resistance r t is defined as 27 r t r f r f r w with r f the viscous resistance which depends from the reynolds number r f the form resistance and r w the wave resistance which depends from the froude number besides r f k r f k being the form factor in the notion of outputs from fine marine force of f in x direction f x f x v f x p where f x v corresponds to the viscous resistance r f f x p corresponds to the sum of the form resistance r f and the wave resistance r w as a result there is a discrepancy of form resistance r f which is related to hull bending in the magnitude of wave making resistance a form effect correction factor k f is introduced but without acknowledged correcting method herein by default it is not accessible to distinguish and correction of form effect is absent in general however to eliminate the form resistance effect as far as possible in the present paper the wave making resistance of cfd method is obtained by conducting the simulations with and without free surface elevation i e by computing the drag d 1 for a mono fluid computation and the drag d 2 for a multi fluid computation the different of drag d 2 d 1 will give much more exact intensity of the wave making resistance whereas the computed total resistance is the wave making resistance in numerical computation based on potential theory from fig 13 a good agreement is found between numerical results from the cfd and rpm both methods obtained satisfactory results in predicting the wave making resistance compared with the error introduced by the different data processing on experimental measurements 4 conclusion in present study two numerical approaches were applied to predict the steady wave making resistance on a standard wigley hull a rpm based on hobem codes and a cfd method based on software fine marine in the case of rankine source based hobem the velocity potential on the ship hull and normal velocity on the free surface were solved at each time instant for cfd solver fine marine the rans and continuity equations were solved with k ω sst menter turbulence model both of them were applied to simulate the wave profile along the ship hull wave patterns pressure distribution on the hull and wave making resistance and validated by comparing them with experimental data in a reasonable agreement from present study the following conclusions can be obtained 1 for wave profile prediction overall tendencies of both numerical methods were similar to each other and show a good agree with experimental measurements the cfd method had an advantage in obtaining closer results to measured data than rpm at the first crest and trough from the ship s bow because the nonlinear and viscous effects were taken into consideration 2 as for pressure distribution the calculated results by both methods showed reasonable correspondence with the experimental data however obvious discrepancy can be observed at the depth near free surface and near the bow or stern of the ship by rpm the cfd did much better than rpm in predicting pressure distribution on ship hull accurately 3 according to the comparisons of wave pattern and wave making resistance between the rpm and cfd both numerical methods gave reasonable results for the standard wigley good agreements were obtained at the positions of humps and hollows the accuracy of numerical methods was validated by comparing them with each other the present paper focused on not only wave making resistance but also pressure distribution on the hull from above research and analyses cfd method s preponderance in estimating the pressure distribution and capturing free surface made it reach the potential in playing an effective role in ship design e g the intensity determination and selection of structure design optimization of ship form and so forth therefore viscous and potential flow methods could be complementary for prediction of hydrodynamic performance in future work more sophisticated cfd methods e g fluent cfx other developed codes and so on will be applied to investigate possible viscous and or nonlinear effects on some vessels with more complex configuration acknowledgments this work was supported by national natural science foundation of china 51579058 shandong provincial natural

23518,non linear hysteretic riser seabed interaction models have been developed and implemented into business software packages within recent years to simulate the riser penetration into the seabed and its influence on fatigue life in the touchdown zone tdz these models have shown significant impact on ultimate fatigue damage and users shall take caution while using the models paying particular attention to the selection of model parameters the oscillation of steel catenary riser scr in the touchdown zone can be quite complex where neighbor nodes go under different episodes and magnitudes of penetration and uplift at the same time therefore it is necessary to evaluate the non linear soil models consistency in nodal performance this paper comprehensively examined the nodal performance of a popular non linear hysteretic riser seabed interaction model through developing a global numerical riser model in abaqus and a user defined subroutine uel the model shows a dominantly strong nodal performance however nodal response violations and model malfunctioning were observed in the proximity of trench bottom towards the vessel which is the most fatigue prone section of scr in the touchdown zone also it was identified that the model over estimates the penetration and suction resistance and consequently the fatigue damage in the tdz keywords steel catenary risers non linear seabed interaction numerical modeling nodal response fatigue life 1 introduction steel catenary risers scr are one of the most attractive elements in the development of deep offshore oil and gas fields as their construction and installation cost is less than other riser families maclure and walters 2007 lim and gauld 2003 these risers are naturally subjected to cyclic motions due to environmental loads and consequently susceptible to fatigue damage both in scr attachment point to the floating system and in the touchdown zone tdz however the estimation of the scr fatigue life in the tdz is the most challenging issue in its design because of highly complex riser seabed interaction and range of inherited uncertainties the survey results obtained by remote operating vehicles rov have proved the complex non linear seabed response to riser fluctuations in the tdz where src penetrates into the seabed and cyclically creates trenches often with several diameters deep bridge and howells 2007 different mechanisms with a range of uncertainties contribute to the riser seabed interaction and the trench development underneath the riser the oscillatory motions of scr in the touchdown zone result in a complex riser interaction mechanism with surrounding media including seawater and soil some of the influential parameters contributing to these non linear hysteretic interactions are as follow soil stiffness degradation under cyclic loads and riser penetration into the seabed mobilization of suction force within uplift motions of the riser trench base softening and damping the erosive mechanism by water velocity field around the scr in the tdz and consequent variation of the flow pattern of displaced water the riser dynamics influenced by internal multi phase flow regimes and also vessel motions velocity and frequencies vortex induced vibration viv these complexities cause several major uncertainties in the prediction of fatigue life and the scr design procedure jacob 2005 advanced non linear hysteretic seabed models have been developed within the recent years enabling automatic simulation of the different stiffness in the seabed response through the tdz randolph and quiggin 2009 aubeny and biscontin 2009 in continuation to exploring the significance of nonlinear soil response in fatigue performance of scrs shiri and hashemi 2012 shiri 2014 the current paper part i comprehensively examined the nodal performance of one of the most popular nonlinear hysteretic soil models i e randolph and quiggin 2009 called r q model from now on the main objective was to explore the consistency and the extent of the model validity that has never been accomplished before the r q model defines evolutionary non linear hysteretic soil stiffness represented by springs connected to the nodes on the scr within the tdz therefore the nodal response of the model which is the basis for longitudinal stress profiles has significant importance in fatigue response in this paper a numerical model was developed in abaqus and the r q model was coded in fortran as a user defined element uel a comprehensive study was conducted focusing on the nodal performance of the model within various seabed parameters and different locations on the scr the pros and cons of the r q model along with its extent of functionality was discussed the performance of the r q model regarding fatigue response and longitudinal stress profiles in the tdz will be presented in a sister paper as part ii 2 seabed soil modeling strategies simplified beam spring models and also constitutive soil models combined with different numerical approaches are two main strategies in modeling the riser seabed interaction the latter approach results in higher accuracy and higher computational cost at the same time increasing the computational effort particularly in coupled analysis makes this approach less attractive for industrial applications however using the constitutive soil models with proper numerical approaches such as continuum finite element models e g clukey et al 2008 can provide a strong tool to explore the different aspects of the riser seabed interaction mechanisms through research projects in beam spring strategy the soil response is represented by simple springs this approach seems to be an oversimplification from the geotechnical standpoint where some particular aspects of the soil such as dilatation and creep are lost within the soil discretization process however the beam spring approach results in considerable mitigation of computational cost with no significant loss of accuracy particularly when the soil stiffness parameters are properly adjusted the simplicity and reasonably acceptable accuracy of this method has caused the industry to apply this approach to a range of design challenges widely the results interestingly show good agreement with experimental data and continuum models the complexity of the riser seabed interaction and the need for simultaneous modeling of vessel excitation riser dynamics and non linear seabed response within fatigue analyses have caused the industry to show more interest in scr beam spring modeling approach various scr design codes have traditionally proposed linear soil springs in the touchdown zone after the first experience of scr technology in the auger field of the gulf of mexico phifer et al 1994 the stride and carisima jips 1999 2001 giertsen et al 2004 were the first organised attempts to investigate the need for more sophisticated riser seabed interaction models theti and moros 2001 bridge et al bridge and howells 2007 examined the test data from the carisima and stride jips and also conducted a range of full scale harbour tests laboratory model tests and numerical simulations a series of soil stiffness models was developed for static penetration small and large displacements and cyclic loading for use in finite element analysis programs these studies included assessment of the influence of suction during uplift and also the presence of a trench on the performance of scrs particularly with respect to fatigue in the tdz the hyperbolic model proposed by bridge et al bridge and howells 2007 captures various non linear aspects of soil behaviour characteristics within the applicable displacement stages including initial penetration uplift suction mobilization breakout and re penetration the hyperbolic curve of the model was developed based on the hyperbolic force displacement interaction curve for sand developed by audibert et al 1984 it is similar in form to the hyperbolic pipe soil interaction curve developed by hardin and drnevich 1972 that was originally proposed for clay by kondner 1963 the soil suction during uplift was modeled based on the test data obtained from the stride and carisima jips in order to calculate the dynamic soil stiffness the model used the bearing load as opposed to the touchdown point reaction force hence the model does not account for soil softening due to repeated cycles resulting in a conservative modeling in the tdz even though the soil behaviour in this region is highly nonlinear jiao 2007 proposed a non linear discrete soil model for scr response analysis in the tdz the model introduced two non degrading and degrading schemes for different soil conditions more recently aubeny biscontin aubeny and biscontin 2009 and randolph quiggin randolph and quiggin 2009 proposed two advanced nonlinear soil models for scr analysis in the tdz aubeny biscontin aubeny and biscontin 2009 proposed a simplified model consisting of four different equations that represent the soil spring characteristic in each load cycle the first curve in this model simulates the intact soil response as a backbone curve the second scenario is the elastic rebound curve which simulates the soil response to scr uplift process the partial separation of the riser and soil within the uplift episode is modeled with a third curve until complete detachment a reloading curve then models the riser re penetration in the disturbed soil more intermediate equations are modeling the local load cycles the incapability of this model in predicting comprehensive soil degradation was resolved by nakhaee and zhang 2008 through proposing an updated version randolph and quiggin 2009 proposed a nonlinear model to predict the hysteretic soil response to scr up and down oscillations the model combines the hyperbolic and exponential functions within four main episodes of riser seabed cyclic contact initial penetration uplift separation and re penetration shiri and randolph 2010 implemented the model into abaqus through developing user defined elements to explore the scr fatigue performance and automated trench generation mechanism this model was implemented into orcaflex software in 2009 and is currently amongst the most popular non linear models to predict the hysteretic riser seabed interaction shiri 2014 used the model to study the influence of trench creation on fatigue performance of scr in the tdz zargar and kimiaei 2015 conducted a comparative study to investigate the advantages and disadvantages of the models proposed by aubeny and biscontin 2009 and randolph and quiggin 2009 using existing test results authors made an overall comparison between the equations proposed by both of the models for different episodes of riser seabed interaction despite the studies conducted on the performance of these non linear models in prediction of fatigue life and trench creation in tdz there is still no study in the literature to comprehensively examine the functionality and the consistency of these models over different conditions in this paper the nodal performance of the model proposed by randolph and quiggin 2009 r q model was comprehensively studied through numerical analyses for a range of seabed soil parameters and various locations with different magnitudes of movements on the scr 3 construction of numerical model to fully examine the nodal response of r q model within the up and down motions of the scr in the tdz a global numerical scr model was developed in abaqus the commercial software orcaflex does not provide access to alter all of the r q soil model parameters therefore developing the global model in abaqus with the r q model implemented provides full access to the model it is worth mentioning that it might be more appropriate to say r q riser seabed interaction model rather than use the term r q soil model because the model indeed is not a soil model but a strong mathematical expression describing the non linear riser seabed interaction however the term r q soil model may be used here in this paper for simplicity the global scr model developed in abaqus comprises a generic scr connected to a spar vessel seabed soil was modeled through developing user defined elements uel and implementing the r q model the vessel excitation under the environmental loads was modeled using the disp subroutine of abaqus fig 1 shows the scr system configuration where the riser is a timoshenko shear flexible beam using element b21 from the abaqus element library the total numbers of 828 nodes were defined starting from node no 1 at the anchor end and ending with node no 828 at the vessel attachment point the length of beam elements in the hanging part is 5 m except for the last element connected to the vessel which is 3 m in length and 1 m in the remaining part on the seabed within a length of 450 m as seen in fig 1 table 1 gives the mechanical properties of scr the vessel excitation was conducted through coding the disp subroutine and a given rao illustrated in fig 2 a full wave scatter diagram from gulf of mexico was fed into the subroutine the subroutine enabled selection of the wave bins number of cycles to be applied and the wave train hierarchies in this paper only a single wave was activated in disp subroutine to investigate the nodal performance of the soil model while the rest of wave bins were deactivated to perform a full fatigue analysis and examine the performance of the soil model all of the wave bins could be activated in disp subroutine however the full wave scatter diagram and the results of fatigue analysis have been comprehensively discussed in a sister paper part ii of the current paper that investigates the global response of the riser system using a non linear hysteretic seabed model to further focus on the performance of the soil model only the wave frequency motions about the vessel mean position was modeled through quasi static analaysis and the effect of low frequency motions was not considered this approach facilitated the purely monitoring of the soil model performance in the second paper part ii dynamic analysis with full vessel excitation has been performed and the results have been discussed in detail 3 1 numerical analysis steps the model uses three steps to define the scr connected to the floating system the scr was initially modeled as a straight pipe laid on the seabed partially supported by seabed springs with simple support at the vessel end and fixed at the anchor end at the first start the submerged weight was applied to the riser and the vessel end of the riser was lifted up simultaneously to the level equal to the height of the attachment point then the vessel was shifted to the vessel s nominal position towards the anchor end to achieve the targeted lay angle 78 in this example and start perturbing to simulate the effects of wave action each new position of the vessel was generated by the disp subroutine of abaqus which processes the applied regular wave data and vessel rao at every increment of analysis fig 3 shows the flowchart of the overall analysis 4 modeling of seabed soil for numerical simulation the scr constructed in abaqus was assumed to sit on user defined springs distributed along the seabed the behaviour of these springs was defined and coded inside the uel subroutine based on r q soil model randolph and quiggin 2009 since the current study deeply explores the r q model it is worth reviewing the model characteristics before expressing the implementation into the abaqus 4 1 r q non linear hysteretic soil model the r q model uses combinations of hyperbolic and exponential functions to model the soil stiffness within four main episodes of riser seabed cyclic contact initial penetration uplift separation and re penetration fig 4 these different episodes were comprehensively examined in this study that will be discussed in the coming sections the model starts with initial penetration mode as shown by the blue line in fig 4 the resistance asymptotically approaches the ultimate penetration resistance pu z while the penetration depth is increased the ultimate penetration resistance pu z is calculated using few key parameters including the soil bearing factor nc which is defined with normalized penetration z d and non dimensional penetration resistance parameters a and b the soil resistance is calculated by 1 p z h ip ζ p u z where ζ is the non dimensional penetration in units of d kmax in which kmax is the normalized maximum stiffness parameter of the model 2 ζ z d k max and hip is a hyperbolic factor given by 3 h ip ζ ζ 1 ζ by reversing the riser penetration direction the model enters uplift mode and the reaction force decreases rapidly with a high initial secant stiffness further uplift takes the model into the suction region with a negative reaction force the suction resistance reaches its maximum value approaching the ultimate suction resistance pu suc the magnitude of ultimate suction resistance is a fraction of the ultimate penetration resistance controlled by parameter fsuc with further uplift the suction resistance decays to zero over a distance controlled by parameter λsuc re penetration after an entire break out follows an initially convex curve reflecting the soil softening beneath the riser during uplift the re penetration resistance approaches the ultimate penetration resistance at a penetration depth greater than the previous maximum penetration depth as controlled by parameter λrep re penetration may also occur when the suction resistance is partially mobilized in such a case the suction resistance reduces rapidly and the model enters the positive reaction region further cycles of uplift and re penetration would give further episodes of uplift and re penetration modes and so give hysteresis loops of seabed resistance with incremental penetration at each cycle randolph and quiggin 2009 for the sake of conciseness we only showed the equations for initial penetration above one may review the paper published by randolph and quiggin 2009 for further details and r q model equations randolph and quiggin 2009 5 analytical response of r q model before examining the r q model through coding the uel subroutine an excel spreadsheet was developed for arbitrary evaluation of a single node on scr in the tdz an artificial displacement history of the node was given and the seabed response was obtained fig 5 shows a sample response of model over a few arbitrary cycles of uplift and re penetration the influence of different key parameters of the model kmax fsuc λsuc and λrep was also studied fig 6 in this example the riser diameter is 0 324 m the mudline shear strength is 0 65 kpa and the shear strength gradient is 1 5 kpa m the power law parameters for bearing capacity factor a b were taken as 6 and 0 25 respectively randolph and quiggin 2009 recommend kmax 200 in the r q model higher values of kmax give higher penetration resistance and lower suction force for a given penetration depth with the maximum difference occurring in the late re penetration and early suction stages as shown in fig 6 the amount of suction resistance in uplift is controlled by fsuc the magnitude of this parameter can lie between zero for no suction resistance to unity for maximum suction resistance equal to the ultimate penetration resistance randolph and quiggin 2009 suggest a more realistic upper limit of 0 7 for fsuc since the suction force appears to reduce rapidly to a low level within a few cycles for the single uplift of a riser a value of 0 5 to unity is considered for fatigue studies or other applications with many cycles the recommended range is 0 0 3 in reality various factors affect the magnitude of suction resistance such as the uplift rate of the riser the time over which the uplift motion is sustained and the recent history of cyclic motion bridge et al 2004 however considering the very limited published data randolph and quiggin 2009 adopted a constant but user defined value of fsuc fig 6 shows the effect of fsuc on the peak suction mobilized and the following re penetration resistance higher values of fsuc give higher suction resistance and a slower mobilization of the re penetration resistance since fsuc does not control the suction decay distance larger values of fsuc give a higher gradient of suction decay the parameter λsuc adjusts the suction decay distance in the r q model randolph and quiggin 2009 considered a value range of 0 2 0 6 for λsuc which leads to small residual suction resistance after an uplift displacement of about 1 diameter this matches experimental results showing a suction decay distance in the order of the riser diameter or less although the response will also be affected by the rate of motion and the previous displacement history aubeny and biscontin 2009 bridge et al 2004 fig 6 illustrates the extension of the suction decay distance with higher values of λsuc which in turn affect the peak suction mobilization and the soil softening or reduced resistance in the initial stages of re penetration lower values of λsuc give a reduced suction decay distance lower peak suction mobilization and a softer response in the initial stages of re penetration i e lower resistance for a given re penetration depth the model parameter λrep simulates the progressive penetration with cumulative load controlled cyclic movements delaying the mobilization of ultimate re penetration resistance randolph and quiggin 2009 recommend a value in the range 0 1 0 5 which shows reasonable correlation with experimental results fig 6 shows the delay in ultimate resistance mobilization by adopting a higher value of λrep the results obtained from excel spreadsheet for an arbitrary nodal displacement history show a smooth and consistent response however the real nodal displacement history on scr can be much more complex and need a sophisticated model to investigate in the coming sections the performance of the model will be discussed over complex scr motions using the constructed numerical model in abaqus 6 developing user defined subroutine uel the r q model was coded into a user defined element uel to model the seabed soil response to cyclic loads at every time increment the uel subroutine is called by abaqus for the elements identified as a user defined element abaqus then passes key variables to the uel including updated displacements of the nodes the uel subroutine uses the historical displacements of the nodes and calculates the stiffness matrix of each element and its contribution to external forces through the right hand side vector rhs this information is returned to abaqus to calculate the global stiffness matrix and update the variables to be passed to the uel again fig 7 illustrates the local flowchart of uel calculation process 7 nodal response of r q soil model a regular wave with a height of 16 5 m and a period of 11 s was applied on spar vessel by ten cycles and the response of scr to r q soil model in the tdz was obtained in various nodes the number of cycles is arbitrary only to illustrate the model performance increasing the load cycles stabilizes the von mises stress variation range that will be further investigated in part ii of this paper a comprehensive parametric study was conducted through series of simulations varying the r q soil model parameters one at a time including mudline shear strength shear strength gradient suction ratio suction decay parameter and re penetration offset parameter table 2 shows the default r q model parameters used in the current study table 3 presents the overall parametric study map comprising 21 different case studies to cover different nodal events fully different groups of seabed nodes on the displaced scr may move in a different direction and experience different episodes fig 8 schematically shows the movement directions of various node families corresponding to the displacement of the vessel away from the scr the initial and displaced profiles are numbered as 1 and 2 respectively certain nodes towards the vessel end of the tdz undergo upward movements while nodes further towards the anchor end of the scr undergo further penetration in the hysteretic non linear model randolph and quiggin 2009 the suction starts when the mobilized penetration resistance in the last stage is quickly decayed and the riser proceeds with further lift up then the breakout is started when the mobilized suction force is entirely decayed various sample nodes shown in fig 9 are selected to illustrate the nodal response of the r q model to different movement scenarios as a result of numerical simulations the hysteretic load displacement response of nodes 360 358 356 354 350 and 344 is illustrated in fig 10 spanning positions from the tdp towards the anchor end of the touchdown zone for instance the node 358 experiences penetration full suction and full breakout over ten load cycles where the spar end of the riser and the tdp moved respectively by 5 13 m and 3 8 m the penetration depth increases from the initial monotonic penetration of z d 0 15 to a final normalized depth of 0 32 at the end of the 10th cycle this limited change implies that a slight trench is formed beneath the riser under cyclic loading as shown incremental penetration under cyclic loading has been appropriately captured through the gradual soil softening by the r q hysteretic non linear soil model the results presented for nodes 356 and 354 seem similar but are different in contrast with node 354 node 356 experiences breakout since the spring spacing is 1 m throughout the region on the seabed the node id reflects the node distance from the anchor end for this analysis the initial tdp is about node 356 and transfers to about node 363 after ten cycles of excitation in these plots the penetration has been considered positive ignoring the signs of the local coordinate system in the analysis 7 1 nodal response violation in minor motion reversal a comprehensive examination of the r q model over a wide range of various parameters and different nodes shows a reasonable nodal response however there are some occasions that the model malfunctions which will be discussed here the model defines a high stiffness value when the nodal movement episode is getting reverse i e turning from penetration to uplift or vice versa this is a key requirement and well correlated with conducted centrifuge test results when the penetration or uplift episode is reasonably sustained for a while however on some occasions the model is cheated by minor changes in the movement direction of a node within a large penetration or uplift episode this violates the nodal contact pressure causing an immediate increase in penetration or suction resistance which is not supposed to happen in real soil this short reversal may be a real event or numerical fluctuation but the soil model is supposed to respond to all motion episodes properly fig 11 shows two samples of violation in nodal responses one in penetration and another in uplift phase a larger view of sample nodes with violations in suction and resistance a and b is shown in fig 12 where a minor motion reversal within the penetration or uplift phase may cause an artificial jump the sudden variation of penetration resistance or suction force can widely vary 2 100 depending on the model input parameters node location and displacement range further investigation shows that nodal response violation is more likely to happen in higher magnitudes of penetration or suction fairly close to the backbone curves a comparative example is shown in fig 13 where minor motion reversal has only violated the penetration curves closer to the ultimate penetration resistance the area of normal and violated response is separated in another sample node in fig 14 this may affect the total force mobilization both in suction and resistance and consequently contact pressure which in turn affects the shear and bending stress distribution and fatigue life of scr in this sample the suction force has been violated by 35 and the resistance by about 12 within ten cycles the trend shows that increasing the number of cycles results in higher values of residual violation a comprehensive examination of the results of the parametric study shows that the probability of nodal violation occurrence is relatively independent of model input parameters however the nodes located in the proximity of the trench bottom point toward the vessel are more likely to show response violation nodes 344 to 350 from fig 9 7 2 nodal response violation in low embedment a detailed evaluation of the nodal response within various analyses with different input parameters shows that for higher values of undrained shear strength at mudline su0 the nodal responses at trench mouth are also violated in this region with low penetrations the resistance is quickly increased because of the high value of undrained shear strength however the r q soil model cannot properly simulate the suction decay within a full uplift episode in the low range of embedment depth this causes the suction decay curve to re enter into the penetration resistance region without any reversal motion which is unexpected in a real soil response fig 15 shows sample responses of nodes 360 358 and 356 which are close to trench mouth please see fig 9 for three different values of undrained shear strength in mudline i e 0 0 0 35 and 1 0 kpa the nodal responses of these nodes are violated using 1 0 kpa undrained shear strength dashed red circles show the violation area fig 16 shows a larger view of sample load cycle in node 360 the same scenario happens in nodal responses with limited embedment for the normal values of undrained shear strength but the extremely low values near zero of suction force mobilization parameter fsuc fig 17 shows examples of nodal responses in such conditions where an unexpected residual penetration resistance is remained over the entire uplift and forced to be zero in the breakout the field surveys show that the remoulded soil inside the trench is washed out under current action and water entraps into the trench by riser motions therefore the suction force mobilization is significantly reduced over the time and the soil model needs to be able to capture the soil response for low suction values over limited uplifts these show that r q soil model has a better performance when relatively large episodes of nodal motions are applied 7 3 pre mature stabilization of nodal response the filed surveys conducted by remote operating vehicles rov have shown that a trench is created underneath the scr in touchdown area within few years after installation bridge and howells 2007 various trench depths have been reported from 3 to 10 times the pipeline diameter to examine the model capability in simulating the trench creation an individual reqular wave h 7 m t 8 7 s has been applied on scr by a large number of cycles 1539 cycles the results show that an ultimate penetration depth of less the 0 5d to 1 0d is achieved in the tdz within few load cycles at the beginning of the analysis see fig 18 the model is then rapidly stabilized and further cycles make no further embedment in another word using the usual range of the r q model input parameters the model is not able to simulate the trench creation because of pre mature stabilization fig 19 shows the pre mature stabilization of scr embedment into the seabed fig 20 shows the nodal response around node 356 in the tdz where about 70 of the total embedment is achieved only by five load cycles and the 97 of the cycles has only contributed to 10 of total embedment one may ask why 1539 cycles has been applied indeed the analysis was terminated when no further embedment was achieved the capabilities of r q riser seabed interaction model have been used before to study the influence of trench on fatigue performance shiri and randolph 2010 randolph et al the pre mature stabilization of the nodal response has caused the authors to feed unrealistic extreme input values to model key parameters to obtain a large embedment this in turn results in a relatively unrealistic trench profile leading to a fatigue response affected by a trench which needs a reliability check authors currently study this separate issue in another research project 7 4 over estimation of nodal resistance our conducted analyses show that r q riser soil interaction model simulates the gradual shallow embedment of the riser into the seabed under the cyclic loads the model simulates the trench formation neither regarding the penetration depth nor penetration resistance the main parameter heavily governing the penetration resistance is the evolutionary undrained shear strength continuously degraded under scr cycle motions the r q model assumes that the remoulded soil underneath the riser is degraded but never disappeared e g because of erosion in reality several mechanisms wash out the soil inside the trench as the riser is gradually penetrating into the seabed these mechanisms comprise the scour under seabed currents action scour because of the water pushed inside the trench by riser motion and the active pressure of riser on the seabed therefore going deeper than initial shallow embedment the real mudline travels down the trench and after a while scr can fluctuate inside the trench with no contact with the seabed soil the r q model does not lower the mudline elevation around the riser in the tdz by gradual embedment therefore the model generates nodal resistance that does not exist in reality and this leads to over estimation of nodal resistance and consequently fatigue response fig 20 using the lower values of the suction decay parameter λsuc in r q model can mitigate the conservative estimation of resistance but cannot delete the unrealistic residual resistance remaining in the scr after developing the trench fig 21 shows an example node response where a lower suction decay parameter i e 0 2 a common magnitude i e 0 5 and an extreme magnitude i e 1 0 were considered 8 impact of nodal response violation on fatigue the cyclic variation of resultant stress in scr cross section area leads to cumulative fatigue damage in the tdz barltrop aams barltrop and adams 1991 described a standard form of s n curves for marine structures which are used in fatigue damage calculation of scr as well 4 n a δ σ f m where n is the number of cycles until failure a is an empirical coefficient equivalent to the fatigue life for δσf 1 mpa δσf is the factored stress variation range in mpa m is the inverse slope of the s n curve typically around 3 for operating life of scr many millions of cycles of various stress ranges contribute and the accumulated fatigue damage can be calculated using linear cumulative damage palmgren 1924 according to the method commonly known as miner s rule 5 d i 1 k n i n i where d is the total accumulated fatigue damage k is the number of stress blocks i is the number of a particular constant stress range block in the stress histogram ni is the number of stress cycles in stress block i over the design life ni is the number of stress cycles to failure for the constant stress range i from equation 1 taking m 3 the relative fatigue damage for two different stress ranges σf2 and σf1 is 6 d 2 d 1 σ f 2 σ f 1 3 0 the stress range in scr cross section area is directly related to the shear force distribution along the riser shiri and hashemi 2012 which in turn is governed by riser seabed contact pressure and soil stiffness using the boundary layer method proposed by pesce et al 1998 the shear force may be expressed as a function of the normalized seabed stiffness so that 7 d 2 d 1 k 2 0 25 2 k 2 0 25 2 k 1 0 25 k 1 0 25 3 0 where k k e i h 2 0 274 k where k is the non dimensional soil rigidity parameter k is soil rigidity per unit area e is the scr young s modulus i is the scr second moment of inertia h is the horizontal tension force at the tdp substituting the actual stiffness with k1 and k2 gives 8 d 2 d 1 k 2 k 1 3 4 2 0 274 k 1 0 25 2 0 274 k 2 0 25 3 as shown in previous sections the range of nodal violations in r q model can be quite high on some occasions however even a low rate of change e g 20 in the soil stiffness gives about 10 increase in fatigue damage 9 d 2 d 1 1 2 k 1 k 1 3 4 2 0 274 k 1 0 25 2 0 274 1 2 k 1 0 25 3 1 10 the obtained value highlights the importance of potential violations in seabed soil stiffness on the prediction of cumulative fatigue damage and consequently fatigue life comprehensive fatigue analysis has been presented in another paper part ii of this paper investigating the effects of non linear soil model on global response of the scr however an accurate assessment of the impact of r q model nodal violation on fatigue response needs improvements in existing model therefore further works need to be conducted to improve the accuracy and consistency of r q model for fatigue assessment in non linear hysteretic seabed soil conditions 9 conclusions degradation of seabed soil stiffness and trench formation under the cyclic motions of steel catenary risers in the touchdown zone is proven by rov survey bridge and howells 2007 these alter the contact pressure the stress range variation and consequently the cumulative fatigue damage throughout the scr in the touchdown zone non linear hysteretic riser seabed interaction models have been developed and implemented into business software packages within recent years to simulate the riser penetration into the seabed within fatigue analysis a popular model referred to as r q model proposed by randolph and quiggin 2009 was selected and its nodal performance was comprehensively studied through developing a numerical model in abaqus with r q model coded through a user defined subroutine uel the study showed there are some over conservative assumptions and nodal response violations in r q model resulting in over estimation of penetration and suction resistance and consequently the fatigue damage in the tdz the nodal response violation was frequently observed within the nodes in the proximity of trench bottom towards the vessel this area is the most fatigue prone section of scr in the touchdown zone the results obtained from this study suggested that modifications are needed to improve the nodal performance of r q model though comfort may be taken from the fact that the r q model overestimates the fatigue damage particular attention shall be paid to updating the mudline elevation throughout the load cycles enabling the trench development underneath the scr also any new model to be developed in this field in the future needs to be widely examined in different nodes on the scr through realistic cyclic motions and range of model parameters representing the seabed soil conditions it is worth mentioning that in reality there are several complex riser soil fluid interactions and a wide range of loading scenarios that affect the ultimate trench profile and consequently the accumulated fatigue damage it is quite difficult to make any robust reference about the real effect of the trench on the scr fatigue without modeling more realistic conditions extensive research work should be conducted to simultaneously consider the proper effects of all contributing events that will be hopefully achieved in future studies acknowledgements the

23518,non linear hysteretic riser seabed interaction models have been developed and implemented into business software packages within recent years to simulate the riser penetration into the seabed and its influence on fatigue life in the touchdown zone tdz these models have shown significant impact on ultimate fatigue damage and users shall take caution while using the models paying particular attention to the selection of model parameters the oscillation of steel catenary riser scr in the touchdown zone can be quite complex where neighbor nodes go under different episodes and magnitudes of penetration and uplift at the same time therefore it is necessary to evaluate the non linear soil models consistency in nodal performance this paper comprehensively examined the nodal performance of a popular non linear hysteretic riser seabed interaction model through developing a global numerical riser model in abaqus and a user defined subroutine uel the model shows a dominantly strong nodal performance however nodal response violations and model malfunctioning were observed in the proximity of trench bottom towards the vessel which is the most fatigue prone section of scr in the touchdown zone also it was identified that the model over estimates the penetration and suction resistance and consequently the fatigue damage in the tdz keywords steel catenary risers non linear seabed interaction numerical modeling nodal response fatigue life 1 introduction steel catenary risers scr are one of the most attractive elements in the development of deep offshore oil and gas fields as their construction and installation cost is less than other riser families maclure and walters 2007 lim and gauld 2003 these risers are naturally subjected to cyclic motions due to environmental loads and consequently susceptible to fatigue damage both in scr attachment point to the floating system and in the touchdown zone tdz however the estimation of the scr fatigue life in the tdz is the most challenging issue in its design because of highly complex riser seabed interaction and range of inherited uncertainties the survey results obtained by remote operating vehicles rov have proved the complex non linear seabed response to riser fluctuations in the tdz where src penetrates into the seabed and cyclically creates trenches often with several diameters deep bridge and howells 2007 different mechanisms with a range of uncertainties contribute to the riser seabed interaction and the trench development underneath the riser the oscillatory motions of scr in the touchdown zone result in a complex riser interaction mechanism with surrounding media including seawater and soil some of the influential parameters contributing to these non linear hysteretic interactions are as follow soil stiffness degradation under cyclic loads and riser penetration into the seabed mobilization of suction force within uplift motions of the riser trench base softening and damping the erosive mechanism by water velocity field around the scr in the tdz and consequent variation of the flow pattern of displaced water the riser dynamics influenced by internal multi phase flow regimes and also vessel motions velocity and frequencies vortex induced vibration viv these complexities cause several major uncertainties in the prediction of fatigue life and the scr design procedure jacob 2005 advanced non linear hysteretic seabed models have been developed within the recent years enabling automatic simulation of the different stiffness in the seabed response through the tdz randolph and quiggin 2009 aubeny and biscontin 2009 in continuation to exploring the significance of nonlinear soil response in fatigue performance of scrs shiri and hashemi 2012 shiri 2014 the current paper part i comprehensively examined the nodal performance of one of the most popular nonlinear hysteretic soil models i e randolph and quiggin 2009 called r q model from now on the main objective was to explore the consistency and the extent of the model validity that has never been accomplished before the r q model defines evolutionary non linear hysteretic soil stiffness represented by springs connected to the nodes on the scr within the tdz therefore the nodal response of the model which is the basis for longitudinal stress profiles has significant importance in fatigue response in this paper a numerical model was developed in abaqus and the r q model was coded in fortran as a user defined element uel a comprehensive study was conducted focusing on the nodal performance of the model within various seabed parameters and different locations on the scr the pros and cons of the r q model along with its extent of functionality was discussed the performance of the r q model regarding fatigue response and longitudinal stress profiles in the tdz will be presented in a sister paper as part ii 2 seabed soil modeling strategies simplified beam spring models and also constitutive soil models combined with different numerical approaches are two main strategies in modeling the riser seabed interaction the latter approach results in higher accuracy and higher computational cost at the same time increasing the computational effort particularly in coupled analysis makes this approach less attractive for industrial applications however using the constitutive soil models with proper numerical approaches such as continuum finite element models e g clukey et al 2008 can provide a strong tool to explore the different aspects of the riser seabed interaction mechanisms through research projects in beam spring strategy the soil response is represented by simple springs this approach seems to be an oversimplification from the geotechnical standpoint where some particular aspects of the soil such as dilatation and creep are lost within the soil discretization process however the beam spring approach results in considerable mitigation of computational cost with no significant loss of accuracy particularly when the soil stiffness parameters are properly adjusted the simplicity and reasonably acceptable accuracy of this method has caused the industry to apply this approach to a range of design challenges widely the results interestingly show good agreement with experimental data and continuum models the complexity of the riser seabed interaction and the need for simultaneous modeling of vessel excitation riser dynamics and non linear seabed response within fatigue analyses have caused the industry to show more interest in scr beam spring modeling approach various scr design codes have traditionally proposed linear soil springs in the touchdown zone after the first experience of scr technology in the auger field of the gulf of mexico phifer et al 1994 the stride and carisima jips 1999 2001 giertsen et al 2004 were the first organised attempts to investigate the need for more sophisticated riser seabed interaction models theti and moros 2001 bridge et al bridge and howells 2007 examined the test data from the carisima and stride jips and also conducted a range of full scale harbour tests laboratory model tests and numerical simulations a series of soil stiffness models was developed for static penetration small and large displacements and cyclic loading for use in finite element analysis programs these studies included assessment of the influence of suction during uplift and also the presence of a trench on the performance of scrs particularly with respect to fatigue in the tdz the hyperbolic model proposed by bridge et al bridge and howells 2007 captures various non linear aspects of soil behaviour characteristics within the applicable displacement stages including initial penetration uplift suction mobilization breakout and re penetration the hyperbolic curve of the model was developed based on the hyperbolic force displacement interaction curve for sand developed by audibert et al 1984 it is similar in form to the hyperbolic pipe soil interaction curve developed by hardin and drnevich 1972 that was originally proposed for clay by kondner 1963 the soil suction during uplift was modeled based on the test data obtained from the stride and carisima jips in order to calculate the dynamic soil stiffness the model used the bearing load as opposed to the touchdown point reaction force hence the model does not account for soil softening due to repeated cycles resulting in a conservative modeling in the tdz even though the soil behaviour in this region is highly nonlinear jiao 2007 proposed a non linear discrete soil model for scr response analysis in the tdz the model introduced two non degrading and degrading schemes for different soil conditions more recently aubeny biscontin aubeny and biscontin 2009 and randolph quiggin randolph and quiggin 2009 proposed two advanced nonlinear soil models for scr analysis in the tdz aubeny biscontin aubeny and biscontin 2009 proposed a simplified model consisting of four different equations that represent the soil spring characteristic in each load cycle the first curve in this model simulates the intact soil response as a backbone curve the second scenario is the elastic rebound curve which simulates the soil response to scr uplift process the partial separation of the riser and soil within the uplift episode is modeled with a third curve until complete detachment a reloading curve then models the riser re penetration in the disturbed soil more intermediate equations are modeling the local load cycles the incapability of this model in predicting comprehensive soil degradation was resolved by nakhaee and zhang 2008 through proposing an updated version randolph and quiggin 2009 proposed a nonlinear model to predict the hysteretic soil response to scr up and down oscillations the model combines the hyperbolic and exponential functions within four main episodes of riser seabed cyclic contact initial penetration uplift separation and re penetration shiri and randolph 2010 implemented the model into abaqus through developing user defined elements to explore the scr fatigue performance and automated trench generation mechanism this model was implemented into orcaflex software in 2009 and is currently amongst the most popular non linear models to predict the hysteretic riser seabed interaction shiri 2014 used the model to study the influence of trench creation on fatigue performance of scr in the tdz zargar and kimiaei 2015 conducted a comparative study to investigate the advantages and disadvantages of the models proposed by aubeny and biscontin 2009 and randolph and quiggin 2009 using existing test results authors made an overall comparison between the equations proposed by both of the models for different episodes of riser seabed interaction despite the studies conducted on the performance of these non linear models in prediction of fatigue life and trench creation in tdz there is still no study in the literature to comprehensively examine the functionality and the consistency of these models over different conditions in this paper the nodal performance of the model proposed by randolph and quiggin 2009 r q model was comprehensively studied through numerical analyses for a range of seabed soil parameters and various locations with different magnitudes of movements on the scr 3 construction of numerical model to fully examine the nodal response of r q model within the up and down motions of the scr in the tdz a global numerical scr model was developed in abaqus the commercial software orcaflex does not provide access to alter all of the r q soil model parameters therefore developing the global model in abaqus with the r q model implemented provides full access to the model it is worth mentioning that it might be more appropriate to say r q riser seabed interaction model rather than use the term r q soil model because the model indeed is not a soil model but a strong mathematical expression describing the non linear riser seabed interaction however the term r q soil model may be used here in this paper for simplicity the global scr model developed in abaqus comprises a generic scr connected to a spar vessel seabed soil was modeled through developing user defined elements uel and implementing the r q model the vessel excitation under the environmental loads was modeled using the disp subroutine of abaqus fig 1 shows the scr system configuration where the riser is a timoshenko shear flexible beam using element b21 from the abaqus element library the total numbers of 828 nodes were defined starting from node no 1 at the anchor end and ending with node no 828 at the vessel attachment point the length of beam elements in the hanging part is 5 m except for the last element connected to the vessel which is 3 m in length and 1 m in the remaining part on the seabed within a length of 450 m as seen in fig 1 table 1 gives the mechanical properties of scr the vessel excitation was conducted through coding the disp subroutine and a given rao illustrated in fig 2 a full wave scatter diagram from gulf of mexico was fed into the subroutine the subroutine enabled selection of the wave bins number of cycles to be applied and the wave train hierarchies in this paper only a single wave was activated in disp subroutine to investigate the nodal performance of the soil model while the rest of wave bins were deactivated to perform a full fatigue analysis and examine the performance of the soil model all of the wave bins could be activated in disp subroutine however the full wave scatter diagram and the results of fatigue analysis have been comprehensively discussed in a sister paper part ii of the current paper that investigates the global response of the riser system using a non linear hysteretic seabed model to further focus on the performance of the soil model only the wave frequency motions about the vessel mean position was modeled through quasi static analaysis and the effect of low frequency motions was not considered this approach facilitated the purely monitoring of the soil model performance in the second paper part ii dynamic analysis with full vessel excitation has been performed and the results have been discussed in detail 3 1 numerical analysis steps the model uses three steps to define the scr connected to the floating system the scr was initially modeled as a straight pipe laid on the seabed partially supported by seabed springs with simple support at the vessel end and fixed at the anchor end at the first start the submerged weight was applied to the riser and the vessel end of the riser was lifted up simultaneously to the level equal to the height of the attachment point then the vessel was shifted to the vessel s nominal position towards the anchor end to achieve the targeted lay angle 78 in this example and start perturbing to simulate the effects of wave action each new position of the vessel was generated by the disp subroutine of abaqus which processes the applied regular wave data and vessel rao at every increment of analysis fig 3 shows the flowchart of the overall analysis 4 modeling of seabed soil for numerical simulation the scr constructed in abaqus was assumed to sit on user defined springs distributed along the seabed the behaviour of these springs was defined and coded inside the uel subroutine based on r q soil model randolph and quiggin 2009 since the current study deeply explores the r q model it is worth reviewing the model characteristics before expressing the implementation into the abaqus 4 1 r q non linear hysteretic soil model the r q model uses combinations of hyperbolic and exponential functions to model the soil stiffness within four main episodes of riser seabed cyclic contact initial penetration uplift separation and re penetration fig 4 these different episodes were comprehensively examined in this study that will be discussed in the coming sections the model starts with initial penetration mode as shown by the blue line in fig 4 the resistance asymptotically approaches the ultimate penetration resistance pu z while the penetration depth is increased the ultimate penetration resistance pu z is calculated using few key parameters including the soil bearing factor nc which is defined with normalized penetration z d and non dimensional penetration resistance parameters a and b the soil resistance is calculated by 1 p z h ip ζ p u z where ζ is the non dimensional penetration in units of d kmax in which kmax is the normalized maximum stiffness parameter of the model 2 ζ z d k max and hip is a hyperbolic factor given by 3 h ip ζ ζ 1 ζ by reversing the riser penetration direction the model enters uplift mode and the reaction force decreases rapidly with a high initial secant stiffness further uplift takes the model into the suction region with a negative reaction force the suction resistance reaches its maximum value approaching the ultimate suction resistance pu suc the magnitude of ultimate suction resistance is a fraction of the ultimate penetration resistance controlled by parameter fsuc with further uplift the suction resistance decays to zero over a distance controlled by parameter λsuc re penetration after an entire break out follows an initially convex curve reflecting the soil softening beneath the riser during uplift the re penetration resistance approaches the ultimate penetration resistance at a penetration depth greater than the previous maximum penetration depth as controlled by parameter λrep re penetration may also occur when the suction resistance is partially mobilized in such a case the suction resistance reduces rapidly and the model enters the positive reaction region further cycles of uplift and re penetration would give further episodes of uplift and re penetration modes and so give hysteresis loops of seabed resistance with incremental penetration at each cycle randolph and quiggin 2009 for the sake of conciseness we only showed the equations for initial penetration above one may review the paper published by randolph and quiggin 2009 for further details and r q model equations randolph and quiggin 2009 5 analytical response of r q model before examining the r q model through coding the uel subroutine an excel spreadsheet was developed for arbitrary evaluation of a single node on scr in the tdz an artificial displacement history of the node was given and the seabed response was obtained fig 5 shows a sample response of model over a few arbitrary cycles of uplift and re penetration the influence of different key parameters of the model kmax fsuc λsuc and λrep was also studied fig 6 in this example the riser diameter is 0 324 m the mudline shear strength is 0 65 kpa and the shear strength gradient is 1 5 kpa m the power law parameters for bearing capacity factor a b were taken as 6 and 0 25 respectively randolph and quiggin 2009 recommend kmax 200 in the r q model higher values of kmax give higher penetration resistance and lower suction force for a given penetration depth with the maximum difference occurring in the late re penetration and early suction stages as shown in fig 6 the amount of suction resistance in uplift is controlled by fsuc the magnitude of this parameter can lie between zero for no suction resistance to unity for maximum suction resistance equal to the ultimate penetration resistance randolph and quiggin 2009 suggest a more realistic upper limit of 0 7 for fsuc since the suction force appears to reduce rapidly to a low level within a few cycles for the single uplift of a riser a value of 0 5 to unity is considered for fatigue studies or other applications with many cycles the recommended range is 0 0 3 in reality various factors affect the magnitude of suction resistance such as the uplift rate of the riser the time over which the uplift motion is sustained and the recent history of cyclic motion bridge et al 2004 however considering the very limited published data randolph and quiggin 2009 adopted a constant but user defined value of fsuc fig 6 shows the effect of fsuc on the peak suction mobilized and the following re penetration resistance higher values of fsuc give higher suction resistance and a slower mobilization of the re penetration resistance since fsuc does not control the suction decay distance larger values of fsuc give a higher gradient of suction decay the parameter λsuc adjusts the suction decay distance in the r q model randolph and quiggin 2009 considered a value range of 0 2 0 6 for λsuc which leads to small residual suction resistance after an uplift displacement of about 1 diameter this matches experimental results showing a suction decay distance in the order of the riser diameter or less although the response will also be affected by the rate of motion and the previous displacement history aubeny and biscontin 2009 bridge et al 2004 fig 6 illustrates the extension of the suction decay distance with higher values of λsuc which in turn affect the peak suction mobilization and the soil softening or reduced resistance in the initial stages of re penetration lower values of λsuc give a reduced suction decay distance lower peak suction mobilization and a softer response in the initial stages of re penetration i e lower resistance for a given re penetration depth the model parameter λrep simulates the progressive penetration with cumulative load controlled cyclic movements delaying the mobilization of ultimate re penetration resistance randolph and quiggin 2009 recommend a value in the range 0 1 0 5 which shows reasonable correlation with experimental results fig 6 shows the delay in ultimate resistance mobilization by adopting a higher value of λrep the results obtained from excel spreadsheet for an arbitrary nodal displacement history show a smooth and consistent response however the real nodal displacement history on scr can be much more complex and need a sophisticated model to investigate in the coming sections the performance of the model will be discussed over complex scr motions using the constructed numerical model in abaqus 6 developing user defined subroutine uel the r q model was coded into a user defined element uel to model the seabed soil response to cyclic loads at every time increment the uel subroutine is called by abaqus for the elements identified as a user defined element abaqus then passes key variables to the uel including updated displacements of the nodes the uel subroutine uses the historical displacements of the nodes and calculates the stiffness matrix of each element and its contribution to external forces through the right hand side vector rhs this information is returned to abaqus to calculate the global stiffness matrix and update the variables to be passed to the uel again fig 7 illustrates the local flowchart of uel calculation process 7 nodal response of r q soil model a regular wave with a height of 16 5 m and a period of 11 s was applied on spar vessel by ten cycles and the response of scr to r q soil model in the tdz was obtained in various nodes the number of cycles is arbitrary only to illustrate the model performance increasing the load cycles stabilizes the von mises stress variation range that will be further investigated in part ii of this paper a comprehensive parametric study was conducted through series of simulations varying the r q soil model parameters one at a time including mudline shear strength shear strength gradient suction ratio suction decay parameter and re penetration offset parameter table 2 shows the default r q model parameters used in the current study table 3 presents the overall parametric study map comprising 21 different case studies to cover different nodal events fully different groups of seabed nodes on the displaced scr may move in a different direction and experience different episodes fig 8 schematically shows the movement directions of various node families corresponding to the displacement of the vessel away from the scr the initial and displaced profiles are numbered as 1 and 2 respectively certain nodes towards the vessel end of the tdz undergo upward movements while nodes further towards the anchor end of the scr undergo further penetration in the hysteretic non linear model randolph and quiggin 2009 the suction starts when the mobilized penetration resistance in the last stage is quickly decayed and the riser proceeds with further lift up then the breakout is started when the mobilized suction force is entirely decayed various sample nodes shown in fig 9 are selected to illustrate the nodal response of the r q model to different movement scenarios as a result of numerical simulations the hysteretic load displacement response of nodes 360 358 356 354 350 and 344 is illustrated in fig 10 spanning positions from the tdp towards the anchor end of the touchdown zone for instance the node 358 experiences penetration full suction and full breakout over ten load cycles where the spar end of the riser and the tdp moved respectively by 5 13 m and 3 8 m the penetration depth increases from the initial monotonic penetration of z d 0 15 to a final normalized depth of 0 32 at the end of the 10th cycle this limited change implies that a slight trench is formed beneath the riser under cyclic loading as shown incremental penetration under cyclic loading has been appropriately captured through the gradual soil softening by the r q hysteretic non linear soil model the results presented for nodes 356 and 354 seem similar but are different in contrast with node 354 node 356 experiences breakout since the spring spacing is 1 m throughout the region on the seabed the node id reflects the node distance from the anchor end for this analysis the initial tdp is about node 356 and transfers to about node 363 after ten cycles of excitation in these plots the penetration has been considered positive ignoring the signs of the local coordinate system in the analysis 7 1 nodal response violation in minor motion reversal a comprehensive examination of the r q model over a wide range of various parameters and different nodes shows a reasonable nodal response however there are some occasions that the model malfunctions which will be discussed here the model defines a high stiffness value when the nodal movement episode is getting reverse i e turning from penetration to uplift or vice versa this is a key requirement and well correlated with conducted centrifuge test results when the penetration or uplift episode is reasonably sustained for a while however on some occasions the model is cheated by minor changes in the movement direction of a node within a large penetration or uplift episode this violates the nodal contact pressure causing an immediate increase in penetration or suction resistance which is not supposed to happen in real soil this short reversal may be a real event or numerical fluctuation but the soil model is supposed to respond to all motion episodes properly fig 11 shows two samples of violation in nodal responses one in penetration and another in uplift phase a larger view of sample nodes with violations in suction and resistance a and b is shown in fig 12 where a minor motion reversal within the penetration or uplift phase may cause an artificial jump the sudden variation of penetration resistance or suction force can widely vary 2 100 depending on the model input parameters node location and displacement range further investigation shows that nodal response violation is more likely to happen in higher magnitudes of penetration or suction fairly close to the backbone curves a comparative example is shown in fig 13 where minor motion reversal has only violated the penetration curves closer to the ultimate penetration resistance the area of normal and violated response is separated in another sample node in fig 14 this may affect the total force mobilization both in suction and resistance and consequently contact pressure which in turn affects the shear and bending stress distribution and fatigue life of scr in this sample the suction force has been violated by 35 and the resistance by about 12 within ten cycles the trend shows that increasing the number of cycles results in higher values of residual violation a comprehensive examination of the results of the parametric study shows that the probability of nodal violation occurrence is relatively independent of model input parameters however the nodes located in the proximity of the trench bottom point toward the vessel are more likely to show response violation nodes 344 to 350 from fig 9 7 2 nodal response violation in low embedment a detailed evaluation of the nodal response within various analyses with different input parameters shows that for higher values of undrained shear strength at mudline su0 the nodal responses at trench mouth are also violated in this region with low penetrations the resistance is quickly increased because of the high value of undrained shear strength however the r q soil model cannot properly simulate the suction decay within a full uplift episode in the low range of embedment depth this causes the suction decay curve to re enter into the penetration resistance region without any reversal motion which is unexpected in a real soil response fig 15 shows sample responses of nodes 360 358 and 356 which are close to trench mouth please see fig 9 for three different values of undrained shear strength in mudline i e 0 0 0 35 and 1 0 kpa the nodal responses of these nodes are violated using 1 0 kpa undrained shear strength dashed red circles show the violation area fig 16 shows a larger view of sample load cycle in node 360 the same scenario happens in nodal responses with limited embedment for the normal values of undrained shear strength but the extremely low values near zero of suction force mobilization parameter fsuc fig 17 shows examples of nodal responses in such conditions where an unexpected residual penetration resistance is remained over the entire uplift and forced to be zero in the breakout the field surveys show that the remoulded soil inside the trench is washed out under current action and water entraps into the trench by riser motions therefore the suction force mobilization is significantly reduced over the time and the soil model needs to be able to capture the soil response for low suction values over limited uplifts these show that r q soil model has a better performance when relatively large episodes of nodal motions are applied 7 3 pre mature stabilization of nodal response the filed surveys conducted by remote operating vehicles rov have shown that a trench is created underneath the scr in touchdown area within few years after installation bridge and howells 2007 various trench depths have been reported from 3 to 10 times the pipeline diameter to examine the model capability in simulating the trench creation an individual reqular wave h 7 m t 8 7 s has been applied on scr by a large number of cycles 1539 cycles the results show that an ultimate penetration depth of less the 0 5d to 1 0d is achieved in the tdz within few load cycles at the beginning of the analysis see fig 18 the model is then rapidly stabilized and further cycles make no further embedment in another word using the usual range of the r q model input parameters the model is not able to simulate the trench creation because of pre mature stabilization fig 19 shows the pre mature stabilization of scr embedment into the seabed fig 20 shows the nodal response around node 356 in the tdz where about 70 of the total embedment is achieved only by five load cycles and the 97 of the cycles has only contributed to 10 of total embedment one may ask why 1539 cycles has been applied indeed the analysis was terminated when no further embedment was achieved the capabilities of r q riser seabed interaction model have been used before to study the influence of trench on fatigue performance shiri and randolph 2010 randolph et al the pre mature stabilization of the nodal response has caused the authors to feed unrealistic extreme input values to model key parameters to obtain a large embedment this in turn results in a relatively unrealistic trench profile leading to a fatigue response affected by a trench which needs a reliability check authors currently study this separate issue in another research project 7 4 over estimation of nodal resistance our conducted analyses show that r q riser soil interaction model simulates the gradual shallow embedment of the riser into the seabed under the cyclic loads the model simulates the trench formation neither regarding the penetration depth nor penetration resistance the main parameter heavily governing the penetration resistance is the evolutionary undrained shear strength continuously degraded under scr cycle motions the r q model assumes that the remoulded soil underneath the riser is degraded but never disappeared e g because of erosion in reality several mechanisms wash out the soil inside the trench as the riser is gradually penetrating into the seabed these mechanisms comprise the scour under seabed currents action scour because of the water pushed inside the trench by riser motion and the active pressure of riser on the seabed therefore going deeper than initial shallow embedment the real mudline travels down the trench and after a while scr can fluctuate inside the trench with no contact with the seabed soil the r q model does not lower the mudline elevation around the riser in the tdz by gradual embedment therefore the model generates nodal resistance that does not exist in reality and this leads to over estimation of nodal resistance and consequently fatigue response fig 20 using the lower values of the suction decay parameter λsuc in r q model can mitigate the conservative estimation of resistance but cannot delete the unrealistic residual resistance remaining in the scr after developing the trench fig 21 shows an example node response where a lower suction decay parameter i e 0 2 a common magnitude i e 0 5 and an extreme magnitude i e 1 0 were considered 8 impact of nodal response violation on fatigue the cyclic variation of resultant stress in scr cross section area leads to cumulative fatigue damage in the tdz barltrop aams barltrop and adams 1991 described a standard form of s n curves for marine structures which are used in fatigue damage calculation of scr as well 4 n a δ σ f m where n is the number of cycles until failure a is an empirical coefficient equivalent to the fatigue life for δσf 1 mpa δσf is the factored stress variation range in mpa m is the inverse slope of the s n curve typically around 3 for operating life of scr many millions of cycles of various stress ranges contribute and the accumulated fatigue damage can be calculated using linear cumulative damage palmgren 1924 according to the method commonly known as miner s rule 5 d i 1 k n i n i where d is the total accumulated fatigue damage k is the number of stress blocks i is the number of a particular constant stress range block in the stress histogram ni is the number of stress cycles in stress block i over the design life ni is the number of stress cycles to failure for the constant stress range i from equation 1 taking m 3 the relative fatigue damage for two different stress ranges σf2 and σf1 is 6 d 2 d 1 σ f 2 σ f 1 3 0 the stress range in scr cross section area is directly related to the shear force distribution along the riser shiri and hashemi 2012 which in turn is governed by riser seabed contact pressure and soil stiffness using the boundary layer method proposed by pesce et al 1998 the shear force may be expressed as a function of the normalized seabed stiffness so that 7 d 2 d 1 k 2 0 25 2 k 2 0 25 2 k 1 0 25 k 1 0 25 3 0 where k k e i h 2 0 274 k where k is the non dimensional soil rigidity parameter k is soil rigidity per unit

stiffness gives about 10 increase in fatigue damage 9 d 2 d 1 1 2 k 1 k 1 3 4 2 0 274 k 1 0 25 2 0 274 1 2 k 1 0 25 3 1 10 the obtained value highlights the importance of potential violations in seabed soil stiffness on the prediction of cumulative fatigue damage and consequently fatigue life comprehensive fatigue analysis has been presented in another paper part ii of this paper investigating the effects of non linear soil model on global response of the scr however an accurate assessment of the impact of r q model nodal violation on fatigue response needs improvements in existing model therefore further works need to be conducted to improve the accuracy and consistency of r q model for fatigue assessment in non linear hysteretic seabed soil conditions 9 conclusions degradation of seabed soil stiffness and trench formation under the cyclic motions of steel catenary risers in the touchdown zone is proven by rov survey bridge and howells 2007 these alter the contact pressure the stress range variation and consequently the cumulative fatigue damage throughout the scr in the touchdown zone non linear hysteretic riser seabed interaction models have been developed and implemented into business software packages within recent years to simulate the riser penetration into the seabed within fatigue analysis a popular model referred to as r q model proposed by randolph and quiggin 2009 was selected and its nodal performance was comprehensively studied through developing a numerical model in abaqus with r q model coded through a user defined subroutine uel the study showed there are some over conservative assumptions and nodal response violations in r q model resulting in over estimation of penetration and suction resistance and consequently the fatigue damage in the tdz the nodal response violation was frequently observed within the nodes in the proximity of trench bottom towards the vessel this area is the most fatigue prone section of scr in the touchdown zone the results obtained from this study suggested that modifications are needed to improve the nodal performance of r q model though comfort may be taken from the fact that the r q model overestimates the fatigue damage particular attention shall be paid to updating the mudline elevation throughout the load cycles enabling the trench development underneath the scr also any new model to be developed in this field in the future needs to be widely examined in different nodes on the scr through realistic cyclic motions and range of model parameters representing the seabed soil conditions it is worth mentioning that in reality there are several complex riser soil fluid interactions and a wide range of loading scenarios that affect the ultimate trench profile and consequently the accumulated fatigue damage it is quite difficult to make any robust reference about the real effect of the trench on the scr fatigue without modeling more realistic conditions extensive research work should be conducted to simultaneously consider the proper effects of all contributing events that will be hopefully achieved in future studies acknowledgements the

23519,the capability of a numerical model to mimic the operation of a physical wave tank allows us to carry out complementary numerical tests to explore various aspects or to investigate the insights of the physical tests which are otherwise not feasible with limited measured data the numerical model could also be extended beyond the physical limitation of a laboratory facility such as full scale tests with realistic conditions at lower cost and shorter turnaround time in this paper we present a construction of such a numerical model of a physical wave tank with flap paddles and porous beaches the model is built based on the navier stokes solver and the volume of fluids method in the open source software open field operation and manipulation openfoam the paddles and the beaches are explicitly modelled to mimic the behaviours of the physical counterparts in the tank high quality laboratory experiments of regular and focused waves were conducted for the validation of the numerical model extension of the numerical model to a three dimensional wave tank with individually controlled paddles is also demonstrated keywords numerical wave tank dynamic mesh wave paddles porous beach wave generation wave absorption 1 introduction offshore structures such as floating platforms and oil derricks in the oceans are exposed to impacts of extreme waves due to the harsh operational conditions in the ocean modern offshore structures are often designed with high safety factor and undergone rigorous model testing a common avenue of testing offshore structures is by conducting experiments in laboratory wave tanks such model tests are costly and subject to instrumentation limitations and physical limitations of the wave tank on the other hand with the rapid development of supercomputers and numerical methodologies numerical studies are less expensive and are able to a produce full range of data in the studied domain however model simplification and assumptions are necessary in numerical simulations rendering the numerical results to many sources of uncertainties therefore combinations of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations which exploit the strengths while complementing the weaknesses of each approach are more commonly adopted experimental data is used to validate numerical models while numerical results complement experiments where data is lacking for example missing data points at certain locations due to inaccessibility of physical measuring devices furthermore validated numerical models can be used to evaluate various designs of offshore structures and test them under different environmental conditions without the need to repeat the physical experiments numerical models can also be extended to conduct full scale simulations beyond the physical limit of the laboratory facilities such numerical experiments are time effective and cost saving a common physical wave tank uses moving paddles to generate waves and uses beaches to absorb waves in a numerical wave tank waves can be generated and absorbed with several methods the most straightforward approach to generate waves is to apply pre defined surface elevations at the lateral open boundaries of the computational domain generated waves are allowed to transmit freely across the lateral boundaries by using an appropriate boundary condition this simple approach is suitable for modelling long waves in oceans such as tides and tsunami pang and tkalich 2003 tang et al 2009 the computational domain could be extended to include relaxation zones at the lateral boundaries for better wave generation and absorption jacobsen et al 2012 in the relaxation zones pre defined surface elevations are relaxed to known analytical solutions for wave generation while unwanted waves are forced to decay gradually for wave absorption the requirement to extend the computational domain renders this method unsuitable for large numerical models which are often the case for enclosed deep water wave tanks the internal wave maker method of lin and liu 1999 uses an internal source that periodically produces positive and negative fluxes in the governing equations to generate waves this approach requires the source zone to be located in the middle of the computational domain which requires domain extension or at a symmetric plane which geometrically limits the computational domain a similar approach is used in the wamit code for wave generation lee 1995 a velocity potential the source is used to represent the scattered waves generated by a body the wave paddle which is fixed at its undisturbed position the most direct approach to generate and absorb waves in a wave tank is to explicitly model the physical wave paddles and the beaches this method has the advantage replicating the exact movement of the physical paddles and the characteristics of the beaches in experiments hence replicating their effects on the wave field another advantage of modelling the paddle movement is the ability to incorporate an active wave correction algorithm which is available in some physical wave tanks such as the one used in this study this algorithm receives real time feedbacks from the wave tank to correct the input signals into the paddle thereby fine tuning the wave generation paddles with an active wave correction algorithm have also been used as wave absorbers despite its advantages the approach of modelling the paddle movement has not been widely used due to the need for dynamic mesh some studies that adopted this approach are reported in grilli 1997 where a moving boundary was applied for a two dimensional 2d potential flow numerical wave tank and was later generalized to a three dimensional 3d tank in brandini and grilli 2001 recently higuera et al 2013 2015 employed the dynamic mesh solver in openfoam to model piston wave paddles for wave generation and absorption in their numerical wave tanks numerical simulations indicated a high degree of accordance with the experiments proving the capability of simulating wave tanks using this method as our goal is to develop a numerical wave tank that complements a physical one we have chosen to explicitly model the wave generators as solid paddles with physical movement while piston paddles are commonly used in small scale laboratory wave tanks flap paddles are used in large and deep wave tanks such as deep water ocean basins in this work the moving boundary method in higuera et al 2015 is extended to simulate flap wave paddles in addition the porous beaches are explicitly modelled to mimic wave reflection behaviour in the physical tanks since many wave tanks use porous beaches for wave absorption the numerical model is developed based on the open source package openfoam a series of high quality laboratory experiments of regular waves sinusoidal waves with fixed frequency and wave height and focused waves modulated wave trains designed to focus at a predetermined time and location in a long wave tank was conducted for the validation of the numerical model in numerical simulations of focused waves amplitude and phase error of smaller and shorter wave components are often hidden from those of the larger and longer wave components as a result the damping of amplitude or phase mismatch of smaller or reflected wave components is difficult to evaluate therefore the numerical model s accuracy is tested for both regular and focused waves furthermore the capability of the numerical model in predicting the wave induced velocities under focused waves is also tested section 2 describes the experimental setup while section 3 describes the numerical model setup section 4 discusses the results and validation of the numerical wave tank with experimental data section 5 extends the numerical model of single paddle to multiple paddles and further to a 3d wave tank with two rows of paddles 2 experimental setup the experiments were conducted in a wave tank at the university of aberdeen united kingdom the tank is 20 m long 0 8 m high and 0 45 m wide fig 1 with smooth bottom and side walls the water depth was fixed at 0 7 m for all experiments a bottom hinged flap paddle was used for wave generation a porous beach measured 5 m by 0 8 m spanning across the whole channel width served as wave absorber providing less than 5 wave reflection in terms of amplitude two cases of regular wave and two cases of focused waves were generated see table 1 for the regular wave case r1 and case r2 represent linear and stokes 2nd waves according to the wave theory for focused wave case f1 and case f2 with peak frequencies of 0 6761 and 0 8399 hz represent north sea and australian sea states respectively these are intermediate depth waves surface elevations were measured using twin wire resistance wave gauges a labview controlled national instruments unit was used to record the wave gauge measurements with a sampling frequency 256 hz water velocities were measured by a laser doppler anemometry lda system the aberdeen lda system includes a 3d automated traverse with 600 mm range in x y and z for accurate 10 μm positioning of the measurement points in the flow field the vertical positions of the lda are of 0 2 mm accuracy the traverse was levelled to 0 15 accuracy in x y and z the z 0 position was set at the still water level swl for these experiments simultaneous measurements of the lda velocities and measurements from the wave gauge located at the focus point were recorded the lda data acquisition started 1 s after the start of paddle motion the locations of the wave probes are shown in fig 1 for regular waves water surface elevations η were measured at x 4 0 m and x 9 42 m where x 0 is at the paddle for focused waves water surface elevations were measured at eight locations x 3 5 7 9 9 42 10 12 14 m at the designed focus point x 9 42 m horizontal and vertical velocities were also measured at nine vertical positions at a distance of y 0 102 m from tank sidewall four positions below swl z 0 4 0 3 0 2 and 0 1 m one position at the swl z 0 m four positions above swl nominally at z 0 35 η f 0 6 η f 0 75 η f and 0 85 η f where η f is the designed focused height crest to swl 3 numerical model setup 3 1 development of a solver with dynamic mesh and porosity in openfoam we adopted openfoam v1 6 ext openfoam foundation 2015 as our computational fluid dynamics cfd development platform due to the flexibility of its source code customization openfoam is efficient in parallel simulations and is compatible with many pre and post processing tools openfoam data can be easily converted to from the format of other commercial cfd software e g ansys fluent cfx star cd by its in built conversion tools openfoam offers a large number of in built solvers the interfoam solver uses the finite volume method fvm for spatial discretization and the pressure implicit with splitting of operator piso algorithm to solve the navier stokes equations for two phase flows with the volume of fluids vof method to capture the fluid interface the interfoam solver has previously been used to model water wave by morgan et al 2010 afshar 2010 jacobsen et al 2012 and higuera et al 2013 in all these applications waves were generated by applying velocities and phase fraction in a relaxation zone at open boundaries and were absorbed by artificial absorptions which are technically different from the development in the present work however the basics of interfoam remain the same higuera et al 2015 used the extended interdymfoam that couples a dynamic mesh solver jasak 2009 into the interfoam solver to model physical movements of piston wave paddles in this work we extended the moving boundary approach to model flap wave paddles although flap paddles have rotational motion which is different from uniform displacement of piston paddles we have shown that the interdymfoam solve is readily extendable to non uniform mesh movement to model wave dissipation through porous beach we integrated the porousmedia tool available in openfoam hafsteinsson 2009 into interdymfoam the integrated model was named as porousinterdymfoam the accuracy of the numerical models to capture the surface elevation and the wave induced velocities was tested against experiments for several regular and focused wave conditions 3 2 governing equations the surface wave propagation in a wave tank is modelled in openfoam by reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations for two phase air water flow 1 u 0 2 ρ u t ρ uu μ u p g x ρ σ t κ α α where u u v w is the velocity ρ and μ are the density and the dynamic viscosity which vary across the air and water interface p is the pressure g is the gravitational acceleration and x x y z is the cartesian coordinates the last term in eq 2 represents the effect of surface tension here σ t is the surface tension coefficient κ α is the surface curvature of the interface between air and water and α is the volume fraction of fluids bottom friction is neglected in simulations of intermediate depth waves in the interfoam solver air and water are not modelled separately neither is the interface instead the interface between the two fluids is modelled by the volume of fluids vof method hirt and nichols 1981 the interface is tracked using a scalar field α which takes the value of 0 for air zero volume fraction of water and 1 for water while the mixture are defined by intermediate values of α properties of fluids across the interface are calculated based on the volume fraction for example eq 3 shows the fluid density is calculated based on α and the density of water and air 3 ρ α ρ w a t e r 1 α ρ a i r the field of α is modelled by an advection eq 4 in openfoam an artificial compression term u r α 1 α is added into the equation to limit the smearing of the interface weller 2002 the modified advection equation for α is 4 α t u α u r α 1 α 0 where u r min c α u max u with c α a user defined coefficient to introduce the compression effect at the interface having volume fraction values other than 0 and 1 3 3 numerical model of a 2d wave tank fig 2 shows the basic model of a wave tank the tank has length l and water depth h the paddle is generally elevated at a level h 0 which is often seen in a deep water wave tank the submerged depth of the paddle is thus h h 0 both left and right walls as well as the bottom of the tank are modelled as solid impermeable boundaries the paddle is modelled as a solid impermeable boundary which can be moved by user defined inputs for wave generation to be described in section 3 4 the atmosphere boundaries are modelled as atmospheric open boundary condition o b c where air is allowed to flow in or out at atmospheric pressure the portion of the atmospheric boundary above the wave paddle slides nearly according to the movement of the free end of the paddle in the direction perpendicular to the x z plane the span wise front and back faces have slip boundary conditions and the mesh points slide along them in the x direction according to the paddle movement the absorbing beach is positioned at the opposite end of the wave tank in a physical wave tank a gap usually exists downstream of the beach to collect spillage over the beach in our model a small gap between the beach and the right wall is explicitly modelled the beach has length l b height h b and submerged depth h b s fig 2 shows an example of a beach with straight triangular surface located at h h b s above the bottom note that in general the beach could take other shapes and profiles such as parabolic curved profile and could be extended to the bottom while the beach material could be solid or porous to be described in section 3 5 second order schemes were used for spatial discretization while first order euler scheme was used for temporal discretization at the start of a simulation the water part was initialized with volume fraction of fluids α 1 density ρ 1000 k g m 3 and dynamic viscosity μ 10 3 k g m 1 s 1 the air part was initialized with α 0 ρ 1 k g m 3 and μ 10 5 k g m 1 s 1 the surface tension coefficient σ t 0 07 k g s 2 initial velocity was set to zero 3 4 model of wave paddles in physical wave tanks two types of paddles are commonly used to generate waves flap paddle for rotational motion and piston paddle for translational motion as shown in fig 3 in general the paddle is elevated from the bottom by a distance of h 0 0 in our cases both types of paddles generate waves by creating horizontal displacement of water with the motion of the paddles wave generation by piston paddle in openfoam was validated in higuera et al 2015 our present work focuses on wave generation by flap paddle which is more suitable for modelling deep water waves as it produces linearly varying displacement with water depth o dea and newman 2007 the far field biesel transfer functions relating wave height h paddle stroke s wave number k and initial water depth h for flap and piston paddles can be derived from a set of boundary forcing laplace governing equations for inviscid and irrotational flows dean

wave absorption in the experiment the porous beach in the numerical model was calibrated to reproduce wave reflections of less than 5 corresponding to the experiments the porous beach was modelled as a medium with porosity γ into the time derivative and a momentum sink term s to the right hand side of eq 2 as described in hafsteinsson 2009 resulting in eq 7 7 γ ρ u t ρ uu μ u p g x ρ σ t κ α α s 8 s μ d 1 2 ρ u f u here d and f in eq 8 are the darcy and forchheimer coefficients respectively the darcy forchheimer formula comprises two parts the viscous resistance scaled by the darcy coefficient and the inertial resistance scaled by the forchheimer coefficient the porous medium calibrated and validated in previous study by the authors magee et al 2015 was used to model the porous beach the porous beach was first assumed to be isotropic the porosity darcy and forchheimer coefficients were the same in all directions f and d were initially guessed based on the porosity of the beach values of f are often in the range of tens to hundreds in the wave alone cases the shear stresses are almost zero and the flow is often characterized by a potential flow teles et al 2013 the inertial resistance is therefore negligible compared to the viscous resistance we set f to the initial guess and conducted a simulation for each value of d in the range of 106 to 107 wave refection coefficients were calculated from the numerical simulations with different d and compared with the measurements to choose the closest one the wave reflection coefficient was defined as the amplitude ratio of the reflected wave to the incident wave both extracted from the surface elevations at two locations near the beach jacobsen et al 2012 this method was validated for a parabolic beach in chew et al 2015 by comparing the wave reflection coefficients between simulated waves and waves generated in experiments experiments with parabolic shaped impermeable beach showed wave reflection coefficients of 2 10 for waves with wavelength ranging from 3 to 15 m while numerical simulations reported wave reflection coefficients of 1 12 a test case with no absorbing beach i e a solid vertical wall at the trailing end of the model correctly predicted wave reflection coefficient of 100 full reflection of the incident wave upon hitting the vertical wall the calibrated parameters for the porous beach is given in table 2 3 6 mesh independence study for simulations of wave propagation especially using the vof method spatial resolution in the wave zone i e the number of cells per wave height and the number of cells per wavelength are critical to minimize the temporal and spatial damping of wave height due to numerical diffusions and smearing of the interface mesh independence study was thus performed to derive an optimal mesh resolution orthogonal meshes with four different resolutions named fine normal coarse and very coarse see table 3 were used all numerical models have identical boundary conditions and settings numerical simulations of a stokes 3rd regular wave were carried out over 100 wave periods to obtain fully developed wave profiles the last 10 wave periods were plotted in fig 4 for analysis as shown in fig 4 the very coarse and coarse mesh models produced wave profiles with smaller wave heights compared to the normal mesh model not only smaller wave heights were produced wave phases were also shifted with normal mesh resolution the model produced a profile black solid line almost coincides with that obtained from the fine resolution model blue solid line indicating that the normal mesh resolution having 60 cells per wave height and 100 cells per wavelength was sufficient for simulations of wave propagation the normal mesh resolution was therefore adopted for all subsequent simulations in this study the almost constant levels of wave crests and troughs also indicated that wave reflections from the simulated porous beach were very small less than 5 4 results comparison and discussions 4 1 regular waves in this section the regular waves r1 and r2 in table 1 were tested the second order wave board motion theory for flap type wave maker i e eq 5 was used to compute wave board motions from the provided wave heights and frequencies similar to the experiments probes were placed at x 4 0 m and x 9 42 m to record the surface elevation for comparison data collection was started after the wave profiles had reached a steady pattern fig 5 and fig 6 plot the time history of surface elevations at x 4 0 m and x 9 42 m for regular waves r1 and r2 respectively in terms of wave periods the numerical simulation agreed well with the experiments in terms of wave heights the simulation seemed slightly over predicted the experiment at x 4 0 m however at x 9 42 m the wave heights from simulation showed a slight decay as compared with those at x 4 0 m and became closer to experimental data no significant wave reflections were observed the plotted periods were sufficiently long for reflected waves to return to the wave probe at x 9 42 m note that the experiments were conducted with active corrections for the paddle to keep the generated wave height close to the targets in the numerical simulations the second order wave board motion theory for flap type wave maker based on the target wave heights and frequencies without active correction was used this likely attributes to the discrepancies in wave heights near the paddle with paddle signal provided the flap wave maker model will generate accurate wave profiles in the wave tank which will be shown in the next section 4 2 focused waves next we tested the capability of the numerical model to simulate focused waves case f1 and case f2 table 1 the paddle s movements recorded in the experiments were directly input into the numerical model as time varying displacement boundary conditions water surface elevations at the eight horizontal locations wave probe locations in fig 1 and velocities at nine vertical locations lda locations in fig 1 in the wave tank were extracted for comparisons fig 7 and fig 8 plot the surface elevations at the eight locations while figs 9 12 plot the horizontal and vertical velocities u and w at nine lda locations at x 9 42 m the experimental data above the wave trough measured points z 0 mm appear discontinuous because lda did not measure the velocity above the instantaneous surface elevation the data from numerical model were therefore processed to exclude fictitious data points above the surface elevation figs 7 and 8 show that numerical results of surface elevations match closely to the experiments at all wave probe locations for both f1 and f2 cases both large waves and small waves in the wave groups were captured in the numerical simulations small displacements from the wave amplitude were observed on the simulated surface elevations at wave probes near the beach this was caused by the reflected waves zooming in to several waves in the wave group around the focused point wave heights measured from the focused crest to the trough in front of the simulated waves almost match to those from the experiments the wave heights of the focused waves for cases f1 and f2 measured 248 5 mm and 115 8 mm in the simulations and 245 8 mm and 114 4 mm in the experiments respectively the differences were approximately 1 the crest to swl heights η f for cases f1 and f2 were 160 8 mm and 73 6 mm in the simulations and 161 6 mm and 70 7 mm in the experiments these values were close to the designed η f of 160 mm and 72 mm the phases of simulated waves were slightly delayed as compared to those from experiments however phase shifts were less than 4 of the peak frequencies comparisons in figs 9 12 show excellent match between simulated horizontal and vertical velocities u and w with experimental data at nine lda locations at the lda locations nearest to the focused wave peaks the focused wave could reach in a very short time and the numerical model successfully captured this small period simulated focused wave profiles figs 7 and 8 and velocities figs 9 12 were in excellent agreement with experimental data validating our numerical model with physical movement of flap paddle and porous beach an interesting aspect of the present numerical model is that we fed the recorded paddle positions in the experiments as direct input into the paddle in the numerical model without fine tuning or calibration this modelling capability is extremely useful for simulating wave tanks equipped with active absorption where the paddle movements are computed on the fly and adjusted according to instantaneous wave flow conditions moreover wave flow disturbances due to imperfect wave paddled generation and beach absorption in laboratory experiments could be captured in the numerical model allowing the model to simulate imperfect experiments for troubleshooting the numerical model can thus be used to fine tune the paddle movement signals prior to laboratory experiments 5 extension to 3d wave tank with multiple paddles having demonstrated that the single paddle model could replicate 2d laboratory experiments we extended the numerical model to simulate a realistic 3d wave tank with multiple paddles covering two sides of the tank and absorbing beaches located at opposite sides each paddle is an independently movable plate with its own input the paddle strokes are computed using eqs 5 and 6 while the stroke and phase adjustments are computed based on huygen s principle frigaard et al 1993 to account for wave generation in oblique directions in the cases where inputs into the paddles in laboratory experiments are available the input signals can be fed directly into the paddles in the numerical wave tank to replicate the experiments the gaps between paddles including one at the corner of the two paddle rows are modelled explicitly in the numerical model the gaps are treated as solid moving boundaries similar to the paddles to prevent water leakage the gaps movements are calculated according to the movements of the two paddles on both sides of the gaps due to their small size these gaps are numerically challenging to model as the stretching of the dynamic mesh in such small gaps can cause instability in the present 3d tank each gap is represented by a one cell layer between the paddles while in general we may have more than one cell for each gap the gap at the corner of the two paddle rows is larger to accommodate movements of the two adjacent paddles this gap is represented by a multiple cell layer and is not moved fig 13 demonstrates a series of 60 long crested oblique waves generated in a numerical wave tank with 30 flap paddles color of the water surface represents surface elevation with red representing wave peaks and blue representing wave troughs besides showing the capability of the 3d wave tank to simulate oblique waves fig 13 also reveals how each paddle can be moved individually to form a serpentine pattern note the small gaps between the paddles appear transparent for illustration purpose time evolution of surface elevations along three 30 degree oblique lines l1 l2 and l3 that cross the y axis at y 4 7 and 10 m respectively were extracted from the simulation and plotted in fig 14 note that these lines are orthogonal to the wave propagation direction and parallel to the wave crests one can see that the long crested waves were fairly well generated in the basin some cross wave patterns were observed along wave crests and troughs that look like standing waves these undulations are more obvious along l1 and l2 nearer to the corner of the two paddle rows and are better mixed along l3 in this case due to constraints in computational resources the tank dimensions were relatively small and resolutions were very coarse as compared to the wave dimensions for demonstration purpose for accurate simulations and meaningful analyses of wave fields the normal resolution in table 3 should be used 6 conclusions a numerical model for wave generation by physical movement of a flap paddle and wave absorption by a porous beach was developed in openfoam both the paddle movement for wave generation as well as the porous beach for wave absorption were modelled explicitly to resemble a physical wave tank numerically a series of high quality laboratory experiments of regular wave and focused wave in a wave tank was conducted for the validation of the numerical model validation results showed that the physical movement of the flap paddle can be mimicked in a numerical model producing both regular and focused waves at designated wave parameters modelling the movement of the paddle explicitly has the advantage of incorporating active wave absorption by the paddle in the numerical model the porous beach achieved a wave reflection of less than 5 the numerical model can be extended to model realistic 3d wave tanks with multiple wave paddles and wave absorbers by conducting the experiments in the numerical physical wave tanks with exactly the same dimension and same parameters as the experiments the wave profiles generated by the numerical tanks could match accurately with the experiments the validated numerical model can thus serve as a virtual wave tank to complement laboratory experiments in giving insights of wave and flow conditions in the laboratory tank due to its capability of providing a holistic flow field in the tank the numerical model can also be used to simulate wave

23519,the capability of a numerical model to mimic the operation of a physical wave tank allows us to carry out complementary numerical tests to explore various aspects or to investigate the insights of the physical tests which are otherwise not feasible with limited measured data the numerical model could also be extended beyond the physical limitation of a laboratory facility such as full scale tests with realistic conditions at lower cost and shorter turnaround time in this paper we present a construction of such a numerical model of a physical wave tank with flap paddles and porous beaches the model is built based on the navier stokes solver and the volume of fluids method in the open source software open field operation and manipulation openfoam the paddles and the beaches are explicitly modelled to mimic the behaviours of the physical counterparts in the tank high quality laboratory experiments of regular and focused waves were conducted for the validation of the numerical model extension of the numerical model to a three dimensional wave tank with individually controlled paddles is also demonstrated keywords numerical wave tank dynamic mesh wave paddles porous beach wave generation wave absorption 1 introduction offshore structures such as floating platforms and oil derricks in the oceans are exposed to impacts of extreme waves due to the harsh operational conditions in the ocean modern offshore structures are often designed with high safety factor and undergone rigorous model testing a common avenue of testing offshore structures is by conducting experiments in laboratory wave tanks such model tests are costly and subject to instrumentation limitations and physical limitations of the wave tank on the other hand with the rapid development of supercomputers and numerical methodologies numerical studies are less expensive and are able to a produce full range of data in the studied domain however model simplification and assumptions are necessary in numerical simulations rendering the numerical results to many sources of uncertainties therefore combinations of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations which exploit the strengths while complementing the weaknesses of each approach are more commonly adopted experimental data is used to validate numerical models while numerical results complement experiments where data is lacking for example missing data points at certain locations due to inaccessibility of physical measuring devices furthermore validated numerical models can be used to evaluate various designs of offshore structures and test them under different environmental conditions without the need to repeat the physical experiments numerical models can also be extended to conduct full scale simulations beyond the physical limit of the laboratory facilities such numerical experiments are time effective and cost saving a common physical wave tank uses moving paddles to generate waves and uses beaches to absorb waves in a numerical wave tank waves can be generated and absorbed with several methods the most straightforward approach to generate waves is to apply pre defined surface elevations at the lateral open boundaries of the computational domain generated waves are allowed to transmit freely across the lateral boundaries by using an appropriate boundary condition this simple approach is suitable for modelling long waves in oceans such as tides and tsunami pang and tkalich 2003 tang et al 2009 the computational domain could be extended to include relaxation zones at the lateral boundaries for better wave generation and absorption jacobsen et al 2012 in the relaxation zones pre defined surface elevations are relaxed to known analytical solutions for wave generation while unwanted waves are forced to decay gradually for wave absorption the requirement to extend the computational domain renders this method unsuitable for large numerical models which are often the case for enclosed deep water wave tanks the internal wave maker method of lin and liu 1999 uses an internal source that periodically produces positive and negative fluxes in the governing equations to generate waves this approach requires the source zone to be located in the middle of the computational domain which requires domain extension or at a symmetric plane which geometrically limits the computational domain a similar approach is used in the wamit code for wave generation lee 1995 a velocity potential the source is used to represent the scattered waves generated by a body the wave paddle which is fixed at its undisturbed position the most direct approach to generate and absorb waves in a wave tank is to explicitly model the physical wave paddles and the beaches this method has the advantage replicating the exact movement of the physical paddles and the characteristics of the beaches in experiments hence replicating their effects on the wave field another advantage of modelling the paddle movement is the ability to incorporate an active wave correction algorithm which is available in some physical wave tanks such as the one used in this study this algorithm receives real time feedbacks from the wave tank to correct the input signals into the paddle thereby fine tuning the wave generation paddles with an active wave correction algorithm have also been used as wave absorbers despite its advantages the approach of modelling the paddle movement has not been widely used due to the need for dynamic mesh some studies that adopted this approach are reported in grilli 1997 where a moving boundary was applied for a two dimensional 2d potential flow numerical wave tank and was later generalized to a three dimensional 3d tank in brandini and grilli 2001 recently higuera et al 2013 2015 employed the dynamic mesh solver in openfoam to model piston wave paddles for wave generation and absorption in their numerical wave tanks numerical simulations indicated a high degree of accordance with the experiments proving the capability of simulating wave tanks using this method as our goal is to develop a numerical wave tank that complements a physical one we have chosen to explicitly model the wave generators as solid paddles with physical movement while piston paddles are commonly used in small scale laboratory wave tanks flap paddles are used in large and deep wave tanks such as deep water ocean basins in this work the moving boundary method in higuera et al 2015 is extended to simulate flap wave paddles in addition the porous beaches are explicitly modelled to mimic wave reflection behaviour in the physical tanks since many wave tanks use porous beaches for wave absorption the numerical model is developed based on the open source package openfoam a series of high quality laboratory experiments of regular waves sinusoidal waves with fixed frequency and wave height and focused waves modulated wave trains designed to focus at a predetermined time and location in a long wave tank was conducted for the validation of the numerical model in numerical simulations of focused waves amplitude and phase error of smaller and shorter wave components are often hidden from those of the larger and longer wave components as a result the damping of amplitude or phase mismatch of smaller or reflected wave components is difficult to evaluate therefore the numerical model s accuracy is tested for both regular and focused waves furthermore the capability of the numerical model in predicting the wave induced velocities under focused waves is also tested section 2 describes the experimental setup while section 3 describes the numerical model setup section 4 discusses the results and validation of the numerical wave tank with experimental data section 5 extends the numerical model of single paddle to multiple paddles and further to a 3d wave tank with two rows of paddles 2 experimental setup the experiments were conducted in a wave tank at the university of aberdeen united kingdom the tank is 20 m long 0 8 m high and 0 45 m wide fig 1 with smooth bottom and side walls the water depth was fixed at 0 7 m for all experiments a bottom hinged flap paddle was used for wave generation a porous beach measured 5 m by 0 8 m spanning across the whole channel width served as wave absorber providing less than 5 wave reflection in terms of amplitude two cases of regular wave and two cases of focused waves were generated see table 1 for the regular wave case r1 and case r2 represent linear and stokes 2nd waves according to the wave theory for focused wave case f1 and case f2 with peak frequencies of 0 6761 and 0 8399 hz represent north sea and australian sea states respectively these are intermediate depth waves surface elevations were measured using twin wire resistance wave gauges a labview controlled national instruments unit was used to record the wave gauge measurements with a sampling frequency 256 hz water velocities were measured by a laser doppler anemometry lda system the aberdeen lda system includes a 3d automated traverse with 600 mm range in x y and z for accurate 10 μm positioning of the measurement points in the flow field the vertical positions of the lda are of 0 2 mm accuracy the traverse was levelled to 0 15 accuracy in x y and z the z 0 position was set at the still water level swl for these experiments simultaneous measurements of the lda velocities and measurements from the wave gauge located at the focus point were recorded the lda data acquisition started 1 s after the start of paddle motion the locations of the wave probes are shown in fig 1 for regular waves water surface elevations η were measured at x 4 0 m and x 9 42 m where x 0 is at the paddle for focused waves water surface elevations were measured at eight locations x 3 5 7 9 9 42 10 12 14 m at the designed focus point x 9 42 m horizontal and vertical velocities were also measured at nine vertical positions at a distance of y 0 102 m from tank sidewall four positions below swl z 0 4 0 3 0 2 and 0 1 m one position at the swl z 0 m four positions above swl nominally at z 0 35 η f 0 6 η f 0 75 η f

foundation 2015 as our computational fluid dynamics cfd development platform due to the flexibility of its source code customization openfoam is efficient in parallel simulations and is compatible with many pre and post processing tools openfoam data can be easily converted to from the format of other commercial cfd software e g ansys fluent cfx star cd by its in built conversion tools openfoam offers a large number of in built solvers the interfoam solver uses the finite volume method fvm for spatial discretization and the pressure implicit with splitting of operator piso algorithm to solve the navier stokes equations for two phase flows with the volume of fluids vof method to capture the fluid interface the interfoam solver has previously been used to model water wave by morgan et al 2010 afshar 2010 jacobsen et al 2012 and higuera et al 2013 in all these applications waves were generated by applying velocities and phase fraction in a relaxation zone at open boundaries and were absorbed by artificial absorptions which are technically different from the development in the present work however the basics of interfoam remain the same higuera et al 2015 used the extended interdymfoam that couples a dynamic mesh solver jasak 2009 into the interfoam solver to model physical movements of piston wave paddles in this work we extended the moving boundary approach to model flap wave paddles although flap paddles have rotational motion which is different from uniform displacement of piston paddles we have shown that the interdymfoam solve is readily extendable to non uniform mesh movement to model wave dissipation through porous beach we integrated the porousmedia tool available in openfoam hafsteinsson 2009 into interdymfoam the integrated model was named as porousinterdymfoam the accuracy of the numerical models to capture the surface elevation and the wave induced velocities was tested against experiments for several regular and focused wave conditions 3 2 governing equations the surface wave propagation in a wave tank is modelled in openfoam by reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations for two phase air water flow 1 u 0 2 ρ u t ρ uu μ u p g x ρ σ t κ α α where u u v w is the velocity ρ and μ are the density and the dynamic viscosity which vary across the air and water interface p is the pressure g is the gravitational acceleration and x x y z is the cartesian coordinates the last term in eq 2 represents the effect of surface tension here σ t is the surface tension coefficient κ α is the surface curvature of the interface between air and water and α is the volume fraction of fluids bottom friction is neglected in simulations of intermediate depth waves in the interfoam solver air and water are not modelled separately neither is the interface instead the interface between the two fluids is modelled by the volume of fluids vof method hirt and nichols 1981 the interface is tracked using a scalar field α which takes the value of 0 for air zero volume fraction of water and 1 for water while the mixture are defined by intermediate values of α properties of fluids across the interface are calculated based on the volume fraction for example eq 3 shows the fluid density is calculated based on α and the density of water and air 3 ρ α ρ w a t e r 1 α ρ a i r the field of α is modelled by an advection eq 4 in openfoam an artificial compression term u r α 1 α is added into the equation to limit the smearing of the interface weller 2002 the modified advection equation for α is 4 α t u α u r α 1 α 0 where u r min c α u max u with c α a user defined coefficient to introduce the compression effect at the interface having volume fraction values other than 0 and 1 3 3 numerical model of a 2d wave tank fig 2 shows the basic model of a wave tank the tank has length l and water depth h the paddle is generally elevated at a level h 0 which is often seen in a deep water wave tank the submerged depth of the paddle is thus h h 0 both left and right walls as well as the bottom of the tank are modelled as solid impermeable boundaries the paddle is modelled as a solid impermeable boundary which can be moved by user defined inputs for wave generation to be described in section 3 4 the atmosphere boundaries are modelled as atmospheric open boundary condition o b c where air is allowed to flow in or out at atmospheric pressure the portion of the atmospheric boundary above the wave paddle slides nearly according to the movement of the free end of the paddle in the direction perpendicular to the x z plane the span wise front and back faces have slip boundary conditions and the mesh points slide along them in the x direction according to the paddle movement the absorbing beach is positioned at the opposite end of the wave tank in a physical wave tank a gap usually exists downstream of the beach to collect spillage over the beach in our model a small gap between the beach and the right wall is explicitly modelled the beach has length l b height h b and submerged depth h b s fig 2 shows an example of a beach with straight triangular surface located at h h b s above the bottom note that in general the beach could take other shapes and profiles such as parabolic curved profile and could be extended to the bottom while the beach material could be solid or porous to be described in section 3 5 second order schemes were used for spatial discretization while first order euler scheme was used for temporal discretization at the start of a simulation the water part was initialized with volume fraction of fluids α 1 density ρ 1000 k g m 3 and dynamic viscosity μ 10 3 k g m 1 s 1 the air part was initialized with α 0 ρ 1 k g m 3 and μ 10 5 k g m 1 s 1 the surface tension coefficient σ t 0 07 k g s 2 initial velocity was set to zero 3 4 model of wave paddles in physical wave tanks two types of paddles are commonly used to generate waves flap paddle for rotational motion and piston paddle for translational motion as shown in fig 3 in general the paddle is elevated from the bottom by a distance of h 0 0 in our cases both types of paddles generate waves by creating horizontal displacement of water with the motion of the paddles wave generation by piston paddle in openfoam was validated in higuera et al 2015 our present work focuses on wave generation by flap paddle which is more suitable for modelling deep water waves as it produces linearly varying displacement with water depth o dea and newman 2007 the far field biesel transfer functions relating wave height h paddle stroke s wave number k and initial water depth h for flap and piston paddles can be derived from a set of boundary forcing laplace governing equations for inviscid and irrotational flows dean

left sketch in fig 3 the horizontal displacement of the moving boundary representing the flap paddle is computed as a function of z in eq 6 6 s z s h h 0 z h h 0 3 5 model of porous beach to match the wave absorption in the experiment the porous beach in the numerical model was calibrated to reproduce wave reflections of less than 5 corresponding to the experiments the porous beach was modelled as a medium with porosity γ into the time derivative and a momentum sink term s to the right hand side of eq 2 as described in hafsteinsson 2009 resulting in eq 7 7 γ ρ u t ρ uu μ u p g x ρ σ t κ α α s 8 s μ d 1 2 ρ u f u here d and f in eq 8 are the darcy and forchheimer coefficients respectively the darcy forchheimer formula comprises two parts the viscous resistance scaled by the darcy coefficient and the inertial resistance scaled by the forchheimer coefficient the porous medium calibrated and validated in previous study by the authors magee et al 2015 was used to model the porous beach the porous beach was first assumed to be isotropic the porosity darcy and forchheimer coefficients were the same in all directions f and d were initially guessed based on the porosity of the beach values of f are often in the range of tens to hundreds in the wave alone cases the shear stresses are almost zero and the flow is often characterized by a potential flow teles et al 2013 the inertial resistance is therefore negligible compared to the viscous resistance we set f to the initial guess and conducted a simulation for each value of d in the range of 106 to 107 wave refection coefficients were calculated from the numerical simulations with different d and compared with the measurements to choose the closest one the wave reflection coefficient was defined as the amplitude ratio of the reflected wave to the incident wave both extracted from the surface elevations at two locations near the beach jacobsen et al 2012 this method was validated for a parabolic beach in chew et al 2015 by comparing the wave reflection coefficients between simulated waves and waves generated in experiments experiments with parabolic shaped impermeable beach showed wave reflection coefficients of 2 10 for waves with wavelength ranging from 3 to 15 m while numerical simulations reported wave reflection coefficients of 1 12 a test case with no absorbing beach i e a solid vertical wall at the trailing end of the model correctly predicted wave reflection coefficient of 100 full reflection of the incident wave upon hitting the vertical wall the calibrated parameters for the porous beach is given in table 2 3 6 mesh independence study for simulations of wave propagation especially using the vof method spatial resolution in the wave zone i e the number of cells per wave height and the number of cells per wavelength are critical to minimize the temporal and spatial damping of wave height due to numerical diffusions and smearing of the interface mesh independence study was thus performed to derive an optimal mesh resolution orthogonal meshes with four different resolutions named fine normal coarse and very coarse see table 3 were used all numerical models have identical boundary conditions and settings numerical simulations of a stokes 3rd regular wave were carried out over 100 wave periods to obtain fully developed wave profiles the last 10 wave periods were plotted in fig 4 for analysis as shown in fig 4 the very coarse and coarse mesh models produced wave profiles with smaller wave heights compared to the normal mesh model not only smaller wave heights were produced wave phases were also shifted with normal mesh resolution the model produced a profile black solid line almost coincides with that obtained from the fine resolution model blue solid line indicating that the normal mesh resolution having 60 cells per wave height and 100 cells per wavelength was sufficient for simulations of wave propagation the normal mesh resolution was therefore adopted for all subsequent simulations in this study the almost constant levels of wave crests and troughs also indicated that wave reflections from the simulated porous beach were very small less than 5 4 results comparison and discussions 4 1 regular waves in this section the regular waves r1 and r2 in table 1 were tested the second order wave board motion theory for flap type wave maker i e eq 5 was used to compute wave board motions from the provided wave heights and frequencies similar to the experiments probes were placed at x 4 0 m and x 9 42 m to record the surface elevation for comparison data collection was started after the wave profiles had reached a steady pattern fig 5 and fig 6 plot the time history of surface elevations at x 4 0 m and x 9 42 m for regular waves r1 and r2 respectively in terms of wave periods the numerical simulation agreed well with the experiments in terms of wave heights the simulation seemed slightly over predicted the experiment at x 4 0 m however at x 9 42 m the wave heights from simulation showed a slight decay as compared with those at x 4 0 m and became closer to experimental data no significant wave reflections were observed the plotted periods were sufficiently long for reflected waves to return to the wave probe at x 9 42 m note that the experiments were conducted with active corrections for the paddle to keep the generated wave height close to the targets in the numerical simulations the second order wave board motion theory for flap type wave maker based on the target wave heights and frequencies without active correction was used this likely attributes to the discrepancies in wave heights near the paddle with paddle signal provided the flap wave maker model will generate accurate wave profiles in the wave tank which will be shown in the next section 4 2 focused waves next we tested the capability of the numerical model to simulate focused waves case f1 and case f2 table 1 the paddle s movements recorded in the experiments were directly input into the numerical model as time varying displacement boundary conditions water surface elevations at the eight horizontal locations wave probe locations in fig 1 and velocities at nine vertical locations lda locations in fig 1 in the wave tank were extracted for comparisons fig 7 and fig 8 plot the surface elevations at the eight locations while figs 9 12 plot the horizontal and vertical velocities u and w at nine lda locations at x 9 42 m the experimental data above the wave trough measured points z 0 mm appear discontinuous because lda did not measure the velocity above the instantaneous surface elevation the data from numerical model were therefore processed to exclude fictitious data points above the surface elevation figs 7 and 8 show that numerical results of surface elevations match closely to the experiments at all wave probe locations for both f1 and f2 cases both large waves and small waves in the wave groups were captured in the numerical simulations small displacements from the wave amplitude were observed on the simulated surface elevations at wave probes near the beach this was caused by the reflected waves zooming in to several waves in the wave group around the focused point wave heights measured from the focused crest to the trough in front of the simulated waves almost match to those from the experiments the wave heights of the focused waves for cases f1 and f2 measured 248 5 mm and 115 8 mm in the simulations and 245 8 mm and 114 4 mm in the experiments respectively the differences were approximately 1 the crest to swl heights η f for cases f1 and f2 were 160 8 mm and 73 6 mm in the simulations and 161 6 mm and 70 7 mm in the experiments these values were close to the designed η f of 160 mm and 72 mm the phases of simulated waves were slightly delayed as compared to those from experiments however phase shifts were less than 4 of the peak frequencies comparisons in figs 9 12 show excellent match between simulated horizontal and vertical velocities u and w with experimental data at nine lda locations at the lda locations nearest to the focused wave peaks the focused wave could reach in a very short time and the numerical model successfully captured this small period simulated focused wave profiles figs 7 and 8 and velocities figs 9 12 were in excellent agreement with experimental data validating our numerical model with physical movement of flap paddle and porous beach an interesting aspect of the present numerical model is that we fed the recorded paddle positions in the experiments as direct input into the paddle in the numerical model without fine tuning or calibration this modelling capability is extremely useful for simulating wave tanks equipped with active absorption where the paddle movements are computed on the fly and adjusted according to instantaneous wave flow conditions moreover wave flow disturbances due to imperfect wave paddled generation and beach absorption in laboratory experiments could be captured in the numerical model allowing the model to simulate imperfect experiments for troubleshooting the numerical model can thus be used to fine tune the paddle movement signals prior to laboratory experiments 5 extension to 3d wave tank with multiple paddles having demonstrated that the single paddle model could replicate 2d laboratory experiments we extended the numerical model to simulate a realistic 3d wave tank with multiple paddles covering two sides of the tank and absorbing beaches located at opposite sides each paddle is an independently movable plate with its own input the paddle strokes are computed using eqs 5 and 6 while the stroke and phase adjustments are computed based on huygen s principle frigaard et al 1993 to account for wave generation in oblique directions in the cases where inputs into the paddles in laboratory experiments are available the input signals can be fed directly into the paddles in the numerical wave tank to replicate the experiments the gaps between paddles including one at the corner of the two paddle rows are modelled explicitly in the numerical model the gaps are

this gap is represented by a multiple cell layer and is not moved fig 13 demonstrates a series of 60 long crested oblique waves generated in a numerical wave tank with 30 flap paddles color of the water surface represents surface elevation with red representing wave peaks and blue representing wave troughs besides showing the capability of the 3d wave tank to simulate oblique waves fig 13 also reveals how each paddle can be moved individually to form a serpentine pattern note the small gaps between the paddles appear transparent for illustration purpose time evolution of surface elevations along three 30 degree oblique lines l1 l2 and l3 that cross the y axis at y 4 7 and 10 m respectively were extracted from the simulation and plotted in fig 14 note that these lines are orthogonal to the wave propagation direction and parallel to the wave crests one can see that the long crested waves were fairly well generated in the basin some cross wave patterns were observed along wave crests and troughs that look like standing waves these undulations are more obvious along l1 and l2 nearer to the corner of the two paddle rows and are better mixed along l3 in this case due to constraints in computational resources the tank dimensions were relatively small and resolutions were very coarse as compared to the wave dimensions for demonstration purpose for accurate simulations and meaningful analyses of wave fields the normal resolution in table 3 should be used 6 conclusions a numerical model for wave generation by physical movement of a flap paddle and wave absorption by a
