19510,a key challenge for osmotic membrane bioreactors ombrs application is reverse solute flux and consequent salt accumulation in the feed side herein a bioelectrochemical system bes was employed to drive reverse fluxed solutes from the feed of an ombr into a cathode compartment for recovery and subsequent reuse as a draw solute ds compared to an ombr without bes function the present ombr system enhanced water recovery from 925 to 1688 ml and increased the chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency from 40 2 8 1 to 75 2 3 3 benefited from its lower anolyte conductivity of 9 0 ms cm 1 than that of the control system 24 1 ms cm 1 the co2 addition significantly improved the ammonia recovery rate to 93 3 116 7 g n m 3 h 1 or 248 0 307 4 g n m 2 d 1 12 1 14 5 times higher than that without co2 addition the recovered ds was successfully applied to accomplish water extraction in the reuse test and such a recovery reuse process could result in a normalized water recovery of 3870 ml mol ds 1 or a ds usage of 0 26 mol l 1 of the recovered water the energy consumption of the system might be compensated by the production of bioenergy and the net specific energy consumption was estimated to be 0 004 0 112 kwh m 3 wastewater 0 007 0 179 kwh kg 1 removed cod or 0 001 0 020 kwh kg 1 recovered nh4 n those results have demonstrated that bioelectrochemical processes can be an effective approach for in situ mitigation of reverse fluxed solute in ombr and recovering the lost ds towards both reuse and reduced operational expense graphical abstract image 1 keywords osmotic membrane bioreactor bioelectrochemical system reverse solute flux resource recovery wastewater 1 introduction osmotic membrane bioreactor ombr is an innovative membrane based treatment technology and can extract high quality water from wastewater via forward osmosis fo achilli et al 2009 holloway et al 2015a in the presence of biological reactions ombrs can achieve simultaneous biodegradation and water extraction and offer several potential advantages over conventional membrane bioreactors mbrs such as high rejection rates for a wide range of contaminants low fouling propensity and low energy consumption cornelissen et al 2011 lay et al 2011 in the past few years ombrs have been advanced in laboratory research for a variety of functions such as simultaneous nutrient or mineral recovery indirect or direct potable reuse applications biodegradation of toxic organic compounds and trace organic chemical removal from wastewater praveen et al 2015 qiu and ting 2014 a pilot scale hybrid ultrafiltration uf ombr was developed and studied for a long term operation to produce reclaimed water for beneficial reuse and nutrient rich uf permeate stream holloway et al 2015b when ombrs are operated under an anaerobic condition anaerobic osmotic membrane bioreactors anombrs are created with energy recovery as biogas wang et al 2016 like any fo based treatment systems salt accumulation occurs in the feed side e g the bioreactor of an ombr due to both a concentrating effect and reverse solute flux rsf from the draw solution and this increased salt concentration can adversely affect the efficiency of membrane separation and biodegradation performance qiu and ting 2013 xiao et al 2011 to alleviate this salt accumulation new draw solutes and modified fo membrane have been developed and investigated yap et al 2012 several methods have been incorporated into ombr operation to reduce salt accumulation the most common approach is to discharge the feed solution periodically e g daily wang et al 2014a but this will cause the loss of biomass and thus affect biological treatment to retain biomass membrane filtration such as uf or microfiltration mf is applied to remove liquid that contains the accumulated salts holloway et al 2015b wang et al 2014b however those pressure driven membrane separation processes do not address the loss of draw solutes due to rsf that is the reverse fluxed draw solutes are not recovered for reuse and the separation also requires much energy input herein we proposed to employ a bioelectrochemical system bes to reduce salt accumulation in the feed side of an ombr and achieve recovery of reverse fluxed solutes for possible reuse a bes is using electrochemically active bacteria in an anode to oxidize organic matter for production of electrons that then reduce a terminal electron acceptor in a cathode for electricity generation logan et al 2006 electron movement also drives ion movement between the anode and the cathode bes has been synergistically linked to fo to achieve recovery of energy water and nutrient qin and he 2017 it was demonstrated that current generation was enhanced in a microbial fuel cell mfc coupled with the ombr pretreatment due to the increased solution conductivity and buffer capacity hou et al 2016 an ombr was connected to a microbial electrolysis cell mec for the reduction of membrane fouling under an electric field zhang et al 2017 in an mec fo system the mec recovered ammonium from a high strength synthetic wastewater was applied as the draw solute in the form of nh4hco3 in the following fo unit that extracted water from the mec effluent qin and he 2014 thus far bes has not been investigated to address the reverse fluxed solutes in an fo based treatment system in this study the feed side of an ombr was converted to an anode of a bes where both anaerobic and bioelectrochemical degradation of organic matter would occur the produced electricity could drive salt including reverse fluxed solutes from the feed into a cathode compartment which was separated from the anode feed with cation exchange membrane fig 1 in this way the salinity of the feed solution was maintained relatively low and the additional salts that migrated from the draw solution into the feed solution would be recovered in the cathode in addition the ombr could concentrate the organic matter in the feed solution and enhance the electricity production that would further promote salt movement because of the need for aeration in the cathode this system was regarded as an indirectly aerobic treatment unit the specific objectives of this study were to 1 demonstrate the mitigation of salt accumulation in the feed solution in the proposed bes assisted ombr system 2 examine the recovery and reuse of an ammonium based draw solute and 3 evaluate the energy consumption of this hybrid system 2 materials and methods 2 1 system setup the bes assisted ombr system consisted of three equal size compartments a liquid volume of 50 ml each draw side feed side anode and cathode fig 1 the draw and feed anode compartments were physically separated by a piece of thin film composite membranes tfc fo membrane aquaporin a s denmark with a total osmosis area of 0 0026 m2 the active side of fo membrane faced the feed solution while the support side faced the draw solution the feed anode and cathode compartments were separated by a piece of cation exchange membrane cem membrane international inc ringwood nj usa with a surface area of 0 0026 m2 non wet proofed carbon brushes were submerged in the feed anode compartment functioning as both the anode electrode and media for biofilm formation which could alleviate fouling on the fo membrane and wet proofed carbon cloth 13 cm 20 cm zoltek corporation st louis mo usa containing 4 mg cm 2 activated carbon powder thermo fisher scientific bridgewater nj usa as a catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction was used as the cathode electrode the pretreatment of both anode or cathode electrodes followed the procedure in a prior work yang et al 2017 oxygen was provided to the cathode compartment by an air pump and a gas diffuser to reduce the purification step and to obtain the highly purified nh4hco3 ds we used the di water as the catholyte in the system 2 2 system operation the bes ombr system was operated at room temperature 20 1 c with an external resistance of 10 ω between the anode and the cathode for relatively high current generation the composition of the synthetic feed wastewater included 1000 24 mg l 1 sodium acetate 800 13

compartment was inoculated with 6 ml sludge from the anaerobic digester 3000 mg l 1 of mixed liquid suspended solids and the vss ss ratio of 68 8 of a local wastewater treatment plant pepper s ferry regional wastewater treatment authority radford va usa and operated with a flow rate of 0 15 ml min 1 or hydraulic retention time of 5 6 h throughout the experiment the cathode compartment was aerated with the air at a flow rate of 10 ml min 1 both the catholyte and the anolyte were recirculated at 5 ml min 1 a 100 ml flask placed on a digital balance was used to monitor the water moved through the fo membrane into the draw compartment the cathode of the bes was operated in a batch mode for two stages in the first stage two different draw solutes nacl and nh4hco3 were studied in the draw side of the ombr under the open and close circuit conditions respectively while the cathode was investigated for the accumulation of draw solutes migrated from the anode and in the second stage carbon dioxide addition was applied in the cathode and nh4hco3 was used as a draw solute in the draw side of the ombr with different concentrations carbon dioxide was supplied at a flow rate of 5 ml min 1 to decrease the catholyte ph for retaining ammonium in the solution that could be recovered and reused when the recovered ammonium reached 80 of the initial draw solution concentration this catholyte was then transferred to the draw compartment and used as a draw solution 2 3 analysis and calculation the voltage was recorded by a digital multimeter 2700 keithley instruments inc cleveland oh usa every

potentially energy efficient recovery mccutcheon et al 2005 it is important to compare it with a commonly used ds nacl in the present system our results have demonstrated the additional benefits of nh4hco3 in terms of water recovery organic removal and current generation in the proposed system fig 2 at the same concentration of 2 m both dss exhibited the similar initial water flux of 14 1 15 0 lmh which then decreased during 48 h operation and the final water flux of the 2 m nacl ds was 2 9 lmh only half of that of the 2 m nh4hco3 ds fig 2a as a result the 2 m nh4hco3 ds led to more water recovery in a batch 1688 ml than that of the 2 m nacl ds 978 ml the cod removal with 2 m nh4hco3 as ds was 75 2 3 3 higher than 70 2 2 4 with the 2 m nacl ds p 0 05 one tailed two sample t test with unequal variance at α 0 05 for all the following statistical tests likewise the current density of 383 21 a m 3 with the 2 m nh4hco3 ds was much higher than 199 20 a m 3 with the 2 m nacl ds p 0 05 fig 2b the difference in cod removal and current generation was likely related to the anolyte ph which could affect both biological and bioelectrochemical activities in the anode or the feed of the system the system had similar catholyte ph between the two dss fig 2c but very different anolyte ph 7 2 0 2 with the 2 m nh4hco3 ds and 5 6 0 1 with the 2 m nacl ds p 0 05 fig 2d this was due to the buffer effect of reverse fluxed hco3 according to the nernst equation using acetate as an electron donor e e 0 ln c h 3 c o o h h 8 p c o 2 2 the anodic potential increases with the decreasing proton concentration and thus a higher anolyte ph could improve the voltage and lead to higher current generation therefore nh4hco3 could be a potentially advantageous ds for the proposed system in terms of both fo performance water flux and bes performance electricity generation because of rsf and a concentrating effect the salinity of the anolyte or the feed would increase the negatively charged surface of tfc membrane that is abundant in carboxyl groups encourages movement of more cations ammonium ions than anions bicarbonate ions from the draw into the feed anode due to the donnan dialysis the diffusion of cations in the feed solution into the draw occurs to balance the charge lu et al 2014 this is supported by our detection of multiple cations i e mg2 ca2 na and k in the draw solution and the effect of such cation accumulation in the draw solution warrants further investigation because of electricity generation the cations including reverse fluxed ds in the anode or the feed could move across cem into the cathode thereby alleviating the salinity in the anolyte or the feed this was investigated by comparing the system performance with the 2 m nh4hco3 ds under the open no electricity generation a conventional ombr and the closed circuit with electricity generation fig 3 water flux exhibited different behaviors between the two conditions it decreased from 14 0 to 0 7 lmh in the open circuit system and from 15 0 to 5 5 lmh in the closed circuit system resulting in significantly different water recovery 935 ml in the open circuit vs 1688 ml in the closed circuit this indicated the beneficial effect of current generation on water recovery fig 3a such an effect was further supported by a much lower anolyte conductivity of 9 0 ms cm 1 in the closed circuit system than 24 1 ms cm 1 in the open circuit system demonstrating that bioelectrochemically assisted mitigation of salinity buildup occurred in the closed circuit system fig 3b in addition to enhancing water flux this salinity mitigation also benefited the cod removal which increased from 40 2 8 1 of the open circuit system to 75 2 3 3 of the closed circuit system fig 3c p 0 05 the previous studies found that when the salinity increased to 13 6 20 0 ms cm 1 in the feed solution the biodegradation of organic compounds would be inhibited in ombrs qiu and ting 2013 song et al 2016 our data show the effectiveness of using bioelectricity to control the reverse fluxed salts and successful alleviation of the feed salinity for improved water flux and organic removal 3 2 enhancing ammonia recovery with co2 addition to further understand the system performance with nh4hco3 ds we investigated the effects of ds concentration and recovery of ds aided by co2 addition three ds concentrations 0 5 1 and 2 m were studied in the absence of co2 addition the current density was less affected by the ds concentration p 0 05 fig 4 a while the water flux increased with increasing the ds concentration due to a larger osmotic pressure difference p 0 05 fig 4b a higher ds concentration also promoted rsf resulting in more ammonium in the anolyte or the feed p 0 05 however the ammonium concentration in the catholyte after the 48 h operation was rather similar at 26 27 mm among three ds concentrations p 0 05 fig s1 the similar catholyte ammonium concentrations were likely due to the stripping effect of aeration that removed a portion of ammonium to the gas phase as ammonia and resulted in similar liquid ammonium concentration consequently the system had similar ammonia recovery rates of 7 8 8 8 g n m 3 h 1 or 19 2 20 9 g n m 2 d 1 vs membrane surface area among three ds concentrations p 0 05 fig 4c the recovered ammonia accounted for 1 4 5 3 of total ammonia that was added to the system as ds and the ammonium residue in the anolyte was 20 8 23 4 p 0 05 fig 4d and e assuming every electron would drive one ammonium ion to move from the anolyte or the feed into the catholyte for charge balance and the transport of ammonium ion could contribute to 100 of salt movement ignoring diffusion movement the ammonium concentration in the catholyte was estimated to be 4 2 4 4 of the migrated ammonium indicating that most ammonium that moved from the anolyte or the feed into the catholyte was lost to the gas phase according to the ammonium mass balance this ammonium loss to the gas phase in the cathode compartment could be about 17 9 46 1 of total ammonia as input via draw solution depending on the ds concentration p 0 05 fig 4f this result has two implications first the high catholyte ph 9 5 9 9 and oxygen aeration might have accelerated loss of ammonia gas out of the cathode compartment and second the amount of migrated ammonium from the anolyte or the feed to the catholyte 27 7 51 3 of total ammonia or 0 26 0 38 m ammonia was affected by the current generation ds recovery in the present study was through retaining ammonium in the catholyte which was then directly reused as a draw solution this is different from prior studies that separated ammonia from the liquid into a gas phase for later adsorption by acid using either gas stripping or passive separation with a special reactor design qin et al 2017 2018 to retain ammonium in the catholyte the catholyte ph should be kept low so that nitrogen would be in the form of ammonium instead of ammonia to achieve this we employed co2 addition to improve ammonia recovery clearly the addition of co2 decreased the catholyte ph from 9 7 0 1 to 7 3 0 1 fig s2a but did not significantly affect the anolyte ph fig s2b this decreased catholyte ph improved current generation for all three ds concentrations due to the reduced potential loss and more supply of protons to the cathodic reduction reaction fig 4a the water flux was less affected by the co2 addition fig 4b p 0 05 the ammonia recovery rate with co2 addition was 100 0 125 0 g n m 3 h 1 or 265 8 329 3 g n m 2 d 1 vs membrane surface area which was 12 1 14 5 times higher than that without co2 addition fig 4c this ammonia recovery rate was much higher than that via volatilization acid absorption 3 3 7 1 g n m 2 d 1 kuntke et al 2012 qin et al 2017 or a submersible microbial desalination cell smdc 80 g n m 2 d 1 zhang and angelidaki 2015 assuming that the gas liquid system had reached equilibrium ammonia in the gas phase was estimated to be less than 0 1 of the aqueous ammonia according to henry s law because of the improved ammonia recovery the ammonium residue in the anolyte was 9 7 19 7 and the ammonium loss to the gas phase in the cathode was 1 8 3 9 of the total ammonium input fig 4e and f both of which were significantly lower than those without co2 addition meanwhile the recovered ammonium in the catholyte was 21 2 68 6 of the total ammonium input as ds 3 3 draw solute recovery and reuse next we investigated the reuse of the recovered ds for further water extraction in four cycles of operation a cycle of operation was concluded when the ratio of the ammonium concentration in the catholyte reached 80 of the initial draw solution concentration to achieve this ratio the operation time for each cycle varied and was affected by the ds concentration fig 5 a the operation time of a cycle with the 0 5 m nh4hco3 ds was 61 1 h must shorter than that with the 1 m nh4hco3 110 1 h or the 2 m nh4hco3 ds 191 2 h the results showed that the recovered ds could achieve similar water flux as that of fresh ds fig 5a in each cycle the ammonium concentration in the anolyte increased firstly due to rsf and then decreased because of current drive ammonium movement fig s3 the ammonium residue in the anolyte or the feed solution accounted for 5 2 10 8 of the total ammonium and 78 8 89 1 of total ammonium in the catholyte was recovered resulting in a requirement of 10 9 21 2 of the ds to be added additionally for the following operation more details of the system performance using the recovered ds can be found in fig 5b and s4 slight decrease in the system performance with the recovered ds though not significantly was summarized in fig 5c in which cod removal efficiency decreased by 2 1 6 4 ammonia recovery rate decrease was below 0 7 the amount of recovered water decreased by 2 0 2 7 and current generation dropped by 4 8 5 9 extending the reuse for a longer period might expect more significant decrease in performance likely related to continuing increase in the ammonium concentration in the anolyte fig s3 that could affect microbial activities in the anode or the feed kim and logan 2013 it should be noted that the present recovery of reverse fluxed ds is different from ds regeneration that is to regenerate the diluted ds from the draw compartment as shown in table 1 few ombr studies have dealt with reverse fluxed ds several employed filtration methods to remove reverse fluxed ds but did not have recovery and reuse our system is one of very few that actually recovered the reverse fluxed ds for reuse resulting in a low ds usage or a high water recovery rate per unit mass of ds if we exclude ds regeneration from estimate of ds usage because regeneration efficiency highly varies and some ds do not need regeneration to produce 1 l of water our system would consume 0 26 mol of ds much lower than those reported in other ombr studies table 1 we can also make comparison for water production per unit mass of ds and in this way our system could achieve 3870 ml mol ds 1 much higher than the other ombr systems 125 2995 ml mol ds 1 treating a wastewater with the similar cod concentrations table 1 therefore the recovery of the lost ds could greatly reduce the demand of new ds with potential benefit of decreasing operational expense 3 4 evaluation of energy consumption in addition to the performance of cod removal water recovery and ds recovery energy consumption of the present system was critically important and thus analyzed with several parameters a bench scale system cannot be fully evaluated for energy consumption thus we have performed a preliminary analysis of energy consumption and production of this system for the purpose of demonstration the values of energy consumption are shown negatively in fig 6 the energy consumption of the system included energy requirement for pump recirculation oxygen aeration and co2 addition fig 6 a oxygen aeration had a maximum energy consumption of 0 897 2 841 kj accounting for up to 90 8 of total energy input in the system while the pumping system required 0 5 of total energy input or 0 005 0 016 kj and co2 addition needed 8 7 of total energy or 0 086 0 272 kj the bioelectrochemical part of the system produced electricity which was 0 770 3 103 kj as a result this system would have a net energy demand of 0 003 0 132 kj the higher next energy demand per cycle with a higher ds concentration was due to a longer operation time in a cycle we further analyzed energy by using sec normalized by unit removed cod unit recovered nh4 n and unit treated water fig 6b the hybrid system consumed 0 007 0 179 kwh kg 1 removed cod 0 001 0 020 kwh kg 1 recovered nh4 n or 0 004 0 112 kwh m 3 treated wastewater a higher nh4hco3 ds concentration tended to have a lower sec likely related to higher water recovery efficiency the specific energy demand of the present hybrid system was much lower than that of conventional ombrs without ds recovery or regeneration approximately 0 4 2 0 kwh m 3 holloway et al 2015a when the ds regeneration was included in the ombr system the overall energy demand would be much higher for example the electrical energy demand for nh4hco3 ds regeneration by the distillation system was 1 6 3 02 kwh m 3 mcginnis and elimelech 2007 alternatively if a non regeneration ds such as fertilizer is used then energy consumption could be maintained low only one prior study reported energy consumption for recovering the reverse fluxed ds by ed lu and he 2015 which had a much higher energy requirement 1 88 4 01 kwh m 3 treated wastewater than that of the present system this is because of potential offset of energy consumption by the simultaneous recovery of bioenergy in the bioelectrochemical part of the hybrid system while the ed in the previous study was a net energy consumer in general the energy demand by the present system could be very low considering that the recovery of the lost ds has been included in the energy estimate 4 conclusions this study has demonstrated the feasibility of in situ mitigation of salt buildup and recovery of waste salts for reuse as draw solute in a bioelectrochemically assisted osmotic membrane bioreactor the effects of operation mode and draw solute concentration were systematically examined and optimized the results have important implications to development of an effective strategy for controlling reverse solute flux in ombrs with the following conclusions the hybrid system achieved a water recovery of 1688 ml and a cod removal efficiency of 75 2 3 3 with 2 m nh4hco3 as a ds and the bioelectrochemical process led to 80 improvement of water recovery compared to that of an open circuit system due to rsf alleviation in the anolyte or the feed the co2 addition increased the ammonia recovery rate to 93 3 116 7 g n m 3 h 1 which was 12 1 14 5 times higher than that without co2 addition as a result the ammonium residue in the anolyte and the ammonium loss to the gas phase in the cathode significantly decreased the recovered ds was successfully applied to accomplish water extraction in the reuse test and such a recovery reuse process could result in a normalized water recovery of 3870 ml mol ds 1 or a ds usage of 0 26 mol l 1 per liter of recovered water the produced bioenergy by the bioelectrochemical part of the sysmte might offset some energy demand the net energy consumption by the hybrid system was estimated to 0 004 0 112 kwh m 3 treated wastewater 0 007 0 179 kwh kg 1 cod or 0 001 0 020 kwh kg 1 recovered nh4 n acknowledgments this work was partially supported by the institute for critical technology and applied science ctas at virginia tech dr yuli yang was supported by fundamental

co2 addition the recovered ds was successfully applied to accomplish water extraction in the reuse test and such a recovery reuse process could result in a normalized water recovery of 3870 ml mol ds

contains the accumulated salts holloway et al 2015b wang et al 2014b however those pressure driven membrane separation processes do not address the loss of draw solutes due to rsf that is the reverse fluxed draw solutes are not recovered for reuse and the separation also requires much energy input herein we proposed to employ a bioelectrochemical system bes to reduce salt accumulation in the feed side of an ombr and achieve recovery of reverse fluxed solutes for possible reuse a bes is using electrochemically active bacteria in an anode to oxidize organic matter for production of electrons that then reduce a terminal electron acceptor in a cathode for electricity generation logan et al 2006 electron movement also drives ion movement between the anode and the cathode bes has been synergistically linked to fo to achieve recovery of energy water and nutrient qin and he 2017 it was demonstrated that current generation was enhanced in a microbial fuel cell mfc coupled with the ombr pretreatment due to the increased solution conductivity and buffer capacity hou et al 2016 an ombr was connected to a microbial electrolysis cell mec for the reduction of membrane fouling under an electric field zhang et al 2017 in an mec fo system the mec recovered ammonium from a high strength synthetic wastewater was applied as the draw solute in the form of nh4hco3 in the following fo unit that extracted water from the mec effluent qin and he 2014 thus far bes has not been investigated to address the reverse fluxed solutes in an fo based treatment system in this study the feed side of an ombr was converted to an anode of a bes where both anaerobic and bioelectrochemical degradation of organic matter would occur the produced electricity could drive salt including reverse fluxed solutes from the feed into a cathode compartment which was separated from the anode feed with cation exchange membrane fig 1 in this way the salinity of the feed solution was maintained relatively low and the additional salts that migrated from the draw solution into the feed solution would be recovered in the cathode in addition the ombr could concentrate the organic matter in the feed solution and enhance the electricity production that would further promote salt movement because of the need for aeration in the cathode this system was regarded as an indirectly aerobic treatment unit the specific objectives of this study were to 1 demonstrate the mitigation of salt accumulation in the feed solution in the proposed bes assisted ombr system 2 examine the recovery and reuse of an ammonium based draw solute and 3 evaluate the energy consumption of this hybrid system 2 materials and methods 2 1 system setup the bes assisted ombr system consisted of three equal size compartments a liquid volume of 50 ml each draw side feed side anode and cathode fig 1 the draw and feed anode compartments were physically separated by a piece of thin film composite membranes tfc fo membrane aquaporin a s denmark with a total osmosis area of 0 0026 m2 the active side of fo membrane faced the feed solution while the support side faced the draw solution the feed anode and cathode compartments were separated by a piece of cation exchange membrane cem membrane international inc ringwood nj usa with a surface area of 0 0026 m2 non wet proofed carbon brushes were submerged in the feed anode compartment functioning as both the anode electrode and media for biofilm formation which could alleviate fouling on the fo membrane and wet proofed carbon cloth 13 cm 20 cm zoltek corporation st louis mo usa containing 4 mg cm 2 activated carbon powder thermo fisher scientific bridgewater nj usa as a catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction was used as the cathode electrode the pretreatment of both anode or cathode electrodes followed the procedure in a prior work yang et al 2017 oxygen was provided to the cathode compartment by an air pump and a gas diffuser to reduce the purification step and to obtain the highly purified nh4hco3 ds we used the di water as the catholyte in the system 2 2 system operation the bes ombr system was operated at room temperature 20 1 c with an external resistance of 10 ω between the anode and the cathode for relatively high current generation the composition of the synthetic feed wastewater included 1000 24 mg l 1 sodium acetate 800 13

compartment was inoculated with 6 ml sludge from the anaerobic digester 3000 mg l 1 of mixed liquid suspended solids and the vss ss ratio of 68 8 of a local wastewater treatment plant pepper s ferry regional wastewater treatment authority radford va usa and operated with a flow rate of 0 15 ml min 1 or hydraulic retention time of 5 6 h throughout the experiment the cathode compartment was aerated with the air at a flow rate of 10 ml min 1 both the catholyte and the anolyte were recirculated at 5 ml min 1 a 100 ml flask placed on a digital balance was used to monitor the water moved through the fo membrane into the draw compartment the cathode of the bes was operated in a batch mode for two stages in the first stage two different draw solutes nacl and nh4hco3 were studied in the draw side of the ombr under the open and close circuit conditions respectively while the cathode was investigated for the accumulation of draw solutes migrated from the anode and in the second stage carbon dioxide addition was applied in the cathode and nh4hco3 was used as a draw solute in the draw side of the ombr with different concentrations carbon dioxide was supplied at a flow rate of 5 ml min 1 to decrease the catholyte ph for retaining ammonium in the solution that could be recovered and reused when the recovered ammonium reached 80 of the initial draw solution concentration this catholyte was then transferred to the draw compartment and used as a draw solution 2 3 analysis and calculation the voltage was recorded by a digital multimeter 2700 keithley instruments inc cleveland oh usa every

potentially energy efficient recovery mccutcheon et al 2005 it is important to compare it with a commonly used ds nacl in the present system our results have demonstrated the additional benefits of nh4hco3 in terms of water recovery organic removal and current generation in the proposed system fig 2 at the same concentration of 2 m both dss exhibited the similar initial water flux of 14 1 15 0 lmh which then decreased during 48 h operation and the final water flux of the 2 m nacl ds was 2 9 lmh only half of that of the 2 m nh4hco3 ds fig 2a as a result the 2 m nh4hco3 ds led to more water recovery in a batch 1688 ml than that of the 2 m nacl ds 978 ml the cod removal with 2 m nh4hco3 as ds was 75 2 3 3 higher than 70 2 2 4 with the 2 m nacl ds p 0 05 one tailed two sample t test with unequal variance at α 0 05 for all the following statistical tests likewise the current density of 383 21 a m 3 with the 2 m nh4hco3 ds was much higher than 199 20 a m 3 with the 2 m nacl ds p 0 05 fig 2b the difference in cod removal and current generation was likely related to the anolyte ph which could affect both biological and bioelectrochemical activities in the anode or the feed of the system the system had similar catholyte ph between the two dss fig 2c but very different anolyte ph 7 2 0 2 with the 2 m nh4hco3 ds and 5 6 0 1 with the 2 m nacl ds p 0 05 fig 2d this was due to the buffer effect of reverse fluxed hco3 according to the nernst equation using acetate as an electron donor e e 0 ln c h 3 c o o h h 8 p c o 2 2 the anodic potential increases with the decreasing proton concentration and thus a higher anolyte ph could improve the voltage and lead to higher current generation therefore nh4hco3 could be a potentially advantageous ds for the proposed system in terms of both fo performance water flux and bes performance electricity generation because of rsf and a concentrating effect the salinity of the anolyte or the feed would increase the negatively charged surface of tfc membrane that is abundant in carboxyl groups encourages movement of more cations ammonium ions than anions bicarbonate ions from the draw into the feed anode due to the donnan dialysis the diffusion of cations in the feed solution into the draw occurs to balance the charge lu et al 2014 this is supported by our detection of multiple cations i e mg2 ca2 na and k in the draw solution and the effect of such cation accumulation in the draw solution warrants further investigation because of electricity generation the cations including reverse fluxed ds in the anode or the feed could move across cem into the cathode thereby alleviating the salinity in the anolyte or the feed this was investigated by comparing the system performance with the 2 m nh4hco3 ds under the open no electricity generation a conventional ombr and the closed circuit with electricity generation fig 3 water flux exhibited different behaviors between the two conditions it decreased from 14 0 to 0 7 lmh in the open circuit system and from 15 0 to 5 5 lmh in the closed circuit system resulting in significantly different water recovery 935 ml in the open circuit vs 1688 ml in the closed circuit this indicated the beneficial effect of current generation on water recovery fig 3a such an effect was further supported by a much lower anolyte conductivity of 9 0 ms cm 1 in the closed circuit system than 24 1 ms cm 1 in the open circuit system demonstrating that bioelectrochemically assisted mitigation of salinity buildup occurred in the closed circuit system fig 3b in addition to enhancing water flux this salinity mitigation also benefited the cod removal which increased from 40 2 8 1 of the open circuit system to 75 2 3 3 of the closed circuit system fig 3c p 0 05 the previous studies found that when the salinity increased to 13 6 20 0 ms cm 1 in the feed solution the biodegradation of organic compounds would be inhibited in ombrs qiu and ting 2013 song et al 2016 our data show the effectiveness of using bioelectricity to control the reverse fluxed salts and successful alleviation of the feed salinity for improved water flux and organic removal 3 2 enhancing ammonia recovery with co2 addition to further understand the system performance with nh4hco3 ds we investigated the effects of ds concentration and recovery of ds aided by co2 addition three ds concentrations 0 5 1 and 2 m were studied in the absence of co2 addition the current density was less affected by the ds concentration p 0 05 fig 4 a while the water flux increased with increasing the ds concentration due to a larger osmotic pressure difference p 0 05 fig 4b a higher ds concentration also promoted rsf resulting in more ammonium in the anolyte or the feed p 0 05 however the ammonium concentration in the catholyte after the 48 h operation was rather similar at 26 27 mm among three ds concentrations p 0 05 fig s1 the similar catholyte ammonium concentrations were likely due to the stripping effect of aeration that removed a portion of ammonium to the gas phase as ammonia and resulted in similar liquid ammonium concentration consequently the system had similar ammonia recovery rates of 7 8 8 8 g n m 3 h 1 or 19 2 20 9 g n m 2 d 1 vs membrane surface area among three ds concentrations p 0 05 fig 4c the recovered ammonia accounted for 1 4 5 3 of total ammonia that was added to the system as ds and the ammonium residue in the anolyte was 20 8 23 4 p 0 05 fig 4d and e assuming every electron would drive one ammonium ion to move from the anolyte or the feed into the catholyte for charge balance and the transport of ammonium ion could contribute to 100 of salt movement ignoring diffusion movement the ammonium concentration in the catholyte was estimated to be 4 2 4 4 of the migrated ammonium indicating that most ammonium that moved from the anolyte or the feed into the catholyte was lost to the gas phase according to the ammonium mass balance this ammonium loss to the gas phase in the cathode compartment could be about 17 9 46 1 of total ammonia as input via draw solution depending on the ds concentration p 0 05 fig 4f this result has two implications first the high catholyte ph 9 5 9 9 and oxygen aeration might have accelerated loss of ammonia gas out of the cathode compartment and second the amount of migrated ammonium from the anolyte or the feed to the catholyte 27 7 51 3 of total ammonia or 0 26 0 38 m ammonia was affected by the current generation ds recovery in the present study was through retaining ammonium in the catholyte which was then directly reused as a draw solution this is different from prior studies that separated ammonia from the liquid into a gas phase for later adsorption by acid using either gas stripping or passive separation with a special reactor design qin et al 2017 2018 to retain ammonium in the catholyte the catholyte ph should be kept low so that nitrogen would be in the form of ammonium instead of ammonia to achieve this we employed co2 addition to improve ammonia recovery clearly the addition of co2 decreased the catholyte ph from 9 7 0 1 to 7 3 0 1 fig s2a but did not significantly affect the anolyte ph fig s2b this decreased catholyte ph improved current generation for all three ds concentrations due to the reduced potential loss and more supply of protons to the cathodic reduction reaction fig 4a the water flux was less affected by the co2 addition fig 4b p 0 05 the ammonia recovery rate with co2 addition was 100 0 125 0 g n m 3 h 1 or 265 8 329 3 g n m 2 d 1 vs membrane surface area which was 12 1 14 5 times higher than that without co2 addition fig 4c this ammonia recovery rate was much higher than that via volatilization acid absorption 3 3 7 1 g n m 2 d 1 kuntke et al 2012 qin et al 2017 or a submersible microbial desalination cell smdc 80 g n m 2 d 1 zhang and angelidaki 2015 assuming that the gas liquid system had reached equilibrium ammonia in the gas phase was estimated to be less than 0 1 of the aqueous ammonia according to henry s law because of the improved ammonia recovery the ammonium residue in the anolyte was 9 7 19 7 and the ammonium loss to the gas phase in the cathode was 1 8 3 9 of the total ammonium input fig 4e and f both of which were significantly lower than those without co2 addition meanwhile the recovered ammonium in the catholyte was 21 2 68 6 of the total ammonium input as ds 3 3 draw solute recovery and reuse next we investigated the reuse of the recovered ds for further water extraction in four cycles of operation a cycle of operation was concluded when the ratio of the ammonium concentration in the catholyte reached 80 of the initial draw solution concentration to achieve this ratio the operation time for each cycle varied and was affected by the ds concentration fig 5 a the operation time of a cycle with the 0 5 m nh4hco3 ds was 61 1 h must shorter than that with the 1 m nh4hco3 110 1 h or the 2 m nh4hco3 ds 191 2 h the results showed that the recovered ds could achieve similar water flux as that of fresh ds fig 5a in each cycle the ammonium concentration in the anolyte increased firstly due to rsf and then decreased because of current drive ammonium movement fig s3 the ammonium residue in the anolyte or the feed solution accounted for 5 2 10 8 of the total ammonium and 78 8 89 1 of total ammonium in the catholyte was recovered resulting in a requirement of 10 9 21 2 of the ds to be added additionally for the following operation more details of the system performance using the recovered ds can be found in fig 5b and s4 slight decrease in the system performance with the recovered ds though not significantly was summarized in fig 5c in which cod removal efficiency decreased by 2 1 6 4 ammonia recovery rate decrease was below 0 7 the amount of recovered water decreased by 2 0 2 7 and current generation dropped by 4 8 5 9 extending the reuse for a longer period might expect more significant decrease in performance likely related to continuing increase in the ammonium concentration in the anolyte fig s3 that could affect microbial activities in the anode or the feed kim and logan 2013 it should be noted that the present recovery of reverse fluxed ds is different from ds regeneration that is to regenerate the diluted ds from the draw compartment as shown in table 1 few ombr studies have dealt with reverse fluxed ds several employed filtration methods to remove reverse fluxed ds but did not have recovery and reuse our system is one of very few that actually recovered the reverse fluxed ds for reuse resulting in a low ds usage or a high water recovery rate per unit mass of ds if we exclude ds regeneration from estimate of ds usage because regeneration efficiency highly varies and some ds do not need regeneration to produce 1 l of water our system would consume 0 26 mol of ds much lower than those reported in other ombr studies table 1 we can also make comparison for water production per unit mass of ds and in this way our system could achieve 3870 ml mol ds 1 much higher than the other ombr systems 125 2995 ml mol ds 1 treating a wastewater with the similar cod concentrations table 1 therefore the recovery of the lost ds could greatly reduce the demand of new ds with potential benefit of decreasing operational expense 3 4 evaluation of energy consumption in addition to the performance of cod removal water recovery and ds recovery energy consumption of the present system was critically important and thus analyzed with several parameters a bench scale system cannot be fully evaluated for energy consumption thus we have performed a preliminary analysis of energy consumption and production of this system for the purpose of demonstration the values of energy consumption are shown negatively in fig 6 the energy consumption of the system included energy requirement for pump recirculation oxygen aeration and co2 addition fig 6 a oxygen aeration had a maximum energy consumption of 0 897 2 841 kj accounting for up to 90 8 of total energy input in the system while the pumping system required 0 5 of total energy input or 0 005 0 016 kj and co2 addition needed 8 7 of total energy or 0 086 0 272 kj the bioelectrochemical part of the system produced electricity which was 0 770 3 103 kj as a result this system would have a net energy demand of 0 003 0 132 kj the higher next energy demand per cycle with a higher ds concentration was due to a longer operation time in a cycle we further analyzed energy by using sec normalized by unit removed cod unit recovered nh4 n and unit treated water fig 6b the hybrid system consumed 0 007 0 179 kwh kg 1 removed cod 0 001 0 020 kwh kg 1 recovered nh4 n or 0 004 0 112 kwh m 3 treated wastewater a higher nh4hco3 ds concentration tended to have a lower sec likely related to higher water recovery efficiency the specific energy demand of the present hybrid system was much lower than that of conventional ombrs without ds recovery or regeneration approximately 0 4 2 0 kwh m 3 holloway et al 2015a when the ds regeneration was included in the ombr system the overall energy demand would be much higher for example the electrical energy demand for nh4hco3 ds regeneration by the distillation system was 1 6 3 02 kwh m 3 mcginnis and elimelech 2007 alternatively if a non regeneration ds such as fertilizer is used then energy consumption could be maintained low only one prior study reported energy consumption for recovering the reverse fluxed ds by ed lu and he 2015 which had a much higher energy requirement 1 88 4 01 kwh m 3 treated wastewater than that of the present system this is because of potential offset of energy consumption by the simultaneous recovery of bioenergy in the bioelectrochemical part of the hybrid system while the ed in the previous study was a net energy consumer in general the energy demand by the present system could be very low considering that the recovery of the lost ds has been included in the energy estimate 4 conclusions this study has demonstrated the feasibility of in situ mitigation of salt buildup and recovery of waste salts for reuse as draw solute in a bioelectrochemically assisted osmotic membrane bioreactor the effects of operation mode and draw solute concentration were systematically examined and optimized the results have important implications to development of an effective strategy for controlling reverse solute flux in ombrs with the following conclusions the hybrid system achieved a water recovery of 1688 ml and a cod removal efficiency of 75 2 3 3 with 2 m nh4hco3 as a ds and the bioelectrochemical process led to 80 improvement of water recovery compared to that of an open circuit system due to rsf alleviation in the anolyte or the feed the co2 addition increased the ammonia recovery rate to 93 3 116 7 g n m 3 h 1 which was 12 1 14 5 times higher than that without co2 addition as a result the ammonium residue in the anolyte and the ammonium loss to the gas phase in the cathode significantly decreased the recovered ds was successfully applied to accomplish water extraction in the reuse test and such a recovery reuse process could result in a normalized water recovery of 3870 ml mol ds 1 or a ds usage of 0 26 mol l 1 per liter of recovered water the produced bioenergy by the bioelectrochemical part of the sysmte might offset some energy demand the net energy consumption by the hybrid system was estimated to 0 004 0 112 kwh m 3 treated wastewater 0 007 0 179 kwh kg 1 cod or 0 001 0 020 kwh kg 1 recovered nh4 n acknowledgments this work was partially supported by the institute for critical technology and applied science ctas at virginia tech dr yuli yang was supported by fundamental

19511,the presence of toxic microcystins in algal impacted surface waters is a concern for drinking water quality management in this study the potential of ferrate vi to eliminate microcystins during drinking water treatment was assessed by investigating reaction kinetics reaction sites transformation products and toxicity changes for the oxidation of microcystin lr mc lr as a representative microsystin the investigations also included several substructural model compounds of mc lr such as cinnamic acid and sorbic acid to elucidate the major transformation products and pathways of mc lr and olefinic compounds second order rate constants were determined in the ph range 6 10 4 for the reaction of ferrate vi with mc lr and the model compounds the kinetic data revealed that the olefinic double bonds in the adda and mdha residues of mc lr were the primary ferrate vi reaction sites while the phenyl or guanidine moiety was not the reaction site this finding was supported by detection and identification of the mc lr transformation products of double bond cleavage with high peak abundance in the liquid chromatography mass spectrometry furthermore the reaction of ferrate vi with cinnamic and sorbic acids formed the corresponding aldehydes and organic acids with near complete carbon mass balance indicating the oxidative cleavage of the double bonds as the primary reaction pathway a quantitative protein phosphatase 2a pp2a binding assay for ferrate vi treated mc lr solutions showed that the mc lr transformation products exhibited negligible pp2a binding activity

deteriorate water quality by releasing algal toxins taste and odor compounds and dissolved organic matter the latter are the precursors of toxic disinfection by products graham et al 2010 he et al

responsible for the hepatotoxicity of mc lr based on its strong binding affinity for liver protein phosphatase xing et al 2006 the world health organization has set a provisional guideline that limits mc lr to less than 1 μg l in drinking water who 2003 microcystins including mc lr can be eliminated during oxidative water treatment processes that are currently widely applied in drinking water treatment for the purpose of chemical oxidation and disinfection chang et al 2014 he et al 2012 onstad et al 2007 rodríguez et al 2007 zong et al 2013 the efficiency of mc lr elimination depends on the type of oxidant used in the process even though chlorine shows some reactivity to mc lr the elimination of mc lr during chlorination can be insufficient especially under basic ph conditions because the second order rate constant k app for the reaction of chlorine with mc lr decreases substantially with increasing ph e g k 90 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 and 10 m 1 s 1 at ph 9 rodríguez et al 2007 ozone and permanganate show high reactivity to mc lr k 4 1 105 m 1 s 1 for o3 and k 3 6 102 m 1 s 1 for mno4 respectively that is independent of ph onstad et al 2007 rodríguez et al 2007 oh radicals exhibit a diffusion controlled reaction rate with mc lr k 2 1010 m 1 s 1 song et al 2009 thus ozone permanganate or advanced oxidation processes such as uv h2o2 can be an effective option to control mc lr levels during oxidative drinking water treatment processes full mineralization of organic contaminants is rarely achieved and thus transformation products are formed as some transformation products may retain the toxicity of a parent contaminant or show a new type of toxicity it is important to identify the structure of the transformation products escher and fenner 2011 lee and von gunten 2016 the elucidation of a reaction mechanism for an oxidant with organic moieties is helpful to establish a general prediction tool for the transformation pathways and products lee and von

al 2007 oh radicals as a much less selective oxidant react not only with the conjugated olefin moiety of an adda side chain but also with other mc lr amino acid chains yielding numerous hydroxylated

at ph 7 jiang et al 2014 based on the identified transformation products using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry it was proposed that the mc lr transformation during fe vi oxidation proceeds by the hydroxylation of the phenyl moiety hydroxylation of the double bonds of adda and mdha residues and fragmentation of the amide bond of me asp residue jiang et al 2014 despite this research progress it is still unclear for the major transformation products and degradation pathways of mc lr during fe vi oxidation hydroxylation of the phenyl moiety and fragmentation of the amide bond are less likely to occur because these moieties are unreactive to fe vi and most other oxidants e g ozone lee and von gunten 2010 2012 hydroxylation of the double bonds as the major reaction pathway is also unclear because the oxidative cleavage of double bonds has also been observed for olefinic compounds during fe vi oxidation hu et al 2009 it should be noted that the identified transformation products of mc lr are not quantified previously jiang et al 2014 and thus some of them may represent minor transformation products overall the general reaction mechanism and pathway for fe vi oxidation of olefinic double bonds which is thought to be the primary reaction site of mc lr and other organic contaminants are currently poorly understood to fill these information gaps this study performed a systematic investigation of the reaction kinetics as well as identified and quantified the transformation products for the reaction of fe vi with mc lr cinnamic acid and sorbic acid the latter two compounds are structural model compounds of the olefin moieties of mc lr fig s1 based on the obtained kinetic and product information the major transformation pathways and reaction mechanisms of mc lr and olefin compounds during fe vi oxidation were proposed and discussed the toxicity of the transformation products of mc lr by fe vi oxidation was also assessed using a protein phosphatase inhibition assay finally the mc lr elimination efficiency was examined in a natural water matrix 2 material and methods 2 1 standards and reagents all chemicals and solvents were purchased

phosphate 2 or 5 mm was used as a buffer and a complexing agent for fe iii to prevent iron precipitation lee et al 2009 for experiments at ph 9 2 mm borate was used as a buffer with phosphate kinetic experiments were conducted in two different modes depending on the reactant ratio under a pseudo first order condition for mc lr by employing excess fe vi relative to mc lr fe vi 0 10 mc lr 0 1 μm and under a pseudo first order condition for fe vi by employing an excess of structural model compound relative to fe vi i e compound 0 10 fe vi 0 and fe vi 0 1 3 μm the reaction was initiated by the addition of a small volume 2 ml of a stock fe vi solution 0 2 1 mm to a solution 25 or 50 ml containing mc lr or structural model compounds 2 acetamidoacrylic acid cinnamic acid ethylguanidine and

mixture transformation product mixtures were obtained by reacting 10 μm mc lr with fe vi 0 100 μm at ph 7 1 mm phosphate buffer residual mc lr concentrations after completion of fe vi consumption 3 h were determined using the hplc uv method the colorimetric protein phosphatase 2a pp2a assay was used to determine the toxic potential of mc lr and its transformation products heresztyn and nicholson 2001 this assay quantifies the binding affinity of targets to pp2a by measuring inhibitory effects on pp2a activity for the dephosphorylation of p nitrophenylphosphate p npp into p nitrophenol and free phosphate inhibition values measured for each member of the dilution series prepared from each fe vi treated mc lr sample were plotted as a function of the logarithmic sample dilution factors to

elimination in real water matrix water from a river nakdong river 5 2 mg l of doc was used to simulate mc lr elimination by fe vi in a real water matrix the nakdong river is the drinking water source for busan city korea the filtered river water samples 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter advantec japan were spiked with 10 μg l mc lr 10 nm buffered at ph 7 10 mm of phosphate and treated with various fe vi doses after 3 h the residual mc lr concentrations were determined by solid phase extraction spe followed by the lc triple quadrupole ms2 using nodularin as an internal standard si text 2 further details on the real water matrix experiment are described in si text 5 3 results and discussions 3 1 kinetics with mc lr and its structural model compounds fig 1 shows the apparent second order rate constants k app for the reaction of fe vi with mc lr or its structural model compounds 2 acetamidoacrylic acid ethylguanidine cinnamic acid and sorbic acid see fig s1 for structures at ph 7 the k app of mc lr was determined to be 153 3 m 1 s 1 this value was higher by a factor of 1 7 than that of sorbic acid k app 89 m 1 s 1 by a factor of 2 9 than that of cinnamic acid k app 52 1 m 1 s 1 and by a factor of 3 6 than that of 2 acetamidoacrylic acid k app 43 m 1 s 1 the higher k app of mc lr and sorbic acid compared to cinnamic acid and 2 acetamidoacrylic acid is consistent with the presence of a conjugated olefinic double bond in mc lr and sorbic acid as double bonds typically show higher reactivity toward oxidation reaction compared to single olefinic double bonds lee and von gunten 2012 the k app of ethylguanidine at ph 7 was 0 09 m 1 s 1 indicating that the arg residue in mc lr has negligible reactivity to fe vi the reactivity of the phenyl moiety in the adda residue to fe vi was also tested using ethylbenzene as the structural model compound fig s2 shows that 20 μm ethylbenzene did not decay at all less than 1 after its reaction with up to 150 μm fe vi at ph 7 for 3 h thus the k app for the phenyl moiety in the adda residue of mc lr was estimated to be 0 1 m 1 s 1 our kinetic data collectively indicate that the olefin moieties of mc lr i e the conjugated double bonds in the adda residue and the non conjugated double bond in the mdha residue are the primary reaction sites for fe vi oxidation the k app values were determined as a function of ph 6 10 4 for mc lr sorbic acid 2 acetamidoacrylic acid and ethylguanine for these compounds the k app values decreased with increasing ph which can be explained by the speciation change of fe vi hfevio4 fevio4 2 h pk a hfeo4 7 2 sharma et al 2001 in which hfeo4 is usually more reactive than feo4 2 lee et al 2009 sharma 2013 the ph dependent k app for these compounds could be modeled by considering the species specific reactions of hfeo4 and feo4 2 see si text 4 the species specific rate constants for the reaction of hfeo4 and feo4 2 were k h f e o 4 212 11 m 1 s 1 and k f e o 4 2 11 1 m 1 s 1 for mc lr k h f e o 4 145 6 m 1 s 1 and k f e o 4 2 0 22 0 03 m 1 s 1 for sorbic acid k h f e o 4 69 2 m 1 s 1 and 0 28 0 06 m 1 s 1 for 2 acetamidoacrylic acid k h f e o 4 0 14 0 02 m 1 s 1 for protonated ethylguanine and k h f e o 4 77 6 m 1 s 1 for deprotonated ethylguanine the k h f e o 4 values for mc lr and sorbic acid from the current study are comparable to but smaller than those reported in a previous study by a factor of 1 8 and 1 4 respectively jiang et al 2014 3 2 transformation products of mc lr to investigate the transformation product 10 μm mc lr was treated with a stepwise increasing fe vi dose 0 100 μm at ph 7 and the samples were analyzed by lc q tof ms fig s3a shows the total ion chromatograms tics of the mc lr samples before and after the fe vi treatment the chromatographic retention time rt of mc lr was 18 3 min and its peak gradually decreased with increasing fe vi dose for the 80 μm fe vi dose the mc lr peak disappeared completely indicating a reaction stoichiometric ratio of 1 8 for mc lr and fe vi with a decreasing mc lr peak several peaks for transformation products were evolved at rts of 1 4 12 9 15 0 16 3 and 19 1 min fig s3a in the next step the detected peaks in the tic mode were investigated to identify the corresponding protonated molecular m h mass information fig s3b and fig s4 show the extracted ion chromatograms eics of mc lr and the protonated molecules m h of its transformation products obtained from the sample treated with 40 μm fe vi a total of six protonated molecular masses were identified as the transformation products of mc lr table 1 summarizes the rts and protonated molecular masses of mc lr and its transformation products fig 2 presents variations in the relative peak areas of mc lr and its transformation products normalized by the initial peak area of mc lr 10 μm as a function of the fe vi dosage tp1 m z 795 4 rt 1 4 min was the largest peak and its peak area rapidly increased at low fe vi doses and then slowed with higher fe vi doses tp3 m z 1015 5 and rt 19 1 min and tp5 m z 1029 6 and rt 12 9 min produced the second largest peaks the peak areas of tp3 and tp5 initially increased with fe vi doses of 0 50 μm and then decreased at the higher fe vi dose the other peaks were minor and their peak areas were maintained at relatively lower levels tp2 m z 835 4 and rt 1 4 min tp4 m z 1027 5 and rt 15 0 min and tp6 m z 1049 5 and rt 16 3 min for tp4 tp5 and tp6 more than two peaks were observed in the eics fig s4 indicating the presence of isomers for these compounds overall tp1 was found to be the primary transformation product of mc lr based on its relative peak intensity in the ms analysis to elucidate the structure of transformation products the ms2 spectrum of mc lr was investigated first fig s5 in total nine different fragment ions were found in the ms2 spectrum of mc lr most of which were also reported in previous studies chang et al 2014 jiang et al 2014 zong et al 2013 these fragment ions could be assigned to the following structures m z 682 3 arg adda glu mdha h m z 599 4 arg adda glu h m z 553 3 mdha ala leu measp arg h m z 470 3 arg adda h m z 286 2 arg measp h m z 268 2 mdha ala leu h m z 213 1 glu mdha h and m z 135 1 phch2ch och3 the formation of these fragment ions could be explained by cleavage of c n in the amide chains of mc lr these fragment ions of mc lr were employed as a reference to interpret the ms2 spectra of the transformation products for structural identification table 1 the proposed structures for the identified transformation products of mc lr are shown in fig 3 tp1 fig s6 the protonated molecular mass of tp1 is 795 4 which is lower than that of mc lr by m z 200 1 indicating a loss of some structural part from mc lr the ms2 spectrum of tp1 showed no fragment ions containing the adda residue m z 682 3 m z 599 4 m z 470 3 or the phenyl moiety m z 135 1 phch2ch och3 which indicates that the adda residue had been structurally modified the fragment ions corresponding to the mdha ala leu measp arg residues were found m z 286 2 268 2 and 213 1 indicating that these structural parts of mc lr were intact fragment ions with a different mass compared to mc lr were observed at m z 648 3 465 2 and 381 2 the structures of these new fragment ions could be explained by considering cleavage at the olefinic double bond in the adda residue the second double bond from the phenyl group and carbonyl formation at the cleavage site fig s6 notably the addition and loss of small neutral molecules including co m z of 28 co2 m z of 44 nh3 m z of 15 and h2o m z of 18 from the fragment ions were observed which must be considered when identifying fragment ions tp2 fig s7 tp2 m z 835 4 was another transformation product with a lower mass than that of mc lr similar to that of tp1 the ms2 spectrum of tp2 does not show any fragment ions containing the adda residue or the phenyl moiety while the fragment ions related to the mdha ala leu measp arg residues were clearly observed this finding indicates that the structure of tp2 is quite similar to that of tp1 several new fragment ions were observed at m z 662 3 522 3 411 2 and 293 2 overall the structure of tp2 was assigned to the product formed by cleavage of the olefinic double bond in the adda residue the first double bond from the phenyl group and carbonyl formation at the cleavage site tp3 fig s8 the protonated molecule of tp3 m z 1015 5 gained m z 20 0 compared to that of mc lr the ms2 spectrum of tp3 reveals that the arg adda glu residues were intact while the mdha residue was clearly structurally transformed new fragment ions such as m z 498 3 were assigned to co2h ala leu measp arg no 4 in fig s8 indicating that the amide bond in the mdha residue was hydrolyzed based on these data the structure of tp3 was assigned to the product formed by cleavage of the olefinic double bond in mdha residue with the loss of ch2 m z 14 and gain of o m z 16 followed by the hydrolysis m z 18 of the two neighboring carbonyls into the terminal carboxyl and carbonyl groups fig s8 this result is consistent with the overall mass gain of m z 20 0 compared to mc lr note that the structure of tp3 in fig 3 could be one of two possible isomers depending on the locations of the terminal carboxyl and carbonyl groups tp4 fig s9 the protonated molecule of tp4 m z 1027 5 gained m z 32 0 compared to that of mc lr the ms2 spectrum of tp4 shows that the mdha ala leu measp arg residues were intact while the adda residue was structurally modified however the fragment ion phch2ch och3 m z 135 1 was clearly found indicating that the phenyl moiety in adda residue was still intact new fragment ions such as m z 898 5 631 4 and 502 3 were observed and assigned to the structures containing the adda residue with additional m z 32 0 based on these data the structure of tp4 was assigned to the product formed by the oxidation of the olefinic double bonds in the adda residue via the addition of two oxygen atoms m z 32 the addition of the two o s can be best explained by oxidation of the olefinic double bond forming an α hydroxy ketone group note that the structure of tp4 in fig 3 indicates three possible structural isomers depending on the locations of the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups tp5 fig s10 the protonated molecule of tp5 m z 1029 6 gained m z 34 0 compared to that of mc lr the ms2 spectrum of tp5 shows common patterns compared to that of tp4 as the conjugated olefinic double bonds in only the adda residue have been structurally transformed thus the structure of tp5 was assigned to the product formed by the oxidation of the olefinic double bond in the adda residue via the addition of two hydroxyl groups specifically diols m z 34 0 similar to tp6 the structure of tp5 in fig 3 indicates two possible structural isomers depending on the location of the two hydroxyl groups m z 17 2 tp6 fig s11 the protonated molecule of tp6 m z 1049 5 gained m z 54 0 compared to that of mc lr the ms2 spectrum of tp6 reveals that both adda and mdha were structurally transformed the fragment ion phch2ch och3 m z 135 1 was found indicating that the phenyl moiety in the adda residue was still intact the structure of tp6 was thus assigned to the product formed by the oxidation of conjugated olefinic double bonds in the adda residue into diols and oxidation of the olefinic double bond in the mdha residue to the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups several possible structural isomers of tp8 are shown in fig s11 based on these data the primary transformation pathways of mc lr during fe vi oxidation can be described as follows first the double bonds in the adda and mdha residues are the major reaction sites while the phenyl moiety in the adda residue is not a reaction site e g hydroxylation of benzene second oxidative cleavage of the double bonds forming carbonyl products tp1 tp2 and tp3 is the major reaction pathway while the formation of diols tp5 and α hydroxy ketone tp4 are also observed as relative minor pathways third most identified products can be further transformed by fe vi due to the presence of unreacted double bonds it should be noted that the assignments for the major vs minor transformation products may be unclear because this study did not quantify the transformation products using the corresponding standard compounds nonetheless it can be expected that the intensity in the q tof ms detector is not significantly different for mc lr and its transformation products as they all share the mdha ala leu measp arg residue furthermore the proposed transformation pathways of mc lr are consistent with the results of oxidation of cinnamic acid and sorbic acid by fe vi as described below 3 3 oxidation of cinnamic acid fig 4 shows the oxidation of cinnamic acid and its transformation product evolution from the reaction of cinnamic acid with fe vi at ph 7 a fe vi dose of more than 150 μm was required to completely oxidize 20 μm cinnamic acid the products benzaldehyde glyoxylic acid and formic acid were identified and quantified and the concentration of benzaldehyde gradually increased with increasing fe vi dose its increase mirrored the decrease in cinnamic acid glyoxylic acid and formic acid showed rather different product evolution patterns compared to those of benzaldehyde the concentration of glyoxylic acid was relatively low and was maintained at 1 6 μm across all fe vi doses tested the concentration of formic acid increased with increasing fe vi dose but its rate of increase was lower than that of benzaldehyde to confirm the carbon mass balance the organic carbon oc concentrations of the samples were calculated by summing the organic carbon normalized concentrations of cinnamic acid benzaldehyde glyoxylic acid and formic acid the result showed that the calculated oc gradually decreased from 20 μm initially to 15 μm with increasing fe vi doses up to 150 μm pink triangles fig 4 indicating the presence of missing products or carbon mineralization the observed product evolution patterns for glyoxylic acid and formic acid fig 4 strongly suggest that glyoxylic acid is oxidized to formic acid and carbon dioxide co2 this result was confirmed by a separate experiment investigating the oxidation of glyoxylic acid with fe vi fig 5 shows that the oxidation of glyoxylic acid during fe vi oxidation at ph 7 produces formic acid and bicarbonate hco3 with a close carbon mass balance note that bicarbonate is the major species of aqueous co2 at ph 7 the degree of reactivity of glyoxylic acid to fe vi is not reported in the literature thus k app for the reaction of fe vi with glyoxylic acid was determined in this study by measuring the decrease in fe vi in the presence of excess glyoxylic acid the k app was determined to be 1 9 0 1 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 the oxidation of glyoxylic acid in the fe vi oxidation system could have been driven by hydrogen peroxide h2o2 because h2o2 is readily formed during fe vi reactions lee et al 2014 a second order rate constant of 0 3 m 1 s 1 was reported for the reaction of h2o2 with glyoxylic acid at ph 7 yielding formic acid and co2 as the products leitzke et al 2001 in separate experiments the h2o2 formation was determined to be 4 8 μm from the reaction of 20 μm of cinnamic acid with 60 100 μm of fe vi for 2 h at ph 7 data not shown based on this information it is concluded that the oxidation of glyoxylic acid is mainly induced by fe vi and the contribution of h2o2 is negligible the oxidation of glyoxylic acid by the h2o2 formed from fe vi decomposition is relatively too slow at ph 7 e g half life of 80 h in presence of 8 μm of h2o2 scheme 1 is proposed for the transformation pathways of cinnamic acid during fe vi oxidation fe vi attacks and cleaves the double bond of cinnamic acid to form benzaldehyde and glyoxylic acid as the primary products r1 glyoxylic acid is oxidized by fe vi producing formic acid and co2 r2 overall oxidative cleavage of the olefinic double bond to form two carbonyl products was found to be the primary fe vi reaction pathway for cinnamic acid 3 4 oxidation of sorbic acid fig 6 shows the oxidation of sorbic acid and the evolution of its transformation products during fe vi treatment at ph 7 at a fe vi dose of 150 μm near complete oxidation of sorbic acid was achieved three aldehydes glyoxal acetaldehyde and formaldehyde and two organic acids glyoxylic acid and formic acid were identified and quantified as the products but 2 enal was also identified without quantification as a product based on the pre column pfbha derivatization followed by gc ms analysis figs s12 and s13 the formation of glyoxylic acid and acetaldehyde occurred slightly earlier with increasing fe vi dose compared to the formation of glyoxal formaldehyde and formic acid the concentration of glyoxylic acid reached a maximum 8 3 μm at a lower fe vi dose 40 μm and gradually decreased with further increases in fe vi dose glyoxal showed a similar evolution pattern compared to glyoxylic acid although its maximum concentration 5 6 μm was observed at a relatively higher fe vi dose 120 μm the product evolution pattern of acetaldehyde formaldehyde and formic acid was different from that of glyoxylic acid and glyoxal and their concentrations continued to increase to 13 3 μm 8 2 μm and 8 7 μm respectively with increasing fe vi doses up to 150 μm the calculated oc gradually decreased from an initial 20 μm 10 μm with increasing fe vi doses up to 150 μm based on the data presented in fig 6 scheme 2 is proposed for the transformation pathways of sorbic acid during fe vi oxidation fe vi first attacks one of the two conjugated olefinic double bonds i e c2 c3 and c4 c5 leading to two different reaction pathways for double bond cleavage cleavage of the c2 c3 bond forms glyoxylic acid and but 2 enal r3 while cleavage of the c4 c5 bond produces 4 oxobut 2 enoic acid and acetaldehyde r4 as the primary products even though 4 oxobut 2 enoic acid could not be identified in this study the formation of acetaldehyde as the product couple strongly supports its formation these primary products except acetaldehyde are not stable and can undergo further reaction glyoxylic acid is oxidized to formic acid and co2 by fe vi r5 and r9 as explained in the previous section but 2 enal still contains an olefinic double bond and its oxidation by fe vi will form acetaldehyde and glyoxal r6 similarly oxidation of the olefinic double bond of 4 oxobut 2 enoic acid will generate glyoxal and glyoxylic acid r7 glyoxal can be further oxidized by fe vi to formaldehyde and formic acid r8 the k app for the reaction of fe vi with glyoxal was determined as 2 6 0 2 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 from this study by measuring the decrease in fe vi in the presence of excess glyoxal overall oxidative cleavage of the olefinic double bonds to formaldehyde and organic acid products was found to be the primary fe vi reaction pathway for sorbic acid 3 5 reaction mechanism of olefin oxidation by fe vi scheme 3 shows the proposed reaction mechanism for the oxidation of olefin compounds by fe vi in water at neutral ph the reaction is initiated by electrophilic attack of fe vi hfeo4 at the olefinic double bond via the formation of a cyclic ester r10 the cyclic ester can be decomposed into two carbonyl products and fe ii via intramolecular redox reactions r11 this double bond cleavage should be the major reaction pathway as it is consistent with our data for mc lr cinnamic acid and sorbic acid the formation of diols or α hydroxy ketone as the minor products observed for mc lr requires the presence of another reaction pathway products with diols can be explained by consecutive hydrolysis of the cyclic ester intermediates r12 and r13 products with α hydroxy ketone can be formed by initial hydrolysis followed by the oxidation of hydroxyl groups r12 and r14 scheme 3 is largely based on the well established reaction mechanism for the oxidation of olefins by permanganate hu et al 2009 lee and brownridge 1974 3 6 pp2a binding activity of transformation product mixtures of mc lr fig 7 shows the decrease in the relative mc lr concentration and the relative pp2a binding activity mc lr eq normalized to the untreated sample value as a function of the fe vi dose for the treatment of 10 μm mc lr at ph 7 see also fig s14 the decrease in pp2a binding activity was quite close to the decrease in mc lr concentration with a direct one to one correlation this finding indicates that the pp2a binding activity of the transformation products of mc lr from fe vi oxidation fig 3 is insignificant relative to mc lr the long hydrophobic adda residue has been identified as the key structure of mc lr for its binding to the hydrophobic cage of pp2a the mdha residue is also known to contribute to mc lr binding to pp2a proteins xing et al 2006 the primary transformation products of mc lr identified in this study show the destroyed olefinic double bonds in the adda and mdha residues fig 3 such structural modifications were found to significantly reduce the binding affinity of mc lr to pp2a similar results were also reported in a previous study for the fe vi induced transformation products of mc lr using a pp1 enzyme assay jiang et al 2014 3 7 elimination efficiency of mc lr in simulated real water matrix the k app for the reaction of mc lr with fe vi was 54 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 indicating that mc lr can be significantly eliminated during water treatment with fe vi to confirm this result mc lr elimination experiments were performed in a simulated real water matrix fig s15 shows the elimination of mc lr in filtered river water samples spiked at 10 μg l 10 nm at ph 7 the samples were treated with fe vi doses ranging from 0 5 mgfe l 9 μm to 5 mgfe l 90 μm and analyzed for residual mc lr after complete consumption of the applied fe vi reaction time of 3 h with increasing fe vi doses the mc lr concentration gradually decreased and a fe vi dose of 3 mgfe l 54 μm was required for complete elimination of mc lr considering only the reaction stoichiometry the complete oxidation for 10 nm of mc lr would require only 80 nm 0 08 μm fe vi the observed much larger fe vi dose required for mc lr elimination in the tested filtered river water matrix by a factor of 675 can be explained by consumption of fe vi via the reaction with dissolved organic matter 5 2 mg c l and fe vi self decay deng et al 2018 lee et al 2014 shin et al 2018 this efficient elimination of mc lr by fe vi oxidation is recommended to be confirmed in more realistic algal impacted water matrices as the fe vi decay kinetics and consequent fe vi oxidation efficiency can be influenced by different water qualities such as ph dom and carbonate and iron floc formation deng et al 2018 jiang et al 2015 kolar et al 2016 4 conclusions the kinetic and product information obtained from the reaction of fe vi with mc lr and its structural model compounds demonstrates that the olefinic double bonds located in the adda and mdha residues are the primary fe vi reaction sites while neither the phenyl nor guanidine moiety is the reaction site cleavage of the olefinic double bonds forming two carbonyl groups was found to be the primary oxidation pathway diols and α hydroxy ketone are also formed as minor non cleavage products from mc lr the observed structural modifications of mc lr during fe vi oxidation lead to significant reductions in the binding affinity of mc lr to the pp2a enzyme oxidation experiments in a selected filtered river water matrix demonstrate that an fe vi dose of 3 mg fe l is sufficient to fully eliminate mc lr nevertheless this efficient elimination is recommended to be confirmed in more realistic algal impacted water matrices overall this study demonstrates fe vi oxidation as a promising option to control mc lr in surface water treatment

19511,the presence of toxic microcystins in algal impacted surface waters is a concern for drinking water quality management in this study the potential of ferrate vi to eliminate microcystins during drinking water treatment was assessed by investigating reaction kinetics reaction sites transformation products and toxicity changes for the oxidation of microcystin lr mc lr as a representative microsystin the investigations also included several substructural model compounds of mc lr such as cinnamic acid and sorbic acid to elucidate the major transformation products and pathways of mc lr and olefinic compounds second order rate constants were determined in the ph range 6 10 4 for the reaction of ferrate vi with mc lr and the model compounds the kinetic data revealed that the olefinic double bonds in the adda and mdha residues of mc lr were the primary ferrate vi reaction sites while the phenyl or guanidine moiety was not the reaction site this finding was supported by detection and identification of the mc lr transformation products of double bond cleavage with high peak abundance in the liquid chromatography mass spectrometry furthermore the reaction of ferrate vi with cinnamic and sorbic acids formed the corresponding aldehydes and organic acids with near complete carbon mass balance indicating the oxidative cleavage of the double bonds as the primary reaction pathway a quantitative protein phosphatase 2a pp2a binding assay for ferrate vi treated mc lr solutions showed that the mc lr transformation products exhibited negligible pp2a binding activity compared to that of the parent mc lr oxidation experiments in a filtered river water matrix spiked with mc lr demonstrated the efficient elimination of mc lr during water treatment with ferrate vi keywords ferrate vi algal toxin microcystin lr olefin sorbic acid cinnamic acid 1 introduction algae and cyanobacteria blooms in bodies of fresh water are a serious environmental concern in many parts of the world and their frequency and intensity are expected to increase due to increased nutrient discharge from agricultural waters and wastewaters as well as the effects of global warming o neil et al 2012 paerl and paul 2012 paerl et al 2014 algal and cyanobacterial blooms often referred to as harmful algal blooms hab are also a serious concern for the drinking water industry as they can deteriorate water quality by releasing algal toxins taste and odor compounds and dissolved organic matter the latter are the precursors of toxic disinfection by products graham et al 2010 he et al 2016 li et al 2012 among the drinking water quality issues related to hab cyanotoxins have received considerable attention they can pose serious health risks for drinking water consumers due to their potent toxicity codd et al 2005 microcystins a class of hepatotoxic monocyclic heptapeptides mclellan and manderville 2017 are the most prevalent cyanotoxins detected in water resources affected by hab in addition to anatoxin cylindrospermospin and saxitoxin among others codd et al 2005 microcystin lr mc lr is the most abundant and toxic of the 80 structurally analogous microcystins codd et al 2005 who 2003 it consists of a chain of six amino acids glu mdha ala leu measp arg with a side chain of adda see fig s1 for the chemical structure the hydrophobic adda residue is known to be responsible for the hepatotoxicity of mc lr based on its strong binding affinity for liver protein phosphatase xing et al 2006 the world health organization has set a provisional guideline that limits mc lr to less than 1 μg l in drinking water who 2003 microcystins including mc lr can be eliminated during oxidative water treatment processes that are currently widely applied in drinking water treatment for the purpose of chemical oxidation and disinfection chang et al 2014 he et al 2012 onstad et al 2007 rodríguez et al 2007 zong et al 2013 the efficiency of mc lr elimination depends on the type of oxidant used in the process even though chlorine shows some reactivity to mc lr the elimination of mc lr during chlorination can be insufficient especially under basic ph conditions because the second order rate constant k app for the reaction of chlorine with mc lr decreases substantially with increasing ph e g k 90 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 and 10 m 1 s 1 at ph 9 rodríguez et al 2007 ozone and permanganate show high reactivity to mc lr k 4 1 105 m 1 s 1 for o3 and k 3 6 102 m 1 s 1 for mno4 respectively that is independent of ph onstad et al 2007 rodríguez et al 2007 oh radicals exhibit a diffusion controlled reaction rate with mc lr k 2 1010 m 1 s 1 song et al 2009 thus ozone permanganate or advanced oxidation processes such as uv h2o2 can be an effective option to control mc lr levels during oxidative drinking water treatment processes full mineralization of organic contaminants is rarely achieved and thus transformation products are formed as some transformation products may retain the toxicity of a parent contaminant or show a new type of toxicity it is important to identify the structure of the transformation products escher and fenner 2011 lee and von gunten 2016 the elucidation of a reaction mechanism for an oxidant with organic moieties is helpful to establish a general prediction tool for the transformation pathways and products lee and von gunten 2016 ozone and permanganate readily oxidize the conjugated olefin moiety located in an adda side chain which may lead to the efficient elimination of mc lr toxicity chang et al 2014 onstad et al 2007 oh radicals as a much less selective oxidant react not only with the conjugated olefin moiety of an adda side chain but also with other mc lr amino acid chains yielding numerous hydroxylated and carbonyl transformation products some oh radical induced transformation products of mc lr were found to retain residual toxicity comparable to the parent mc lr zong et al 2013 ferratevi fe vi has been proposed and demonstrated to be an oxidant and a coagulant for treating drinking water or wastewater jiang 2007 lee et al 2009 sharma et al 2016 fe vi is similar to permanganate which is widely used for drinking water treatment in china and the usa as both are transition metal based oxidants and the products resulting from their oxidative reactions can be used as in situ coagulants in the form of iron iii and manganese iii iv oxides respectively u s epa 1999 the two oxidants also show mild and selective reactivity to electron rich organic moieties such as phenols olefins and amines hu et al 2009 hu et al 2010 jiang et al 2012 lee and von gunten 2010 sharma 2013 pre oxidation with fe vi or permanganate prior to the coagulation process has been proposed as an option for treating algal impacted waters as it can enhance the coagulation efficiency of algae cells without the excessive release of intracellular organic matter deng et al 2017 liu et al 2017 ma and liu 2002 xie et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 and can eliminate taste and odor compounds containing olefin moieties shin et al 2018 a recent study reported that fe vi shows considerable reactivity to mc lr k 2 5 102 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 jiang et al 2014 based on the identified transformation products using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry it was proposed that the mc lr transformation during fe vi oxidation proceeds by the hydroxylation of the phenyl moiety hydroxylation of the double bonds of adda and mdha residues and fragmentation of the amide bond of me asp residue jiang et al 2014 despite this research progress it is still unclear for the major transformation products and degradation pathways of mc lr during fe vi oxidation hydroxylation of the phenyl moiety and fragmentation of the amide bond are less likely to occur because these moieties are unreactive to fe vi and most other oxidants e g ozone lee and von gunten 2010 2012 hydroxylation of the double bonds as the major reaction pathway is also unclear because the oxidative cleavage of double bonds has also been observed for olefinic compounds during fe vi oxidation hu et al 2009 it should be noted that the identified transformation products of mc lr are not quantified previously jiang et al 2014 and thus some of them may represent minor transformation products overall the general reaction mechanism and pathway for fe vi oxidation of olefinic double bonds which is thought to be the primary reaction site of mc lr and other organic contaminants are currently poorly understood to fill these information gaps this study performed a systematic investigation of the reaction kinetics as well as identified and quantified the transformation products for the reaction of fe vi with mc lr cinnamic acid and sorbic acid the latter two compounds are structural model compounds of the olefin moieties of mc lr fig s1 based on the obtained kinetic and product information the major transformation pathways and reaction mechanisms of mc lr and olefin compounds during fe vi oxidation were proposed and discussed the toxicity of the transformation products of mc lr by fe vi oxidation was also assessed using a protein phosphatase inhibition assay finally the mc lr elimination efficiency was examined in a natural water matrix 2 material and methods 2 1 standards and reagents all chemicals and solvents were purchased

phosphate 2 or 5 mm was used as a buffer and a complexing agent for fe iii to prevent iron precipitation lee et al 2009 for experiments at ph 9 2 mm borate was used as a buffer with phosphate kinetic experiments were conducted in two different modes depending on the reactant ratio under a pseudo first order condition for mc lr by employing excess fe vi relative to mc lr fe vi 0 10 mc lr 0 1 μm and under a pseudo first order condition for fe vi by employing an excess of structural model compound relative to fe vi i e compound 0 10 fe vi 0 and fe vi 0 1 3 μm the reaction was initiated by the addition of a small volume 2 ml of a stock fe vi solution 0 2 1 mm to a solution 25 or 50 ml containing mc lr or structural model compounds 2 acetamidoacrylic acid cinnamic acid ethylguanidine and sorbic acid which was buffered at the desired ph under rapid mixing for the initial 10 s the reaction solutions were sampled at pre determined times and mixed with either solutions containing 2 2

mixture transformation product mixtures were obtained by reacting 10 μm mc lr with fe vi 0 100 μm at ph 7 1 mm phosphate buffer residual mc lr concentrations after completion of fe vi consumption 3 h were determined using the hplc uv method the colorimetric protein phosphatase 2a pp2a assay was used to determine the toxic potential of mc lr and its transformation products heresztyn and nicholson 2001 this assay quantifies the binding affinity of targets to pp2a by measuring inhibitory effects on pp2a activity for the dephosphorylation of p nitrophenylphosphate p npp into p nitrophenol and free phosphate inhibition values measured for each member of the dilution series prepared from each fe vi treated mc lr sample were plotted as a function of the logarithmic sample dilution factors to yield dose response curves the dose response curves were then fitted to a symmetric logistic function in which the optimal relative dilution factors causing a 50 pp2a enzyme inhibition effect ec50 were determined the pp2a binding activity of samples were calculated as the ratio of the ec50 of the untreated mc lr 10 μm to the ec50 of each treated sample i e pp2a binding activity ec50 mc lr ec50

elimination in real water matrix water from a river nakdong river 5 2 mg l of doc was used to simulate mc lr elimination by fe vi in a real water matrix the nakdong river is the drinking water source for busan city korea the filtered river water samples 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter advantec japan were spiked with 10 μg l mc lr 10 nm buffered at ph 7 10 mm of phosphate and treated with various fe vi doses after 3 h the residual mc lr concentrations were determined by solid phase extraction spe followed by the lc triple quadrupole ms2 using nodularin as an internal standard si text 2 further details on the real water matrix experiment are described in si text 5 3 results and discussions 3 1 kinetics with mc lr and its structural model compounds fig 1 shows the apparent second order rate constants k app for the reaction of fe vi with mc lr or its structural model compounds 2 acetamidoacrylic acid ethylguanidine cinnamic acid and sorbic acid see fig s1 for structures at ph 7 the k app of mc lr was determined to be 153 3 m 1 s 1 this value was higher by a factor of 1 7 than that of sorbic acid k app 89 m 1 s 1 by a factor of 2 9 than that of cinnamic acid k app 52 1 m 1 s 1 and by a factor of 3 6 than that of 2 acetamidoacrylic acid k app 43 m 1 s 1 the higher k app of mc lr and sorbic acid compared to cinnamic acid and 2 acetamidoacrylic acid is consistent with the presence of a conjugated olefinic double bond in mc lr and sorbic acid as double bonds typically show higher reactivity toward oxidation reaction compared to single olefinic double bonds lee and von gunten 2012 the k app of ethylguanidine at ph 7 was 0 09 m 1 s 1 indicating that the arg residue in mc lr has negligible reactivity to fe vi the reactivity of the phenyl moiety in the adda residue to fe vi was also tested using ethylbenzene as the structural model compound fig s2 shows that 20 μm ethylbenzene did not decay at all less than 1 after its reaction with up to 150 μm fe vi at ph 7 for 3 h thus the k app for the phenyl moiety in the adda residue of mc lr was estimated to be 0 1 m 1 s 1 our kinetic data collectively indicate that the olefin moieties of mc lr i e the conjugated double bonds in the adda residue and the non conjugated double bond in the mdha residue are the primary reaction sites for fe vi oxidation the k app values were determined as a function of ph 6 10 4 for mc lr sorbic acid 2 acetamidoacrylic acid and ethylguanine for these compounds the k app values decreased with increasing ph which can be explained by the speciation change of fe vi hfevio4 fevio4 2 h pk a hfeo4 7 2 sharma et al 2001 in which hfeo4 is usually more reactive than feo4 2 lee et al 2009 sharma 2013 the ph dependent k app for these compounds could be modeled by considering the species specific reactions of hfeo4 and feo4 2 see si text 4 the species specific rate constants for the reaction of hfeo4 and feo4 2 were k h f e o 4 212 11 m 1 s 1 and k f e o 4 2 11 1 m 1 s 1 for mc lr k h f e o 4 145 6 m 1 s 1 and k f e o 4 2 0 22 0 03 m 1 s 1 for sorbic acid k h f e o 4 69 2 m 1 s 1 and 0 28 0 06 m 1 s 1 for 2 acetamidoacrylic acid k h f e o 4 0 14 0 02 m 1 s 1 for protonated ethylguanine and k h f e o 4 77 6 m 1 s 1 for deprotonated ethylguanine the k h f e o 4 values for mc lr and sorbic acid from the current study are comparable to but smaller than those reported in a previous study by a factor of 1 8 and 1 4 respectively jiang et al 2014 3 2 transformation products of mc lr to investigate the transformation product 10 μm mc lr was treated with a stepwise increasing fe vi dose 0 100 μm at ph 7 and the samples were analyzed by lc q tof ms fig s3a shows the total ion chromatograms tics of the mc lr samples before and after the fe vi treatment the chromatographic retention time rt of mc lr was 18 3 min and its peak gradually decreased with increasing fe vi dose for the 80 μm fe vi dose the mc lr peak disappeared completely indicating a reaction stoichiometric ratio of 1 8 for mc lr and fe vi with a decreasing mc lr peak several peaks for transformation products were evolved at rts of 1 4 12 9 15 0 16 3 and 19 1 min fig s3a in the next step the detected peaks in the tic mode were investigated to identify the corresponding protonated molecular m h mass information fig s3b and fig s4 show the extracted ion chromatograms eics of mc lr and the protonated molecules m h of its transformation products obtained from the sample treated with 40 μm fe vi a total of six protonated molecular masses were identified as the transformation products of mc lr table 1 summarizes the rts and protonated molecular masses of mc lr and its transformation products fig 2 presents variations in the relative peak areas of mc lr and its transformation products normalized by the initial peak area of mc lr 10 μm as a function of the fe vi dosage tp1 m z 795 4 rt 1 4 min was the largest peak and its peak area rapidly increased at low fe vi doses and then slowed with higher fe vi doses tp3 m z 1015 5 and rt 19 1 min and tp5 m z 1029 6 and rt 12 9 min produced the second largest peaks the peak areas of tp3 and tp5 initially increased with fe vi doses of 0 50 μm and then decreased at the higher fe vi dose the other peaks were minor and their peak areas were maintained at relatively lower levels tp2 m z 835 4 and rt 1 4 min tp4 m z 1027 5 and rt 15 0 min and tp6 m z 1049 5 and rt 16 3 min for tp4 tp5 and tp6 more than two peaks were observed in the eics fig s4 indicating the presence of isomers for these compounds overall tp1 was found to be the primary transformation product of mc lr based on its relative peak intensity in the ms analysis to elucidate the structure of transformation products the ms2 spectrum of mc lr was investigated first fig s5 in total nine different fragment ions were found in the ms2 spectrum of mc lr most of which were also reported in previous studies chang et al 2014 jiang et al 2014 zong et al 2013 these fragment ions could be assigned to the following structures m z 682 3 arg adda glu mdha h m z 599 4 arg adda glu h m z 553 3 mdha ala leu measp arg h m z 470 3 arg adda h m z 286 2 arg measp h m z 268 2 mdha ala leu h m z 213 1 glu mdha h and m z 135 1 phch2ch och3 the formation of these fragment ions could be explained by cleavage of c n in the amide chains of mc lr these fragment ions of mc lr were employed as a reference to interpret the ms2 spectra of the transformation products for structural identification table 1 the proposed structures for the identified transformation products of mc lr are shown in fig 3 tp1 fig s6 the protonated molecular mass of tp1 is 795 4 which is lower than that of mc lr by m z 200 1 indicating a loss of some structural part from mc lr the ms2 spectrum of tp1 showed no fragment ions containing the adda residue m z 682 3 m z 599 4 m z 470 3 or the phenyl moiety m z 135 1 phch2ch och3 which indicates that the adda residue had been structurally modified the fragment ions corresponding to the mdha ala leu measp arg residues were found m z 286 2 268 2 and 213 1 indicating that these structural parts of mc lr were intact fragment ions with a different mass compared to mc lr were observed at m z 648 3 465 2 and 381 2 the structures of these new fragment ions could be explained by considering cleavage at the olefinic double bond in the adda residue the second double bond from the phenyl group and carbonyl formation at the cleavage site fig s6 notably the addition and loss of small neutral molecules including co m z of 28 co2 m z of 44 nh3 m z of 15 and h2o m z of 18 from the fragment ions were observed which must be considered when identifying fragment ions tp2 fig s7 tp2 m z 835 4 was another transformation product with a lower mass than that of mc lr similar to that of tp1 the ms2 spectrum of tp2 does not show any fragment ions containing the adda residue or the phenyl moiety while the fragment ions related to the mdha ala leu measp arg residues were clearly observed this finding indicates that the structure of tp2 is quite similar to that of tp1 several new fragment ions were observed at m z 662 3 522 3 411 2 and 293 2 overall the structure of tp2 was assigned to the product formed by cleavage of the olefinic double bond in the adda residue the first double bond from the phenyl group and carbonyl formation at the cleavage site tp3 fig s8 the protonated molecule of tp3 m z 1015 5 gained m z 20 0 compared to that of mc lr the ms2 spectrum of tp3 reveals that the arg adda glu residues were intact while the mdha residue was clearly structurally transformed new fragment ions such as m z 498 3 were assigned to co2h ala leu measp arg no 4 in fig s8 indicating that the amide bond in the mdha residue was hydrolyzed based on these data the structure of tp3 was assigned to the product formed by cleavage of the olefinic double bond in mdha residue with the loss of ch2 m z 14 and gain of o m z 16 followed by the hydrolysis m z 18 of the two neighboring carbonyls into the terminal carboxyl and carbonyl groups fig s8 this result is consistent with the overall mass gain of m z 20 0 compared to mc lr note that the structure of tp3 in fig 3 could be one of two possible isomers depending on the locations of the terminal carboxyl and carbonyl groups tp4 fig s9 the protonated molecule of tp4 m z 1027 5 gained m z 32 0 compared to that of mc lr the ms2 spectrum of tp4 shows that the mdha ala leu measp arg residues were intact while the adda residue was structurally modified however the fragment ion phch2ch och3 m z 135 1 was clearly found indicating that the phenyl moiety in adda residue was still intact new fragment ions such as m z 898 5 631 4 and 502 3 were observed and assigned to the structures containing the adda residue with additional m z 32 0 based on these data the structure of tp4 was assigned to the product formed by the oxidation of the olefinic double bonds in the adda residue via the addition of two oxygen atoms m z 32 the addition of the two o s can be best explained by oxidation of the olefinic double bond forming an α hydroxy ketone group note that the structure of tp4 in fig 3 indicates three possible structural isomers depending on the locations of the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups tp5 fig s10 the protonated molecule of tp5 m z 1029 6 gained m z 34 0 compared to that of mc lr the ms2 spectrum of tp5 shows common patterns compared to that of tp4 as the conjugated olefinic double bonds in only the adda residue have been structurally transformed thus the structure of tp5 was assigned to the product formed by the oxidation of the olefinic double bond in the adda residue via the addition of two hydroxyl groups specifically diols m z 34 0 similar to tp6 the structure of tp5 in fig 3 indicates two possible structural isomers depending on the location of the two hydroxyl groups m z 17 2 tp6 fig s11 the protonated molecule of tp6 m z 1049 5 gained m z 54 0 compared to that of mc lr the ms2 spectrum of tp6 reveals that both adda and mdha were structurally transformed the fragment ion phch2ch och3 m z 135 1 was found indicating that the phenyl moiety in the adda residue was still intact the structure of tp6 was thus assigned to the product formed by the oxidation of conjugated olefinic double bonds in the adda residue into diols and oxidation of the olefinic double bond in the mdha residue to the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups several possible structural isomers of tp8 are shown in fig s11 based on these data the primary transformation pathways of mc lr during fe vi oxidation can be described as follows first the double bonds in the adda and mdha residues are the major reaction sites while the phenyl moiety in the adda residue is not a reaction site e g hydroxylation of benzene second oxidative cleavage of the double bonds forming carbonyl products tp1 tp2 and tp3 is the major reaction pathway while the formation of diols tp5 and α hydroxy ketone tp4 are also observed as relative minor pathways third most identified products can be further transformed by fe vi due to the presence of unreacted double bonds it should be noted that the assignments for the major vs minor transformation products may be unclear because this study did not quantify the transformation products using the corresponding standard compounds nonetheless it can be expected that the intensity in the q tof ms detector is not significantly different for mc lr and its transformation products as they all share the mdha ala leu measp arg residue furthermore the proposed transformation pathways of mc lr are consistent with the results of oxidation of cinnamic acid and sorbic acid by fe vi as described below 3 3 oxidation of cinnamic acid fig 4 shows the oxidation of cinnamic acid and its transformation product evolution from the reaction of cinnamic acid with fe vi at ph 7 a fe vi dose of more than 150 μm was required to completely oxidize 20 μm cinnamic acid the products benzaldehyde glyoxylic acid and formic acid were identified and quantified and the concentration of benzaldehyde gradually increased with increasing fe vi dose its increase mirrored the decrease in cinnamic acid glyoxylic acid and formic acid showed rather different product evolution patterns compared to those of benzaldehyde the concentration of glyoxylic acid was relatively low and was maintained at 1 6 μm across all fe vi doses tested the concentration of formic acid increased with increasing fe vi dose but its rate of increase was lower than that of benzaldehyde to confirm the carbon mass balance the organic carbon oc concentrations of the samples were calculated by summing the organic carbon normalized concentrations of cinnamic acid benzaldehyde glyoxylic acid and formic acid the result showed that the calculated oc gradually decreased from 20 μm initially to 15 μm with increasing fe vi doses up to 150 μm pink triangles fig 4 indicating the presence of missing products or carbon mineralization the observed product evolution patterns for glyoxylic acid and formic acid fig 4 strongly suggest that glyoxylic acid is oxidized to formic acid and carbon dioxide co2 this result was confirmed by a separate experiment investigating the oxidation of glyoxylic acid with fe vi fig 5 shows that the oxidation of glyoxylic acid during fe vi oxidation at ph 7 produces formic acid and bicarbonate hco3 with a close carbon mass balance note that bicarbonate is the major species of aqueous co2 at ph 7 the degree of reactivity of glyoxylic acid to fe vi is not reported in the literature thus k app for the reaction of fe vi with glyoxylic acid was determined in this study by measuring the decrease in fe vi in the presence of excess glyoxylic acid the k app was determined to be 1 9 0 1 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 the oxidation of glyoxylic acid in the fe vi oxidation system could have been driven by hydrogen peroxide h2o2 because h2o2 is readily formed during fe vi reactions lee et al 2014 a second order rate constant of 0 3 m 1 s 1 was reported for the reaction of h2o2 with glyoxylic acid at ph 7 yielding formic acid and co2 as the products leitzke et al 2001 in separate experiments the h2o2 formation was determined to be 4 8 μm from the reaction of 20 μm of cinnamic acid with 60 100 μm of fe vi for 2 h at ph 7 data not shown based on this information it is concluded that the oxidation of glyoxylic acid is mainly induced by fe vi and the contribution of h2o2 is negligible the oxidation of glyoxylic acid by the h2o2 formed from fe vi decomposition is relatively too slow at ph 7 e g half life of 80 h in presence of 8 μm of h2o2 scheme 1 is proposed for the transformation pathways of cinnamic acid during fe vi oxidation fe vi attacks and cleaves the double bond of cinnamic acid to form benzaldehyde and glyoxylic acid as the primary products r1 glyoxylic acid is oxidized by fe vi producing formic acid and co2 r2 overall oxidative cleavage of the olefinic double bond to form two carbonyl products was found to be the primary fe vi reaction pathway for cinnamic acid 3 4 oxidation of sorbic acid fig 6 shows the oxidation of sorbic acid and the evolution of its transformation products during fe vi treatment at ph 7 at a fe vi dose of 150 μm near complete oxidation of sorbic acid was achieved three aldehydes glyoxal acetaldehyde and formaldehyde and two organic acids glyoxylic acid and formic acid were identified and quantified as the products but 2 enal was also identified without quantification as a product based on the pre column pfbha derivatization followed by gc ms analysis figs s12 and s13 the formation of glyoxylic acid and acetaldehyde occurred slightly earlier with increasing fe vi dose compared to the formation of glyoxal formaldehyde and formic acid the concentration of glyoxylic acid reached a maximum 8 3 μm at a lower fe vi dose 40 μm and gradually decreased with further increases in fe vi dose glyoxal showed a similar evolution pattern compared to glyoxylic acid although its maximum concentration 5 6 μm was observed at a relatively higher fe vi dose 120 μm the product evolution pattern of acetaldehyde formaldehyde and formic acid was different from that of glyoxylic acid and glyoxal and their concentrations continued to increase to 13 3 μm 8 2 μm and 8 7 μm respectively with increasing fe vi doses up to 150 μm the calculated oc gradually decreased from an initial 20 μm 10 μm with increasing fe vi doses up to 150 μm based on the data presented in fig 6 scheme 2 is proposed for the transformation pathways of sorbic acid during fe vi oxidation fe vi first attacks one of the two conjugated olefinic double bonds i e c2 c3 and c4 c5 leading to two different reaction pathways for double bond cleavage cleavage of the c2 c3 bond forms glyoxylic acid and but 2 enal r3 while cleavage of the c4 c5 bond produces 4 oxobut 2 enoic acid and acetaldehyde r4 as the primary products even though 4 oxobut 2 enoic acid could not be identified in this study the formation of acetaldehyde as the product couple strongly supports its formation these primary products except acetaldehyde are not stable and can undergo further reaction glyoxylic acid is oxidized to formic acid and co2 by fe vi r5 and r9 as explained in the previous section but 2 enal still contains an olefinic double bond and its oxidation by fe vi will form acetaldehyde and glyoxal r6 similarly oxidation of the olefinic double bond of 4 oxobut 2 enoic acid will generate glyoxal and glyoxylic acid r7 glyoxal can be further oxidized by fe vi to formaldehyde and formic acid r8 the k app for the reaction of fe vi with glyoxal was determined as 2 6 0 2 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 from this study by measuring the decrease in fe vi in the presence of excess glyoxal overall oxidative cleavage of the olefinic double bonds to formaldehyde and organic acid products was found to be the primary fe vi reaction pathway for sorbic acid 3 5 reaction mechanism of olefin oxidation by fe vi scheme 3 shows the proposed reaction mechanism for the oxidation of olefin compounds by fe vi in water at neutral ph the reaction is initiated by electrophilic attack of fe vi hfeo4 at the olefinic double bond via the formation of a cyclic ester r10 the cyclic ester can be decomposed into two carbonyl products and fe ii via intramolecular redox reactions r11 this double bond cleavage should be the major reaction pathway as it is consistent with our data for mc lr cinnamic acid and sorbic acid the formation of diols or α hydroxy ketone as the minor products observed for mc lr requires the presence of another reaction pathway products with diols can be explained by consecutive hydrolysis of the cyclic ester intermediates r12 and r13 products with α hydroxy ketone can be formed by initial hydrolysis followed by the oxidation of hydroxyl groups r12 and r14 scheme 3 is largely based on the well established reaction mechanism for the oxidation of olefins by permanganate hu et al 2009 lee and brownridge 1974 3 6 pp2a binding activity of transformation product mixtures of mc lr fig 7 shows the decrease in the relative mc lr concentration and the relative pp2a binding activity mc lr eq normalized to the untreated sample value as a function of the fe vi dose for the treatment of 10 μm mc lr at ph 7 see also fig s14 the decrease in pp2a binding activity was quite close to the decrease in mc lr concentration with a direct one to one correlation this finding indicates that the pp2a binding activity of the transformation products of mc lr from fe vi oxidation fig 3 is insignificant relative to mc lr the long hydrophobic adda residue has been identified as the key structure of mc lr for its binding to the hydrophobic cage of pp2a the mdha residue is also known to contribute to mc lr binding to pp2a proteins xing et al 2006 the primary transformation products of mc lr identified in this study show the destroyed olefinic double bonds in the adda and mdha residues fig 3 such structural modifications were found to significantly reduce the binding affinity of mc lr to pp2a similar results were also reported in a previous study for the fe vi induced transformation products of mc lr using a pp1 enzyme assay jiang et al 2014 3 7 elimination efficiency of mc lr in simulated real water matrix the k app for the reaction of mc lr with fe vi was 54 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 indicating that mc lr can be significantly eliminated during water treatment with fe vi to confirm this result mc lr elimination experiments were performed in a simulated real water matrix fig s15 shows the elimination of mc lr in filtered river water samples spiked at 10 μg l 10 nm at ph 7 the samples were treated with fe vi doses ranging from 0 5 mgfe l 9 μm to 5 mgfe l 90 μm and analyzed for residual mc lr after complete consumption of the applied fe vi reaction time of 3 h with increasing fe vi doses the mc lr concentration gradually decreased and a fe vi dose of 3 mgfe l 54 μm was required for complete elimination of mc lr considering only the reaction stoichiometry the complete oxidation for 10 nm of mc lr would require only 80 nm 0 08 μm fe vi the observed much larger fe vi dose required for mc lr elimination in the tested filtered river water matrix by a factor of 675 can be explained by consumption of fe vi via the reaction with dissolved organic matter 5 2 mg c l and fe vi self decay deng et al 2018 lee et al 2014 shin et al 2018 this efficient elimination of mc lr by fe vi oxidation is recommended to be confirmed in more realistic algal impacted water matrices as the fe vi decay kinetics and consequent fe vi oxidation efficiency can be influenced by different water qualities such as ph dom and carbonate and iron floc formation deng et al 2018 jiang et al 2015 kolar et al 2016 4 conclusions the kinetic and product information obtained from the reaction of fe vi with mc lr and its structural model compounds demonstrates that the olefinic double bonds located in the adda and mdha residues are the primary fe vi reaction sites while neither the phenyl nor guanidine moiety is the reaction site cleavage of the olefinic double bonds forming two carbonyl groups was found to be the primary oxidation pathway diols and α hydroxy ketone are also formed as minor non cleavage products from mc lr the observed structural modifications of mc lr during fe vi oxidation lead to significant reductions in the binding affinity of mc lr to the pp2a enzyme oxidation experiments in a selected filtered river water matrix demonstrate that an fe vi dose of 3 mg fe l is sufficient to fully eliminate mc lr nevertheless this efficient elimination is recommended to be confirmed in more realistic algal impacted water matrices overall this study demonstrates fe vi oxidation as a promising option to control mc lr in surface water treatment

19512,ultraviolet uv light emission diode led which is mercury free and theoretically more energy efficient has now become an alternative to conventional uv lamps in water disinfection industry in this research the disinfection performance of a novel sequential process uva365nm led followed by uvc265nm led uva uvc was evaluated the results revealed that the responses of different bacterial strains to uva uvc varied coupled with appropriate dosages of uvc a 20 min uva pre radiation provided higher inactivations log inactivation of e coli atcc 11229 15597 and 700891 by 1 2 1 4 and 1 2 times respectively than the sum of inactivations by uva alone and uvc alone on the contrary the inactivation of e coli atcc 25922 the most uvc sensitive strain decreased from 3 log to 1 8 log after uva pre radiation a 30 min uva pre radiation did not affect the photo repair capacity of the four strains n 23 p 0 1 but their dark repair ability was significantly inhibited n 14 p 0 05 mechanism study was conducted for two representative strains e coli atcc 15597 and 25922 to understand the observed effect the hypothesis that uva pre radiation promoted the yield of reactive oxygen species ros was rejected elisa results indicated that 18 more cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers cpd were formed in e coli atcc 15597 with uva pre radiation n 3 p 0 01 however the cpd levels of e coli atcc 25922 was the same with or without uva pre radiation n 3 p 0 01 considering the results of both dark repair and cpd formation it was concluded that the increased uv sensitivity of e coli 15597 was originated from the increased cpd for e coli atcc 25922 the enhanced uv resistance was attributed to the strain s adoption of a survival strategy translesion dna synthesis tls when triggered by uva pre radiation the study on umud protein which is a key protein during tls confirmed this hypothesis graphical abstract image 1 keywords sequential ultraviolet uv radiation light emitting diode led photo dark repair mechanism disinfection 1 introduction as an effective disinfection method ultraviolet uv light has been widely used in water and wastewater treatment industries most uv disinfection systems use low or medium pressure mercury lamps which contain toxic chemical mercury require significant amounts of energy and have a relatively short lifetime chevremont et al 2013 an attractive alternative uv source to traditional uv lamp is light emitting diodes leds which are mercury free and potentially have a much longer lifetime in addition uv leds provide design flexibility due to their small size over the past decade deep uv leds with peak wavelength of 240 280 nm have been commercially available many studies have been reported using uv led to inactivate microorganisms such as different e coli strains chatterley and linden 2010 ibrahim et al 2014 li et al 2010 and phytoplankton choi et al 2009 uv leds can emit light at any peak wavelength with a very narrow distribution range on the contrary conventional lamps only emit light at 254 nm lp or over a broad range of wavelengths simultaneously mp this property of uv led enables the flexibility of customizing most effective wavelengths according to demand as for disinfection the absorbance spectrum of dna peaks at 260 nm vilhunen et al 2009 würtele et al 2011 which indicates uv254 emitted by lp lamp is not the most effective wavelength as suggested by chatterley and linden 2010 in addition another problem posed by single wavelength lp lamp is that many microorganisms reverse uv induced dna damage through photo repair and dark repair to address this issue a few researchers proposed to employ medium pressure uv lamps mp uv it was reported that mp uv could be more effective than low pressure lamp and irradiation with wavelengths from 300 to 580 nm was responsible for the reduction of photoreactivation oguma et al 2002 zimmer and slawson 2002 among the wavelengths in this range 365 nm was further reported to provide a better bactericidal effect chevremont et al 2012a b therefore it is possible that uva pre radiation might improve the disinfection effect of uvc process by suppressing bacterial photo or dark repair as reported by webb 1977 and poepping et al 2014 some researchers explored multiple wavelengths uv led disinfection processes chevremont et al 2012a b oguma et al 2013 instead of simultaneous combination of multiple wavelengths this study explored a sequential uva uvc disinfection of e coli strains the impacts of sequential uva uvc process on inactivation of four e coli strains and on photo repair and dark repair were revealed in this study three mechanisms were also proposed based on the fundamental principles of uva and uvc disinfection in terms of the mechanism for uvc germicidal effect cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers cpd formation was believed to be the main reason for uva radiation it is known that uva radiation alone could barely cause cpd formation jiang et al 2009 and it is recognized that cell damages by uva is mediated by reactive oxygen species ros such as hydroxyl radicals ros damage multicellular components like membrane protein and finally lead to cell death hirakawa et al 2003 in sequential uvc uva disinfection ros generated during uva pre radiation could enhance the sensitivity of uvc germicidal capability webb 1977 tyrrell and webb 1973 also reported inhibited dark repair after intensive uva pre radiation due to protein damage caused by ros hence the impact of ros was investigated to confirm the possible role of ros in the uva uvc process the second mechanism of uva pre radiation was that this sequential radiation could affect the final cpd formation through repair poepping et al 2014 found that sequential radiation of uv280 followed by uv228 showed synergistic inactivation performance due to bacteria undergoing simultaneous dna damage and repair similar results were reported by some other researchers johns et al 1962 pan et al 2012 on the other hand uva pre radiation was reported to inhibit the repair capacity of e coli under certain conditions in previous reported research eisenstark 1971 sedliakova et al 1987 the obvious differences of experimental setup and bacterial strains among these references eisenstark 1971 johns et al 1962 pan et al 2012 sedliakova et al 1987 make it difficult to directly conclude whether these two mechanisms are responsible for the synergistic or detrimental uv resistances observed in this study hence investigations on cpd formation after uv disinfection were designed to verify the hypothesis here the survival strategy of e coli to bypass dna damage via tolerance mechanisms namely translesion dna synthesis tls was reported in uv inactivation researches before lv et al 2013 sutton et al 2000 tls is directed by specialized dna polymerases that are able to synthesize new dna strands through bypassing a spectrum of template strand base damage thereby preventing stalled replication forks from collapse and possible cell death friedberg 2005 lv et al 2013 su and modrich 1986 sutton et al 2000 it is known that uv can activate tls survival strategy in e coli strains berney et al 2006 shah et al 2013 resulting in poorer disinfection performance tls might play a role in the coupled effect observed from sequential uva uvc treatment the objective of this research is to study the performance and mechanisms of the sequential uva uvc disinfection process the inactivation performance of the sequential uva uvc was investigated with four types of e coli strains and was compared with uva and uvc respectively the impacts of uva pre radiation on photo and dark repair capacity were studied as well furthermore to understand the role of uva pre radiation in depth the influence of uva pre radiation on dna damage and role of ros was also evaluated in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and chemicals the water used for all solutions and suspensions was treated by a milli q water purification system millipore synergy 185 us d mannitol 98 was purchased from sigma aldrich anti umud antibody rabbit polyclonal antiserum was from bio academia japan immun

rad singapore anti reca antibody was from abcam hongkong blocking reagent was prepared using 5 skim milk sigma aldrich 1 tween 20 sigma aldrich in tris buffered saline tbs sigma aldrich 2 2 e coli strains and bacteria enumeration four e coli strains were purchased from the american type culture collection atcc table 1 provided some characteristics of these strains among them e coli atcc 25922 is frequently used for disinfection and antibiotic studies e coli atcc 700891 contains famp plasmid which is antibiotic resistant e coli atcc 15597 and e coli atcc 700891 are reported to be very uv resistant quek and hu 2008 e coli atcc 15597 and e coli atcc 25922 were chosen as representatives to conduct the mechanism study since their uv sensitivity changed in an opposite manner after uva pre radiation overnight phase cultures were prepared by inoculating one colony from a corresponding master plate to 30 ml tryptic soy broth tsb and incubating overnight in a shaker with 150 rpm speed at 37 c to prepare log phase e coli 1 ml overnight phase was inoculated to 30 ml tsb solution and incubated in a shaker with 150 rpm speed for 4 h 37 c after incubation log phase solution was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min washed three times and re suspended in 30 ml sterile distilled water the resultant suspension was further diluted with sterile distilled water to yield a bacterial concentration of approximately 108 cfu ml which was determined by bacteria enumeration method as described in the following paragraph enumeration of e coli was performed using the spread plate method in brief samples were serially diluted with 0 9 nacl solution plated in duplicate on tryptic soy agar tsa and incubated for 24 h at 37 c after incubation the colonies on the plates were counted and the counts were averaged and recorded as cfu ml 2 3 disinfection experiments 15 ml e coli suspension was dispensed into 60 mm diameter petri dish with a water depth of 1 cm and exposed to 1 uva365 led radiation for a contact time of 20 min or 30 min 2 uvc265 led radiation for a contact time of 5 16 min or 3 a sequential radiation of uva365 20 min or 30 min uvc265 5 16 min from performance of sequential disinfection based on maximum coupled effects optimum uvc radiation times for each type of e coli were later selected for mechanism studies for all disinfection experiments a magnetic stirrer in e coli suspensions was powered at a speed of 3000 rpm which provided sufficient turbulence to ensure a homogeneous solution during exposure to uv light after disinfection the samples were evaluated by enumeration for each disinfection experiment it was repeated twice and the standard error was reflected as the error bar in result figures 2 3 1 uva led radiation setup the detailed information of uva led system was provided in our previous research xiong and hu 2013 briefly high power uva led lamps 3 w peak wavelength 365 nm set inc usa were applied and connected to serve as light source in this study eighteen lamps were connected as three in series six parallel groups and powered by a direct current dc power supply iso tech ips 2303 the lamps were adhered with thermal grease to the inner surface of a hollow aluminum cylinder 100 mm diameter and 60 mm height recycled cooling water at 25 c was pumped around the aluminum cylinder to protect the lamps from overheating light intensity was adjusted by changing the current of the dc power supply and measured by ilt1700 radiometer with a sed 033 probe international light technologies inc usa in this study the light intensity was fixed at 6 mw cm2 2 3 2 uvc led radiation setup uvc radiation setup is shown in fig 1 only one single led bulb ty uv265 to39h taoyuan electron hk linited was used this led bulb emitted uv light peaked at 265 nm the typical power output was about 0 7 mw with a current of 20 ma as the led bulb itself already had a heat sink housing there was no extra heat control provided in the experiment the experiment was performed at room temperature the current during experiment was strictly controlled at 20 0 1 ma the distance between led bulb and water surface was fixed at 7 mm with sufficient mixing such that the intensity received by the water bodies was relatively constant across all experiment runs the average uvc intensity was 0 127 mw cm2 the life test of uv265 led showed that the power output dropped quickly due to the technical limitations of led manufacture and its lit time was found to be less than 1000 hrs in order to minimize the impact of led aging on the intensity of uv light received by the water bodies during experiment period the led bulb was burned for 60 h to avoid the sharp power output drop at initial period secondly it was assumed that led could emit at constant intensity within 10 h for the experiments of comparing uvc resistance of different strains all experiments were finished within 10 h while for the experiments of comparing photo and dark repair capacity they were conducted within another 10 h 2 4 photo and dark repair 5 ml uv irradiated samples were pipetted into another petri dish for photo repair under fluorescent light at room temperature 20 2 c the light intensity for photo repair study was 10klx measured by model e2 b hagner ab sweden and the samples were taken at a 30 min interval for enumeration for 4 h another 5 ml samples were pipetted in a small bottle wrapped with aluminum foil to avoid light exposure for dark repair study samples were taken at a 2 h interval for enumeration for 4 h as well for each repair experiment it was repeated twice and the standard error was reflected as the error bar in result figures 2 5 impact of ros scavenger mannitol was reported to be used as scavenger of ros cho et al 2011 hamamoto et al 2007 li et al 2010 zhang et al 1997 in this study mannitol 98 sigma aldrich was dissolved in autoclaved di water and added into e coli suspensions to achieve a final concentration of 10 mmol ml it was reported that mannitol at this concentration could significantly reduce the impact generated by uva induced ros li et al 2010 zhang et al 1997 e coli suspensions with without mannitol were exposed to uvc or uva uvc to study the role of ros in the proposed sequential uv process the uv irradiated e coli suspensions were then sampled for enumeration 2 6 detection of cpd formation the cpd quantity of uv irradiated e coli strains were compared with cpd elisa firstly dna of the uv treated e coli strains were extracted with dneasy blood tissue kit qiagen following the operation manual after extraction dna samples were divided into multi portions and stored at 20 c to avoid repeated frozen warm up the exact experiments steps were conducted following the protocol from cosmobio company in brief the 96

the effect of uva irradiation on umud and reca protein which are core proteins involved in sos response of bacteria was determined by western blot using the anti umud antibody and anti reca antibody separately anti umud antibody and anti reca antibody were designed against a peptide target conserved in those proteins and had been widely adopted for detection of umud protein clerch et al 1996 and reca protein fridrichova et al 1992 to conduct western blot in brief equal amounts of e coli were washed with pbs and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was disposed and 1 ml of ice cold ripa buffer was added to re suspend the pellet the suspension was agitated at 4 c for 30 min and then was added 1 ml 2 laemmli sample buffer afterwards it was boiled at 95 100 c for 5 min lysates were stored at 20 c and centrifuged at 16000 rpm for 10 min before use equal amount of total proteins was loaded into the wells of precast gradient sds gel 4 20 bio rad and separated by sds page gel electrophoresis at 100 v and then electro blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane afterwards the blot was incubated in blocking reagent for 1 h followed by 1st antibody hybridization for 2 h 1st antibody was diluted 3000 in blocking reagent after washing with tbst the blot was then probed with 2nd antibody which was diluted 20 000 times with blocking reagent then the blot was washed with tbst at last the blots were developed in ecl substrate solution for 5 min finally the blots were scanned and analyzed with chemidoc mp system bio rad and image lab software bio rad to obtain the relative quantity of each sample 2 8 data analysis the bacterial reduction performance was evaluated by plate counting as described above and was represented by log reduction as shown in eq 1 the photo and dark repair efficiency was calculated with eq 2 1 l o g i n a c t i v a t i o n log n 0 n t where n0 is the initial concentration cfu ml nt is the concentration after disinfection cfu ml 2 l

inactivationt is the log reduction value after uv radiation and a period of time t of dark photo repair statistical analysis to compare two populations was performed with paired unpaired tests for multiple populations statistical analysis was performed with anova after statistical analysis was performed if p value 0 1 it indicates the difference was significant otherwise the difference was not 3 results and discussion 3 1 disinfection by uva365 and uvc265 uva and uvc inactivation of the selected strains under the experimental conditions were evaluated as shown in fig 2 the results presented that the resistance of these 4 strains to uvc265 in the following sequence e coli atcc 25922 e coli atcc 11229 e coli atcc 15597 e coli atcc 700891 this concurred with the results reported by quek et al quek and hu 2008 who compared the resistance of e coli atcc 11229 e coli atcc 15597 e coli atcc 700891 to low pressure uvc254 to achieve 4 log reduction the contact time ranged from 7 min to 16 min under this particular experiment setup e coli atcc 700891 is known as an antibiotic resistant ampicillin and streptomycin strain with famp plasmid and it was reported to be extremely uv resistant davies et al 2009 from the insert in fig 2 the inactivation of all 4 strains by uva alone was insignificant as the log inactivation brought by uva alone was less than 0 1 n 12 p 0 1 it is widely accepted that uv a365 alone barely inactivate bacteria under relatively low dosage vermeulen et al 2008 xiong and hu 2013 reported that the inactivation of e coli atcc 700891 by uva365 was almost undetectable with an intensity of 8 mw cm2 for 60 min in this research both the intensity and irradiation time were lower than those of xiong s research thus the inactivation by uva alone was considered negligible in the following discussion 3 2 disinfection by sequential uva uvc fig 3 presented the inactivation performance of the sequential uva uvc process for the four e coli strains compared with uvc radiation alone uva pre radiation enhanced the inactivation performances synergistic effect of e coli atcc 11229 e coli atcc 15597 and e coli atcc 700891by at least 0 5 log n 18 p 0 1 in other words these three strains became more sensitive to uvc after uva pre radiation even though uva radiation itself did not give direct inactivation however for e coli atcc 25922 uva pre radiation caused a performance decline adverse effect of at least 0 5 log indicating that it was more resistant to uvc after uva pre radiation n 5 p 0 1 for e coli atcc 15597 the 10 13 5 and 15 min uvc radiation inactivation performances were increased by 0 5 log 1 3 log and 0 9 log respectively after 20 min uva pre radiation similar trends were also found for e coli atcc 11229 and 700891 however for e coli atcc 25922 the inactivation performance was decreased by 0 5 log 1 2 log and 0 9 log after 5 6 and 6 5 min uvc radiation after 20 min uva pre radiation respectively it could be because long time uvc radiation obscured the impact of uva pre radiation on the other hand when uva pre radiation time was increased both the synergistic and the adverse effects were boosted as shown in fig 4 for e coli atcc 15597 11229 and 700891 30 min uva pre radiation promoted the inactivation performance by 2 log 1 log and 2 log respectively as compared to uvc only on the other hand a decline of inactivation performance by 1 3 log was observed after 30 min uva pre radiation of e coli atcc25922 in summary the introduction of uva pre radiation changed the uvc resistance of the four strains either negatively or positively 3 3 impact of uva pre radiation on photo and dark repair the photo and dark repair performance of four strains with or without uva pre radiation were studied and the results were presented in figs 5 and 6 as shown in fig 5 e coli atcc 15597 and 700891 showed stronger photo repair performance than e coli atcc 11229 and 25922 which in general agreed with the reported results by other researches guo et al 2012 quek and hu 2008 sanz et al 2007 in terms of the effect of uva pre radiation for all of the four e coli stains the photo repair performance was not significantly influenced by uva pre radiation n 23 p 0 1 the findings agreed with the results of webb 1977 in which it was found that uva pre radiation only with a dosage higher than 7 5 105 j cm2 could negatively impact the photo repair process by the formation of ros in this study the uva dosage was as low as 1 08 105 j cm2 and ros may not be strong enough to cause much damage in fig 6 it was found that dark repair capacities of the four strains were all significantly inhibited after uva pre radiation n 14 p 0 01 the percentage log repair of e coli 15597 after 2 h of dark repair decreased from 16 to 3 when the bacterial suspension were treated with uva pre radiation for other e coli strains 11229 700891 and 25922 the repair percentage dropped as well from 12 to 1 10 2 and 16 3 when the dark repair duration increased to 4 h the inhibition on repair by sequential disinfection treatment became more pronounced for all the strains except for 700891 some other researchers also reported the similar observation sedliakova et al 1987 2001 slezarikova et al 1996 tyrrell and webb 1973 webb 1977 3 4 mechanism studies the mechanism of the synergistic adverse effect from sequential uva uvc treatment in terms of inactivation performance and dark repair was studied three mechanism hypotheses were tested uva generated ros theory changes in cpd formation mechanism and the tls strategy the hypothesis for ros was first validated fig 7 presented the inactivation performances of e coli atcc 15597 and 25922 with and without the addition of mannitol from the graph the addition of mannitol as hydroxyl radical scavengers did not affect the inactivation performance of both e coli strains n 4 p 0 1 it indicated that neither the synergistic effect nor the adverse effect for log inactivation resulted from uva pre radiation was driven by ros process the ros hypothesis was suggested by webb 1977 it was reported that ros induced by uva damaged cell components assisting uvc to inactivate bacteria and to inhibit dark repair webb 1977 used extremely high uva dosage which alone could immediately inactivate bacteria while in this research uva dosage was only at sub lethal level therefore hydroxyl radicals were not responsible for the synergistic effect found in the sequential treatment since the hypothesis for ros was rejected the changes in cpd formation for the dna of e coli atcc 15597 and 25922 were investigated and evaluated by elisa and the results were shown in fig 8 from the figure no significant cpd was detected after uva while uvc alone was found to cause cpd formation very efficiently the difference of cpd formation between e coli atcc 15597 and 25922 by uvc alone was due to the different uvc radiation time and biological characteristics for e coli 15597 cpd amount with uva pre radiation was about 18 higher than that with uvc alone indicating that even though uva itself did not cause any cpd formation it did promote the cpd formation in the following uvc radiation n 3 p 0 1 the enhanced cpd formation coincides with the synergistic inactivation performance observed for e coli 15597 11229 and 70089 for e coli atcc 25922 uva pre radiation did not significantly increase cpd formation n 3 p 0 1 even though the log reduction with uva pre radiation was about 1 3 log lower than that of uvc alone the resultant higher cdp formation for e coli 15597 after sequential treatment might be due to inhibited repair by considering the facts that bacteria was able to repair by simultaneous cleavage of cpd during uv radiation poepping et al 2014 it was reported that uva radiation could also induce the reca gene expression booth et al 2001 a series of research results from sedliakova et al 1987 sedliakova et al 2001 slezarikova et al 1996 and fridrichova et al 1993 claimed that the overproducing of reca protein could inhibit repair since the premature of reca protein could combine with cpd and block the pathway of dark repair therefore the investigation on reca proteins with western blot was employed to quantify reca protein the western blot image was presented in supporting information and was processed with software image lab version 5 2 bio rad as shown in fig 9 the reca concentration after uva uvc and sequential uva uvc radiation was increased by 1 26 1 40 and 1 44 times for e coli 25922 and 1 43 1 5 and 2 13 times for e coli 15597 respectively for e coli 15597 reca protein level after uva uvc radiation was obviously higher than that after uvc radiation alone thus its final cpd level was also 18 higher it could be deduced that uva pre radiation limited cell repair leading to higher inactivation rate whereas for e coli 25922 its reca level was basically the same with or without uva pre radiation hence its final cpd level was also similar comparison of reca gene expression between 15597 and 25922 indicated that the increased cpd formation in 15597 caused by uva pre irradiation was due to overproducing of rec a lower level of cpd formation in 15597 could explain the synergistic effect found from sequential uva uvc treatment however it could not explain the adverse effect discovered in 25922 therefore a third hypothesis regarding tls strategy was tested during tls umud protein will be activated to its active form umud by removing 24 amino acids therefore if tls was enhanced after uva pre radiation umud protein would decline in view of this relation umud protein quantity was measured with western blot to confirm the role of tls in the synergy effect within e coli atcc15597 the umud protein was undetectable under all conditions while the umud protein in e coli atcc25922 was successfully detected by western blot as shown in supporting information its relative quantity was presented in fig 10 it was found that umud protein was only slightly reduced with uvc radiation alone specifically after uvc radiation only about 8 umud protein was processed to its active form umud however after uva alone and sequential uva uvc treatment 25 and 45 umud protein was processed to its active form respectively detection of umud protein indicated that e coli 25922 had a strong tls capacity and it could be enhanced by uva pre radiation hence a possible mechanism of the enhanced uv resistance of e coli atcc 25922 is that uva pre radiation activated tls response which significantly enhance the tolerance of e coli 25922 to dna damage it was shown that uv sensitive e coli strains showed higher tls capacity than uv resistant strains kuban et al 2012 in this research e coli 25922 was also the most uv sensitive strain therefore it was possible that the strong tls was a compensatory survival strategy for this sensitive strain 4 conclusions in this research a uva365 pre radiation followed by uvc265 radiation process with uv led as light sources was developed and evaluated using four e coli strains as bacterial pathogen indicators the results revealed that the responses to uva uvc process differed largely among these tested strains for e coli atcc 11229 15597 and 700891 increased uvc sensitivities were found after uva pre radiation coupled with appropriate dosages of uvc a 20 min uva pre radiation provided higher inactivation rates of e coli atcc 11229 15597 and 700891 by 1 2 1 4 and 1 2 times respectively than the sum of inactivation rates by uva alone and uvc alone on the contrary the inactivation of e coli atcc 25922 the most uvc sensitive strain decreased from 3 log to 1 8 log after uva pre radiation to understand the mechanisms responsible for the increased uv sensitivity and resistance after uva pre radiation ros and cpd formation were evaluated for representative strains of e coli atcc 15597 and atcc 25922 it was found that the increased uv sensitivity and resistance after uva pre radiation were driven by different mechanisms ros induced by uva pre radiation was found to be unessential in this case the increased uvc sensitivity of three strains was mainly due to the enhanced cpd formation in uvc radiation after uva pre radiation even though uva radiation itself could not cause cpd formation directly it accelerated cpd formation in the following uvc radiation uva sensitized the bacteria that consequently overproduced reca proteins thus it inhibited repair process during uvc and led to net increase of cpd formation on the other hand increased resistance of e coli atcc 25922 was explained by a survival strategy mechanism it was found that uva pre radiation activated the tls response which in turn made the bacteria more tolerable to dna damage in this study another benefit of the uva uvc system was found to inhibit dark repair capacity however the photo repair capabilities of all four strains remained unchanged currently uv is usually used as primary disinfection followed by chlorination disinfection the dosage of downstream disinfectant could be reduced if the dark repair capacity of bacteria could be disabled considering the price of uvc led is still hundredfold higher than that of uva led the synergistic effects observed could be practically valuable by cutting the overall cost down however more research should be conducted to confirm that the adverse effects are limited to the very sensitive strains acknowledgment this work was supported by the funding from maritime and port authority of singapore and national

19512,ultraviolet uv light emission diode led which is mercury free and theoretically more energy efficient has now become an alternative to conventional uv lamps in water disinfection industry in this research the disinfection performance of a novel sequential process uva365nm led followed by uvc265nm led uva uvc was evaluated the results revealed that the responses of different bacterial strains to uva uvc varied coupled with appropriate dosages of uvc a 20 min uva pre radiation provided higher inactivations log inactivation of e coli atcc 11229 15597 and 700891 by 1 2 1 4 and 1 2 times respectively than the sum of inactivations by uva alone and uvc alone on the contrary the inactivation of e coli atcc 25922 the most uvc sensitive strain decreased from 3 log to 1 8 log after uva pre radiation a 30 min uva pre radiation did not affect the photo repair capacity of the four strains n 23 p 0 1 but their dark repair ability was significantly inhibited n 14 p 0 05 mechanism study was conducted for two representative strains e coli atcc 15597 and 25922 to understand the observed effect the hypothesis that uva pre radiation promoted the yield of reactive oxygen species ros was rejected elisa results indicated that 18 more cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers cpd were formed in e coli atcc 15597 with uva pre radiation n 3 p 0 01 however the cpd levels of e coli atcc 25922 was the same with or without uva pre radiation n 3 p 0 01 considering the results of both dark repair and cpd formation it was concluded that the increased uv sensitivity of e coli 15597 was originated from the increased cpd for e coli atcc 25922 the enhanced uv resistance was attributed to the strain s adoption of a survival strategy translesion dna synthesis tls when triggered by uva pre radiation the study on umud protein which is a key protein during tls confirmed this hypothesis graphical abstract image 1 keywords sequential ultraviolet uv radiation light emitting diode led photo dark repair mechanism disinfection 1 introduction as an effective disinfection method ultraviolet uv light has been widely used in water and wastewater treatment industries most uv disinfection systems use low or medium pressure mercury lamps which contain toxic chemical mercury require significant amounts of energy and have a relatively short lifetime chevremont et al 2013 an attractive alternative uv source to traditional uv lamp is light emitting diodes leds which are mercury free and potentially have a much longer lifetime in addition uv leds provide design flexibility due to their small size over the past decade deep uv leds with peak wavelength of 240 280 nm have been commercially available many studies have been reported using uv led to inactivate microorganisms such as different e coli strains chatterley and linden 2010 ibrahim et al 2014 li et al 2010 and phytoplankton choi et al 2009 uv leds can emit light at any peak wavelength with a very narrow distribution range on the contrary conventional lamps only emit light at 254 nm lp or over a broad range of wavelengths simultaneously mp this property of uv led enables the flexibility of customizing most effective wavelengths according to demand as for disinfection the absorbance spectrum of dna peaks at 260 nm vilhunen et al 2009 würtele et al 2011 which indicates uv254 emitted by lp lamp is not the most effective wavelength as suggested by chatterley and linden 2010 in addition another problem posed by single wavelength lp lamp is that many microorganisms reverse uv induced dna damage through photo repair and dark repair to address this issue a few researchers proposed to employ medium pressure uv lamps mp uv it was reported that mp uv could be more effective than low pressure lamp and irradiation with wavelengths from 300 to 580 nm was responsible for the reduction of photoreactivation oguma et al 2002 zimmer and slawson 2002 among the wavelengths in this range 365 nm was further reported to provide a better bactericidal effect chevremont et al 2012a b therefore it is possible that uva pre radiation might improve the disinfection effect of uvc process by suppressing bacterial photo or dark repair as reported by webb 1977 and poepping et al 2014 some researchers explored multiple wavelengths uv led disinfection processes chevremont et al 2012a b oguma et al 2013 instead of simultaneous combination of multiple wavelengths this study explored a sequential uva uvc disinfection of e coli strains the impacts of sequential uva uvc process on inactivation of four e coli strains and on photo repair and dark repair were revealed in this study three mechanisms were also proposed based on the fundamental principles of uva and uvc disinfection in terms of the mechanism for uvc germicidal effect cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers cpd formation was believed to be the main reason for uva radiation it is known that uva radiation alone could barely cause cpd formation jiang et al 2009 and it is recognized that cell damages by uva is mediated by reactive oxygen species ros such as hydroxyl radicals ros damage multicellular components like membrane protein and finally lead to cell death hirakawa et al 2003 in sequential uvc uva disinfection ros generated during uva pre radiation could enhance the sensitivity of uvc germicidal capability webb 1977 tyrrell and webb 1973 also reported inhibited dark repair after intensive uva pre radiation due to protein damage caused by ros hence the impact of ros was investigated to confirm the possible role of ros in the uva uvc process the second mechanism of uva pre radiation was that this sequential radiation could affect the final cpd formation through repair poepping et al 2014 found that sequential radiation of uv280 followed by uv228 showed synergistic inactivation performance due to bacteria undergoing simultaneous dna damage and repair similar results were reported by some other researchers johns et al 1962 pan et al 2012 on the other hand uva pre radiation was reported to inhibit the repair capacity of e coli under certain conditions in previous reported research eisenstark 1971 sedliakova et al 1987 the obvious differences of experimental setup and bacterial strains among these references eisenstark 1971 johns et al 1962 pan et al 2012 sedliakova et al 1987 make it difficult to directly conclude whether these two mechanisms are responsible for the synergistic or detrimental uv resistances observed in this study hence investigations on cpd formation after uv disinfection were designed to verify the hypothesis here the survival strategy of e coli to bypass dna damage via tolerance mechanisms namely translesion dna synthesis tls was reported in uv inactivation researches before lv et al 2013 sutton et al 2000 tls is directed by specialized dna polymerases that are able to synthesize new dna strands through bypassing a spectrum of template strand base damage thereby preventing stalled replication forks from collapse and possible cell death friedberg 2005 lv et al 2013 su and modrich 1986 sutton et al 2000 it is known that uv can activate tls survival strategy in e coli strains berney et al 2006 shah et al 2013 resulting in poorer disinfection performance tls might play a role in the coupled effect observed from sequential uva uvc treatment the objective of this research is to study the performance and mechanisms of the sequential uva uvc disinfection process the inactivation performance of the sequential uva uvc was investigated with four types of e coli strains and was compared with uva and uvc respectively the impacts of uva pre radiation on photo and dark repair capacity were studied as well furthermore to understand the role of uva pre radiation in depth the influence of uva pre radiation on dna damage and role of ros was also evaluated in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and chemicals the water used for all solutions and suspensions was treated by a milli q water purification system millipore synergy 185 us d mannitol 98 was purchased from sigma aldrich anti umud antibody rabbit polyclonal antiserum was from bio academia japan immun

strains and bacteria enumeration four e coli strains were purchased from the american type culture collection atcc table 1 provided some characteristics of these strains among them e coli atcc 25922 is frequently used for disinfection and antibiotic studies e coli atcc 700891 contains famp plasmid which is antibiotic resistant e coli atcc 15597 and e coli atcc 700891 are reported to be very uv resistant quek and hu 2008 e coli atcc 15597 and e coli atcc 25922 were chosen as representatives to conduct the mechanism study since their uv sensitivity changed in an opposite manner after uva pre radiation overnight phase cultures were prepared by inoculating one colony from a corresponding master plate to 30 ml tryptic soy broth tsb and incubating overnight in a shaker with 150 rpm speed at 37 c to prepare log phase e coli 1 ml overnight phase was inoculated to 30 ml tsb solution and incubated in a shaker with 150 rpm speed for 4 h 37 c after incubation log phase solution was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min washed three times and re suspended in 30 ml sterile distilled water the resultant suspension was further diluted with sterile distilled water to yield a bacterial concentration of approximately 108 cfu ml which was determined by bacteria enumeration method as described in the following paragraph enumeration of e coli was performed using the spread plate method in brief samples were serially diluted with 0 9 nacl solution plated in duplicate on tryptic soy agar tsa and incubated for 24 h at 37 c after incubation the colonies on the plates were counted and the counts were averaged and recorded as cfu ml 2 3 disinfection experiments 15 ml e coli suspension was dispensed into 60 mm diameter petri dish with a water depth of 1 cm and exposed to 1 uva365 led radiation for a contact time of 20 min or 30 min 2 uvc265 led radiation for a contact time of 5 16 min or 3 a sequential radiation of uva365 20 min or 30 min uvc265 5 16 min from performance of sequential disinfection based on maximum coupled effects optimum uvc radiation times for each type of e coli were later selected for mechanism studies for all disinfection experiments a magnetic stirrer in e coli suspensions was powered at a speed of 3000 rpm which provided sufficient turbulence to ensure a homogeneous solution during exposure to uv light after disinfection the samples were evaluated by enumeration for each disinfection experiment it was repeated twice and the standard error was reflected as the error bar in result figures 2 3 1 uva led radiation setup the detailed information of uva led system was provided in our previous research xiong and hu 2013 briefly high power uva led lamps 3 w peak wavelength 365 nm set inc usa were applied and connected to serve as light source in this study eighteen lamps were connected as three in series six parallel groups and powered by a direct current dc power supply iso tech ips 2303 the lamps were adhered with thermal grease to the inner surface of a hollow aluminum cylinder 100 mm diameter and 60 mm height recycled cooling water at 25 c was pumped around the aluminum cylinder to protect the lamps from overheating light intensity was adjusted by changing the current of the dc power supply and measured by ilt1700 radiometer with a sed 033 probe international light technologies inc usa in this study the light intensity was fixed at 6 mw cm2 2 3 2 uvc led radiation setup uvc radiation setup is shown in fig 1 only one single led bulb ty uv265 to39h taoyuan electron hk linited was used this led bulb emitted uv light peaked at 265 nm the typical power output was about 0 7 mw with a current of 20 ma as the led bulb itself already had a heat sink housing there was no extra heat control provided in the experiment the experiment was performed at room temperature the current during experiment was strictly controlled at 20 0 1 ma the distance between led bulb and water surface was fixed at 7 mm with sufficient mixing such that the intensity received by the water bodies was relatively constant across all experiment runs the average uvc intensity was 0 127 mw cm2 the life test of uv265 led showed that the power output dropped quickly due to the technical limitations of led manufacture and its lit time was found to be less than 1000 hrs in order to minimize the impact of led aging on the intensity of uv light received by the water bodies during experiment period the led bulb was burned for 60 h to avoid the sharp power output drop at initial period secondly it was assumed that led could emit at constant intensity within 10 h for the experiments of comparing uvc resistance of different strains all experiments were finished within 10 h while for the experiments of comparing photo and dark repair capacity they were conducted within another 10 h 2 4 photo and dark repair 5 ml uv irradiated samples were pipetted into another petri dish for photo repair under fluorescent light at room temperature 20 2 c the light intensity for photo repair study was 10klx measured by model e2 b hagner ab sweden and the samples were taken at a 30 min interval for enumeration for 4 h another 5 ml samples were pipetted in a small bottle wrapped with aluminum foil to avoid light exposure for dark repair study samples were taken at a 2 h interval for enumeration for 4 h as well for each repair experiment it was repeated twice and the standard error was reflected as the error bar in result figures 2 5 impact of ros scavenger mannitol was reported to be used as scavenger of ros cho et al 2011 hamamoto et al 2007 li et al 2010 zhang et al 1997 in this study mannitol 98 sigma aldrich was dissolved in autoclaved di water and added into e coli suspensions to achieve a final concentration of 10 mmol ml it was reported that mannitol at this concentration could significantly reduce the impact generated by uva induced ros li et al 2010 zhang et al 1997 e coli suspensions with without mannitol were exposed to uvc or uva uvc to study the role of ros in the proposed sequential uv process the uv irradiated e coli suspensions were then sampled for enumeration 2 6 detection of cpd formation the cpd quantity of uv irradiated e coli strains were compared with cpd elisa firstly dna of the uv treated e coli strains were extracted with dneasy blood tissue kit qiagen following the operation manual after extraction dna samples were divided into multi portions and stored at 20 c to avoid repeated frozen warm up the exact experiments steps were conducted following the protocol from cosmobio company in brief the 96

each well was determined by a spectrophotometer sunrise tecan the absorbance at 492 nm was positively proportional to the concentration of cpd 2 7 detection of umud and reca protein by western blot the effect of uva irradiation on umud and reca protein which are core proteins involved in sos response of bacteria was determined by western blot using the anti umud antibody and anti reca antibody separately anti umud antibody and anti reca antibody were designed against a peptide target conserved in those proteins and had been widely adopted for detection of umud protein clerch et al 1996 and reca protein fridrichova et al 1992 to conduct western blot in brief equal amounts of e coli were washed with pbs and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was disposed and 1 ml of ice cold ripa buffer was added to re suspend the pellet the suspension was agitated at 4 c for 30 min and then was added 1 ml 2 laemmli sample buffer afterwards it was boiled at 95 100 c for 5 min lysates were stored at 20 c and centrifuged at 16000 rpm for 10 min before use equal amount of total proteins was loaded into the wells of precast gradient sds gel 4 20 bio rad and separated by sds page gel electrophoresis at 100 v and then electro blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane afterwards the blot was incubated in blocking reagent for 1 h followed by 1st antibody hybridization for 2 h 1st antibody was diluted 3000 in blocking reagent after washing with tbst the blot was then probed with 2nd antibody which was diluted 20 000 times with blocking reagent then the blot was washed with tbst at last the blots were developed in ecl substrate solution for 5 min finally the blots were scanned and analyzed with chemidoc mp system bio rad and image lab software bio rad to obtain the relative quantity of each sample 2 8 data analysis the bacterial reduction performance was evaluated by plate counting as described above and was represented by log reduction as shown in eq 1 the

multiple populations statistical analysis was performed with anova after statistical analysis was performed if p value 0 1 it indicates the difference was significant otherwise the difference was not 3 results and discussion 3 1 disinfection by uva365 and uvc265 uva and uvc inactivation of the selected strains under the experimental conditions were evaluated as shown in fig 2 the results presented that the resistance of these 4 strains to uvc265 in the following sequence e coli atcc 25922 e coli atcc 11229 e coli atcc 15597 e coli atcc 700891 this concurred with the results reported by quek et al quek and hu 2008 who compared the resistance of e coli atcc 11229 e coli atcc 15597 e coli atcc 700891 to low pressure uvc254 to achieve 4 log reduction the contact time ranged from 7 min to 16 min under this particular experiment setup e coli atcc 700891 is known as an antibiotic resistant ampicillin and streptomycin strain with famp plasmid and it was reported to be extremely uv resistant davies et al 2009 from the insert in fig 2 the inactivation of all 4 strains by uva alone was insignificant as the log inactivation brought by uva alone was less than 0 1 n 12 p 0 1 it is widely accepted that uv a365 alone barely inactivate bacteria under relatively low dosage vermeulen et al 2008 xiong and hu 2013 reported that the inactivation of e coli atcc 700891 by uva365 was almost undetectable with an intensity of 8 mw cm2 for 60 min in this research both the intensity and irradiation time were lower than those of xiong s research thus the inactivation by uva alone was considered negligible in the following discussion 3 2 disinfection by sequential uva uvc fig 3 presented the inactivation performance of the sequential uva uvc process for the four e coli strains compared with uvc radiation alone uva pre radiation enhanced the inactivation performances synergistic effect of e coli atcc 11229 e coli atcc 15597 and e coli atcc 700891by at least 0 5 log n 18 p 0 1 in other words these three strains became more sensitive to uvc after uva pre radiation even though uva radiation itself did not give direct inactivation however for e coli atcc 25922 uva pre radiation caused a performance decline adverse effect of at least 0 5 log indicating that it was more resistant to uvc after uva pre radiation n 5 p 0 1 for e coli atcc 15597 the 10 13 5 and 15 min uvc radiation inactivation performances were increased by 0 5 log 1 3 log and 0 9 log respectively after 20 min uva pre radiation similar trends were also found for e coli atcc 11229 and 700891 however for e coli atcc 25922 the inactivation performance was decreased by 0 5 log 1 2 log and 0 9 log after 5 6 and 6 5 min uvc radiation after 20 min uva pre radiation respectively it could be because long time uvc radiation obscured the impact of uva pre radiation on the other hand when uva pre radiation time was increased both the synergistic and the adverse effects were boosted as shown in fig 4 for e coli atcc 15597 11229 and 700891 30 min uva pre radiation promoted the inactivation performance by 2 log 1 log and 2 log respectively as compared to uvc only on the other hand a decline of inactivation performance by 1 3 log was observed after 30 min uva pre radiation of e coli atcc25922 in summary the introduction of uva pre radiation changed the uvc resistance of the four strains either negatively or positively 3 3 impact of uva pre radiation on photo and dark repair the photo and dark repair performance of four strains with or without uva pre radiation were studied and the results were presented in figs 5 and 6 as shown in fig 5 e coli atcc 15597 and 700891 showed stronger photo repair performance than e coli atcc 11229 and 25922 which in general agreed with the reported results by other researches guo et al 2012 quek and hu 2008 sanz et al 2007 in terms of the effect of uva pre radiation for all of the four e coli stains the photo repair performance was not significantly influenced by uva pre radiation n 23 p 0 1 the findings agreed with the results of webb 1977 in which it was found that uva pre radiation only with a dosage higher than 7 5 105 j cm2 could negatively impact the photo repair process by the formation of ros in this study the uva dosage was as low as 1 08 105 j cm2 and ros may not be strong enough to cause much damage in fig 6 it was found that dark repair capacities of the four strains were all significantly inhibited after uva pre radiation n 14 p 0 01 the percentage log repair of e coli 15597 after 2 h of dark repair decreased from 16 to 3 when the bacterial suspension were treated with uva pre radiation for other e coli strains 11229 700891 and 25922 the repair percentage dropped as well from 12 to 1 10 2 and 16 3 when the dark repair duration increased to 4 h the inhibition on repair by sequential disinfection treatment became more pronounced for all the strains except for 700891 some other researchers also reported the similar observation sedliakova et al 1987 2001 slezarikova et al 1996 tyrrell and webb 1973 webb 1977 3 4 mechanism studies the mechanism of the synergistic adverse effect from sequential uva uvc treatment in terms of inactivation performance and dark repair was studied three mechanism hypotheses were tested uva generated ros theory changes in cpd formation mechanism and the tls strategy the hypothesis for ros was first validated fig 7 presented the inactivation performances of e coli atcc 15597 and 25922 with and without the addition of mannitol from the graph the addition of mannitol as hydroxyl radical scavengers did not affect the inactivation performance of both e coli strains n 4 p 0 1 it indicated that neither the synergistic effect nor the adverse effect for log inactivation resulted from uva pre radiation was driven by ros process the ros hypothesis was suggested by webb 1977 it was reported that ros induced by uva damaged cell components assisting uvc to inactivate bacteria and to inhibit dark repair webb 1977 used extremely high uva dosage which alone could immediately inactivate bacteria while in this research uva dosage was only at sub lethal level therefore hydroxyl radicals were not responsible for the synergistic effect found in the sequential treatment since the hypothesis for ros was rejected the changes in cpd formation for the dna of e coli atcc 15597 and 25922 were investigated and evaluated by elisa and the results were shown in fig 8 from the figure no significant cpd was detected after uva while uvc alone was found to cause cpd formation very efficiently the difference of cpd formation between e coli atcc 15597 and 25922 by uvc alone was due to the different uvc radiation time and biological characteristics for e coli 15597 cpd amount with uva pre radiation was about 18 higher than that with uvc alone indicating that even though uva itself did not cause any cpd formation it did promote the cpd formation in the following uvc radiation n 3 p 0 1 the enhanced cpd formation coincides with the synergistic inactivation performance observed for e coli 15597 11229 and 70089 for e coli atcc 25922 uva pre radiation did not significantly increase cpd formation n 3 p 0 1 even though the log reduction with uva pre radiation was about 1 3 log lower than that of uvc alone the resultant higher cdp formation for e coli 15597 after sequential treatment might be due to inhibited repair by considering the facts that bacteria was able to repair by simultaneous cleavage of cpd during uv radiation poepping et al 2014 it was reported that uva radiation could also induce the reca gene expression booth et al 2001 a series of research results from sedliakova et al 1987 sedliakova et al 2001 slezarikova et al 1996 and fridrichova et al 1993 claimed that the overproducing of reca protein could inhibit repair since the premature of reca protein could combine with cpd and block the pathway of dark repair therefore the investigation on reca proteins with western blot was employed to quantify reca protein the western blot image was presented in supporting information and was processed with software image lab version 5 2 bio rad as shown in fig 9 the reca concentration after uva uvc and sequential uva uvc radiation was increased by 1 26 1 40 and 1 44 times for e coli 25922 and 1 43 1 5 and 2 13 times for e coli 15597 respectively for e coli 15597 reca protein level after uva uvc radiation was obviously higher than that after uvc radiation alone thus its final cpd level was also 18 higher it could be deduced that uva pre radiation limited cell repair leading to higher inactivation rate whereas for e coli 25922 its reca level was basically the same with or without uva pre radiation hence its final cpd level was also similar comparison of reca gene expression between 15597 and 25922 indicated that the increased cpd formation in 15597 caused by uva pre irradiation was due to overproducing of rec a lower level of cpd formation in 15597 could explain the synergistic effect found from sequential uva uvc treatment however it could not explain the adverse effect discovered in 25922 therefore a third hypothesis regarding tls strategy was tested during tls umud protein will be activated to its active form umud by removing 24 amino acids therefore if tls was enhanced after uva pre radiation umud protein would decline in view of this relation umud protein quantity was measured with western blot to confirm the role of tls in the synergy effect within e coli atcc15597 the umud protein was undetectable under all conditions while the umud protein in e coli atcc25922 was successfully detected by western blot as shown in supporting information its relative quantity was presented in fig 10 it was found that umud protein was only slightly reduced with uvc radiation alone specifically after uvc radiation only about 8 umud protein was processed to its active form umud however after uva alone and sequential uva uvc treatment 25 and 45 umud protein was processed to its active form respectively detection of umud protein indicated that e coli 25922 had a strong tls capacity and it could be enhanced by uva pre radiation hence a possible mechanism of the enhanced uv resistance of e coli atcc 25922 is that uva pre radiation activated tls response which significantly enhance the tolerance of e coli 25922 to dna damage it was shown that uv sensitive e coli strains showed higher tls capacity than uv resistant strains kuban et al 2012 in this research e coli 25922 was also the most uv sensitive strain therefore it was possible that the strong tls was a compensatory survival strategy for this sensitive strain 4 conclusions in this research a uva365 pre radiation followed by uvc265 radiation process with uv led as light sources was developed and evaluated using four e coli strains as bacterial pathogen indicators the results revealed that the responses to uva uvc process differed largely among these tested strains for e coli atcc 11229 15597 and 700891 increased uvc sensitivities were found after uva pre radiation coupled with appropriate dosages of uvc a 20 min uva pre radiation provided higher inactivation rates of e coli atcc 11229 15597 and 700891 by 1 2 1 4 and 1 2 times respectively than the sum of inactivation rates by uva alone and uvc alone on the contrary the inactivation of e coli atcc 25922 the most uvc sensitive strain decreased from 3 log to 1 8 log after uva pre radiation to understand the mechanisms responsible for the increased uv sensitivity and resistance after uva pre radiation ros and cpd formation were evaluated for representative strains of e coli atcc 15597 and atcc 25922 it was found that the increased uv sensitivity and resistance after uva pre radiation were driven by different mechanisms ros induced by uva pre radiation was found to be unessential in this case the increased uvc sensitivity of three strains was mainly due to the enhanced cpd formation in uvc radiation after uva pre radiation even though uva radiation itself could not cause cpd formation directly it accelerated cpd formation in the following uvc radiation uva sensitized the bacteria that consequently overproduced reca proteins thus it inhibited repair process during uvc and led to net increase of cpd formation on the other hand increased resistance of e coli atcc 25922 was explained by a survival strategy mechanism it was found that uva pre radiation activated the tls response which in turn made the bacteria more tolerable to dna damage in this study another benefit of the uva uvc system was found to inhibit dark repair capacity however the photo repair capabilities of all four strains remained unchanged currently uv is usually used as primary disinfection followed by chlorination disinfection the dosage of downstream disinfectant could be reduced if the dark repair capacity of bacteria could be disabled considering the price of uvc led is still hundredfold higher than that of uva led the synergistic effects observed could be practically valuable by cutting the overall cost down however more research should be conducted to confirm that the adverse effects are limited to the very sensitive strains acknowledgment this work was supported by the funding from maritime and port authority of singapore and national

19513,up to now only a few studies about microparticle contamination of bottled mineral water have been published the smallest analysed particle size was 5 μm however due to toxicological reasons especially microparticles smaller than 1 5 μm are critically discussed therefore in the present study 32 samples of bottled mineral water were investigated for contamination by microplastics pigment and additive particles due to the application of aluminium coated polycarbonate membrane filters and micro raman spectroscopy a lowest analysed particle size of 1 μm was achieved microplastics were found in water from all bottle types in single use and reusable bottles made of poly ethylene terephthalate pet as well as in glass bottles the amount of microplastics in mineral water varied from 2649 2857 per litre in single use pet bottles up to 6292 10521 per litre in glass bottles while in plastic bottles the predominant polymer type was pet in glass bottles various polymers such as polyethylene or styrene butadiene copolymer were found hence besides the packaging itself other contamination sources have to be considered pigment particles were detected in high amounts in reusable paper labelled bottles 195047 330810 pigment particles per litre in glass and 23594 25518 pigment particles per litre in reusable paper labelled pet bottles pigment types found in water samples were the same as used for label printing indicating the bottle cleaning process as possible contamination route furthermore on average 708 1024 particles per litre of the additive tris 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphite were found in reusable pet bottles this additive might be leached out from the bottle material itself over 90 of the detected microplastics and pigment particles were smaller than 5 μm and thus not covered by previous studies in summary this is the first study reporting about microplastics pigment and additive particles found in bottled mineral water samples with a smallest analysed particle size of 1 μm graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastics pigments bottled mineral water micro raman spectroscopy food abbreviations cv coefficient of variation μ ftir

introduction since the first reports about small plastic pieces in oceans in the early 1970s carpenter et al 1972 carpenter and smith 1972 a lot of studies have been published investigating the abundance of so called microplastics in different environmental compartments auta et al 2017 eerkes medrano et al 2015 horton et al 2017 microplastics are small plastic pieces with a size below 5 mm besides these plastics coloured polymer particles as well as pure pigment particles were also detected imhof et al 2016 lenz et al 2015 it has been shown that various animals ingest plastics instead of or with their food ivar do sul and costa 2014 wright et al 2013 hence toxicological risks resulting from the intake of these particles are discussed covering three main topics the particles themselves polymer additives and adsorbed contaminants browne et al 2008 2013 particles themselves may cause inner abrasions or blockage of the gastro intestinal system of animals wright et al 2013 small particles might translocate into body tissues and cause harm browne et al 2008 with the smallest size fraction 1 5 μm being more likely to penetrate deeply into organs efsa 2016 yoo et al 2011 furthermore chemicals such as additives and contaminants which adhere to particles might be leached out after oral intake of the particles browne et al 2013 regarding pigments primarily metals might leach out from the particles imhof et al 2016 since the detection of microplastics in commercial seafood li et al 2015 van cauwenberghe and janssen 2014 the issue of a potential contamination of foods with microplastics became increasingly important studies were performed about the occurrence of microplastics in german beer liebezeit and liebezeit 2013 honey and sugar liebezeit and liebezeit 2014 table salts karami et al 2017 yang et al 2015 drinking and mineral water mintenig et al 2014 schymanski et al 2018 in all of the above named studies separation of particles from food matrix was realised via filtration and particle analysis was performed on the filter surface depending on the food type sample pre treatment with nitric acid van cauwenberghe and janssen 2014 or hydrogen peroxide seafood honey and partly table salts li et al 2015 liebezeit and liebezeit 2013 yang et al 2015 was necessary to digest organic material particle identification was performed in various ways visual identification with a microscope partly after colouring liebezeit and liebezeit 2013 2014 micro fourier transform infrared spectroscopy μ ftir li et al 2015 mintenig et al 2014 yang et al 2015 or micro raman spectroscopy karami et al 2017 schymanski et al 2018 the spectroscopic methods were either used after visual pre sorting of particles or spectra were generated for all detected particles the results of some of these studies were critically discussed due to the analytical methods applied there was a lack in the prevention of blank values and the clear identification of the potential microplastics efsa 2016 lachenmeier et al 2015 however among the methods used in the above mentioned studies μ ftir and micro raman spectroscopy showed to be adequate for conclusive polymer identification whereas μ ftir is usable to identify particles greater than 10 μm micro raman spectroscopy enables analysis down to a particle size of 1 μm käppler et al 2016 wiesheu et al 2016 and schymanski et al 2018 showed the applicability of micro raman spectroscopy to the analysis of beverages beer and mineral water for microplastics while in the first paper only one mineral water sample was analysed the second one shows the results for 38 mineral water samples the highest amount of microplastics 241 particles l was found in a reusable bottle made of poly ethylene terephthalate pet however microparticles smaller than 5 μm were not analysed regarding toxicological risks for humans after the oral intake of microplastics especially small particles are of particular concern efsa 2016 the aim of the present study was to investigate mineral water samples for microparticle contamination including the particle size larger than 1 μm therefore micro raman spectroscopy was combined with special newly developed aluminium coated polycarbonate membrane filters oβmann et al 2017 thus even microparticles in a size of 1 μm could be visualized and clearly identified 32 bottled mineral water samples from three different packaging types single and reusable bottles made of pet and glass bottles were analysed for microparticle contamination in addition to microplastics we extended our investigation to pigmented and additive particles 2 materials and methods 2 1 precautions to avoid sample contamination to avoid contamination by air all steps of sample preparation were performed in a laminar flow box clean room class iso 5 after en din iso 14644 1 spetec gmbh and filter membranes were stored in closed glass petri dishes after sample preparation all persons wore lab coats made of cotton for analytical procedures only ultrapure water veolia water solutions and technologies purelab flex 0 2 μm filtered was used all added solutions were filtered through a syringe membrane filter cellulose acetate 0 2 μm ge healthcare life sciences whatman prior to use hardware made of plastics was avoided to be used whenever possible glassware was treated for 15 min with sodium dodecyl sulphate solution 0 3 g l prepared from sds applichem panreac itw companies 99 0 2 μm filtered in an ultrasonic bath this detergent proved to be more suitable in removing microplastics from the glass surface then pure water afterwards glassware was rinsed once with ethanol 50 v v ultrapure water ethanol absolute fisher chemical 99 8 and three times with ultrapure water in the laminar flow box 2 2 samples 32 samples from 21 different brands of mineral water were purchased in bavarian food stores twelve samples were packaged in reusable bottles made of poly ethylene terephthalate pet ten samples in single use bottles made of pet and ten samples in glass bottles including one single use and nine reusable glass bottles among the reusable pet bottles four pairs of a newish and a frequently reused bottle were analysed the pairs were from the same batch each and belonged to three different brands newish bottles were differentiated from older ones based on the frequency of scratches on the outside of the bottles and the cloudiness of the bottle material which both enhance during reutilisation the characteristics of all samples such as the bottle type or volume are summed up in table s1 in the supplementary data 2 3 sample preparation after removing the labels all bottles were cleaned thoroughly with detergent and rinsed with deionized water to avoid sample contamination via the outside of the bottles before opening bottles were allowed to dry in a laminar flow box each sample was mixed by inverting the bottle and then transferred into a precleaned erlenmeyer flask depending on the content of calcium and magnesium ions in the sample as listed on the labelling of water samples an equimolar amount of an ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid tetrasodium salt edta solution 250 g l prepared from edta tetrahydrat fluka 99 0 2 μm filtered was added and the sample was left to stay for 15 min particles consisting of calcium or magnesium carbonate got dissolved by complexing these cations with edta accordingly the total particle number was reduced leading to decrease in the measurement time afterwards 3 ml of a sodium dodecyl sulphate sds solution 100 g l prepared from sds applichem panreac itw companies 99 0 2 μm filtered were added per litre sample prior tests showed that plastic particles could be suspended easier by adding this detergent resulting in a higher sample homogeneity oβmann et al 2017 to obtain analysable particle numbers on the filter surface samples were mixed and an aliquot of 250 ml of the initial sample volume was filtered via vacuum through an aluminium coated polycarbonate membrane filter as described by oβmann et al 2017 pore size 0 4 μm filtration unit msscientific kg13b 500 filtration area 113 mm2 the funnel of the filtration unit was first rinsed with 5 ml ethanol 50 to destroy foam v v ultrapure water ethanol absolute fisher chemical 99 8 and then continuously with ultrapure water subsequently filters were immobilized and flattened using two rings of metal und a microscope slide in this way the microscopic focus on the flat filter surface and particle locations remained constant oβmann et al 2017 to avoid contamination filters were stored in closed glass petri dishes water samples were analysed in blocks within each block one blank value was analysed to check for sample contamination in total seven blanks were evaluated blank values were prepared in a similar way like water samples 0 5 l of ultrapure water was mixed with 2 5 ml of edta 250 g l solution after a waiting time of 15 min 1 5 ml sds solution 100 g l were added due to the added chemicals and the absence of buffering capacity unlike in mineral water the ph value of this solution is so basic that the aluminium layer of the membrane filter would be destroyed to prevent this the ph value was adjusted to 7 by adding hydrochloric acid 25 bernd kraft p a 0 2 μm filtered 250 ml of the initial sample volume were filtered as described above 2 4 micro raman spectroscopy 2 4 1 identification of microplastics after the sample preparation particles were analysed directly on the filter surface with micro raman spectroscopy using an xplora plus system operated by labspec 6 software horiba scientific the raman system was equipped with two lasers 532 nm and 785 nm and a cooled charge coupled device ccd detector gratings with 600 grooves mm 1200 grooves mm or 1800 grooves mm were used the confocal hole width was set to 300 μm the confocal slit width to 100 μm system calibration was performed by zero order correction of the grating and additionally on the 520 7 cm 1 peak of a silicon wafer as the identification of all particles on the whole filter surface 113 mm2 would be extremely time consuming referring to imhof et al 2016 five spots of 1 mm2 were examined for each sample resulting in an analysed sample area of 4 4 on each site an image montage 1 mm 1 mm was recorded with a camera infinity 3 lumenera using a 50 objective olympus mplann 50 0 75 bd in dark field illumination reflected light an example of an image montage as well as the locations of the spots are displayed in figs s1 and s2 in the supplementary data on these image montages all particles greater or equal than 1 μm were analysed with the particle finder module of the software as shown in a previous publication oβmann et al 2017 first the size and coordinates were documented for each particle by image analysis second raman spectra were recorded for all particles with one laser 532 nm 600 grooves mm and 3 2 mw at the sample 2 1 s spectrum range was set from 150 cm 1 to 3500 cm 1 intensity correction algorithm of labspec 6 was applied to get a better comparability of recorded spectra with a data base biorad knowitall informatics system horiba edition for some samples due to high particle numbers the analysed areas of 1 mm2 had to be divided into 3 or 4 smaller image montages for the calculation the results were summed up to each mm2 most particles showed no straight spectral baseline e g background caused by light fluorescence which was corrected by subtracting a polynomial baseline however a few particles showed high fluorescence for these particles raman spectra were recorded manually with a second laser 785 nm 5 3 mw at the sample 600 grooves mm or 1200 grooves mm resulting in evaluable spectra in most cases the acquisition time and the number of accumulations were set individually for each measurement spectra could not be compared automatically with a database to simplify analysis all spectra were screened for plastics using classical least squares algorithm cls a mathematical process based on beer s law workman and howard 2010 and a software option of labspec 6 the evaluation with cls was supported by microsoft excel 2010 spectra of different synthetic polymers polyamide nylon 6 pa polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polycarbonate pc poly ethylene terephthalate pet and poly vinyl chloride pvc were set as standard references furthermore spectra of other materials present in the samples e g colours were used as reference after confirming their identities with a database each measured spectrum was calculated as the sum of all references and the theoretical composition was displayed in this way spectra similar to a reference were highlighted if a spectrum showed to be a mixture of two or more references all of them were highlighted in fig s3 an example for the analysis with cls is shown in order to avoid missing of unknown substances which were not set as reference and false positive effects the results of cls were checked manually again unknown substances were identified by comparing with spectra from a database although a review of the results was necessary cls simplified data evaluation and decreased analytics time considerably some spectra appeared to be polymeric but were not clearly recognizable e g due to low intensity high noise or interference with non polymeric spectra for these particles manual remeasurement with adjusted values for acquisition time and accumulation runs was performed partially the application of a grating with a higher number of grooves mm was necessary to achieve conclusive spectra particles might also consist of several components which adhere together in such cases raman mapping of single particles was recorded using a step size of 1 μm to check their position dependent composition the number of the identified particles was classified in four groups depending on their size 1 5 μm 1 5 μm to 5 μm 5 μm to 10 μm and 10 μm 2 4 2 identification of colours on paper labels colours used for the printing of paper labels from four different brands of mineral water packed in glass bottles and from two different brands of reusable pet bottles were identified using micro raman spectroscopy labels were removed from the bottles and analysed directly with the raman system described in section 2 4 1 images were recorded in bright field illumination reflected light and raman parameters were set individually for each measurement identification of the colour spectra was performed by comparing with spectra from a database these findings were further confirmed by comparing with spectra of several pigments heubach gmbh germany pigment blue 15 pb15 heuco blue 515400 heuco blue 515303 pigment violet 23 pv23 aquis violet 90230 heucosperse i vs 1621 e and pigment yellow 83 py83 monolite yellow 108304 2 5 calculation as described in sections 2 3 and 2 4 1 for each sample a volume of 250 ml was filtered and five spots of 1 mm2 were analysed for particles to get better comparability with other studies detected particle numbers were extrapolated to 1 l mineral water assuming an even particle distribution in the initial sample and over the filter surface we multiplied the particle number detected on the analysed area of 5 mm2 by 22 6 to calculate the total number of particles on the filter surface and again by 4 to calculate the number of particles in 1 l mineral water the limitations caused by this extrapolation are discussed in section 4 4 1 3 results 3 1 microplastics the results for microplastics in mineral water samples depending on the bottle type are summed up in figs 1 3 fig 1 shows the mean number of microplastics projected to 1 l sample volume fig 2 exhibits the particle size distribution in percent in fig 3 the distribution of the polymer type is displayed detailed results for all samples are shown in figs s4a blank samples s5 single use pet bottles s6 reusable pet bottles and s7 glass bottles in the supplementary data 3 1 1 blank samples although we took several precautions to avoid contamination of the samples with microplastics we were not able to prevent contamination completely on average 384 468 microplastics l were found in blank samples fig 1 consisting mainly of pp some of ps pe and pet fig s4a we did not find pc particles in the blank values but as the filter membranes were made of pc and as only single particles of this material were detected in the water samples we excluded pc from the results schymanski et al 2018 3 1 2 mineral water microplastics were detected in almost all bottled water samples they showed very different amounts of microplastics figs s5 s7 resulting in a high uncertainty per bottle type water from single use pet bottles displayed the lowest amount with 2649 2857 microplastics l water from reusable pet bottles contained on average 4889 5432 microplastics l and water from glass bottles 6292 10521 microplastics l fig 1 the highest amount of microplastics was detected in one of the glass bottles 35436 microplastics l sample g1 in fig s7 when removing this outlier a mean value of 3074 2531 microplastics l for water from glass bottles was calculated which is in the range of single use pet bottles in the four newish reusable pet bottles sample r4n r5n r6n and r7n similar amounts as in single use pet bottles 2689 4371 microplastics l were detected whereas obviously higher amounts 8339 7043 microplastics l were measured in the corresponding older bottles sample r4o r5o r6o and r7o regarding the material of the particles solely the number of pet particles was increasing see fig s6 the size distribution of microplastics fig 2 is very similar for single use and reusable pet bottles over 95 of the plastic particles were smaller than 5 μm and even about 50 were smaller than 1 5 μm in glass bottles larger particles 15 were 5 μm and 10 μm and 7 10 μm occurred more frequently in water from bottles made of pet single use and reusable most microplastics showed the spectrum of pet partly interfered by an olefinic or a pigment spectrum by contrast in water from glass bottles pe 46 pp 23 and a styrene butadiene copolymer 14 were the predominant polymer types fig 3 as already mentioned above several pet particles also showed characteristic bands of pigments or olefinic bands some of these particles were investigated with raman mapping to check their spatial composition in fig 4 the results are shown for a particle consisting of pet and pb15 characteristic spectral bands of pet were detected on every measuring point pb 15 could only be verified at a part of the particle indicating that two particles of different material were stacked together in this case in samples with olefinic interference e g sample s1 high numbers of particles with raman spectra similar to erucamide were also found data not shown this olefinic interference might be caused by adherence of this substance to plastic particles 3 2 pigmented particles the mean number of pigmented particles their size distribution and the distribution of the pigment types are shown in figs 5 7 respectively figs s4b blank samples s8 single use pet bottles s9 reusable pet bottles and s10 glass bottles exhibit further detailed results about detected pigmented particles for all samples samples showed very different amounts of pigmented particles figs s8 s10 resulting in a high uncertainty per bottle type 3 2 1 blank samples in blank samples we found 554 477 pigmented particles l the most particles consisted of pigment white 6 pw6 titanium dioxide anatase and rutile but some also of pb15 and pv23 3 2 2 mineral water in mineral water from single use pet bottles mainly the same quantity of pigmented particles as in blank samples was found only two samples showed higher amounts of pw6 resulting in a mean value of 1175 1179 pigmented particles l fig s8 and fig 5 in contrast we detected higher amounts of pigmented particles in water from reusable pet bottles 11074 18967 pigmented particles l and even higher amounts in water from glass bottles 195047 330810 pigmented particles l among these two bottle types all samples from reusable bottles labelled with printed paper showed significantly higher concentrations 10000 pigmented particles l than bottles labelled with plastic or the single use glass bottle cf table s1 figs s9 and s10 moreover we found higher contents in older reusable pet bottles than in the corresponding newish ones sample r6n o and r7n o in fig s9 in water from all bottle types most of the pigmented particles were smaller than 5 μm fig 6 in addition 40 of the pigmented particles in water from single use pet bottles to 53 in water from glass bottles were smaller than 1 5 μm whereas in water from single use pet bottles pw6 was the predominant pigment type in water from reusable pet bottles and glass bottles pv23 pb15 or a spectral mixture of two or more pigments were dominant see fig 7 3 2 3 pigments on paper labels the analysed mineral water samples were packaged in different bottle types being labelled with printed paper or plastic labels see table s1 as we found higher amounts of pigmented particles in reusable bottles labelled with paper the pigments used for printing of the paper labels were also analysed in fig s11 microscopic images of the surface of a paper label are displayed the labels are printed with spots in mainly four to five colours blue red yellow white and green which showed to be a mixture of blue and yellow based on their raman spectra see fig s12 the colours were identified as pb15 pv23 py83 and pw6 anatase and rutile the pigment of the red spots could not be identified due to the lack of a matching reference spectrum however we did not detect this spectrum for any particle found in water samples the pigment types found on paper labels of glass and pet bottles were the same in fig s13 raman spectra of pb15 measured on an isolated particle from a mineral water sample a blue spot on a printed paper label and a reference powder heuco blue 515303 are compared these spectra showed to be almost identical 3 3 additives solely in water from reusable pet bottles we identified 708 1024 particles l of the antioxidant tris 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphite see fig s14 11 7 of the particles were 1 5 μm 56 9 1 5 μm and 5 μm 23 4 5 μm and 10 μm and 5 3 10 μm a second substance could not be identified due to a missing reference spectrum because it shows similar spectral elements to tris 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphite see fig s15 we estimate it to be an antioxidant too but as this cannot be confirmed and as this substance was found in one single sample only 542 particles l sample r4o in fig s14 we excluded it from the data to check the composition of some of these particles a mapping over the particle surface was performed similar to the coloured pet particle above section 3 1 2 in fig s16 the result is exemplarily displayed for one particle all spectra were identified as tris 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphite and no underlying polymer was detected 4 discussion actually only one peer reviewed study about the contamination of bottled water with microplastics having analysed multiple samples has been published schymanski et al 2018 investigated bottled water from different packaging types via filtration without former sample pre treatment and micro raman spectroscopy they presented data about microplastics 5 μm sparsely addressed pigmented particles and did not mention additives in the present study we analysed 32 samples of mineral water packaged in different bottle types for contamination with microplastics pigmented particles and additives using special filters and micro raman spectroscopy we were able to investigate particles down to a size of 1 μm by dissolving calcium or magnesium carbonate particles during sample pre treatment we decreased the total particle number and thus the measuring time considerably in addition we analysed the influence of the age of reusable pet bottles on the content of microplastics in bottled water and identified labelling with paper labels as potential source for contamination with pigmented particles 4 1 microplastics 4 1 1 microplastics content according to schymanski et al 2018 we detected microplastics in mineral water from all bottle types the lowest contents were detected in single use pet bottles in contrast the highest microplastics content was found in a glass bottle sample g1 furthermore the total number of microplastics was significantly higher in our study as seen in table s2 where the results of both studies are compared since 98 3 single use pet bottles 95 4 reusable pet bottles and 77 7 glass bottles of the detected microplastics were 5 μm in our study these particles were not covered by schymanski et al 2018 comparing the amount of microplastics with a diameter greater than 5 μm numbers are in a similar range for single use and reusable pet bottles in water from glass bottles we found about twenty times higher amounts of microplastics see table s2 even when removing the outlier sample g1 the mean number of microplastics greater than 5 μm was about ten times higher 673 953 particles l than in the study of schymanski et al 2018 this discrepancy might be partly explainable due to different brands analysed in the two studies or the differences in methodology see also section 4 4 1 schymanski et al 2018 pointed out that the analysis of microplastics with micro raman spectroscopy is important since μ ftir spectroscopy is not suitable to identify particles 20 μm as over 90 of the determined microplastics were smaller than 5 μm our results show that it is of great importance to analyse food for the smallest size of microplastics regarding potential health effects for humans due to the oral intake of microplastics in particular the smallest microplastics 1 5 μm are considered critically efsa 2016 yoo et al 2011 among the twelve analysed reusable pet bottles we analysed four pairs of one newish and one older bottle for three brands on average 2689 4371 microplastics l were found in newish 8339 7043 microplastics l in older bottles for three pairs fig s6 r4n o r5n o r6n o microplastics content was clearly higher in water from the older bottle only for one pair the difference was small fig s6 r7n o regarding the polymer type of the detected particles solely the amount of pet particles increased from newish to older bottles this increase in microplastics consisting of the bottle material indicates a significant influence of the bottle age on contamination with microplastics see also section 4 1 2 and 4 1 3 4 1 2 distribution of polymers comparing the polymer distribution among the detected microplastics with the results of schymanski et al 2018 they are very similar for single use and reusable pet bottles in water from both bottle types we found predominantly pet whereas schymanski et al declared 30 of microplastics in water from single use bottles as others which could not be clearly identified because of an unavailable standard spectrum we did not find particles with such a raman spectrum in mineral water from glass bottles we found only a small amount of pet particles 3 6 whereas schymanski et al 2018 detected 41 pest used for the sum of pet and other polyesters particles beside this variation we only detected single particles of pa instead of 12 in the other study by contrast we found 46 pe schymanski et al 35 14 of a styrene butadiene copolymer and 6 ps partly interfered by olefinic spectrum while schymanski et al did not detect a relevant amount of ps these differences as well as the above mentioned unidentified polymer in the study of schymanski et al might be explainable by different mineral water brands analysed in the two studies 4 1 3 potential sources for contamination with microplastics concerning the potential sources for the contamination of bottled mineral water with microplastics schymanski et al 2018 already suspected the packaging bottle and cap in bottles made of pet single use as well as reusable pet was the predominant polymer in both studies furthermore reusable pet bottles showed a higher content of microplastics than single use bottles we could also show that water from older frequently used pet bottles had a higher content of pet particles than water from newish bottles newish bottles proved to have similar amounts of microplastics as single use bottles schymanski et al 2018 presumed a stress influence on the amount of delivered particles for reusable pet bottles this assumption could explain the higher content of pet particles in older bottles whose inner surface might be affected e g during the washing process the contents of microplastics in glass bottles might be a result of an abrasion of the caps on the hard glass bottleneck schymanski et al 2018 while this is a possible explanation for the polymers pe and pp the packaging cannot be the source of contamination in glass bottles especially for polymers like ps styrene butadiene copolymer or pet schymanski et al 2018 recommended to take a closer look at the production cleaning and refilling processes of reusable bottles regarding our results for the content of pigment particles in mineral water see sections 3 2 3 and 4 2 we presume the machinery for bottle cleaning as a significant source for microplastics the washing liquor might be contaminated with microplastics due to the abrasion of machine parts or contaminated returned empties contaminated washing liquor would lead to contamination of the bottles inside and outside however we did not find ps or styrene butadiene copolymer in water from reusable pet bottles which are of course machinery washed too since pet is more sensitive reusable pet bottles are washed in general at lower temperature and concentration of the washing liquor compensated by a longer time for cleaning purposes in contrast glass bottles are washed intensively which may also affect the material of the washing machinery more aggressively this might have an influence on contamination with microplastics too to clarify this assumption further experiments like the investigation of cleaned unfilled bottles or a successive analysis of mineral water beginning with samples at the bore head and during the filling process have to be performed thereby the conditions of sampling especially the sampling container have to be critically reviewed to avoid contamination during the sample process size distribution of microplastics in glass bottles is shifted to particles 5 μm compared to pet bottles almost all of the particles 5 μm in glass bottles consisted of pe or pp which are probably caused by abrasion from the caps on the hard glass bottleneck see above as this contamination source is less relevant for pet bottles this might be an explanation for the different size distribution 4 2 pigments while investigating mineral water for microparticle contamination we detected also partly high amounts of pigmented particles the sample with the highest content over 1 1 million pigmented particles l was water from a glass bottle all water samples from glass bottles were contaminated beside one sample from a single use glass bottle which contained only small amounts of pw6 in water from single use pet bottles and most reusable pet bottles pigmented particles were only scarcely present 4500 particles l whereas in three reusable pet bottles higher amounts 18000 particles l to 62000 particles l of pigmented particles were detected schymanski et al 2018 found coloured particles in all samples from glass bottles 115 102 particles l and in one type of returnable pet bottle 27 particles l these particles showed a similar spectrum as blue nitrile gloves worn during the experiment heliogen blue or the polypropylene blue bottle caps used during experiments however they were not able to identify the source of these particles as with the contents of microplastics we also detected higher amounts of pigmented particles in total 91 5 of the pigmented particles were 5 μm these were not analysed by schymanski et al 2018 besides pw6 titanium dioxide and pb15 which were already observed by schymanski et al 2018 we also found other pigment types such as pv23 py83 or spectral mixtures of two or more pigments these spectral mixtures might be caused by conglutination of two or more particles as mentioned in section 3 1 2 or by a real mixture of colours these pigment types were also reported by imhof et al 2016 to be found in limnetic ecosystems even so we rule out a transfer of pigmented particles from freshwater to mineral water sources all samples that exhibited a higher content of pigmented particles were reusable bottles pet or glass and all of them were labelled with paper the only single use glass bottle as well as the plastic labelled reusable pet bottles displayed almost no or only small amounts of pigment particles accordingly we investigated the colours used for printing on the paper labels from several brands and found the same pigments as in mineral water samples paper labels in contrast to plastic labels are normally not removed from reusable bottles before the cleaning process thus paper labels come into direct contact with the washing liquor so that pigment particles find their way into the washing liquor and from there into the bottles the following rinsing steps with fresh water seem not to be efficient enough to remove this contamination of the inner surface of the bottles on average water from glass bottles showed higher amounts of pigmented particles as water from paper labelled reusable pet bottles as described in section 4 1 3 reusable pet bottles run through a more gently washing process colder less concentrated washing liquor as used for pet bottles might remove fewer pigments from paper labels as that used for glass bottles this would result in a lesser contamination of reusable pet bottles among the water from reusable pet bottles which were contaminated with pigment particles two were newish and two older from the same brand in the newish ones we found obviously smaller amounts of pigmented particles 1808 and 814 particles l than in the corresponding older bottles 35256 and 61652 particles l this leads us to the hypothesis that pigment particles which were brought inside the bottles during the washing process take hold on the potentially affected rough inner surface of older reusable pet bottles and cannot be removed as easy as from newish bottles nevertheless further tests have to be performed to clearly demonstrate the washing liquor as the source for contamination of water samples with pigmented particles for example the investigation of cleaned unfilled bottles or of the washing liquor itself might be useful pw6 titanium dioxide was not only detected in water from reusable bottles labelled with paper but also in water from two single use pet bottles the single use glass bottle and some reusable pet bottles with plastic labels in these cases the pigments used for label printing cannot be the source for the contamination with the pigmented particles however titanium dioxide is also used as material filler or uv blocker lenz et al 2015 thus it might be added to other materials used during the filling process of water e g filter materials which could lead to contamination to achieve a definite cause for this observation further tests are required 4 3 additives besides different microplastics we also detected several particles of the antioxidant additive tris 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphite in water from eight of the twelve analysed reusable pet bottles the remaining four samples were from one brand and filled in a different bottle type in mineral water from single use pet or glass bottles no additive particles were found tris 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphite is used as hydro peroxide scavenger in the manufacturing process of plastics welle 2007 and might be leached out from the bottle we did not detect any polymeric spectrum when investigating these particles with raman mapping nevertheless we cannot exclude that they consisted of a mixture of the polymer and the above named additive lenz et al 2015 4 4 method assessment 4 4 1 partial analysis in the present study our aim was to investigate mineral water for microplastics down to a particle size of 1 μm using micro raman spectroscopy by the use of aluminium coated pc membrane filters oβmann et al 2017 we were able to generate reliable raman spectra of the smallest particles 1 μm without destruction using gold coated pc membrane filters as they were applied by schymanski et al 2018 non destructive raman measurement of particles less than 5 μm was only possible by decreasing laser power to a minimum combined with a prolonged measurement time oβmann et al 2017 as total particle number in mineral water strongly increased with analysing smaller particle size we had to reduce sample volume to 250 ml to achieve analysable particle numbers additionally the more particles are present on the filter surface the more particles stack together and are recognized as one single particle furthermore regarding the measurement time all particles on 5 mm2 from the total filtration area 113 mm2 were analysed if we would have analysed all particles on the entire filter surface only a maximum of two samples instead of 32 would have been investigated in the same time schymanski et al 2018 filtered the whole sample volume 0 7 1 5 l through a 12 6 mm2 filter and analysed particles greater than 5 μm as they had a maximum of 5000 particles analysable per sample they also used extrapolation in contrast we analysed up to 23000 particles per sample every extrapolation causes additional uncertainty even so to get a better comparability of our results with other studies we decided to calculate particle numbers per litre sample volume assuming an even distribution of the particles in the initial sample volume and over the filter surface multiplying the particle number detected on the analysed area by 22 6 resulted in the total particle number on the filter surface and multiplying again by 4 resulted in the number of particles in 1 l mineral water accordingly an entire factor of 90 4 is used one particle detected on the analysed area results in 90 particles l which might lead to an overestimation during method validation three aliquots of one sample were analysed in a similar way the coefficient of variation cv of the microplastics content between the three aliquots was up to 50 with a mean value of only 10 microplastic particles 5 mm2 resulting in 900 particles l this cv includes the variation caused by the analysis of a partial volume as well as the variation caused by the analysis of a subarea the analysis of microplastics is a kind of trace analysis where a cv of 50 is not unlikely in addition a strong reliance was observed between the cv of the particle number among the five analysed spots and the particle number itself this cv did not decrease with a higher number of analysed squares even with 21 analysed spots the cv remained constant as a consequence particle numbers less than 10 particles 5 mm2 resulting in 900 particles l might be considered with an uncertainty over 50 summarized partial analysis and extrapolation might lead to over or to underestimation of contamination nevertheless a complete analysis of all particles on the filter surface in a size class beginning with 1 μm is nearly unfeasible 4 4 2 interference of raman spectra as already mentioned above section 4 4 1 particles might stick together and thus were recognized as one single particle this was demonstrated exemplarily for one blue pet particle in fig 4 in some samples interference with an olefinic spectrum was also observed which might be caused by adherence of highly detected erucamide to plastic particles furthermore some particles might be a mixture of several components like a polymer and a pigment or an additive depending on the generated raman spectra such particles might be recognized as one of the components or as a mixture even though we tried to differentiate between plastic additive and pigment spectra we cannot ensure that some microplastics were missed as their spectra were totally covered by additive or pigment spectra this already showed to be a problem in previous studies and might lead to underestimation of the microplastics content imhof et al 2016 lenz et al 2015 4 4 3 blank values microplastics are ubiquitously present thus when performing analytics of microplastics it is important to follow several precautions to avoid sample contamination and to monitor it via blank samples nevertheless it is difficult to completely avoid sample contamination schymanski et al 2016 2018 in the present study small amounts of pp and ps and single particles of pe and pet were detected we paid attention on avoiding plastic products during analytics whenever possible however e g the housing of the filter of the ultrapure water system and the syringe filter as well as the syringe itself used for filtration of chemical solutions were made of plastics pc pp and might have led to sample contamination even so as the unfiltered chemicals edta sds were highly contaminated with microplastics blank values could be decreased considerably by using these filters 5 conclusions in the present study 32 samples of mineral water were investigated for microparticle contamination in water from all bottle types variable amounts of microplastics were detected mineral water from reusable bottles pet as well as glass showed higher amounts of microplastics than water from single use pet bottles in water from pet bottles the predominant polymer was pet indicating a contamination via the bottle material in water from glass bottles various polymer types like pe pp or a styrene butadiene copolymer were found possible contamination sources are the bottle cap the washing machinery or other steps during filling process additionally water from frequently reused pet bottles showed higher amounts of microplastics than water from newish pet bottles this was possibly caused by aging of the bottle material in reusable pet bottles also few particles of an antioxidant additive were found these might be leached out from the bottle material apart from microplastics partly high amounts of pigmented particles were detected in water from reusable bottles labelled with printed paper the colours used for label printing were the same as those found in mineral water samples the most possible way of contamination might be the washing liquor used in the cleaning process of the bottles which comes into contact with the labels and also the inner surface of the bottles in total about 90 of the detected microplastics and the pigmented particles were 5 μm and about 40 were even 1 5 μm considering toxicological aspects for humans via the oral intake of microplastics with food analysis of the smallest microplastics is crucial in the present study a method is shown enabling analysis of particles down to a size of 1 μm this important size class could only be achieved by using aluminium coated pc membrane filters and micro raman spectroscopy furthermore data about microplastics additive particles and pigmented particles in mineral water are

19513,up to now only a few studies about microparticle contamination of bottled mineral water have been published the smallest analysed particle size was 5 μm however due to toxicological reasons especially microparticles smaller than 1 5 μm are critically discussed therefore in the present study 32 samples of bottled mineral water were investigated for contamination by microplastics pigment and additive particles due to the application of aluminium coated polycarbonate membrane filters and micro raman spectroscopy a lowest analysed particle size of 1 μm was achieved microplastics were found in water from all bottle types in single use and reusable bottles made of poly ethylene terephthalate pet as well as in glass bottles the amount of microplastics in mineral water varied from 2649 2857 per litre in single use pet bottles up to 6292 10521 per litre in glass bottles while in plastic bottles the predominant polymer type was pet in glass bottles various polymers such as polyethylene or styrene butadiene copolymer were found hence besides the packaging itself other contamination sources have to be considered pigment particles were detected in high amounts in reusable paper labelled bottles 195047 330810 pigment particles per litre in glass and 23594 25518 pigment particles per litre in reusable paper labelled pet bottles pigment types found in water samples were the same as used for label printing indicating the bottle cleaning process as possible contamination route furthermore on average 708 1024 particles per litre of the additive tris 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphite were found in reusable pet bottles this additive might be leached out from the bottle material itself over 90 of the detected microplastics and pigment particles were smaller than 5 μm and thus not covered by previous studies in summary this is the first study reporting about microplastics pigment and additive particles found in bottled mineral water samples with a smallest analysed particle size of 1 μm graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastics pigments bottled mineral water micro raman spectroscopy food abbreviations cv coefficient of variation μ ftir

introduction since the first reports about small plastic pieces in oceans in the early 1970s carpenter et al 1972 carpenter and smith 1972 a lot of studies have been published investigating the abundance of so called microplastics in different environmental compartments auta et al 2017 eerkes medrano et al 2015 horton et al 2017 microplastics are small plastic pieces with a size below 5 mm besides these plastics coloured polymer particles as well as pure pigment particles were also detected imhof et al 2016 lenz et al 2015 it has been shown that various animals ingest plastics instead of or with their food ivar do sul and costa 2014 wright et al 2013 hence toxicological risks resulting from the intake of these particles are discussed covering three main topics the particles themselves polymer additives and adsorbed contaminants browne et al 2008 2013 particles themselves may cause inner abrasions or blockage of the gastro intestinal system of animals wright et al 2013 small particles might translocate into body tissues and cause harm browne et al 2008 with the smallest size fraction 1 5 μm being more likely to penetrate deeply into organs efsa 2016 yoo et al 2011 furthermore chemicals such as additives and contaminants which adhere to particles might be leached out after oral intake of the particles browne et al 2013 regarding pigments primarily metals might leach out from the particles imhof et al 2016 since the detection of microplastics in commercial seafood li et al 2015 van cauwenberghe and janssen 2014 the issue of a potential contamination of foods with microplastics became increasingly important studies were performed about the occurrence of microplastics in german beer liebezeit and liebezeit 2013 honey and sugar liebezeit and liebezeit 2014 table salts karami et al 2017 yang et al 2015 drinking and mineral water mintenig et al 2014 schymanski et al 2018 in all of the above named studies separation of particles from food matrix was realised via filtration and particle analysis was performed on the filter surface depending on the food type sample pre treatment with nitric acid van cauwenberghe and janssen 2014 or hydrogen peroxide seafood honey and partly table salts li et al 2015 liebezeit and liebezeit 2013 yang et al 2015 was necessary to digest organic material particle identification was performed in various ways

or micro raman spectroscopy karami et al 2017 schymanski et al 2018 the spectroscopic methods were either used after visual pre sorting of particles or spectra were generated for all detected particles the results of some of these studies were critically discussed due to the analytical methods applied there was a lack in the prevention of blank values and the clear identification of the potential microplastics efsa 2016 lachenmeier et al 2015 however among the methods used in the above mentioned studies μ ftir and micro raman spectroscopy showed to be adequate for conclusive polymer identification whereas μ ftir is usable to identify particles greater than 10 μm micro raman spectroscopy enables analysis down to a particle size of 1 μm käppler et al 2016 wiesheu et al 2016 and schymanski et al 2018 showed the applicability of micro raman spectroscopy to the analysis of beverages beer and mineral water for microplastics while in the first paper only one mineral water sample was analysed the second one shows the results for 38 mineral water samples the highest amount of microplastics 241 particles l was found in a reusable bottle made of poly ethylene terephthalate pet however microparticles smaller than 5 μm were not analysed regarding toxicological risks for humans after the oral intake of microplastics especially small particles are of particular concern efsa 2016 the aim of the present study was to investigate mineral water samples for microparticle contamination including the particle size larger than 1 μm therefore micro raman spectroscopy was combined with special newly developed aluminium coated polycarbonate membrane filters oβmann et al 2017 thus even microparticles in a size of 1 μm could be visualized and clearly identified 32 bottled mineral water samples from three different packaging types single and reusable bottles made of pet and glass bottles were analysed for microparticle contamination in addition to microplastics we extended our investigation to pigmented and additive particles 2 materials and methods 2 1 precautions to avoid sample contamination to avoid contamination by air all steps of sample preparation were performed in a laminar flow box clean room class iso 5 after en din iso 14644 1 spetec gmbh and filter membranes were stored in closed glass petri dishes after sample preparation all persons wore lab coats made of cotton for analytical procedures only ultrapure water veolia water solutions and technologies purelab flex 0 2 μm filtered was used all added solutions were filtered through a syringe membrane filter cellulose acetate 0 2 μm ge healthcare life sciences whatman prior to use hardware made of plastics was avoided to be used whenever possible glassware was treated for 15 min with sodium dodecyl sulphate solution 0 3 g l prepared from sds applichem panreac itw companies 99 0 2 μm filtered in an ultrasonic bath this detergent proved to be more suitable in removing microplastics from the glass surface then pure water afterwards glassware was rinsed once with ethanol 50 v v ultrapure water ethanol absolute fisher chemical 99 8 and three times with ultrapure water in the laminar flow box 2 2 samples 32 samples from 21 different brands of mineral water were purchased in bavarian food stores twelve samples were packaged in reusable bottles made of poly ethylene terephthalate pet ten samples in single use bottles made of pet and ten samples in glass bottles including one single use and nine reusable glass bottles among the reusable pet bottles four pairs of a newish and a frequently reused bottle were analysed the pairs were from the same batch each and belonged to three different brands newish bottles were differentiated from older ones based on the frequency of scratches on the outside of the bottles and the cloudiness of the bottle material which both enhance during reutilisation the characteristics of all samples such as the bottle type or volume are summed up in table s1 in the supplementary data 2 3 sample preparation after removing the labels all bottles were cleaned thoroughly with detergent and rinsed with deionized water to avoid sample contamination via the outside of the bottles before opening bottles were allowed to dry in a laminar flow box each sample was mixed by inverting the bottle and then transferred into a precleaned erlenmeyer flask depending on the content of calcium and magnesium ions in the sample as listed on the labelling of water samples an equimolar amount of an ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid tetrasodium salt edta solution 250 g l prepared from edta tetrahydrat fluka 99 0 2 μm filtered was added and the sample was left to stay for 15 min particles consisting of calcium or magnesium carbonate got dissolved by complexing these cations with edta accordingly the total particle number was reduced leading to decrease in the measurement time afterwards 3 ml of a sodium dodecyl sulphate sds solution 100 g l prepared from sds applichem panreac itw companies 99 0 2 μm filtered were added per litre sample prior tests showed that plastic particles could be suspended easier by adding this detergent resulting in a higher sample homogeneity oβmann et al 2017 to obtain analysable particle numbers on the filter surface samples were mixed and an aliquot of 250 ml of the initial sample volume was filtered via vacuum through an aluminium coated polycarbonate membrane filter as described by oβmann et al 2017 pore size 0 4 μm filtration unit msscientific kg13b 500 filtration area 113 mm2 the funnel of the filtration unit was first rinsed with 5 ml ethanol 50 to destroy foam v v ultrapure water ethanol absolute fisher chemical 99 8 and then continuously with ultrapure water subsequently filters were immobilized and flattened using two rings of metal und a microscope slide in this way the microscopic focus on the flat filter surface and particle locations remained constant oβmann et al 2017 to avoid contamination filters were stored in closed glass petri dishes water samples were analysed in blocks within each block one blank value was analysed to check for sample contamination in total seven blanks were evaluated blank values were prepared in a similar way like water samples 0 5 l of ultrapure water was mixed with 2 5 ml of edta 250 g l solution after a waiting time of 15 min 1 5 ml sds solution 100 g l were added due to the added chemicals and the absence of buffering capacity unlike in mineral water the ph value of this solution is so basic that the aluminium layer of the membrane filter would be destroyed to prevent this the ph value was adjusted to 7 by adding hydrochloric acid 25 bernd kraft p a 0 2 μm filtered 250 ml of the initial sample volume were filtered as described above 2 4 micro raman spectroscopy 2 4 1 identification of microplastics after the sample preparation particles were analysed directly on the filter surface with micro raman spectroscopy using an xplora plus system operated by labspec 6 software horiba scientific the raman system was equipped with two lasers 532 nm and 785 nm and a cooled charge coupled device ccd detector gratings with 600 grooves mm 1200 grooves mm or 1800 grooves mm were used the confocal hole width was set to 300 μm the confocal slit width to 100 μm system calibration was performed by zero order correction of the grating and additionally on the 520 7 cm 1 peak of a silicon wafer as the identification of all particles on the whole filter surface 113 mm2 would be extremely time consuming referring to imhof et al 2016 five spots of 1 mm2 were examined for each sample resulting in an analysed sample area of 4 4 on each site an image montage 1 mm 1 mm was recorded with a camera infinity 3 lumenera using a 50 objective olympus mplann 50 0 75 bd in dark field illumination reflected light an example of an image montage as well as the locations of the spots are displayed in figs s1 and s2 in the supplementary data on these image montages all particles greater or equal than 1 μm were analysed with the particle finder module of the software as shown in a previous publication oβmann et al 2017 first the size and coordinates were documented for each particle by image analysis second raman spectra were recorded for all particles with one laser 532 nm 600 grooves mm and 3 2 mw at the sample 2 1 s spectrum range was set from 150 cm 1 to 3500 cm 1 intensity correction algorithm of labspec 6 was applied to get a better comparability of recorded spectra with a data base biorad knowitall informatics system horiba edition for some samples due to high particle numbers the analysed areas of 1 mm2 had to be divided into 3 or 4 smaller image montages for the calculation the results were summed up to each mm2 most particles showed no straight spectral baseline e g background caused by light fluorescence which was corrected by subtracting a polynomial baseline however a few particles showed high fluorescence for these particles raman spectra were recorded manually with a second laser 785 nm 5 3 mw at the sample 600 grooves mm or 1200 grooves mm resulting in evaluable spectra in most cases the acquisition time and the number of accumulations were set individually for each measurement spectra could not be compared automatically with a database to simplify analysis all spectra were screened for plastics using classical least squares algorithm cls a mathematical process based on beer s law workman and howard 2010 and a software option of labspec 6 the evaluation with cls was supported by microsoft excel 2010 spectra of different synthetic polymers polyamide nylon 6 pa polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polycarbonate pc poly ethylene terephthalate pet and poly vinyl chloride pvc were set as standard references furthermore spectra of other materials present in the samples e g colours were used as reference after confirming their identities with a database each measured spectrum was calculated as the sum of all references and the theoretical composition was displayed in this way spectra similar to a reference were highlighted if a spectrum showed to be a mixture of two or more references all of them were highlighted in fig s3 an example for the analysis with cls is shown in order to avoid missing of unknown substances which were not set as reference and false positive effects the results of cls were checked manually again unknown substances were identified by comparing with spectra from a database although a review of the results was necessary cls simplified data evaluation and decreased analytics time considerably some spectra appeared to be polymeric but were not clearly recognizable e g due to low intensity high noise or interference with non polymeric spectra for these particles manual remeasurement with adjusted values for acquisition time and accumulation runs was performed partially the application of a grating with a higher number of grooves mm was necessary to achieve conclusive spectra particles might also consist of several components which adhere together in such cases raman mapping of single particles was recorded using a step size of 1 μm to check their position dependent composition the number of the identified particles was classified in four groups depending on their size 1 5 μm 1 5 μm to 5 μm 5 μm to 10 μm and 10 μm 2 4 2 identification of colours on paper labels colours used for the printing of paper labels from four different brands of mineral water packed in glass bottles and from two different brands of reusable pet bottles were identified using micro raman spectroscopy labels were removed from the bottles and analysed directly with the raman system described in section 2 4 1 images were recorded in bright field illumination reflected light and raman parameters were set individually for each measurement identification of the colour spectra was performed by comparing with spectra from a database these findings were further confirmed by comparing with spectra of several pigments heubach gmbh germany pigment blue 15 pb15 heuco blue 515400 heuco blue 515303 pigment violet 23 pv23 aquis violet 90230 heucosperse i vs 1621 e and pigment yellow 83 py83 monolite yellow 108304 2 5 calculation as described in sections 2 3 and 2 4 1 for each sample a volume of 250 ml was filtered and five spots of 1 mm2 were analysed for particles to get better comparability with other studies detected particle numbers were extrapolated to 1 l mineral water assuming an even particle distribution in the initial sample and over the filter surface we multiplied the particle number detected on the analysed area of 5 mm2 by 22 6 to calculate the total number of particles on the filter surface and again by 4 to calculate the number of particles in 1 l mineral water the limitations caused by this extrapolation are discussed in section 4 4 1 3 results 3 1 microplastics the results for microplastics in mineral water samples depending on the bottle type are summed up in figs 1 3 fig 1 shows the mean number of microplastics projected to 1 l sample volume fig 2 exhibits the particle size distribution in percent in fig 3 the distribution of the polymer type is displayed detailed results for all samples are shown in figs s4a blank samples s5 single use pet bottles s6 reusable pet bottles and s7 glass bottles in the supplementary data 3 1 1 blank samples although we took several precautions to avoid contamination of the samples with microplastics we were not able to prevent contamination completely on average 384 468 microplastics l were found in blank samples fig 1 consisting mainly of pp some of ps pe and pet fig s4a we did not find pc particles in the blank values but as the filter membranes were made of pc and as only single particles of this material were detected in the water samples we excluded pc from the results schymanski et al 2018 3 1 2 mineral water microplastics were detected in almost all bottled water samples they showed very different amounts of microplastics figs s5 s7 resulting in a high uncertainty per bottle type water from single use pet bottles displayed the lowest amount with 2649 2857 microplastics l water from reusable pet bottles contained on average 4889 5432 microplastics l and water from glass bottles 6292 10521 microplastics l fig 1 the highest amount of microplastics was detected in one of the glass bottles 35436 microplastics l sample g1 in fig s7 when removing this outlier a mean value of 3074 2531 microplastics l for water from glass bottles was calculated which is in the range of single use pet bottles in the four newish reusable pet bottles sample r4n r5n r6n and r7n similar amounts as in single use pet bottles 2689 4371 microplastics l were detected whereas obviously higher amounts 8339 7043 microplastics l were measured in the corresponding older bottles sample r4o r5o r6o and r7o regarding the material of the particles solely the number of pet particles was increasing see fig s6 the size distribution of microplastics fig 2 is very similar for single use and reusable pet bottles over 95 of the plastic particles were smaller than 5 μm and even about 50 were smaller than 1 5 μm in glass bottles larger particles 15 were 5 μm and 10 μm and 7 10 μm occurred more frequently in water from bottles made of pet single use and reusable most microplastics showed the spectrum of pet partly interfered by an olefinic or a pigment spectrum by contrast in water from glass bottles pe 46 pp 23 and a styrene butadiene copolymer 14 were the predominant polymer types fig 3 as already mentioned above several pet particles also showed characteristic bands of pigments or olefinic bands some of these particles were investigated with raman mapping to check their spatial composition in fig 4 the results are shown for a particle consisting of pet and pb15 characteristic spectral bands of pet were detected on every measuring point pb 15 could only be verified at a part of the particle indicating that two particles of different material were stacked together in this case in samples with olefinic interference e g sample s1 high numbers of particles with raman spectra similar to erucamide were also found data not shown this olefinic interference might be caused by adherence of this substance to plastic particles 3 2 pigmented particles the mean number of pigmented particles their size distribution and the distribution of the pigment types are shown in figs 5 7 respectively figs s4b blank samples s8 single use pet bottles s9 reusable pet bottles and s10 glass bottles exhibit further detailed results about detected pigmented particles for all samples samples showed very different amounts of pigmented particles figs s8 s10 resulting in a high uncertainty per bottle type 3 2 1 blank samples in blank samples we found 554 477 pigmented particles l the most particles consisted of pigment white 6 pw6 titanium dioxide anatase and rutile but some also of pb15 and pv23 3 2 2 mineral water in mineral water from single use pet bottles mainly the same quantity of pigmented particles as in blank samples was found only two samples showed higher amounts of pw6 resulting in a mean value of 1175 1179 pigmented particles l fig s8 and fig 5 in contrast we detected higher amounts of pigmented particles in water from reusable pet bottles 11074 18967 pigmented particles l and even higher amounts in water from glass bottles 195047 330810 pigmented particles l among these two bottle types all samples from reusable bottles labelled with printed paper showed significantly higher concentrations 10000 pigmented particles l than bottles labelled with plastic or the single use glass bottle cf table s1 figs s9 and s10 moreover we found higher contents in older reusable pet bottles than in the corresponding newish ones sample r6n o and r7n o in fig s9 in water from all bottle types most of the pigmented particles were smaller than 5 μm fig 6 in addition 40 of the pigmented particles in water from single use pet bottles to 53 in water from glass bottles were smaller than 1 5 μm whereas in water from single use pet bottles pw6 was the predominant pigment type in water from reusable pet bottles and glass bottles pv23 pb15 or a spectral mixture of two or more pigments were dominant see fig 7 3 2 3 pigments on paper labels the analysed mineral water samples were packaged in different bottle types being labelled with printed paper or plastic labels see table s1 as we found higher amounts of pigmented particles in reusable bottles labelled with paper the pigments used for printing of the paper labels were also analysed in fig s11 microscopic images of the surface of a paper label are displayed the labels are printed with spots in mainly four to five colours blue red yellow white and green which showed to be a mixture of blue and yellow based on their raman spectra see fig s12 the colours were identified as pb15 pv23 py83 and pw6 anatase and rutile the pigment of the red spots could not be identified due to the lack of a matching reference spectrum however we did not detect this spectrum for any particle found in water samples the pigment types found on paper labels of glass and pet bottles were the same in fig s13 raman spectra of pb15 measured on an isolated particle from a mineral water sample a blue spot on a printed paper label and a reference powder heuco blue 515303 are compared these spectra showed to be almost identical 3 3 additives solely in water from reusable pet bottles we identified 708 1024 particles l of the antioxidant tris 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphite see fig s14 11 7 of the particles were 1 5 μm 56 9 1 5 μm and 5 μm 23 4 5 μm and 10 μm and 5 3 10 μm a second substance could not be identified due to a missing reference spectrum because it shows similar spectral elements to tris 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphite see fig s15 we estimate it to be an antioxidant too but as this cannot be confirmed and as this substance was found in one single sample only 542 particles l sample r4o in fig s14 we excluded it from the data to check the composition of some of these particles a mapping over the particle surface was performed similar to the coloured pet particle above section 3 1 2 in fig s16 the result is exemplarily displayed for one particle all spectra were identified as tris 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphite and no underlying polymer was detected 4 discussion actually only one peer reviewed study about the contamination of bottled water with microplastics having analysed multiple samples has been published schymanski et al 2018 investigated bottled water from different packaging types via filtration without former sample pre treatment and micro raman spectroscopy they presented data about microplastics 5 μm sparsely addressed pigmented particles and did not mention additives in the present study we analysed 32 samples of mineral water packaged in different bottle types for contamination with microplastics pigmented particles and additives using special filters and micro raman spectroscopy we were able to investigate particles down to a size of 1 μm by dissolving calcium or magnesium carbonate particles during sample pre treatment we decreased the total particle number and thus the measuring time considerably in addition we analysed the influence of the age of reusable pet bottles on the content of microplastics in bottled water and identified labelling with paper labels as potential source for contamination with pigmented particles 4 1 microplastics 4 1 1 microplastics content according to schymanski et al 2018 we detected microplastics in mineral water from all bottle types the lowest contents were detected in single use pet bottles in contrast the highest microplastics content was found in a glass bottle sample g1 furthermore the total number of microplastics was significantly higher in our study as seen in table s2 where the results of both studies are compared since 98 3 single use pet bottles 95 4 reusable pet bottles and 77 7 glass bottles of the detected microplastics were 5 μm in our study these particles were not covered by schymanski et al 2018 comparing the amount of microplastics with a diameter greater than 5 μm numbers are in a similar range for single use and reusable pet bottles in water from glass bottles we found about twenty times higher amounts of microplastics see table s2 even when removing the outlier sample g1 the mean number of microplastics greater than 5 μm was about ten times higher 673 953 particles l than in the study of schymanski et al 2018 this discrepancy might be partly explainable due to different brands analysed in the two studies or the differences in methodology see also section 4 4 1 schymanski et al 2018 pointed out that the analysis of microplastics with micro raman spectroscopy is important since μ ftir spectroscopy is not suitable to identify particles 20 μm as over 90 of the determined microplastics were smaller than 5 μm our results show that it is of great importance to analyse food for the smallest size of microplastics regarding potential health effects for humans due to the oral intake of microplastics in particular the smallest microplastics 1 5 μm are considered critically efsa 2016 yoo et al 2011 among the twelve analysed reusable pet bottles we analysed four pairs of one newish and one older bottle for three brands on average 2689 4371 microplastics l were found in newish 8339 7043 microplastics l in older bottles for three pairs fig s6 r4n o r5n o r6n o microplastics content was clearly higher in water from the older bottle only for one pair the difference was small fig s6 r7n o regarding the polymer type of the detected particles solely the amount of pet particles increased from newish to older bottles this increase in microplastics consisting of the bottle material indicates a significant influence of the bottle age on contamination with microplastics see also section 4 1 2 and 4 1 3 4 1 2 distribution of polymers comparing the polymer distribution among the detected microplastics with the results of schymanski et al 2018 they are very similar for single use and reusable pet bottles in water from both bottle types we found predominantly pet whereas schymanski et al declared 30 of microplastics in water from single use bottles as others which could not be clearly identified because of an unavailable standard spectrum we did not find particles with such a raman spectrum in mineral water from glass bottles we found only a small amount of pet particles 3 6 whereas schymanski et al 2018 detected 41 pest used for the sum of pet and other polyesters particles beside this variation we only detected single particles of pa instead of 12 in the other study by contrast we found 46 pe schymanski et al 35 14 of a styrene butadiene copolymer and 6 ps partly interfered by olefinic spectrum while schymanski et al did not detect a relevant amount of ps these differences as well as the above mentioned unidentified polymer in the study of schymanski et al might be explainable by different mineral water brands analysed in the two studies 4 1 3 potential sources for contamination with microplastics concerning the potential sources for the contamination of bottled mineral water with microplastics schymanski et al 2018 already suspected the packaging bottle and cap in bottles made of pet single use as well as reusable pet was the predominant polymer in both studies furthermore reusable pet bottles showed a higher content of microplastics than single use bottles we could also show that water from older frequently used pet bottles had a higher content of pet particles than water from newish bottles newish bottles proved to have similar amounts of microplastics as single use bottles schymanski et al 2018 presumed a stress influence on the amount of delivered particles for reusable pet bottles this assumption could explain the higher content of pet particles in older bottles whose inner surface might be affected e g during the washing process the contents of microplastics in glass bottles might be a result of an abrasion of the caps on the hard glass bottleneck schymanski et al 2018 while this is a possible explanation for the polymers pe and pp the packaging cannot be the source of contamination in glass bottles especially for polymers like ps styrene butadiene copolymer or pet schymanski et al 2018 recommended to take a closer look at the production cleaning and refilling processes of reusable bottles regarding our results for the content of pigment particles in mineral water see sections 3 2 3 and 4 2 we presume the machinery for bottle cleaning as a significant source for microplastics the washing liquor might be contaminated with microplastics due to the abrasion of machine parts or contaminated returned empties contaminated washing liquor would lead to contamination of the bottles inside and outside however we did not find ps or styrene butadiene copolymer in water from reusable pet bottles which are of course machinery washed too since pet is more sensitive reusable pet bottles are washed in general at lower temperature and concentration of the washing liquor compensated by a longer time for cleaning purposes in contrast glass bottles are washed intensively which may also affect the material of the washing machinery more aggressively this might have an influence on contamination with microplastics too to clarify this assumption further experiments like the investigation of cleaned unfilled bottles or a successive analysis of mineral water beginning with samples at the bore head and during the filling process have to be performed thereby the conditions of sampling especially the sampling container have to be critically reviewed to avoid contamination during the sample process size distribution of microplastics in glass bottles is shifted to particles 5 μm compared to pet bottles almost all of the particles 5 μm in glass bottles consisted of pe or pp which are probably caused by abrasion from the caps on the hard glass bottleneck see above as this contamination source is less relevant for pet bottles this might be an explanation for the different size distribution 4 2 pigments while investigating mineral water for microparticle contamination we detected also partly high amounts of pigmented particles the sample with the highest content over 1 1 million pigmented particles l was water from a glass bottle all water samples from glass bottles were contaminated beside one sample from a single use glass bottle which contained only small amounts of pw6 in water from single use pet bottles and most reusable pet bottles pigmented particles were only scarcely present 4500 particles l whereas in three reusable pet bottles higher amounts 18000 particles l to 62000 particles l of pigmented particles were detected schymanski et al 2018 found coloured particles in all samples from glass bottles 115 102 particles l and in one type of returnable pet bottle 27 particles l these particles showed a similar spectrum as blue nitrile gloves worn during the experiment heliogen blue or the polypropylene blue bottle caps used during experiments however they were not able to identify the source of these particles as with the contents of microplastics we also detected higher amounts of pigmented particles in total 91 5 of the pigmented particles were 5 μm these were not analysed by schymanski et al 2018 besides pw6 titanium dioxide and pb15 which were already observed by schymanski et al 2018 we also found other pigment types such as pv23 py83 or spectral mixtures of two or more pigments these spectral mixtures might be caused by conglutination of two or more particles as mentioned in section 3 1 2 or by a real mixture of colours these pigment types were also reported by imhof et al 2016 to be found in limnetic ecosystems even so we rule out a transfer of pigmented particles from freshwater to mineral water sources all samples that exhibited a higher content of pigmented particles were reusable bottles pet or glass and all of them were labelled with paper the only single use glass bottle as well as the plastic labelled reusable pet bottles displayed almost no or only small amounts of pigment particles accordingly we investigated the colours used for printing on the paper labels from several brands and found the same pigments as in mineral water samples paper labels in contrast to plastic labels are normally not removed from reusable bottles before the cleaning process thus paper labels come into direct contact with the washing liquor so that pigment particles find their way into the washing liquor and from there into the bottles the following rinsing steps with fresh water seem not to be efficient enough to remove this contamination of the inner surface of the bottles on average water from glass bottles showed higher amounts of pigmented particles as water from paper labelled reusable pet bottles as described in section 4 1 3 reusable pet bottles run through a more gently washing process colder less concentrated washing liquor as used for pet bottles might remove fewer pigments from paper labels as that used for glass bottles this would result in a lesser contamination of reusable pet bottles among the water from reusable pet bottles which were contaminated with pigment particles two were newish and two older from the same brand in the newish ones we found obviously smaller amounts of pigmented particles 1808 and 814 particles l than in the corresponding older bottles 35256 and 61652 particles l this leads us to the hypothesis that pigment particles which were brought inside the bottles during the washing process take hold on the potentially affected rough inner surface of older reusable pet bottles and cannot be removed as easy as from newish bottles nevertheless further tests have to be performed to clearly demonstrate the washing liquor as the source for contamination of water samples with pigmented particles for example the investigation of cleaned unfilled bottles or of the washing liquor itself might be useful pw6 titanium dioxide was not only detected in water from reusable bottles labelled with paper but also in water from two single use pet bottles the single use glass bottle and some reusable pet bottles with plastic labels in these cases the pigments used for label printing cannot be the source for the contamination with the pigmented particles however titanium dioxide is also used as material filler or uv blocker lenz et al 2015 thus it might be added to other materials used during the filling process of water e g filter materials which could lead to contamination to achieve a definite cause for this observation further tests are required 4 3 additives besides different microplastics we also detected several particles of the antioxidant additive tris 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphite in water from eight of the twelve analysed reusable pet bottles the remaining four samples were from one brand and filled in a different bottle type in mineral water from single use pet or glass bottles no additive particles were found tris 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphite is used as hydro peroxide scavenger in the manufacturing process of plastics welle 2007 and might be leached out from the bottle we did not detect any polymeric spectrum when investigating these particles with raman mapping nevertheless we cannot exclude that they consisted of a mixture of the polymer and the above named additive lenz et al 2015 4 4 method assessment 4 4 1 partial analysis in the present study our aim was to investigate mineral water for microplastics down to a particle size of 1 μm using micro raman spectroscopy by the use of aluminium coated pc membrane filters oβmann et al 2017 we were able to generate reliable raman spectra of the smallest particles 1 μm without destruction using gold coated pc membrane filters as they were applied by schymanski et al 2018 non destructive raman measurement of particles less than 5 μm was only possible by decreasing laser power to a minimum combined with a prolonged measurement time oβmann et al 2017 as total particle number in mineral water strongly increased with analysing smaller particle size we had to reduce sample volume to 250 ml to achieve analysable particle numbers additionally the more particles are present on the filter surface the more particles stack together and are recognized as one single particle furthermore regarding the measurement time all particles on 5 mm2 from the total filtration area 113 mm2 were analysed if we would have analysed all particles on the entire filter surface only a maximum of two samples instead of 32 would have been investigated in the same time schymanski et al 2018 filtered the whole sample volume 0 7 1 5 l through a 12 6 mm2 filter and analysed particles greater than 5 μm as they had a maximum of 5000 particles analysable per sample they also used extrapolation in contrast we analysed up to 23000 particles per sample every extrapolation causes additional uncertainty even so to get a better comparability of our results with other studies we decided to calculate particle numbers per litre sample volume assuming an even distribution of the particles in the initial sample volume and over the filter surface multiplying the particle number detected on the analysed area by 22 6 resulted in the total particle number on the filter surface and multiplying again by 4 resulted in the number of particles in 1 l mineral water accordingly an entire factor of 90 4 is used one particle detected on the analysed area results in 90 particles l which might lead to an overestimation during method validation three aliquots of one sample were analysed in a similar way the coefficient of variation cv of the microplastics content between the three aliquots was up to 50 with a mean value of only 10 microplastic particles 5 mm2 resulting in 900 particles l this cv includes the variation caused by the analysis of a partial volume as well as the variation caused by the analysis of a subarea the analysis of microplastics is a kind of trace analysis where a cv of 50 is not unlikely in addition a strong reliance was observed between the cv of the particle number among the five analysed spots and the particle number itself this cv did not decrease with a higher number of analysed squares even with 21 analysed spots the cv remained constant as a consequence particle numbers less than 10 particles 5 mm2 resulting in 900 particles l might be considered with an uncertainty over 50 summarized partial analysis and extrapolation might lead to over or to underestimation of contamination nevertheless a complete analysis of all particles on the filter surface in a size class beginning with 1 μm is nearly unfeasible 4 4 2 interference of raman spectra as already mentioned above section 4 4 1 particles might stick together and thus were recognized as one single particle this was demonstrated exemplarily for one blue pet particle in fig 4 in some samples interference with an olefinic spectrum was also observed which might be caused by adherence of highly detected erucamide to plastic particles furthermore some particles might be a mixture of several components like a polymer and a pigment or an additive depending on the generated raman spectra such particles might be recognized as one of the components or as a mixture even though we tried to differentiate between plastic additive and pigment spectra we cannot ensure that some microplastics were missed as their spectra were totally covered by additive or pigment spectra this already showed to be a problem in previous studies and might lead to underestimation of the microplastics content imhof et al 2016 lenz et al 2015 4 4 3 blank values microplastics are ubiquitously present thus when performing analytics of microplastics it is important to follow several precautions to avoid sample contamination and to monitor it via blank samples nevertheless it is difficult to completely avoid sample contamination schymanski et al 2016 2018 in the present study small amounts of pp and ps and single particles of pe and pet were detected we paid attention on avoiding plastic products during analytics whenever possible however e g the housing of the filter of the ultrapure water system and the syringe filter as well as the syringe itself used for filtration of chemical solutions were made of plastics pc pp and might have led to sample contamination even so as the unfiltered chemicals edta sds were highly contaminated with microplastics blank values could be decreased considerably by using these filters 5 conclusions in the present study 32 samples of mineral water were investigated for microparticle contamination in water from all bottle types variable amounts of microplastics were detected mineral water from reusable bottles pet as well as glass showed higher amounts of microplastics than water from single use pet bottles in water from pet bottles the predominant polymer was pet indicating a contamination via the bottle material in water from glass bottles various polymer types like pe pp or a styrene butadiene copolymer were found possible contamination sources are the bottle cap the washing machinery or other steps during filling process additionally water from frequently reused pet bottles showed higher amounts of microplastics than water from newish pet bottles this was possibly caused by aging of the bottle material in reusable pet bottles also few particles of an antioxidant additive were found these might be leached out from the bottle material apart from microplastics partly high amounts of pigmented particles were detected in water from reusable bottles labelled with printed paper the colours used for label printing were the same as those found in mineral water samples the most possible way of contamination might be the washing liquor used in the cleaning process of the bottles which comes into contact with the labels and also the inner surface of the bottles in total about 90 of the detected microplastics and the pigmented particles were 5 μm and about 40 were even 1 5 μm considering toxicological aspects for humans via the oral intake of microplastics with food analysis of the smallest microplastics is crucial in the present study a method is shown enabling analysis of particles down to a size of 1 μm this important size class could only be achieved by using aluminium coated pc membrane filters and micro raman spectroscopy furthermore data about microplastics additive particles and pigmented particles in mineral water are

19514,in north west europe agricultural diffuse p losses are a major cause of eutrophication problems in surface waters given that the water framework directive wfd demands fast water quality improvements and most of the actual p mitigation strategies tend to work on the long run new short term mitigation measures are urgently needed we here report on the entire process of developing small scale field filters to remove p at the end of tile drains starting from the screening of potential p sorbing materials psm iron coated sand ics acid pre treated natural minerals biotite glauconite and olivine and bauxite initial batch ad sorption experiments revealed following order in both p sorption capacity and speed ics bauxite glauconite olivine biotite because of the presence of significant

100 0 90 10 80 20 70 30 and 60 40 respectively on weight basis we found a significant relationship between ksat and the filter mixtures particle size distribution and bulk density and a significant effect of the filter mixture composition on p removal efficiency and stability of ksat during the 10 week field trials the pure ics filters were capable of processing all drainage discharge rates up to 6 m3 day 1 with a p removal efficiency of 74 the 90 10 ics glauconite filters could process up to 4 m3 water day 1 with a p removal efficiency of 57 as saturated ics filters can easily be replaced and recycled for other applications this is a promising sustainable technique to drastically cut back diffuse p losses and to tremendously improve surface water quality in the short term keywords

since the late 60s and 70s agriculture in north west europe has intensified strongly the concomitant increase in livestock units and use of mineral fertilizer has led to highly positive nutrient balances at field level correll 1998 ulen et al 2007 resulting in the accumulation of nutrients such as phosphorus p in soils and high p saturation degrees this is especially the case in flanders belgium the netherlands chardon and faassen 1999 schoumans and chardon 2015 denmark and parts of e g france brittany spain catalunya and italy river po plain an even stronger and much more rapid intensification has been observed also in some regions of china e g changsha qin et al 2010 in flanders and the netherlands losses of p via erosion run off and leaching account for almost 60 of the eutrophication problems groenenberg et al 2013 in order to meet the requirements of the water framework directive these p losses need to be mitigated urgently whereas p losses by erosion and run off can be cut back very efficiently by means of catch crops buffer strips and reduced tillage chambers et al 2000 salomez et al 2006 there are no efficient management practices to reduce p leaching on the short term reduction of p leaching losses is generally believed only to be possible on the long run decadal time scale by means of phytomining and reduced fertilizer use van der salm et al 2009 nest et al 2015 however there may be one specific case of p leaching with a large mitigation potential in tile drained agricultural fields the drains short circuit the p buffering capacity of the subsoil resulting in high loads of p sometimes up to 5 0 ppm p that are discharged directly into the surrounding surface waters sims et al 1998 mcdowell and sharpley 2001 for this type of p losses four potential mitigation options exist buda et al 2012 a first option is the installation of p filters in the receiving waterbodies bryant et al 2012 but due to the high clogging risk of these filters this option seems to have very a limited practical applicability a second option consists of backfilling the trenches of newly installed drainage tubes with p sorbing materials psm mcdowell et al 2008 groenenberg et al 2013 although this option can reduce p losses to almost zero it can only be used for newly installed drains and requires very large amounts of psm typically 100 200 tonnes ha 1 which cannot be recovered from soil moreover p leaching may recommence once the psm is saturated a third option is installing small constructed wetlands filled with a psm at the end of the drains these systems can remove both particulate and dissolved reactive p but require a size up to 8 of the catchment area and have a highly variable p removal efficiency 1 88 brooks et al 2000 braskerud et al 2005 a fourth mitigation option consists of installing p filters at the end of the drains in the edge of the field penn et al 2007 this allows circumventing problems of the other mitigation options but presents a number of technical challenges which to date have prevented its use in practice the biggest challenge is to develop a filter system that combines large hydraulic conductivity to accept peak drainage flows with high p removal efficiency with minimal reaction time whichever of the four options above is selected the p removal structure should primarily have a high p sorption affinity i e react fast and have a long lifespan i e feature a high p sorption capacity there should also be no appreciable p desorption from the psm when p concentrations in the drainage water decrease these properties are basically determined by the combination of elemental composition and specific surface area ssa of the psm psm with a high fe al and ca content and a large ssa show the best p removal mcdowell et al 2008 buda et al 2012 in addition the costs of producing installing and maintaining a p removal structure should be minimal therefore it should be considered per region or even per site whether the use of secondary materials e g iron coated sand natural minerals i e abundantly occurring minerals rich in iron aluminium or calcium or engineered materials is the most suitable option penn et al 2007 egemose et al 2012 finally the p removal structure should be capable of processing peak flows which contain the highest p loads as the available space for p removal structures is often limited psm with a relatively high saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat should be selected in order to maintain this high ksat the psm needs to be physically stable moelants et al 2011 egemose et al 2012 because of the potentially wide applicability of p filters installed at the end of tile drains compared to other p removal options we focus on this specific mitigation option to date research dealing with the development and use of this type of filters has shown a very high p removal potential of typically 80 at lab scale but a low to moderate p revomal potential of 9 5 60 at field scale ayoub et al 2001 hylander et al 2006 penn et al 2017 because in north western europe an important share of the arable land is drained e g 34 5 in the netherlands 30 in the uk 40 in the scandinavian countries and 17 in flanders belgium van hecke 2003 svanback et al 2014 and thus at risk of high p leaching there is a tremendous potential of tile drain filters for water quality improvement in this study we wanted to develop and test p filters under laboratory conditions and validate the filter performance under field conditions to this end we i characterized and tested potential psm for their p sorption capacity and efficiency in batch experiments ii tested two filter compositions in combination with the best psm for their p removal performances under a continuous flow experiment and iii did a field scale evaluation of the final filter designs 2 materials methods 2 1 filter materials we screened ics a secondary waste product three widely occurring natural minerals biotite glauconite and olivine and bauxite an aluminium ore which consists of several minerals as potential psm the ics used is a by product of the drinking water production centre of pidpa situated in grobbendonk belgium when groundwater which is generally anaerobic is pumped up from a deep aquifer reduced iron fe2 is oxidized this iron needs to be removed because it can result in clogging of the distribution pipelines and affects water quality negatively odour colour and staining therefore the water is lead over a sand filter whereby fe oh 3 precipitates on the sand kernels giving origin to the ics bauxite biotite glauconite and olivine are abundantly available mixtures of minerals and can be easily mined in large quantities their main constituents are iron alumina magnesium and silica which make them potentially suitable as psm however in bauxite biotite glauconite and olivine these ions are a structural part of the crystal lattice largely unavailable for surface reactions which only become available over the long term through weathering processes in order to make these ions available for p sorption reactions we subjected them to a pre treatment that simulated enhanced weathering the minerals were ball milled followed by acid pre treatment with hcl 37 1 3 ratio for 2 5 h washed with distilled water and then oven dried de bolle 2013 the physical pre treatment caused an decrease in particle size leading to a higher ssa of the natural minerals the chemical weathering increased the number of reactive sites available for p sorption lyngsie et al 2014 2 2 lab scale experiments 2

comprised a 0 1 mm receiving slit a soller slit and 1 anti scanner slit the tube was operated at 40 kv and 30 ma and the xrd data were collected in a theta 2 theta geometry from 3 00 onwards at a step of 0 020 2 theta and a count time of 1 s per step 2 2 1 2 phosphate sorption isotherms for the determination of the phosphate sorption isotherms 1 gram of the psm 0 1 g for the ics was shaken on a rotational shaker with 20 ml of a 0 01 m cacl2 solution containing seven different initial p concentrations between 5 and 100 ppm p prepared from a kh2po4 stock solution 1000 ppm p the 0 01 m cacl2 solution was used to mimic the ionic strength of the soil solution mcdowell et al 2008 after 24 h of shaking the test tubes were centrifuged at 1500 g for 15 min and filtered on a 0 45 μm whatmann glass micro filter dissolved p present in the supernatant was measured using the method of murphy riley murphy and riley 1986 for each sample this procedure was performed in triplicate 2 2 1 3 phosphate sorption kinetics phosphate sorption kinetics of the psm were determined in a 0 01 m cacl2 solution containing a low 0 5 ppm p and high 5 0 ppm p p concentration 1 g of the psm 0 1 g of the ics was shaken for 4 20 100 and 500 s in 20 ml of the prepared solutions immediately after shaking the samples were filtered on a 0 45 μm whatmann glass micro filter applying a vacuum in order to minimize additional p sorption during filtration dissolved p present in the resulting liquid samples was determined using the method of murphy riley murphy and riley 1986 each test was performed in triplicate 2 2 2 filter development at lab scale 2 2 2 1 preparation and characterization of filter mixtures the most promising psm as resulting from the p sorption characteristics were used to prepare filter mixtures which were further characterized and tested in filters at lab scale these mixtures were made in order to optimize the hydraulic conductivity and increase the retention times and hence p removal in the filters the ics was mixed with ball milled and acid pre treated glauconite in ratios of 60 40 70 30 80 20 90 10 and 100 0 based on weight basis a small portion 100 g of the mixtures was used to determine the particle size distribution as described by canga et al 2014 this portion was sieved over a range of sieves with mesh sizes varying from 5 00 to 0 05 mm by weighing the amount of filter material left on each sieve dx d10 to d90 values were derived with dx being the mesh size of a sieve that allows x of the filter mixture to pass we then prepared filters at lab scale with these mixtures to determine the bulk density and ksat of the filter mixtures the mixtures were filled in plastic tubes length 30 cm inner diameter 60 mm closed at the bottom with a sintered glass plate type robu porosity 00 to a height of 20 cm the bulk density of the psm was calculated from the empty and filled tubes then the filled tubes were placed underneath a downward oriented volumetric flask to determine the ksat fig 1 by positioning the outlet of the volumetric flask directly under the ponding water level on the filter material a constant water head was created klute 1965 after the first liter of water had passed the filter the discharge through the filter was recorded in three consecutive periods of 1 min the ksat values were then calculated as follows 1 k s a t v l a t δ h with v the liquid volume passing through the filter l the filling height of the filter tube a the cross sectional area of the filter t the time period and δh the water head in our situation 0 25 m 2 2 2 2 evolution of ksat and p removal efficiency of filter mixtures following discussions on practical filter design and limitations with experimental research stations active in monitoring artificial drainage discharge from agricultural fields it was concluded that a filter system should not exceed a total volume of 0 072 m3 length x width x height 0 4 m 0 4 m x 0 45 m to allow easy installation and maintenance these preset filter dimensions combined with the expected peak flows 8 m3 per drainage tube per day d 1 and the maximum available water head difference 0 25 m yielded a minimal needed ksat 4 5 10 4 m s 1 of the psm based on the measured ksat only the filters containing pure ics and ics glauconite mixtures of 10 and 20 glauconite were used in further experiments for a more detailed description of filter dimensioning see supplementary materials s1 for these filter types a filter system at lab scale was developed as shown in fig 2 in this system a 0 01 m cacl2 solution containing 0 50 ppm p a concentration considered common in agricultural drainage water in flanders was pumped from a large supplier vessel towards a smaller buffer vessel in which the water height was kept constant the solution was led over the filters at a constant water head via a supplier tube the water head difference δh for each filter type was adjusted varying from 0 05 m for the pure ics filter to 0 25 m for 80 20 ics glauconite filter in such a way that all filters could be tested under the same peak flow conditions the evolution of ksat and p removal efficiency were monitored by determining the ksat of the filters and the residual p present in the effluent each time 10 liter had passed the filters 2 2 2 3 field scale experiments field scale filters with either pure ics or the 90 10 ics glauconite mixture as psm were built using 65 liter pvc vessels fig 3 the 80 20 ics glauconite filter was not included during field trials because both the ksat and p removal efficiency of this filter strongly decreased over time during the lab scale tests in these vessels a large construction sieve diameter 45 mm mesh size 40 mm was placed on a wooden support and glued to the edges by covering the sieve with a meshed netting type aisi316 mesh size 50 μm a dense and firm support for the psm was obtained a hole was drilled at the bottom of the pvc vessel and connected to a discharge tube depending on the psm pure ics or a 90 10 ics glauconite mixture the discharge tube was led upwards low constant head difference of 0 05 m or left at the bottom high constant head difference of 0 25 m at the top of the vessel another hole was drilled and connected to an overflow this allowed to keep the drain running in case the filter would clog filters were tested at four sites during 10 weeks in the winter of 2016 and or 2017 the sites were selected based on two criteria namely a ortho p concentration in the drain water higher than 0 10 mg p l 1 and the end of the tile drain had to be above the water level of the ditch as in many situations the space between the drainage tube and the water level of the ditch was small 0 10 m the filter with 90 10 ics glauconite with the downward oriented discharge tube filter 4 could only be tested at one site concentrations in the drainage water varied from 0 10 to 0 40 mg ortho p l 1 monitoring of the filters was done on a weekly basis and consisted of discharge measurements from the filter outflow and sampling of the filter in and outlet the filter discharge was determined by recording the time in triplicate to collect two liters of water the water samples were put in a glass jar and stored in a cooling box for transport upon arrival in the lab the dissolved reactive p drp content of the water samples was determined immediately using the method of murphy riley murphy and riley 1986 total p and total dissolved p were not determined as preliminar screening had shown that most p present 90 in the water samples consisted of drp for more information see supplementary material s2 2 3 data analysis the p sorption isotherms were obtained by plotting the sorbed p qe versus the solution equilibrium concentration ce and fitting the langmuir equation equation 1 to these data 2 q e q m a x k a c e 1 k a c e for the p sorption kinetics experiment the amount of p sorbed was plotted against time and fitted to following hyperbolic equation 3 s p s p m a x t k f t where sp is the amount of sorbed p in time t spmax is the maximum amount of p that can be sorbed and kf is a curve fitting parameter related to the p sorption rate the dx values and bulk densities of the filters at lab scale were used as independent variables in a stepwise regression analysis with ksat as dependent variable this should allow to estimate the ksat of future batches of psm all curve fittings and statistical analyses were performed with the r software package r core team 2017 3 results 3 1 psm characteristics 3 1 1 elemental and mineral composition the olivine used in this study is a forsterite and contains iron fe 7 9 fe2o3 as main p sorbing element table 1 despite its potential for p sorption olivine contains very high amounts of nickel ni 3053 mg kg 1 which might pose an environmental risk ics is clearly dominated by fe 62 5 fe2o3 as p sorbing element the biotite used in this study is a phlogopite containing fe and aluminium al in almost equal amounts 8 7 al2o3 and 8 7 fe2o3 and a substantial amount of calcium ca 9 4 cao because biotite does not contain any ca we assume that traces of caco3 were present in the biotite sample we used in bauxite fe 41 1 fe2o3 predominates over al and ca 23 1 al2o3 and 10 4 cao further large amounts of lead pb 187 mg kg 1 and nickel ni 826 mg kg 1 are present in bauxite which might pose environmental risks in glauconite fe 13 3 fe2o3 and al 6 1 al2o3 act as the main p sorbing elements with hardly any ca or mg for a more detailed description of the xrd pattern determination of the psm and findings on the obtained results see supplementary material s3 3 1 2 p sorption isotherms and kinetics the ics had by far the largest p sorption capacity fig 4 and table 2 with a qmax value of 10 510 mg p kg 1 filter material it sorbed highly significantly p 0 0001 more p than the other psm which had a qmax in the order significant at p 0 05 bauxite glauconite biotite olivine the ka values of olivine and biotite 0 132 0 060 liter mg 1 respectively were highly significantly larger p 0 01 than for the other psm table 2 the combined effect of qmax and ka is shown with the qe values calculated at a ce value of 50 mg p l 1 this clearly shows that ics has by far the best p sorption properties followed by pre treated bauxite glauconite olivine and biotite in the kinetics experiment ics showed significantly higher p 0 0001 spmax than the other psm at both low and high p concentrations fig 5 and table 3 sorbing from 2 to 19 times and 5 to 28 times more p at low and high p concentrations respectively based on significantly different spmax the materials were in the order ics bauxite glauconite biotite olivine bauxite and ics had significantly higher p 0 05 p sorption rates kf values than the other psm at low p concentrations at high p concentrations the differences in p sorption rate were smaller based on significantly different k values the materials were in the order bauxite ics olivine biotite glauconite table 3 the combined effect of spmax and kf is shown with the sp value calculated at a t value of 30 s this shows that ics has the highest p sorption affinity followed by bauxite glauconite olivine and biotite 3 2 lab scale filters because of the presence of significant amounts of lead and or nickel we did not further include bauxite and olivine in our lab trials also biotite was excluded because its p sorption capacity was low therefor we decided to focus on ics for further development of filters on lab and field scale furthermore we decided to also look at combinations of ics with glauconite as a means of optimizing the combination of minimum needed hydraulic conductivity to allow peak volumes to be processed with minimum needed residence time to allow sufficient reaction time the choice for glauconite was based on its local availability and low presence of heavy metals 3 2 1 filter characteristics decreasing the ratio of ics over glauconite resulted in a systematic and significant decrease of dx and ksat values from 32 33 10 4 m s 1 for 100 0 to 0 89 10 4 m s 1 for 60 40 and a concomitant increase in bulk density table 4 the stepwise regression analysis with ksat as dependent variable and the dx values and bulk density as independent variables led to a final prediction model characterized by three significant parameters d10 p 0 0024 d40 p 0 0433 and bulk density bd p 0 0002 with ksat expressed in m s 1 d10 and d40 in mm and bulk density in kg m 3 4 k s a t 1 50 10 2 1 15 10 3 d 10 8 70 10 4 d 40 1 02 10 5 b d the relation between estimated with eq 3 and measured ksat fig 6 had a high r2 value 0 969 and low rmse 0 0002 3 2 2 evolution of ksat and p removal efficiency filter characteristics revealed that only filters containing pure ics and ics glauconite mixtures of 10 and 20 glauconite reached a sufficiently high ksat to process peak flows these filters were then further tested in a continuous system with a larger volume of p containing solution 250 l equivalent to about 10 of the total amount of solution that passes a drain on average on yearly basis as described in section 2 2 2 δh for each of the mixtures was adjusted in such a way that all tubes processed equal water flows per unit of time i e 1 3 10 3 l s 1 this water flow is comparable to peak flow conditions at field level under these starting conditions the pure ics filter had retention times of 220 s while the 90 10 and 80 20 ics glauconite mixtures had retention times of 205 and 186 s respectively while the 100 0 and 90 10 filters maintained a ksat of at least 2 1 10 3 and 1 2 10 3 m s 1 respectively ksat in the 80 20 filter dropped below the level of 4 5 10 4 m s 1 which is the minimal anticipated ksat level to process peak flows fig 7 hence under certain circumstances the 80 20 filters might be unable to process peak flows which also contain the highest p loads furthermore the ksat of the 80 20 filter varied significantly stronger coefficient of variation 32 5 than the ksat of the 100 0 and 90 10 filters coefficients of variation of 14 7 and 13 7 indicating that the 80 20 filter is less stable the pure ics filter performed best in terms of p removal efficiency with a more or less constant p concentration of 0 03 mg p l 1 in the leachate in the 90 10 and 80 20 filters the p concentration in the leachate tended to increase after 170 and 90 liters respectively over the entire experiment the pure ics filter removed 93 5 of the p passing the filter cumulatively which was 9 3 significantly p 0 0070 higher than the 80 20 filter whereas there was no significant difference in cumulative p removal with the 90 10 filter 3 3 field trials as the 80 20 ics glauconite filter was less stable and removed less p during lab trials it was decided to conduct field trials with only the pure ics filter and the 90 10 ics glauconite filter based on available test sites four filters were built each of these filters filters 1 2 and 3 pure ics filters and filter 4 90 10 filter were tested during a period of 10 weeks from the second half of november until the end of january during this period the highest precipitation surpluses and drainage discharges were expected the pure ics filters were perfectly capable of processing highly variable drainage discharges fig 8 varying from 0 5 to 1 m3 of water d 1 in dry periods up to 6 m3 d 1 in very wet periods this led to retention times varying from 2700 to 226 s moreover the pure ics filters were never flooded by too high drainage discharges the 90 10 filter was flooded on several occasions when drainage discharge was 4 m3 d 1 and processed drainage discharges varying from 2 to 3 m3 d 1 resulting in retention times of 635 to 424 s the pure ics filters removed 74 1 filter 1 to 92 4 filter 3 of the incoming p these variations in p removal efficiency depended on the drainage discharge rate in periods of high drainage discharges the residence time of the drainage water in the filter is strongly reduced leading to a reduction in p removal efficiency as can be seen for filter 1 relatively constant drainage discharges as is the case for filter 2 resulted in constant p removal efficiency for filter 3 the drainage discharges increased only for a very short period and therefore did not affect the p removal efficiency the 90 10 filter removed on average 57 8 of the incoming p the relatively lower incoming p concentrations and the lower p binding capacity of this filter mixture probably led to a lower p removal efficiency bypass flow occurring when the 90 10 filter was flooded obviously must have further decreased the p removal efficiency of this particular filter but could not be taken into account 4 discussion a wide range of materials rich in fe al ca has been demonstrated to remove p from drainage water both efficiently and at high rates at lab scale cucarella and renman 2009 wendling et al 2013 however to date field scale applications of p filters containing these materials have proven to be laborious and inefficient in their p removal bryant et al 2012 with the development of small scale field filters applicable for individual drainage tubes we demonstrated that p losses via drainage tubes could be reduced greatly and comparable p removal rates and efficiencies could be reached as during lab scale tests in our study screening of potential psm showed that ics and natural minerals with fe as main p fixing element bauxite and glauconite outperformed the other psm in p sorption capacity and rate similar p sorption properties for the tested psm were reported by moelants et al 2011 drizo et al 1999 wendling et al 2013 and lyngsie et al 2014 small differences between these studies and our results are due to variations in the experimental conditions such as the initial p concentration of the solution and the psm to solution ratio cucarella and renman 2009 the fe rich psm performed better than the other non fe dominated psm because fe has a stronger hydrolysing power to form chemical bonds with p and it has a higher affinity for p at a slightly acidic ph hsu 1976 weng et al 2012 drainage water originating from acidic sandy soils which are dominant in our study area is logically often slightly acidic within the fe dominated psm ics had the best p sorption properties for two reasons first of all the relative amount of p sorbing elements fe al ca in the ics was much higher than in the natural minerals used secondly a much smaller part of the p sorbing elements in these minerals can be made available for surface reactions bauxite and olivine both contain relatively high amounts of ni and or pb while no short term leaching of ni and or pb from both untreated bauxite and olivine has been reported in literature the combination of physical and chemical pre treatment obviously will result in an increased risk of ni and or pb leaching moreover long term leaching risks should then be assessed given the intended time for use of such filter materials in field conditions we therefore excluded these materials from further testing after screening ics and acid pre treated glauconite were mixed in diverse ratios to prepare filters at lab scale to monitor the evolution of ksat the ksat values obtained in our study were in line with the results of canga et al 2014 while they strongly exceeded the values reported by chardon et al 2012 this observation is explained by the particle size distribution dx values which in our study was comparable to that of canga et al 2014 and much larger than that in the study of chardon et al 2012 which according to eq 3 results in a larger ksat both eq 3 and the canga et al 2014 equation clearly indicate the small d10 and medium d40 particle sizes to be the most important estimators of ksat in eq 3 the small particle size d10 is positively related to ksat and the medium particle size d40 is negatively related to ksat in the equation of canga et al 2014 both the small and medium particle sizes were positively related to ksat the positive relationships are explained by the fact that bigger particle sizes lead to wider pores within the psm allowing higher flow rates the negative relation of ksat with d40 in our study may be explained by the fact that relatively coarse particles of ics determining d40 were mixed with relatively small particles of acid pre treated glauconite these high d40 values allow within filter movement of the smaller particles glauconite resulting in a heterogeneous pore size distribution of the psm mixture which causes a decrease in ksat chardon et al 2012 furthermore in our study mixing ics with glauconite automatically led to an increase in bulk density which seemed to provide additional significant predictive power for ksat this was not the case in the study of canga et al 2014 probably because of the wide range of materials tested however eq 3 had little predictive power for the ksat values in the study of canga et al 2014 r2 0 23 whereas the equation of canga et al 2014 quite successfully predicted our ksat values r2 0 82 the equation developed by canga et al 2014 thus seems to be more generally applicable the ksat of the three filters with sufficiently high initial ksat decreased over time during the lab scale continuous flow experiment but to a variable extent this decrease was small for the pure ics and the 90 10 ics glauconite filters and was probably caused by aging of the psm sanford et al 1995 for the 80 20 ics glauconite filter the decrease in ksat was more pronounced we assume that next to aging of the psm this was due to within filter movement of the smaller glauconite particles chardon et al 2012 the p removal efficiency of each filter at lab scale was 80 90 which is comparable with efficiencies reported by ayoub et al 2001 nevertheless the longevity i e the period that the p concentration in the effluent is below 0 1 mg p l 1 of filters with a larger share of glauconite was lower because of the smaller p sorption capacity less fe present of these filters and shorter retention times in these filters burst 1958 small scale field filters were developed to process peak volumes of 6 7 m3 day 1 based on the ksat values measured at lab scale however the 90 10 ics glauconite filter could not process volumes larger than 4 m3 day 1 next to aging of the psm le coustumer et al 2012 found that the influx of sediment and development of algae also reduced ksat of filter systems a rough estimate in that study showed that a 1 3 reduction of the available pore space reduced ksat with a factor 10 influx of sediment and growth of algae must also have occurred in the pure ics filters and thus must have also reduced ksat but not to an extent that would limit the water processing capacity even at peak flows it could thus be advisable to quantify this potential clogging effect at lab scale if for practical reasons this is not feasible then one should take into account a sufficiently large margin in ksat to account for a potential decrease in ksat in contrast to the results of penn et al 2007 and bryant et al 2012 our field scale pure ics field filters removed from 70 to 90 of the incoming p main issues that caused the low p removal efficiencies in these former studies were the occurrence of bypass flow and clogging of the filter system as the pure ics filters had a sufficiently large ksat all the incoming water could be processed without any additional maintenance in addition our filters had p removal efficiencies comparable to those in the lab scale tests which is in contrast with results of ayoub et al 2001 who noticed a clear decrease in p removal efficiency due to presence of competing species such as sulphates and dissolved organic matter dom in our study sulphates and dom must have been equally present in the drainage water and we therefore suspect that the upward orientation of the discharge tube must be the main reason for the superior performance in the field this upward orientation of the discharge tube indeed ensures an increased filter residence time during periods below peak flow discharges which allows for an increased reaction time and p removal in the filter the lifespan of our small scale field filters depends on two factors i the period during which the filter reduces p losses below the 0 1 mg p l 1 limit set by the wfd and ii the period during which the filter can process all drainage discharges although the lifespan of the pure ics filters was beyond the period tested in this research these filters are expected to last shorter than the backfill systems described by groenenberg et al 2013 and mcdowell et al 2008 this shorter lifespan is due to the use of much less psm and the higher flow rates in our filter systems nevertheless the psm in our filter systems can be easily recovered and possibly further used for treatment of other wastewater streams with higher p concentrations and longer filter residence times examples include greenhouse wastewater containing p loads varying from 5 to 50 mg p l 1 and allowing filter residence times of 1 h westholm 2006 both ulen et al 2007 and grant et al 1996 state that the amount of drp in drainage water varies widely 20 85 of total p because our field scale filters were only tested in situations where the amount of drp was at least 90 of total p it remains to be seen how efficient these filters would be in situations with higher proportions of particulate p up to now capturing particulate p has only shown to be efficient by constructed wetlands nevertheless installing such wetlands is expensive and undesirable in regions where agricultural land is costly groenenberg et al 2013 therefore the development of a compact filter for particulate p removal may be the next step that needs to be taken to further reduce agricultural p losses in the short term 5 conclusions to date no efficient mitigation options exist for reducing p concentrations in surface waters other than reducing erosive p losses we successfully installed and tested filters for removal of drp from drain water in field conditions with a p removal efficiency between 70 and 90 such system could be easily optimized for fast and reversible installation at individual tile drains given the large area of tile drained fields in areas of intensive agriculture in nw europe and the absence of other efficient mitigation options in level areas this would allow for a rapid and drastic improvement of water quality with respect to p this would buy time until measures taken at the source such as p phytomining start to take effect acknowledgement this research was carried out within the framework of the nuredrain

19514,in north west europe agricultural diffuse p losses are a major cause of eutrophication problems in surface waters given that the water framework directive wfd demands fast water quality improvements and most of the actual p mitigation strategies tend to work on the long run new short term mitigation measures are urgently needed we here report on the entire process of developing small scale field filters to remove p at the end of tile drains starting from the screening of potential p sorbing materials psm iron coated sand ics acid pre treated natural minerals biotite glauconite and olivine and bauxite initial batch ad sorption experiments revealed following order in both p sorption capacity and speed ics bauxite glauconite olivine biotite because of the presence of significant

100 0 90 10 80 20 70 30 and 60 40 respectively on weight basis we found a significant relationship between ksat and the filter mixtures particle size distribution and bulk density and a significant effect of the filter mixture composition on p removal efficiency and stability of ksat during the 10 week field trials the pure ics filters were capable of processing all drainage discharge rates up to 6 m3 day 1 with a p removal efficiency of 74 the 90 10 ics glauconite filters could process up to 4 m3 water day 1 with a p removal efficiency of 57 as saturated ics filters can easily be replaced and recycled for other applications this is a promising sustainable technique to drastically cut back diffuse p losses and to tremendously improve surface water quality in the short term keywords

since the late 60s and 70s agriculture in north west europe has intensified strongly the concomitant increase in livestock units and use of mineral fertilizer has led to highly positive nutrient balances at field level correll 1998 ulen et al 2007 resulting in the accumulation of nutrients such as phosphorus p in soils and high p saturation degrees this is especially the case in flanders belgium the netherlands chardon and faassen 1999 schoumans and chardon 2015 denmark and parts of e g france brittany spain catalunya and italy river po plain an even stronger and much more rapid intensification has been observed also in some regions of china e g changsha qin et al 2010 in flanders and the netherlands losses of p via erosion run off and leaching account for almost 60 of the eutrophication problems groenenberg et al 2013 in order to meet the requirements of the water framework directive these p losses need to be mitigated urgently whereas p losses by erosion and run off can be cut back very efficiently by means of catch crops buffer strips and reduced tillage chambers et al 2000 salomez et al 2006 there are no efficient management practices to reduce p leaching on the short term reduction of p leaching losses is generally believed only to be possible on the long run decadal time scale by means of phytomining and reduced fertilizer use van der salm et al 2009 nest et al 2015 however there may be one specific case of p leaching with a large mitigation potential in tile drained agricultural fields the drains short circuit the p buffering capacity of the subsoil resulting in high loads of p sometimes up to 5 0 ppm p that are discharged directly into the surrounding surface waters sims et al 1998 mcdowell and sharpley 2001 for this type of p losses four potential mitigation options exist buda et al 2012 a first option is the installation of p filters in the receiving waterbodies bryant et al 2012 but due to the high clogging risk of these filters this option seems to have very a limited practical applicability a second option consists of backfilling the trenches of newly installed drainage tubes with p sorbing materials psm mcdowell et al 2008 groenenberg et al 2013 although this option can reduce p losses to almost zero it can only be used for newly installed drains and requires very large amounts of psm typically 100 200 tonnes ha 1 which cannot be recovered from soil moreover p leaching may recommence once the psm is saturated a third option is installing small constructed wetlands filled with a psm at the end of the drains these systems can remove both particulate and dissolved reactive p but require a size up to 8 of the catchment area and have a highly variable p removal efficiency 1 88 brooks et al 2000 braskerud et al 2005 a fourth mitigation option consists of installing p filters at the end of the drains in the edge of the field penn et al 2007 this allows circumventing problems of the other mitigation options but presents a number of technical challenges which to date have prevented its use in practice the biggest challenge is to develop a filter system that combines large hydraulic conductivity to accept peak drainage flows with high p removal efficiency with minimal reaction time whichever of the four options above is selected the p removal structure should primarily have a high p sorption affinity i e react fast and have a long lifespan i e feature a high p sorption capacity there should also be no appreciable p desorption from the psm when p concentrations in the drainage water decrease these properties are basically determined by the combination of elemental composition and specific surface area ssa of the psm psm with a high fe al and ca content and a large ssa show the best p removal mcdowell et al 2008 buda et al 2012 in addition the costs of producing installing and maintaining a p removal structure should be minimal therefore it should be considered per region or even per site whether the use of secondary materials e g iron coated sand natural minerals i e abundantly occurring minerals rich in iron aluminium or calcium or engineered materials is the most suitable option penn et al 2007 egemose et al 2012 finally the p removal structure should be capable of processing peak flows which contain the highest p loads as the available space for p removal structures is often limited psm with a relatively high saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat should be selected in order to maintain this high ksat the psm needs to be physically stable moelants et al 2011 egemose et al 2012 because of the potentially wide applicability of p filters installed at the end of tile drains compared to other p removal options we focus on this specific mitigation option to date research dealing with the development and use of this type of filters has shown a very high p removal potential of typically 80 at lab scale but a low to moderate p revomal potential of 9 5 60 at field scale ayoub et al 2001 hylander et al 2006 penn et al 2017 because in north western europe an important share of the arable land is drained e g 34 5 in the netherlands 30 in the uk 40 in the scandinavian countries and 17 in flanders belgium van hecke 2003 svanback et al 2014 and thus at risk of high p leaching there is a tremendous potential of tile drain filters for water quality improvement in this study we wanted to develop and test p filters under laboratory conditions and validate the filter performance under field conditions to this end we i characterized and tested potential psm for their p sorption capacity and efficiency in batch experiments ii tested two filter compositions in combination with the best psm for their p removal performances under a continuous flow experiment and iii did a field scale evaluation of the final filter designs 2 materials methods 2 1 filter materials we screened ics a secondary waste product three widely occurring natural minerals biotite glauconite and olivine and bauxite an aluminium ore which consists of several minerals as potential psm the ics used is a by product of the drinking water production centre of pidpa situated in grobbendonk belgium when groundwater which is generally anaerobic is pumped up from a deep aquifer reduced iron fe2 is oxidized this iron needs to be removed because it can result in clogging of the distribution pipelines and affects water quality negatively odour colour and staining therefore the water is lead over a sand filter whereby fe oh 3 precipitates on the sand kernels giving origin to the ics bauxite biotite glauconite and olivine are abundantly available mixtures of minerals and can be easily mined in large quantities their main constituents are iron alumina magnesium and silica which make them potentially suitable as psm however in bauxite biotite glauconite and olivine these ions are a structural part of the crystal lattice largely unavailable for surface reactions which only become available over the long term through weathering processes in order to make these ions available for p sorption reactions we subjected them to a pre treatment that simulated enhanced weathering the minerals were ball milled followed by acid pre treatment with hcl 37 1 3 ratio for 2 5 h washed with distilled water and then oven dried de bolle 2013 the physical pre treatment caused an decrease in particle size leading to a higher ssa of the natural minerals the chemical weathering increased the number of reactive sites available for p sorption lyngsie et al 2014 2 2 lab scale experiments 2 2 1 psm characterization 2 2 1 1 elemental and mineral composition for the determination of the full elemental composition of the psm 1 g of the samples was filled in platinum crucibles and combusted in a muffle furnace at 850 c for 30 min then the samples were mixed thoroughly with 2 g of lithium metaborate powder and fused for 15 min at 950 c the resulting residue was dissolved in a 4 nitric acid solution elemental analysis was then performed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes for determination of the mineralogy powder samples were used as starting material x ray diffraction xrd patterns of the samples were collected on a philips x pert system with a pw 3710 base diffractometer equipped with a cu tube anode a secondary graphite beam monochromator a proportional xenon filled detector and a 35 position multiple sample changer the incident beam was automatically collimated the irradiated length was 12 mm the secondary beam side comprised a 0 1 mm receiving slit a soller slit and 1 anti scanner slit the tube was operated at 40 kv and 30 ma and the xrd data were collected in a theta 2 theta geometry from 3 00 onwards at a step of 0 020 2 theta and a count time of 1 s per step 2 2 1 2 phosphate sorption isotherms for the determination of the phosphate sorption isotherms 1 gram of the psm 0 1 g for the ics was shaken on a rotational shaker with 20 ml of a 0 01 m cacl2 solution containing seven different initial p concentrations between 5 and 100 ppm p prepared from a kh2po4 stock solution 1000 ppm p the 0 01 m cacl2 solution was used to mimic the ionic strength of the soil solution mcdowell et al 2008 after 24 h of shaking the test tubes were centrifuged at 1500 g for 15 min and filtered on a 0 45 μm whatmann glass micro filter dissolved p present in the supernatant was measured using the method of murphy riley murphy and riley 1986 for each sample this procedure was performed in triplicate 2 2 1 3 phosphate sorption kinetics phosphate sorption kinetics of the psm were determined in a 0 01 m cacl2 solution containing a low 0 5 ppm p and high 5 0 ppm p p concentration 1 g of the psm 0 1 g of the ics was shaken for 4 20 100 and 500 s in 20 ml of the prepared solutions immediately after shaking the samples were filtered on a 0 45 μm whatmann glass micro filter applying a vacuum in order to minimize additional p sorption during filtration dissolved p present in the resulting liquid samples was determined using the method of murphy riley murphy and riley 1986 each test was performed in triplicate 2 2 2 filter development at lab scale 2 2 2 1 preparation and characterization of filter mixtures the most promising psm as resulting from the p sorption characteristics were used to prepare filter mixtures which were further characterized and tested in filters at lab scale these mixtures were made in order to optimize the hydraulic conductivity and increase the retention times and hence p removal in the filters the ics was mixed with ball milled and acid pre treated glauconite in ratios of 60 40 70 30 80 20 90 10 and 100 0 based on weight basis a small portion 100 g of the mixtures was used to determine the particle size distribution as described by canga et al 2014 this portion was sieved over a range of sieves with mesh sizes varying from 5 00 to 0 05 mm by weighing the amount of filter material left on each sieve dx d10 to d90 values were derived with dx being the mesh size of a sieve that allows x of the filter mixture to pass we then prepared filters at lab scale with these mixtures to determine the bulk density and ksat of the filter mixtures the mixtures were filled in plastic tubes length 30 cm inner diameter 60 mm closed at the bottom with a sintered glass plate type robu porosity 00 to a height of 20 cm the bulk density of the psm was calculated from the empty and filled tubes then the filled tubes were placed underneath a downward oriented volumetric flask to determine the ksat fig 1 by positioning the outlet of the volumetric flask directly under the ponding water level on the filter material a constant water head was created klute 1965 after the first liter of water had passed the filter the discharge through the filter was recorded in three consecutive periods of 1 min the ksat values were then calculated as follows 1 k s a t v l a t δ h with v the liquid volume passing through the filter l the filling height of the filter tube a the cross sectional area of the filter t the time period and δh the water head in our situation 0 25 m 2 2 2 2 evolution of ksat and p removal efficiency of filter mixtures following discussions on practical filter design and limitations with experimental research stations active in monitoring artificial drainage discharge from agricultural fields it was concluded that a filter system should not exceed a total volume of 0 072 m3 length x width x height 0 4 m 0 4 m x 0 45 m to allow easy installation and maintenance these preset filter dimensions combined with the expected peak flows 8 m3 per drainage tube per day d 1 and the maximum available water head difference 0 25 m yielded a minimal needed ksat 4 5 10 4 m s 1 of the psm based on the measured ksat only the filters containing pure ics and ics glauconite mixtures of 10 and 20 glauconite were used in further experiments for a more detailed description of filter dimensioning see supplementary materials s1 for these filter types a filter system at lab scale was developed as shown in fig 2 in this system a 0 01 m cacl2 solution containing 0 50 ppm p a concentration considered common in agricultural drainage water in flanders was pumped from a large supplier vessel towards a smaller buffer vessel in which the water height was kept constant the solution was led over the filters at a constant water head via a supplier tube the water head difference δh for each filter type was adjusted varying from 0 05 m for the pure ics filter to 0 25 m for 80 20 ics glauconite filter in such a way that all filters could be tested under the same peak flow conditions the evolution of ksat and p removal efficiency were monitored by determining the ksat of the filters and the residual p present in the effluent each time 10 liter had passed the filters 2 2 2 3 field scale experiments field scale filters with either pure ics or the 90 10 ics glauconite mixture as psm were built using 65 liter pvc vessels fig 3 the 80 20 ics glauconite filter was not included during field trials because both the ksat and p removal efficiency of this filter strongly decreased over time during the lab scale tests in these vessels a large construction sieve diameter 45 mm mesh size 40 mm was placed on a wooden support and glued to the edges by covering the sieve with a meshed netting type aisi316 mesh size 50 μm a dense and firm support for the psm was obtained a hole was drilled at the bottom of the pvc vessel and connected to a discharge tube depending on the psm pure ics or a 90 10 ics glauconite mixture the discharge tube was led upwards low constant head difference of 0 05 m or left at the bottom high constant head difference of 0 25 m at the top of the vessel another hole was drilled and connected to an overflow this allowed to keep the drain running in case the filter would clog filters were tested at four sites during 10 weeks in the winter of 2016 and or 2017 the sites were selected based on two criteria namely a ortho p concentration in the drain water higher than 0 10 mg p l 1 and the end of the tile drain had to be above the water level of the ditch as in many situations the space between the drainage tube and the water level of the ditch was small 0 10 m the filter with 90 10 ics glauconite with the downward oriented discharge tube filter 4 could only be tested at one site concentrations in the drainage water varied from 0 10 to 0 40 mg ortho p l 1 monitoring of the filters was done on a weekly basis and consisted of discharge measurements from the filter outflow and sampling of the filter in and outlet the filter discharge was determined by recording the time in triplicate to collect two liters of water the water samples were put in a glass jar and stored in a cooling box for transport upon arrival in the lab the dissolved reactive p drp content of the water samples was determined immediately using the method of murphy riley murphy and riley 1986 total p and total dissolved p were not determined as preliminar screening had shown that most p present 90 in the water samples consisted of drp for more information see supplementary material s2 2 3 data analysis the p sorption isotherms were obtained by plotting the sorbed p qe versus the solution equilibrium concentration ce and fitting the langmuir equation equation 1 to these data 2 q e q m a x k a c e 1 k a c e for the p sorption kinetics experiment the amount of p sorbed was plotted against time and fitted to following hyperbolic equation 3 s p s p m a x t k f t where sp is the amount of sorbed p in time t spmax is the maximum amount of p that can be sorbed and kf is a curve fitting parameter related to the p sorption rate the dx values and bulk densities of the filters at lab scale were used as independent variables in a stepwise regression analysis with ksat as dependent variable this should allow to estimate the ksat of future batches of psm all curve fittings and statistical analyses were performed with the r software package r core team 2017 3 results 3 1 psm characteristics 3 1 1 elemental and mineral composition the olivine used in this study is a forsterite and contains iron fe 7 9 fe2o3 as main p sorbing element table 1 despite its potential for p sorption olivine contains very high amounts of nickel ni 3053 mg kg 1 which might pose an environmental risk ics is clearly dominated by fe 62 5 fe2o3 as p sorbing element the biotite used in this study is a phlogopite containing fe and aluminium al in almost equal amounts 8 7 al2o3 and 8 7 fe2o3 and a substantial amount of calcium ca 9 4 cao because biotite does not contain any ca we assume that traces of caco3 were present in the biotite sample we used in bauxite fe 41 1 fe2o3 predominates over al and ca 23 1 al2o3 and 10 4 cao further large amounts of lead pb 187 mg kg 1 and nickel ni 826 mg kg 1 are present in bauxite which might pose environmental risks in glauconite fe 13 3 fe2o3 and al 6 1 al2o3 act as the main p sorbing elements with hardly any ca or mg for a more detailed description of the xrd pattern determination of the psm and findings on the obtained results see supplementary material s3 3 1 2 p sorption isotherms and kinetics the ics had by far the largest p sorption capacity fig 4 and table 2 with a qmax value of 10 510 mg p kg 1 filter material it sorbed highly significantly p 0 0001 more p than the other psm which had a qmax in the order significant at p 0 05 bauxite glauconite biotite olivine the ka values of olivine and biotite 0 132 0 060 liter mg 1 respectively were highly significantly larger p 0 01 than for the other psm table 2 the combined effect of qmax and ka is shown with the qe values calculated at a ce value of 50 mg p l 1 this clearly shows that ics has by far the best p sorption properties followed by pre treated bauxite glauconite olivine and biotite in the kinetics experiment ics showed significantly higher p 0 0001 spmax than the other psm at both low and high p concentrations fig 5 and table 3 sorbing from 2 to 19 times and 5 to 28 times more p at low and high p concentrations respectively based on significantly different spmax the materials were in the order ics bauxite glauconite biotite olivine bauxite and ics had significantly higher p 0 05 p sorption rates kf values than the other psm at low p concentrations at high p concentrations the differences in p sorption rate were smaller based on significantly different k values the materials were in the order bauxite ics olivine biotite glauconite table 3 the combined effect of spmax and kf is shown with the sp value calculated at a t value of 30 s this shows that ics has the highest p sorption affinity followed by bauxite glauconite olivine and biotite 3 2 lab scale filters because of the presence of significant amounts of lead and or nickel we did not further include bauxite and olivine in our lab trials also biotite was excluded because its p sorption capacity was low therefor we decided to focus on ics for further development of filters on lab and field scale furthermore we decided to also look at combinations of ics with glauconite as a means of optimizing the combination of minimum needed hydraulic conductivity to allow peak volumes to be processed with minimum needed residence time to allow sufficient reaction time the choice for glauconite was based on its local availability and low presence of heavy metals 3 2 1 filter characteristics decreasing the ratio of ics over glauconite resulted in a systematic and significant decrease of dx and ksat values from 32 33 10 4 m s 1 for 100 0 to 0 89 10 4 m s 1 for 60 40 and a concomitant increase in bulk density table 4 the stepwise regression analysis with ksat as dependent variable and the dx values and bulk density as independent variables led to a final prediction model characterized by three significant parameters d10 p 0 0024 d40 p 0 0433 and bulk density bd p 0 0002 with ksat expressed in m s 1 d10 and d40 in mm and bulk density in kg m 3 4 k s a t 1 50 10 2 1 15 10 3 d 10 8 70 10 4 d 40 1 02 10 5 b d the relation between estimated with eq 3 and measured ksat fig 6 had a high r2 value 0 969 and low rmse 0 0002 3 2 2 evolution of ksat and p removal efficiency filter characteristics revealed that only filters containing pure ics and ics glauconite mixtures of 10 and 20 glauconite reached a sufficiently high ksat to process peak flows these filters were then further tested in a continuous system with a larger volume of p containing solution 250 l equivalent to about 10 of the total amount of solution that passes a drain on average on yearly basis as described in section 2 2 2 δh for each of the mixtures was adjusted in such a way that all tubes processed equal water flows per unit of time i e 1 3 10 3 l s 1 this water flow is comparable to peak flow conditions at field level under these starting conditions the pure ics filter had retention times of 220 s while the 90 10 and 80 20 ics glauconite mixtures had retention times of 205 and 186 s respectively while the 100 0 and 90 10 filters maintained a ksat of at least 2 1 10 3 and 1 2 10 3 m s 1 respectively ksat in the 80 20 filter dropped below the level of 4 5 10 4 m s 1 which is the minimal anticipated ksat level to process peak flows fig 7 hence under certain circumstances the 80 20 filters might be unable to process peak flows which also contain the highest p loads furthermore the ksat of the 80 20 filter varied significantly stronger coefficient of variation 32 5 than the ksat of the 100 0 and 90 10 filters coefficients of variation of 14 7 and 13 7 indicating that the 80 20 filter is less stable the pure ics filter performed best in terms of p removal efficiency with a more or less constant p concentration of 0 03 mg p l 1 in the leachate in the 90 10 and 80 20 filters the p concentration in the leachate tended to increase after 170 and 90 liters respectively over the entire experiment the pure ics filter removed 93 5 of the p passing the filter cumulatively which was 9 3 significantly p 0 0070 higher than the 80 20 filter whereas there was no significant difference in cumulative p removal with the 90 10 filter 3 3 field trials as the 80 20 ics glauconite filter was less stable and removed less p during lab trials it was decided to conduct field trials with only the pure ics filter and the 90 10 ics glauconite filter based on available test sites four filters were built each of these filters filters 1 2 and 3 pure ics filters and filter 4 90 10 filter were tested during a period of 10 weeks from the second half of november until the end of january during this period the highest precipitation surpluses and drainage discharges were expected the pure ics filters were perfectly capable of processing highly variable drainage discharges fig 8 varying from 0 5 to 1 m3 of water d 1 in dry periods up to 6 m3 d 1 in very wet periods this led to retention times varying from 2700 to 226 s moreover the pure ics filters were never flooded by too high drainage discharges the 90 10 filter was flooded on several occasions when drainage discharge was 4 m3 d 1 and processed drainage discharges varying from 2 to 3 m3 d 1 resulting in retention times of 635 to 424 s the pure ics filters removed 74 1 filter 1 to 92 4 filter 3 of the incoming p these variations in p removal efficiency depended on the drainage discharge rate in periods of high drainage discharges the residence time of the drainage water in the filter is strongly reduced leading to a reduction in p removal efficiency as can be seen for filter 1 relatively constant drainage discharges as is the case for filter 2 resulted in constant p removal efficiency for filter 3 the drainage discharges increased only for a very short period and therefore did not affect the p removal efficiency the 90 10 filter removed on average 57 8 of the incoming p the relatively lower incoming p concentrations and the lower p binding capacity of this filter mixture probably led to a lower p removal efficiency bypass flow occurring when the 90 10 filter was flooded obviously must have further decreased the p removal efficiency of this particular filter but could not be taken into account 4 discussion a wide range of materials rich in fe al ca has been demonstrated to remove p from drainage water both efficiently and at high rates at lab scale cucarella and renman 2009 wendling et al 2013 however to date field scale applications of p filters containing these materials have proven to be laborious and inefficient in their p removal bryant et al 2012 with the development of small scale field filters applicable for individual drainage tubes we demonstrated that p losses via drainage tubes could be reduced greatly and comparable p removal rates and efficiencies could be reached as during lab scale tests in our study screening of potential psm showed that ics and natural minerals with fe as main p fixing element bauxite and glauconite outperformed the other psm in p sorption capacity and rate similar p sorption properties for the tested psm were reported by moelants et al 2011 drizo et al 1999 wendling et al 2013 and lyngsie et al 2014 small differences between these studies and our results are due to variations in the experimental conditions such as the initial p concentration of the solution and the psm to solution ratio cucarella and renman 2009 the fe rich psm performed better than the other non fe dominated psm because fe has a stronger hydrolysing power to form chemical bonds with p and it has a higher affinity for p at a slightly acidic ph hsu 1976 weng et al 2012 drainage water originating from acidic sandy soils which are dominant in our study area is logically often slightly acidic within the fe dominated psm ics had the best p sorption properties for two reasons first of all the relative amount of p sorbing elements fe al ca in the ics was much higher than in the natural minerals used secondly a much smaller part of the p sorbing elements in these minerals can be made available for surface reactions bauxite and olivine both contain relatively high amounts of ni and or pb while no short term leaching of ni and or pb from both untreated bauxite and olivine has been reported in literature the combination of physical and chemical pre treatment obviously will result in an increased risk of ni and or pb leaching moreover long term leaching risks should then be assessed given the intended time for use of such filter materials in field conditions we therefore excluded these materials from further testing after screening ics and acid pre treated glauconite were mixed in diverse ratios to prepare filters at lab scale to monitor the evolution of ksat the ksat values obtained in our study were in line with the results of canga et al 2014 while they strongly exceeded the values reported by chardon et al 2012 this observation is explained by the particle size distribution dx values which in our study was comparable to that of canga et al 2014 and much larger than that in the study of chardon et al 2012 which according to eq 3 results in a larger ksat both eq 3 and the canga et al 2014 equation clearly indicate the small d10 and medium d40 particle sizes to be the most important estimators of ksat in eq 3 the small particle size d10 is positively related to ksat and the medium particle size d40 is negatively related to ksat in the equation of canga et al 2014 both the small and medium particle sizes were positively related to ksat the positive relationships are explained by the fact that bigger particle sizes lead to wider pores within the psm allowing higher flow rates the negative relation of ksat with d40 in our study may be explained by the fact that relatively coarse particles of ics determining d40 were mixed with relatively small particles of acid pre treated glauconite these high d40 values allow within filter movement of the smaller particles glauconite resulting in a heterogeneous pore size distribution of the psm mixture which causes a decrease in ksat chardon et al 2012 furthermore in our study mixing ics with glauconite automatically led to an increase in bulk density which seemed to provide additional significant predictive power for ksat this was not the case in the study of canga et al 2014 probably because of the wide range of materials tested however eq 3 had little predictive power for the ksat values in the study of canga et al 2014 r2 0 23 whereas the equation of canga et al 2014 quite successfully predicted our ksat values r2 0 82 the equation developed by canga et al 2014 thus seems to be more generally applicable the ksat of the three filters with sufficiently high initial ksat decreased over time during the lab scale continuous flow experiment but to a variable extent this decrease was small for the pure ics and the 90 10 ics glauconite filters and was probably caused by aging of the psm sanford et al 1995 for the 80 20 ics glauconite filter the decrease in ksat was more pronounced we assume that next to aging of the psm this was due to within filter movement of the smaller glauconite particles chardon et al 2012 the p removal efficiency of each filter at lab scale was 80 90 which is comparable with efficiencies reported by ayoub et al 2001 nevertheless the longevity i e the period that the p concentration in the effluent is below 0 1 mg p l 1 of filters with a larger share of glauconite was lower because of the smaller p sorption capacity less fe present of these filters and shorter retention times in these filters burst 1958 small scale field filters were developed to process peak volumes of 6 7 m3 day 1 based on the ksat values measured at lab scale however the 90 10 ics glauconite filter could not process volumes larger than 4 m3 day 1 next to aging of the psm le coustumer et al 2012 found that the influx of sediment and development of algae also reduced ksat of filter systems a rough estimate in that study showed that a 1 3 reduction of the available pore space reduced ksat with a factor 10 influx of sediment and growth of algae must also have occurred in the pure ics filters and thus must have also reduced ksat but not to an extent that would limit the water processing capacity even at peak flows it could thus be advisable to quantify this potential clogging effect at lab scale if for practical reasons this is not feasible then one should take into account a sufficiently large margin in ksat to account for a potential decrease in ksat in contrast to the results of penn et al 2007 and bryant et al 2012 our field scale pure ics field filters removed from 70 to 90 of the incoming p main issues that caused the low p removal efficiencies in these former studies were the occurrence of bypass flow and clogging of the filter system as the pure ics filters had a sufficiently large ksat all the incoming water could be processed without any additional maintenance in addition our filters had p removal efficiencies comparable to those in the lab scale tests which is in contrast with results of ayoub et al 2001 who noticed a clear decrease in p removal efficiency due to presence of competing species such as sulphates and dissolved organic matter dom in our study sulphates and dom must have been equally present in the drainage water and we therefore suspect that the upward orientation of the discharge tube must be the main reason for the superior performance in the field this upward orientation of the discharge tube indeed ensures an increased filter residence time during periods below peak flow discharges which allows for an increased reaction time and p removal in the filter the lifespan of our small scale field filters depends on two factors i the period during which the filter reduces p losses below the 0 1 mg p l 1 limit set by the wfd and ii the period during which the filter can process all drainage discharges although the lifespan of the pure ics filters was beyond the period tested in this research these filters are expected to last shorter than the backfill systems described by groenenberg et al 2013 and mcdowell et al 2008 this shorter lifespan is due to the use of much less psm and the higher flow rates in our filter systems nevertheless the psm in our filter systems can be easily recovered and possibly further used for treatment of other wastewater streams with higher p concentrations and longer filter residence times examples include greenhouse wastewater containing p loads varying from 5 to 50 mg p l 1 and allowing filter residence times of 1 h westholm 2006 both ulen et al 2007 and grant et al 1996 state that the amount of drp in drainage water varies widely 20 85 of total p because our field scale filters were only tested in situations where the amount of drp was at least 90 of total p it remains to be seen how efficient these filters would be in situations with higher proportions of particulate p up to now capturing particulate p has only shown to be efficient by constructed wetlands nevertheless installing such wetlands is expensive and undesirable in regions where agricultural land is costly groenenberg et al 2013 therefore the development of a compact filter for particulate p removal may be the next step that needs to be taken to further reduce agricultural p losses in the short term 5 conclusions to date no efficient mitigation options exist for reducing p concentrations in surface waters other than reducing erosive p losses we successfully installed and tested filters for removal of drp from drain water in field conditions with a p removal efficiency between 70 and 90 such system could be easily optimized for fast and reversible installation at individual tile drains given the large area of tile drained fields in areas of intensive agriculture in nw europe and the absence of other efficient mitigation options in level areas this would allow for a rapid and drastic improvement of water quality with respect to p this would buy time until measures taken at the source such as p phytomining start to take effect acknowledgement this research was carried out within the framework of the nuredrain
