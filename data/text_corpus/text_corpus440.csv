2200,river discharge monitoring sites are scarce in high mountain basins especially on the tibetan plateau where rivers are widely distributed the potential for estimating river discharge using remote sensing has been widely utilized for large continental rivers while its application to smaller regional rivers has been limited to address this issue we investigate the reliability of calibrating a hydrological model for two small subbasins lacking discharge data in the upstream region of the heihe river located on the tibetan plateau based solely on multiple pixel ratio mpr data derived from near infrared satellite images using six independent calibration schemes based on discharge or mpr data the value of mpr data for hydrological modeling is explored we first calibrate a model using observed discharge data and nash sutcliffe efficiencies nses based on non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii q nse scheme we then use estimated discharge values derived from mpr data and identify different parameter sets that result in the highest nses in a monte carlo based uncertainty framework q nse 1 q nse 2 and q nse 3 schemes spearman rank coefficients between mpr data and observed discharge data are then used as an alternative way to calibrate the model mpr sr scheme the mpr sr scheme is also applied with a simple water balance filter which removes parameter sets which result in either underestimated or overestimated total discharge volumes mpr srf scheme the babao river basin and yeniugou river basin are used to compare the different calibration schemes and to perform parameter sensitivity analyses the mpr srf calibration scheme achieved better performance in both river basins with nses of 0 63 and 0 62 respectively during the validation period this study demonstrates the potential of the mpr srf calibration scheme to enhance models of small ungauged river basins lacking ground discharge observation data and provides insights into how remote sensing data can be more effectively combined with hydrological modelling keywords near infrared images hydrological model model calibration ungauged basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction river discharge data is essential for understanding earth systems and practically important for flood forecasting catchment management operations water resource management and design of hydraulic structures swain patra 2017 there are considerable hydrological research challenges in complex mountain basins where gauged discharge data are scarce due to the harsh environment and relatively high maintenance costs involved such as the tibetan plateau the tibetan plateau is the origin of many rivers and is known as the water tower of the world viviroli et al 2007 li et al 2016 yu et al 2019 small rivers are widely distributed across the tibetan plateau and these have an important impact on many communities and their livelihoods however current data gaps prevent the investigation of temporal and spatial changes of relevant parameters needed for water resource research in the tibetan plateau region which is critical to support decision making and the design of hydraulic structures required to prevent damage from floods and droughts davids et al 2017 in recent decades remote sensing information has provided an effective alternative approach for monitoring or estimating streamflow empirical relationships between remote sensing data and gauged streamflow have been established and can provide substitutes for rating curves from regular ground observations at gauge stations for example river water surface width has been retrieved from satellite imagery smith et al 1995 smith pavelsky 2008 water stage has been retrieved from radar altimetry tarpanelli et al 2013a huang et al 2018 multivariate river hydraulic measurements has been obtained based on various sensors bjerklie et al 2005 sichangi et al 2016 and inundated channel reflectivity has been retrieved from multispectral images bjerklie et al 2003 lu et al 2010 li et al 2019 tarpanelli et al 2013b presented a single pixel calibration measurement c m approach which used near infrared images and achieved good results but was confined to rivers with channel widths of 200 m to 300 m li et al 2019 presented a multiple pixel ratio mpr method which used near infrared band reflectivity ratios between a reference area and an inundated river channel instead of using a single pixel as in the c m approach in addition the mpr approach allowed the uses of landsat images to monitor the discharge of small rivers with widths greater than 30 m many previous remote sensing studies have mainly focused on monitoring the discharge of large rivers bjerklie et al 2003 sun et al 2018 however it is normally necessary to obtain rating curves between remote sensing data and gauged river discharge before remote sensing data can be used operationally weeser et al 2019 in addition the temporal resolution of such estimates in a specific region depends on the satellite repeat cycle and this may not provide sufficient information about hydrological processes that occur or change at a daily scale such as the generation and movement of floods realizing the limitations of the direct application of satellite observations for monitoring streamflow many researchers have recently tried to calibrate hydrological models e g sun et al 2010 liu et al 2015 and hydraulic models e g domeneghetti et al 2014 using relationships between remote sensing data and discharge such integration of remote sensing and modelling does not modify the model structure and can make optimal use of the advantages of hydrological or hydraulic models and satellite observations and such models can be used to simulate the spatial and temporal variations of streamflow at the same time remote sensing data can be used to calibrate models to provide streamflow estimates at locations that lack any ground truth observational data however previous studies using such methods have mainly been carried out on large continental rivers with river channel widths greater than several hundred meters montanari et al 2009 sun et al 2010 milzow et al 2011 getirana et al 2013 revilla romero et al 2015 wu et al 2022 it has so far proved more difficult to calibrate hydrological models for small river basins with river channel widths less than 100 m due to restrictions in the spatial resolution of remote sensing platforms sun et al 2018 li et al 2019 recent studies have demonstrated that remote sensing data instead of discharge data can be used for model calibration by using monotonic relationships between remote sensing data and discharge mapped using spearman rank coefficients van meerveld et al 2017 jian et al 2017 this approach avoids the need to relate remote sensing data to discharge using rating curves and potentially reduces the uncertainties introduced by the conversion step jian et al 2017 however because total discharge volume information is not taken into account model calibration only using spearman rank correlation coefficients rspear may lead to systematic biases in order to address this limitation there have been different attempts to include additional data during hydrological model calibration to improve the quality of the calibration for example regionalized discharge coefficients from similar basins have been used jian et al 2017 as has filtering acceptable model parameters using annual discharge volumes seibert vis 2016 or using evapotranspiration estimates derived from modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer data weeser et al 2019 however for the latter method the actual evapotranspiration derived from the modis data set cannot be determined precisely for dry climate regimes zhang et al 2020 hence other calibration enhancement methods such as using a simple annual water balance filter should be considered derived from the budyko framework meteorological data and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data to address the problem of the lack of discharge data for hydrological model calibration in ungauged small river basins we here investigate a method of model calibration using mpr data derived from near infrared images of the upstream region of the heihe river basin on the tibetan plateau china the specific objectives of this study are 1 to assess the quality of a calibration method using mpr data derived from near infrared images applied to a hydrological model 2 to compare the uncertainty between the proposed calibration method using mpr data and a traditional calibration method using conventional hydrological data 3 to explore whether model uncertainties can be reduced by applying a simple water balance filter as an additional criterion 2 study area and materials 2 1 study area the babao river and yeniugou river represent the eastern branch of the upper reach of the heihe river basin located on the northeastern tibetan plateau li et al 2020 the babao river basin was selected for the comparison of the different model calibration methods and a parameter sensitivity analysis the yeniugou river basin was used for further verification of the effectiveness of the proposed mpr srf calibration method the outlet hydrological stations monitoring the two river basins are the qilian station and the zhamashike station shown in fig 1 the two rivers are typical braided rivers with the mean channel widths of 91 m and 132 m respectively li et al 2019 the babao river basin drainage area is approximately 2452 km2 with a river length of 104 km the elevation ranging from 2640 m to 5000 m and the average elevation of 3604 m kang et al 2017 the study area is completely within the northeastern tibetan plateau characterized with a perennial snow cover rate of 0 48 and a seasonal snow cover rate of 17 53 li et al 2020 the annual precipitation is approximately 481 mm from 2013 to 2017 table 1 gradually decreasing from southeast to northwest rainfall is concentrated from may to september and snowfall occurs from october to april each year accounting for about 5 of annual precipitation this results in river flows exhibiting obvious seasonal changes zhao et al 2019 the annual mean air temperature is 0 7 c which indicates that a freezing and thawing cycle exists in the study region kang et al 2017 the yeniugou river basin drainage area is approximately 4600 km2 with elevations ranging from 2612 m to 4897 m and climatic conditions and geomorphic features are similar to the babao river basin 2 2 meteorological and hydrological data daily streamflow and precipitation observations recorded at the qilian and yeniugou hydrological stations were obtained from the water resources bulletin of gansu province https www gssl gov cn gauged discharge data from the qilian station was available for the period 2013 to 2017 and discharge data from the zhamashike station was available from 2008 to 2014 meteorological data from the qilian and yeniugou stations were downloaded from the china meteorological network http data cma cn including daily temperature precipitation wind speed and relative humidity the qilian meteorological station is located 1 km upstream of the qilian hydrological station potential evapotranspiration ep was calculated using an improved kinetic model recommended by the china meteorological administration liu wang 1999 i e 1 e p i 22 d i 1 6 u i 1 2 w oi 1 h i p i 1 2 273 2 t i 1 4 where i is the month number epi is the monthly potential evapotranspiration pi is the monthly mean atmospheric pressure ti is the monthly mean air temperature di is the number of days in month i ui is the monthly mean wind speed woi is the saturated water vapor pressure at ti and hi is the monthly mean relative humidity 2 3 satellite images landsat images were obtained from the oli landsat 8 and etm landsat 7 sensors near infrared nir images were used in this study namely the oli 0 845 0 885 μm and etm 0 775 0 90 μm images the spatial resolution of the two sensors in the nir band was 30 m we only selected images without cloud interference in the inundated and reference areas around the qilian station for the babao river basin a total of 34 oli images from 21 july 2013 to 18 december 2015 were obtained and for the yeniugou river basin a total of 33 oli and etm images from 11 january 2012 to 11 october 2014 were obtained these images were atmospherically corrected and obtained from the google earth engine platform https earthengine google com landsat surface reflectance tier 1 dataset 3 methodology a new calibration scheme for a hydrological model without any discharge gauging data is developed here and is summarized in fig 2 the method consists of three major steps 1 the calculation of mpr data using selected near infrared satellite images 2 use of spearman rank coefficients to calibrate the hydrological model using the mpr data and 3 use a simple water balance filter to obtain acceptable model outputs 3 1 mpr data generation the single pixel c m method is widely used to remotely monitor river discharge the principle of this method is that the reflectivity ratio between a reference region and an inundated region close to a river is positively correlated with river discharge brakenridge et al 2007 tarpanelli et al 2013b van dijk et al 2016 sahoo et al 2020 however this method cannot accurately monitor the discharge of small rivers when using landsat images due to the width and variability of small river channels width less than 100 m li et al 2019 the mpr method was developed to monitoring the discharge of small rivers based on the relationship between river discharge and the near infrared reflectivity li et al 2019 this method overcomes the errors caused by the extraction of river width in the c m method and solves the problem that a continuously varying river width cannot be extracted due to the limitation of image spatial resolution the mpr method achieves this by using the mean value of multiple pixels in a reference region and a selected inundated region and can be used with landsat images to monitor the discharge of small rivers with widths greater than 30 m in this study we adopted the mpr method in our model calibration framework the mpr calculation is described as follows 2 p c m 1 n i 1 n c i 1 w l j 1 w l m j where p is the reflectivity ratio between c and m c is the mean reflectivity of all pixels in a reference region and m is the mean reflectivity of all pixels in a selected inundated region fig 3 the terms i and j represent the number of pixels in the reference region and the selected inundated region respectively the terms w and l are the width and length of the selected inundated region respectively in units of image pixels fig 4 presents the relationship between the reflectivity ratio derived from near infrared images and observed daily streamflow for a selected inundated region located near the qilian monitoring station we used 150 m the five landsat pixels 30 m 5 as the shortest length of the selected inundated region which was approximately 2 000 m upstream from the qilian hydrological station this follows the selection methodology presented in previous study li et al 2019 a 600 m length i e twenty 30 m landsat pixels was selected due to better stability of results the reference region was located near the monitored river reach and had high and stable reflectivity to ensure homogeneous high reflectivity we selected a gentle slope of the high mountainous region as the reference region the reflectivity of the selected inundated region was sensitive to river discharge variations 3 2 hydrological model setup a daily step lumped conceptual model named cemaneige gr4j was used to test the potential for using mpr data for hydrological model calibration as the chosen study area was located on the northeastern tibetan plateau and is covered with snow throughout the year the cemaneige snow module was added to the gr4j hydrological model to simulate the evolution of snow cover on the catchment and to estimate its melt at the outlet of snow influenced catchments valéry et al 2014a we selected this model for its relatively simple structure and small number of calibration parameters the cemaneige gr4j forcing data includes rainfall runoff and potential evapotranspiration the cemaneige gr4j model has been applied to several river basins worldwide in studies related to uncertainty analysis in hydrological modeling e g seiller et al 2012 valéry et al 2014b the gr4j model has been proven to exhibit good performance in cold and mountainous areas hao et al 2022 and the cemaneige snow module coupled with gr4j hydrological model has been shown to achieve better performance in french swiss swedish and canadian study areas riboust et al 2019 the gr4j model is a daily lumped rainfall runoff model which has four parameters x1 x2 x3 and x4 which are optimized during calibration the model uses two non linear reservoirs to calculate runoff yield and concentration valéry et al 2014b the first reservoir is called the production store and the second reservoir is called the routing store the two flow components together are divided into 90 of the flow which is routed through the unit hydrograph and then through the non linear routing store while 10 of the flow is routed through the single unit hydrograph the time lag between precipitation events and the corresponding peak discharge can be simulated with these two hydrographs tian et al 2013 the cemaneige snow module is a daily two parameter x5 x6 semi distributed snow accounting routine hence the cemaneige gr4j model has 6 parameters in total which are used for model calibration the mean and value ranges of these six parameters are listed in table 2 3 3 model calibration and validation the data time series were split up into a warm up period for the babao river basin 1 january 2012 to 31 december 2012 a calibration period 1 january 2013 to 31 december 2015 and a validation period 1 january 2016 to 31 december 2017 we followed a monte carlo based calibration method and quantified model parameter uncertainty model performance was evaluated using four objective functions i e nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the coefficient of determination r2 the percent bias bias the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 these functions were calculated as follows 3 nse 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 4 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s 2 i 1 n o i o 2 s i s 2 5 bias i 1 n o i s i i 1 n o i 6 kge 1 r 1 2 σ sim σ obs 1 2 μ sim μ obs 1 2 where oi is the ith observation si is the ith simulation s and o are the mean of the simulations and observations respectively r is the linear correlation between observations and simulations σ obs is the standard deviation in the observations σ sim is the standard deviation in the simulations μ sim is the simulation mean and μ obs is the observation mean nse values mainly evaluate model performance during high flow periods because it is mainly affected by flood peaks bias values indicate the tendency of underestimation or overestimation of the simulated discharge during the whole simulation period kge values indicate the ratios of means and the ratios of dispersion and correlation of the simulations and observations a total of 105 parameters sets were generated for the calibration process within set parameter ranges using latin hypercube sampling mckay et al 1979 and these are summarized in table 2 3 3 1 using spearman rank coefficients to calibrate with mpr data to calibrate the hydrological model using the mpr data we took advantage of the fact that the mpr data are dynamically linked to streamflow variation and that they can therefore be compared against modeled streamflow using the spearman rank correlation coefficient rspear seibert vis 2016 calculated using 7 ρ i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where xi is the ith mpr data yi is the ith discharge simulation and x and y are the mean of the mpr data and discharge simulation respectively ranging from 1 to 1 an rspear value close to 1 indicates that the simulated streamflow and the retrieved mpr data reproduce the same variability and that the mpr data and streamflow values are strictly monotonically related regardless of the shape of the relation rspear values are not affected if strictly monotonic increasing or decreasing functions are used to transform the sample data since rspear only reflects the similarity of the variability between gauged discharge data and mpr data and does not reflect the absolute volumes a value of 1 does not ensure a perfect fit seibert vis 2016 therefore the threshold definition of a behavioral parameter set cannot be similar to calibration based on objective function such as nse instead we suggest that a behavioral parameter set should be selected by sorting all model runs according to their relative rspear values and the parameter sets with the highest rspear should be selected in this study we selected behavioral parameter sets by taking the best 2 of 105 model runs resulting in 2 000 parameter sets in order to ensure the comparability of the different calibration schemes the same procedure of taking the best 2 was adopted when the model was calibrated using discharge data 3 3 2 water balance filter mpr data instead of discharge data can be used for model calibration by using the monotonic relationship between the mpr data and discharge data mapped using the spearman rank coefficient this step avoids the need to convert mpr values into discharge values and hence potentially reduces the uncertainties potentially caused by this conversion however this method may lead to a systematic deviation because information describing total water volume is not considered as stated above a risk exists that a hydrological model might be biased when only calibrated with mpr data and that such a model may produce overestimated or underestimated modelled runoffs therefore a simple annual water balance filter was added to the above model and acceptable model output was obtained by selecting only those parameters sets which resulted in high rspear values and an additional sets was selected which matched a simplified water balance referred to as the mpr srf scheme fig 2 the annual runoff depth was calculated by using the observed precipitation minus the average actual evapotranspiration etact assuming that possible change in catchment storage can be considered small enough to be ignored over a period of serval years in addition we added a subjective confidence interval of 20 to account for measurement errors unknown uncertainties and possible storage changes etact was calculated using the budyko equation i e e p f ep p where ep refers to the mean annual potential evapotranspiration the equation developed by fu 1981 and recommended by zhang et al 2004 has been widely used and has the following form 8 e p 1 ep p 1 ep p ω 1 ω where e is the mean annual actual evapotranspiration ep refers to the mean annual potential evapotranspiration we then used the semi empirical equation proposed by li et al 2013 to calculate the empirical parameter ω based solely on remotely sensed vegetation information this simple parameterization for the basin specific ω has achieved good performance in modeling annual evapotranspiration 9 ω 2 36 m 1 16 the vegetation coverage m which represents the fraction of total ground surface covered by vegetation was estimated using the following equation yang et al 2009 10 m ndvi n d v i min ndv i max n d v i min where ndvimax and ndvimin are the ndvi values of dense green vegetation and bare soil respectively as described in previous studies yang et al 2009 li et al 2013 ndvimax and ndvimin are global constants that are independent of vegetation soil type as was demonstrated by gutman and ignatov 1998 in our study we used an ndvimax value for dense forest of 0 80 and an ndvimin value for bare soil of 0 05 as described by yang et al 2009 we estimated that the average etact value for the babao river basin from 2013 to 2015 was 273 5 mm year which was calculated using water balance formula and neglecting storage changes based on gauged discharge data the annual etact was 286 1 mm year for the babao river basin during the period 2013 to 2015 based on budyko equation which was 4 6 more than the value determined based on observed data in order to account for possible storage changes and measurements errors we added a subjective confidence interval of 20 resulting in an annual runoff depth of between 455 9 mm and 683 9 mm during the period 2013 to 2015 within the study area 3 3 3 calibration schemes the construction simulation and parameter calibration of the cemaneigegr4j model are realized using the rstudio software platform six independent calibration schemes were carried out to evaluate the value of mpr data and the water balance filter for model calibration we first calibrated the model based on the observed discharge data using the nse based method and the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii the q nse scheme in total 105 parameter sets were generated for the calibration process using latin hypercube sampling within predefined parameter ranges table 2 we selected behavioral parameter sets by ranking all model runs by their associated nse values and taking the top set in this study we defined behavioral parameter sets by taking three different best percentages of the 105 runs resulting in 100 1000 and 2 000 parameters the q nse 1 q nse 2 and q nse 3 schemes respectively mpr data was then used to identifiy 2000 parameter sets that resulted in the highest spearman rank coefficients based on the latin hypercube sampling framework the mpr sr scheme finally the mpr sr scheme was filtered using the water balance filter the mpr srf scheme see fig 2 4 results 4 1 calibration using discharge data the model achieved good simulation performance when the parameters were calibrated against discharge data using the q nse scheme fig 5 with the values of nse kge bias and r2 of 0 71 0 69 1 8 and 0 71 during calibration respectively table 3 the q nse scheme also achieved good performance results during the validation period with an nse value of 0 73 a kge value of 0 72 a bias value of 5 8 and an r2 value of 0 76 for the other calibration schemes based on the monte carlo based uncertainty framework the three objective functions of simulated discharge at the 50 quantile were calculated the q nse 1 q nse 2 and q nse 3 calibration schemes obtained satisfactory performance results among all parameter sets the identified 100 sets with the highest nse values i e scheme q nse 1 achieved an nse of 0 7 a kge of 0 63 a bias of 7 7 and an r2 of 0 75 however the performance of the model simulations became worse as the number of behavioral parameter sets increased to 1000 q nse 2 scheme and 2000 q nse 3 scheme indicating that there was a deterioration in the capability for accurate reproduction of discharge different percentage parameter sets which selected by ranking all model runs by their associated nse illustrate the uncertainty of simulation results clearly more behavioral parameter sets led to increasingly poorer simulation quality and increases in the uncertainty of the simulation results on the contrary fewer behavioral parameter sets resulted in better simulation results 4 2 calibration using mpr data the model predicted the observed discharges beyond acceptable ranges when calibrated and validated against the mpr data in a monte carlo based uncertainty framework without applying the water balance filter during the validation period the mpr sr calibration scheme provided unsatisfactory performance results with an nse value of 0 24 a kge value of 0 04 and a bias value of 73 4 however the r2 value of the simulated discharge at the 50 quantile was 0 73 indicating that the mpr sr scheme results had good correlation with the observed discharge temporal variability but there were obvious errors in the total discharge volumes fig 6 4 3 effects of the water balance filter applying the water balance filter in the mpr srf calibration scheme improved the model performance during the calibration period notably compared to the mpr sr scheme according to three objective functions of simulated discharge at the 50 quantile the nse value increased from 0 31 to 0 62 the kge value decreased from 0 04 to 0 58 the bias value decreased from 71 2 to 6 7 and the r2 value increased from 0 64 to 0 66 this result is similar to that of a previous study in the region which used the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model dhsvm model calibrated using 4 years of daily discharge zhao et al 2019 the mpr srf calibration scheme of simulated discharge at the 50 quantile also achieved good performance results during validation period with an nse value of 0 62 a kge value of 0 58 a bias value of 15 9 and an r2 value of 0 72 hence the hydrological model calibrated with mpr data combined with the water balance filter in the mpr srf scheme predicted river discharge almost as well as when the model was calibrated using observed discharge data fig 5 presents the simulated discharge time series during the calibration period for the q nse scheme and the mpr srf scheme clearly showing differences between the two different calibration schemes although temporal variations in discharge were simulated well by the model when calibrated using both schemes in general both the q nse scheme and the mpr srf scheme tended to slightly overestimate dry season discharge but the q nse scheme overestimated more obviously however both schemes resulted in similar lower discharge in wet seasons the modeled discharge time series during the validation period for the mpr sr mpr srf and q nse schemes can be seen in fig 6 the timing and magnitude of discharges were reproduced well except by the mpr sr scheme during the validation period the similarities and differences between the q nse scheme and the mpr srf scheme were similar as during the calibration period however the total discharge volumes deviated from the observed discharges for the mpr sr scheme which was also reflected in the large bias value 4 4 parameter sensitivity analysis fig 7 presents the posterior distribution of model parameters using the different calibration schemes among the six parameters x1 x2 and x3 were relatively sensitive to the calibration data for the q nse 1 q nse 2 and q nse 3 calibration schemes the range of the posterior distribution of model parameters increased with the number of behavioral parameter sets indicating that the uncertainty became more obvious with a larger number of sets however the water exchange coefficient parameter x2 was not sensitive in the mpr sr scheme suggesting that the total discharge volumes were mainly affected by parameter x2 which was also reflected in the bias values 4 5 further application of the mpr srf calibration scheme to an ungauged river basin in order to further verify the effectiveness of the mpr srf calibration scheme we used simulations of the yeniugou river to show the applicability of our method in a different river basin fig 8 presents the modeled discharge time series during the calibration and validation periods using the mpr srf and the q nse schemes this figure underlines the better performance of mpr srf calibration method the traditional calibration method achieved good performance results with an nse value of 0 67 a kge value of 0 81 a bias value of 1 7 and an r2 value of 0 68 during the validation period table 4 compared with using the traditional calibration method the simulated discharge at the 50 quantile using the mpr srf calibration scheme also achieved good performance results with an nse of 0 62 a kge of 0 79 a bias of 2 7 and an r2 of 0 64 during the validation period 5 discussion to date integrating remote sensing information into hydrological monitoring remains uncommon with only a few studies which examine the usefulness of remote sensing data for model calibration sun et al 2010 milzow et al 2011 liu et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 huang et al 2020 all of these limited studies have been carried out using large continental rivers i e river channel widths greater than several hundred meters due to restrictions in the spatial resolution of remote sensing platforms our study demonstrates the potential of using mpr data derived from near infrared images to calibrate daily scale hydrological models in small river basins i e river channels on the order of 100 m wide this kind of method is only applicable to rivers having mpr variations that are sensitive to variations in discharge we found that the model calibrated with mpr data combined with a water balance filter can perform well for daily discharge simulation in terms of model accuracies compared to traditional calibration methods but can exhibit greater uncertainties and overestimations of total discharge volumes 5 1 assessing model performance through spearman rank coefficient rspear values were used to identify behavioral parameter sets during calibration and allowed a comparison of the variability of simulated discharges and mpr data but information related to the total discharge volumes was not provided jian et al 2017 weeser et al 2019 values close to one were obtained when mpr data and gauged discharge were monotonically correlated regardless of the shape of the relation this suggests that as long as simulated discharges and derived mpr data rise and fall concurrently a high value for this goodness of fit measure can be obtained seibert vis 2016 the effects of selecting different numbers of behavior parameter sets on model calibration can be compared using rspear as the objective function in this study we ranked all parameter sets by their rspear values and chose the top set 100 1000 and 2000 runs as behavioral parameter sets the uncertainty of model simulation was more obvious with increased numbers of behavioral parameter sets however the behavioral parameter sets screened using rspear need to be further filtered through a simple water balance filter therefore if the number of behavioral parameter sets screened using rspear is too small many effective parameter sets will be removed which increases the uncertainty in the resulting simulated discharge to a certain extent advantages of using rspear are that there is no need to estimate extra inverse rating curve functions with additional associated uncertainties jian et al 2017 and that mpr data can be directly used to calibrate discharge models this avoids expensive discharge measurements which require specialist equipment and expert knowledge often not available in challenging and remote natural environment regions such as the tibetan plateau calibration methods based on mpr data rely heavily on the resolution and availability of remote sensing data data availability may improve when the future surface water and ocean topography swot satellite mission is launched durand et al 2010 this mission could help provide estimates of changes in terrestrial water storage and inundation extent for rivers wider than 50 m at a global scale pavelsky et al 2014 yoon et al 2016 hydraulic information of rivers at different spatial and temporal scales will become available and will be able to be used to calibrate hydrological model sichangi et al 2016 showed that estimating discharge using water level and river width observation data simultaneously is better than using only hydraulic geometry information 5 2 the value of a water balance filter as shown above a risk exists that a hydrological model might be biased when only calibrated with mpr data seibert and vis 2016 calibrated a model for more than 600 river basins in the united states using daily water level and streamflow data assessed using rspear their study revealed that models that were calibrated from water levels performed well in wet basins where the precipitation input was higher than the potential evapotranspiration but performed poorly in drier basins our results confirmed these findings the mpr sr calibration scheme resulted in obvious errors in the simulated total discharge volumes these results suggest that a more intense testing of the calibration method under different climatic zones is needed seibert and vis 2016 suggested that better discharge volume information can improve model results for drier basins and indicated the need for further research in this field weeser et al 2019 tested the added value of a water balance filter which derived evapotranspiration etact value from modis data based on a parameter set selection that reduced the risk of biased model calibration the uncertainty of evapotranspiration derived using the budyko framework or the modis data set cannot be determined precisely since it depends on various local factors weeser et al 2019 when we compared the etact values derived using the budyko framework to those derived using a simple water balance method with observed precipitation minus the observed discharge and neglected storage changes senay et al 2011 we found an overestimation of 4 6 the resulting water balance filter range falls within the measured discharge values after applying an uncertainty compensation of 20 the mpr srf results indicated that model simulation efficiencies were improved when behavioral parameter sets of the mpr sr calibraiton scheme were further filtered in the mpr srf scheme the filter effectively removed behavioral parameter sets that resulted in total discharge volume underestimation therefore adding such a simple filter in the process of posteriori model selection can effectively reduce the inherent bias of model calibration with rspear as the objective function 5 3 the role of input mpr data besides mpr data we used precipitation and temperature data from hydrometeorological stations to demonstrate the feasibility of calibrating a model using mpr data mpr data derived from near infrared images can be available for most river basins particularly in regions where in situ monitoring networks are sparse li et al 2019 however selecting a suitable reference region and inundated region is critical to establish the correlation between discharge and mpr data li et al 2019 suggested selecting the gentle slope area of high mountains as the reference region in addition the shape of the inundated region and its location are important factors influencing the resulting correlation between simulated and observed discharge tarpanelli et al 2013b in this study the width of the inundated region was approximately equal to the maximum flood coverage the length and location of the inundated region were also closely related to the correlation between observed discharge and mpr data li et al 2019 we selected a downstream area 1 500 2 000 m away from the hydrological station as the inundated region where the influence of a bridge and the hydrological station construction on river state was negligible and the mpr data and observed discharge at the station maintained a close correlation li et al 2019 previous studies have found that there is a power function rating curve relationship between mpr data and daily gauged discharge which can be further studied by converting the objective function from daily gauged discharge to mpr data to calibrate a model sun et al 2018 li et al 2019 5 4 applicability of the mpr srf method the proposed mpr srf calibration scheme significantly expands the range of rivers that can be simulated using remote sensing images to calibrate hydrological models the results of this study clearly demonstrate the potential for using mpr data derived from near infrared images to calibrate hydrological models in mid size and small regional rivers having river channel widths greater than 30 m it is noted that the mpr srf calibration scheme is only applicable to discharge estimation in ungauged basins where discharge variations are highly correlated with the inundated extent most small rivers on the tibetan plateau are shallow braided rivers thus the mpr srf method is suitable previous studies have mainly focused on calibrating hydrological models for large river basins sun et al 2010 2015 milzow et al 2011 domeneghetti et al 2014 liu et al 2015 the proposed mpr srf calibration schemes produced comparable results to the discharge based calibration the increased uncertainty is therefore mainly induced by using the rspear and only marginally by the mpr data itself the mpr data only led to a decrease of the relative performance of around 5 for the nse bias and r2 error estimates during calibration mpr srf in comparison to the discharge based calibration q nse the conceptual model cemaneige gr4j used in this study has only six parameters which allowed a consistent calibration and avoided over parameterization kirchner 2006 in addition the model can be easily applied to ungauged basins because of the few parameters involved a more complex spatially distributed hydrological model might have benefits by providing the opportunity to use measured data from various sources and locations and integrate them into the model approach starkey et al 2017 in the future it is necessary to further investigate the performance of mpr data evaluate the calibration effect of hydrological models under different land use and climatic conditions and discuss the uncertainty of mpr data and water balance filters in calibrating small watersheds in ungauged basins 6 conclusions this study attempts at investigating the potential use of mpr data obtained from near infrared images for calibrating hydrological models for ungauged mid size and small river basins based on the study area of the babao and yeniugou river basin on the tibetan plateau the main conclusions are as follows 1 a hydrological model calibrated based solely on mpr data derived from remote sensing images estimated discharge with satisfactory accuracy however greater simulation uncertainty was observed compared with typical or traditional calibration using actual discharge data 2 by applying a simple water balance filter it was possible to achieve model efficiencies similar to those obtained from traditional calibration using gauged discharge we used a parsimonious water balance derived from a budyko framework and measured meteorological data avoiding data intense estimates combining the water balance filter with the conceptual model increased calibration reliability the filter can remove those parameter sets that result in total discharge volumes that are overestimated or underestimated and which can occur when only using the spearman rank correlation as an objective function 3 the mpr srf calibration scheme proposed here extends the range of model calibration to small river basins and provides an alternative for gauge stations that are not operational in some regions further studies will explore whether the approach is effective in different climatic and geophysical catchments

2200,river discharge monitoring sites are scarce in high mountain basins especially on the tibetan plateau where rivers are widely distributed the potential for estimating river discharge using remote sensing has been widely utilized for large continental rivers while its application to smaller regional rivers has been limited to address this issue we investigate the reliability of calibrating a hydrological model for two small subbasins lacking discharge data in the upstream region of the heihe river located on the tibetan plateau based solely on multiple pixel ratio mpr data derived from near infrared satellite images using six independent calibration schemes based on discharge or mpr data the value of mpr data for hydrological modeling is explored we first calibrate a model using observed discharge data and nash sutcliffe efficiencies nses based on non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii q nse scheme we then use estimated discharge values derived from mpr data and identify different parameter sets that result in the highest nses in a monte carlo based uncertainty framework q nse 1 q nse 2 and q nse 3 schemes spearman rank coefficients between mpr data and observed discharge data are then used as an alternative way to calibrate the model mpr sr scheme the mpr sr scheme is also applied with a simple water balance filter which removes parameter sets which result in either underestimated or overestimated total discharge volumes mpr srf scheme the babao river basin and yeniugou river basin are used to compare the different calibration schemes and to perform parameter sensitivity analyses the mpr srf calibration scheme achieved better performance in both river basins with nses of 0 63 and 0 62 respectively during the validation period this study demonstrates the potential of the mpr srf calibration scheme to enhance models of small ungauged river basins lacking ground discharge observation data and provides insights into how remote sensing data can be more effectively combined with hydrological modelling keywords near infrared images hydrological model model calibration ungauged basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction river discharge data is essential for understanding earth systems and practically important for flood forecasting catchment management operations water resource management and design of hydraulic structures swain patra 2017 there are considerable hydrological research challenges in complex mountain basins where gauged discharge data are scarce due to the harsh environment and relatively high maintenance costs involved such as the tibetan plateau the tibetan plateau is the origin of many rivers and is known as the water tower of the world viviroli et al 2007 li et al 2016 yu et al 2019 small rivers are widely distributed across the tibetan plateau and these have an important impact on many communities and their livelihoods however current data gaps prevent the investigation of temporal and spatial changes of relevant parameters needed for water resource research in the tibetan plateau region which is critical to support decision making and the design of hydraulic structures required to prevent damage from floods and droughts davids et al 2017 in recent decades remote sensing information has provided an effective alternative approach for monitoring or estimating streamflow empirical relationships between remote sensing data and gauged streamflow have been established and can provide substitutes for rating curves from regular ground observations at gauge stations for example river water surface width has been retrieved from satellite imagery smith et al 1995 smith pavelsky 2008 water stage has been retrieved from radar altimetry tarpanelli et al 2013a huang et al 2018 multivariate river hydraulic measurements has been obtained based on various sensors bjerklie et al 2005 sichangi et al 2016 and inundated channel reflectivity has been retrieved from multispectral images bjerklie et al 2003 lu et al 2010 li et al 2019 tarpanelli et al 2013b presented a single pixel calibration measurement c m approach which used near infrared images and achieved good results but was confined to rivers with channel widths of 200 m to 300 m li et al 2019 presented a multiple pixel ratio mpr method which used near infrared band reflectivity ratios between a reference area and an inundated river channel instead of using a single pixel as in the c m approach in addition the mpr approach allowed the uses of landsat images to monitor the discharge of small rivers with widths greater than 30 m many previous remote sensing studies have mainly focused on monitoring the discharge of large rivers bjerklie et al 2003 sun et al 2018 however it is normally necessary to obtain rating curves between remote sensing data and gauged river discharge before remote sensing data can be used operationally weeser et al 2019 in addition the temporal resolution of such estimates in a specific region depends on the satellite repeat cycle and this may not provide sufficient information about hydrological processes that occur or change at a daily scale such as the generation and movement of floods realizing the limitations of the direct application of satellite observations for monitoring streamflow many researchers have recently tried to calibrate hydrological models e g sun et al 2010 liu et al 2015 and hydraulic models e g domeneghetti et al 2014 using relationships between remote sensing data and discharge such integration of remote sensing and modelling does not modify the model structure and can make optimal use of the advantages of hydrological or hydraulic models and satellite observations and such models can be used to simulate the spatial and temporal variations of streamflow at the same time remote sensing data can be used to calibrate models to provide streamflow estimates at locations that lack any ground truth observational data however previous studies using such methods have mainly been carried out on large continental rivers with river channel widths greater than several hundred meters montanari et al 2009 sun et al 2010 milzow et al 2011 getirana et al 2013 revilla romero et al 2015 wu et al 2022 it has so far proved more difficult to calibrate hydrological models for small river basins with river channel widths less than 100 m due to restrictions in the spatial resolution of remote sensing platforms sun et al 2018 li et al 2019 recent studies have demonstrated that remote sensing data instead of discharge data can be used for model calibration by using monotonic relationships between remote sensing data and discharge mapped using spearman rank coefficients van meerveld et al 2017 jian et al 2017 this approach avoids the need to relate remote sensing data to discharge using rating curves and potentially reduces the uncertainties introduced by the conversion step jian et al 2017 however because total discharge volume information is not taken into account model calibration only using spearman rank correlation coefficients rspear may lead to systematic biases in order to address this limitation there have been different attempts to include additional data during hydrological model calibration to improve the quality of the calibration for example regionalized discharge coefficients from similar basins have been used jian et al 2017 as has filtering acceptable model parameters using annual discharge volumes seibert vis 2016 or using evapotranspiration estimates derived from modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer data weeser et al 2019 however for the latter method the actual evapotranspiration derived from the modis data set cannot be determined precisely for dry climate regimes zhang et al 2020 hence other calibration enhancement methods such as using a simple annual water balance filter should be considered derived from the budyko framework meteorological data and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data to address the problem of the lack of discharge data for hydrological model calibration in ungauged small river basins we here investigate a method of model calibration using mpr data derived from near infrared images of the upstream region of the heihe river basin on the tibetan plateau china the specific objectives of this study are 1 to assess the quality of a calibration method using mpr data derived from near infrared images applied to a hydrological model 2 to compare the uncertainty between the proposed calibration method using mpr data and a traditional calibration method using conventional hydrological data 3 to explore whether model uncertainties can be reduced by applying a simple water balance filter as an additional criterion 2 study area and materials 2 1 study area the babao river and yeniugou river represent the eastern branch of the upper reach of the heihe river basin located on the northeastern tibetan plateau li et al 2020 the babao river basin was selected for the comparison of the different model calibration methods and a parameter sensitivity analysis the yeniugou river basin was used for further verification of the effectiveness of the proposed mpr srf calibration method the outlet hydrological stations monitoring the two river basins are the qilian station and the zhamashike station shown in fig 1 the two rivers are typical braided rivers with the mean channel widths of 91 m and 132 m respectively li et al 2019 the babao river basin drainage area is approximately 2452 km2 with a river length of 104 km the elevation ranging from 2640 m to 5000 m and the average elevation of 3604 m kang et al 2017 the study area is completely within the northeastern tibetan plateau characterized with a perennial snow cover rate of 0 48 and a seasonal snow cover rate of 17 53 li et al 2020 the annual precipitation is approximately 481 mm from 2013 to 2017 table 1 gradually decreasing from southeast to northwest rainfall is concentrated from may to september and snowfall occurs from october to april each year accounting for about 5 of annual precipitation this results in river flows exhibiting obvious seasonal changes zhao et al 2019 the annual mean air temperature is 0 7 c which indicates that a freezing and thawing cycle exists in the study region kang et al 2017 the yeniugou river basin drainage area is approximately 4600 km2 with elevations ranging from 2612 m to 4897 m and climatic conditions and geomorphic features are similar to the babao river basin 2 2 meteorological and hydrological data daily streamflow and precipitation observations recorded at the qilian and yeniugou hydrological stations were obtained from the water resources bulletin of gansu province https www gssl gov cn gauged discharge data from the qilian station was available for the period 2013 to 2017 and discharge data from the zhamashike station was available from 2008 to 2014 meteorological data from the qilian and yeniugou stations were downloaded from the china meteorological network http data cma cn including daily temperature precipitation wind speed and relative humidity the qilian meteorological station is located 1 km upstream of the qilian hydrological station potential evapotranspiration ep was calculated using an improved kinetic model recommended by the china meteorological administration liu wang 1999 i e 1 e p i 22 d i 1 6 u i 1 2 w oi 1 h i p i 1 2 273 2 t i 1 4 where i is the month number epi is the monthly potential evapotranspiration pi is the

the monthly mean relative humidity 2 3 satellite images landsat images were obtained from the oli landsat 8 and etm landsat 7 sensors near infrared nir images were used in this study namely the oli 0 845 0 885 μm and etm 0 775 0 90 μm images the spatial resolution of the two sensors in the nir band was 30 m we only selected images without cloud interference in the inundated and reference areas around the qilian station for the babao river basin a total of 34 oli images from 21 july 2013 to 18 december 2015 were obtained and for the yeniugou river basin a total of 33 oli and etm images from 11 january 2012 to 11 october 2014 were obtained these images were atmospherically corrected and obtained from the google earth engine platform https earthengine google com landsat surface reflectance tier 1 dataset 3 methodology a new calibration scheme for a hydrological model without any discharge gauging data is developed here and is summarized in fig 2 the method consists of three major steps 1 the calculation of mpr data using selected near infrared satellite images 2 use of spearman rank coefficients to calibrate the hydrological model using the mpr data and 3 use a simple water balance filter to obtain acceptable model outputs 3 1 mpr data generation the single pixel c m method is widely used to remotely monitor river discharge the principle of this method is that the reflectivity ratio between a reference region and an inundated region close to a river is positively correlated with river discharge brakenridge et al 2007 tarpanelli et al 2013b van dijk et al 2016 sahoo et al 2020 however this method cannot accurately monitor the discharge of small rivers when using landsat images due to the width and variability of small river channels width less than 100 m li et al 2019 the mpr method was developed to monitoring the discharge of small rivers based on the relationship between river discharge and the near infrared reflectivity li et al 2019 this method overcomes the errors caused by the extraction of river width in the c m method and solves the problem that a continuously varying river width cannot be extracted due to the limitation of image spatial resolution the mpr method achieves this by using the mean value of multiple pixels in a reference region and a selected inundated region and can be used with landsat images to monitor the discharge of small rivers with widths greater than 30 m in this study we adopted the mpr method in our model calibration framework the mpr calculation is described as follows 2 p c m 1 n i 1 n c i 1 w l j 1 w l m j where p is the reflectivity ratio between c and m c is the mean reflectivity of all pixels in a reference region and m is the mean reflectivity of all pixels in a selected inundated region fig 3 the terms i and j represent the number of pixels in the reference region and the selected inundated region respectively the terms w and l are the width and length of the selected inundated region respectively in units of image pixels fig 4 presents the relationship between the reflectivity ratio derived from near infrared images and observed daily streamflow for a selected inundated region located near the qilian monitoring station we used 150 m the five landsat pixels 30 m 5 as the shortest length of the selected inundated region which was approximately 2 000 m upstream from the qilian hydrological station this follows the selection methodology presented in previous study li et al 2019 a 600 m length i e twenty 30 m landsat pixels was selected due to better stability of results the reference region was located near the monitored river reach and had high and stable reflectivity to ensure homogeneous high reflectivity we selected a gentle slope of the high mountainous region as the reference region the reflectivity of the selected inundated region was sensitive to river discharge variations 3 2 hydrological model setup a daily step lumped conceptual model named cemaneige gr4j was used to test the potential for using mpr data for hydrological model calibration as the chosen study area was located on the northeastern tibetan plateau and is covered with snow throughout the year the cemaneige snow module was added to the gr4j hydrological model to simulate the evolution of snow cover on the catchment and to estimate its melt at the outlet of snow influenced catchments valéry et al 2014a we selected this model for its relatively simple structure and small number of calibration parameters the cemaneige gr4j forcing data includes rainfall runoff and potential evapotranspiration the cemaneige gr4j model has been applied to several river basins worldwide in studies related to uncertainty analysis in hydrological modeling e g seiller et al 2012 valéry et al 2014b the gr4j model has been proven to exhibit good performance in cold and mountainous areas hao et al 2022 and the cemaneige snow module coupled with gr4j hydrological model has been shown to achieve better performance in french swiss swedish and canadian study areas riboust et al 2019 the gr4j model is a daily lumped rainfall runoff model which has four parameters x1 x2 x3 and x4 which are optimized during calibration the model uses two non linear reservoirs to calculate runoff yield and concentration valéry et al 2014b the first reservoir is called the production store and the second reservoir is called the routing store the two flow components together are divided into 90 of the flow which is routed through the unit hydrograph and then through the non linear routing store while 10 of the flow is routed through the single unit hydrograph the time lag between precipitation events and the corresponding peak discharge can be simulated with these two hydrographs tian et al 2013 the cemaneige snow module is a daily two parameter x5 x6 semi distributed snow accounting routine hence the cemaneige gr4j model has 6 parameters in total which are used for model calibration the mean and value ranges of these six parameters are listed in table 2 3 3 model calibration and validation the data time series were split up into a warm up period for the babao river basin 1 january 2012 to 31 december 2012 a calibration period 1 january 2013 to 31 december 2015 and a validation period 1 january 2016 to 31 december 2017 we followed a monte carlo based calibration method and quantified model parameter uncertainty model performance was evaluated using four objective functions i e nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the coefficient of determination r2 the percent bias bias the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 these functions were calculated as follows 3 nse 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 4 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s 2 i 1 n o i o 2 s i s 2 5 bias i 1 n o i s i i 1 n o i 6 kge 1 r 1 2 σ sim σ obs 1 2 μ sim μ obs 1 2 where oi is the ith observation si is the ith simulation s and o are the mean of the simulations and observations respectively r is the linear correlation between observations and simulations σ obs is the standard deviation in the observations σ sim is the standard deviation in the simulations μ sim is the simulation mean and μ obs is the observation mean nse values mainly evaluate model performance during high flow periods because it is mainly affected by flood peaks bias values indicate the tendency of underestimation or overestimation of the simulated discharge during the whole simulation period kge values indicate the ratios of means and the ratios of dispersion and correlation of the simulations and observations a total of 105 parameters sets were generated for the calibration process within set parameter ranges using latin hypercube sampling mckay et al 1979 and these are summarized in table 2 3 3 1 using spearman rank coefficients to calibrate with mpr data to calibrate the hydrological model using the mpr data we took advantage of the fact that the mpr data are dynamically linked to streamflow variation and that they can therefore be compared against modeled streamflow using the spearman rank correlation coefficient rspear seibert vis 2016 calculated using 7 ρ i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where xi is the ith mpr data yi is the ith discharge simulation and x and y are the mean of the mpr data and discharge simulation respectively ranging from 1 to 1 an rspear value close to 1 indicates that the simulated streamflow and the retrieved mpr data reproduce the same variability and that the mpr data and streamflow values are strictly monotonically related regardless of the shape of the relation rspear values are not affected if strictly monotonic increasing or decreasing functions are used to transform the sample data since rspear only reflects the similarity of the variability between gauged discharge data and mpr data and does not reflect the absolute volumes a value of 1 does not ensure a perfect fit seibert vis 2016 therefore the threshold definition of a behavioral parameter set cannot be similar to calibration based on objective function such as nse instead we suggest that a behavioral parameter set should be selected by sorting all model runs according to their relative rspear values and the parameter sets with the highest rspear should be selected in this study we selected behavioral parameter sets by taking the best 2 of 105 model runs resulting in 2 000 parameter sets in order to ensure the comparability of the different calibration schemes the same procedure of taking the best 2 was adopted when the model was calibrated using discharge data 3 3 2 water balance filter mpr data instead of discharge data can be used for model calibration by using the monotonic relationship between the mpr data and discharge data mapped using the spearman rank coefficient this step avoids the need to convert mpr values into discharge values and hence potentially reduces the uncertainties potentially caused by this conversion however this method may lead to a systematic deviation because information describing total water volume is not considered as stated above a risk exists that a hydrological model might be biased when only calibrated with mpr data and that such a model may produce overestimated or underestimated modelled runoffs therefore a simple annual water balance filter was added to the above model and acceptable model output was obtained by selecting only those parameters sets which resulted in high rspear values and an additional sets was selected which matched a simplified water balance referred to as the mpr srf scheme fig 2 the annual runoff depth was calculated by using the observed precipitation minus the average actual evapotranspiration etact assuming that possible change in catchment storage can be considered small enough to be ignored over a period of serval years in addition we added a subjective confidence interval of 20 to account for measurement errors unknown uncertainties and possible storage changes etact was calculated using the budyko equation i e e p f ep p where ep refers to the mean annual potential evapotranspiration the equation developed by fu 1981 and recommended by zhang et al 2004 has been widely used and has the following form 8 e p 1 ep p 1 ep p ω 1 ω where e is the mean annual actual evapotranspiration ep refers to the mean annual potential evapotranspiration we then used the semi empirical equation proposed by li et al 2013 to calculate the empirical parameter ω based solely on remotely sensed vegetation information this simple parameterization for the basin specific ω has achieved good performance in modeling annual evapotranspiration 9 ω 2 36 m 1 16 the vegetation coverage m which represents the fraction of total ground surface covered by vegetation was estimated using the following equation yang et al 2009 10 m ndvi n d v i min ndv i max n d v i min where ndvimax and ndvimin are the ndvi values of dense green vegetation and bare soil respectively as described in previous studies yang et al 2009 li et al 2013 ndvimax and ndvimin are global constants that are independent of vegetation soil type as was demonstrated by gutman and ignatov 1998 in our study we used an ndvimax value for dense forest of 0 80 and an ndvimin value for bare soil of 0 05 as described by yang et al 2009 we estimated that the average etact value for the babao river basin from 2013 to 2015 was 273 5 mm year which was calculated using water balance formula and neglecting storage changes based on gauged discharge data the annual etact was 286 1 mm year for the babao river basin during the period 2013 to 2015 based on budyko equation which was 4 6 more than the value determined based on observed data in order to account for possible storage changes and measurements errors we added a subjective confidence interval of 20 resulting in an annual runoff depth of between 455 9 mm and 683 9 mm during the period 2013 to 2015 within the study area 3 3 3 calibration schemes the construction simulation and parameter calibration of the cemaneigegr4j model are realized using the rstudio software platform six independent calibration schemes were carried out to evaluate the value of mpr data and the water balance filter for model calibration we first calibrated the model based on the observed discharge data using the nse based method and the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii the q nse scheme in total 105 parameter sets were generated for the calibration process using latin hypercube sampling within predefined parameter ranges table 2 we selected behavioral parameter sets by ranking all model runs by their associated nse values and taking the top set in this study we defined behavioral parameter sets by taking three different best percentages of the 105 runs resulting in 100 1000 and 2 000 parameters the q nse 1 q nse 2 and q nse 3 schemes respectively mpr data was then used to identifiy 2000 parameter sets that resulted in the highest spearman rank coefficients based on the latin hypercube sampling framework the mpr sr scheme finally the mpr sr scheme was filtered using the water balance filter the mpr srf scheme see fig 2 4 results 4 1 calibration using discharge data the model achieved good simulation performance when the parameters were calibrated against discharge data using the q nse scheme fig 5 with the values of nse kge bias and r2 of 0 71 0 69 1 8 and 0 71 during calibration respectively table 3 the q nse scheme also achieved good performance results during the validation period with an nse value of 0 73 a kge value of 0 72 a bias value of 5 8 and an r2 value of 0 76 for the other calibration schemes based on the monte carlo based uncertainty framework the three objective functions of simulated discharge at the 50 quantile were calculated the q nse 1 q nse 2 and q nse 3 calibration schemes obtained satisfactory performance results among all parameter sets the identified 100 sets with the highest nse values i e scheme q nse 1 achieved an nse of 0 7 a kge of 0 63 a bias of 7 7 and an r2 of 0 75 however the performance of the model simulations became worse as the number of behavioral parameter sets increased to 1000 q nse 2 scheme and 2000 q nse 3 scheme indicating that there was a deterioration in the capability for accurate reproduction of discharge different percentage parameter sets which selected by ranking all model runs by their associated nse illustrate the uncertainty of simulation results clearly more behavioral parameter sets led to increasingly poorer simulation quality and increases in the uncertainty of the simulation results on the contrary fewer behavioral parameter sets resulted in better simulation results 4 2 calibration using mpr data the model predicted the observed discharges beyond acceptable ranges when calibrated and validated against the mpr data in a monte carlo based uncertainty framework without applying the water balance filter during the validation period the mpr sr calibration scheme provided unsatisfactory performance results with an nse value of 0 24 a kge value of 0 04 and a bias value of 73 4 however the r2 value of the simulated discharge at the 50 quantile was 0 73 indicating that the mpr sr scheme results had good correlation with the observed discharge temporal variability but there were obvious errors in the total discharge volumes fig 6 4 3 effects of the water balance filter applying the water balance filter in the mpr srf calibration scheme improved the model performance during the calibration period notably compared to the mpr sr scheme according to three objective functions of simulated discharge at the 50 quantile the nse value increased from 0 31 to 0 62 the kge value decreased from 0 04 to 0 58 the bias value decreased from 71 2 to 6 7 and the r2 value increased from 0 64 to 0 66 this result is similar to that of a previous study in the region which used the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model dhsvm model calibrated using 4 years of daily discharge zhao et al 2019 the mpr srf calibration scheme of simulated discharge at the 50 quantile also achieved good performance results during validation period with an nse value of 0 62 a kge value of 0 58 a bias value of 15 9 and an r2 value of 0 72 hence the hydrological model calibrated with mpr data combined with the water balance filter in the mpr srf scheme predicted river discharge almost as well as when the model was calibrated using observed discharge data fig 5 presents the simulated discharge time series during the calibration period for the q nse scheme and the mpr srf scheme clearly showing differences between the two different calibration schemes although temporal variations in discharge were simulated well by the model when calibrated using both schemes in general both the q nse scheme and the mpr srf scheme tended to slightly overestimate dry season discharge but the q nse scheme overestimated more obviously however both schemes resulted in similar lower discharge in wet seasons the modeled discharge time series during the validation period for the mpr sr mpr srf and q nse schemes can be seen in fig 6 the timing and magnitude of discharges were reproduced well except by the mpr sr scheme during the validation period the similarities and differences between the q nse scheme and the mpr srf scheme were similar as during the calibration period however the total discharge volumes deviated from the observed discharges for the mpr sr scheme which was also reflected in the large bias value 4 4 parameter sensitivity analysis fig 7 presents the posterior distribution of model parameters using the different calibration schemes among the six parameters x1 x2 and x3 were relatively sensitive to the calibration data for the q nse 1 q nse 2 and q nse 3 calibration schemes the range of the posterior distribution of model parameters increased with the number of behavioral parameter sets indicating that the uncertainty became more obvious with a larger number of sets however the water exchange coefficient parameter x2 was not sensitive in the mpr sr scheme suggesting that the total discharge volumes were mainly affected by parameter x2 which was also reflected in the bias values 4 5 further application of the mpr srf calibration scheme to an ungauged river basin in order to further verify the effectiveness of the mpr srf calibration scheme we used simulations of the yeniugou river to show the applicability of our method in a different river basin fig 8 presents the modeled discharge time series during the calibration and validation periods using the mpr srf and the q nse schemes this figure underlines the better performance of mpr srf calibration method the traditional calibration method achieved good performance results with an nse value of 0 67 a kge value of 0 81 a bias value of 1 7 and an r2 value of 0 68 during the validation period table 4 compared with using the traditional calibration method the simulated discharge at the 50 quantile using the mpr srf calibration scheme also achieved good performance results with an nse of 0 62 a kge of 0 79 a bias of 2 7 and an r2 of 0 64 during the validation period 5 discussion to date integrating remote sensing information into hydrological monitoring remains uncommon with only a few studies which examine the usefulness of remote sensing data for model calibration sun et al 2010 milzow et al 2011 liu et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 huang et al 2020 all of these limited studies have been carried out using large continental rivers i e river channel widths greater than several hundred meters due to restrictions in the spatial resolution of remote sensing platforms our study demonstrates the potential of using mpr data derived from near infrared images to calibrate daily scale hydrological models in small river basins i e river channels on the order of 100 m wide this kind of method is only applicable to rivers having mpr variations that are sensitive to variations in discharge we found that the model calibrated with mpr data combined with a water balance filter can perform well for daily discharge simulation in terms of model accuracies compared to traditional calibration methods but can exhibit greater uncertainties and overestimations of total discharge volumes 5 1 assessing model performance through spearman rank coefficient rspear values were used to identify behavioral parameter sets during calibration and allowed a comparison of the variability of simulated discharges and mpr data but information related to the total discharge volumes was not provided jian et al 2017 weeser et al 2019 values close to one were obtained when mpr data and gauged discharge were monotonically correlated regardless of the shape of the relation this suggests that as long as simulated discharges and derived mpr data rise and fall concurrently a high value for this goodness of fit measure can be obtained seibert vis 2016 the effects of selecting different numbers of behavior parameter sets on model calibration can be compared using rspear as the objective function in this study we ranked all parameter sets by their rspear values and chose the top set 100 1000 and 2000 runs as behavioral parameter sets the uncertainty of model simulation was more obvious with increased numbers of behavioral parameter sets however the behavioral parameter sets screened using rspear need to be further filtered through a simple water balance filter therefore if the number of behavioral parameter sets screened using rspear is too small many effective parameter sets will be removed which increases the uncertainty in the resulting simulated discharge to a certain extent advantages of using rspear are that there is no need to estimate extra inverse rating curve functions with additional associated uncertainties jian et al 2017 and that mpr data can be directly used to calibrate discharge models this avoids expensive discharge measurements which require specialist equipment and expert knowledge often not available in challenging and remote natural environment regions such as the tibetan plateau calibration methods based on mpr data rely heavily on the resolution and availability of remote sensing data data availability may improve when the future surface water and ocean topography swot satellite mission is launched durand et al 2010 this mission could help provide estimates of changes in terrestrial water storage and inundation extent for rivers wider than 50 m at a global scale pavelsky et al 2014 yoon et al 2016 hydraulic information of rivers at different spatial and temporal scales will become available and will be able to be used to calibrate hydrological model sichangi et al 2016 showed that estimating discharge using water level and river width observation data simultaneously is better than using only hydraulic geometry information 5 2 the value of a water balance filter as shown above a risk exists that a hydrological model might be biased when only calibrated with mpr data seibert and vis 2016 calibrated a model for more than 600 river basins in the united states using daily water level and streamflow data assessed using rspear their study revealed that models that were calibrated from water levels performed well in wet basins where the precipitation input was higher than the potential evapotranspiration but performed poorly in drier basins our results confirmed these findings the mpr sr calibration scheme resulted in obvious errors in the simulated total discharge volumes these results suggest that a more intense testing of the calibration method under different climatic zones is needed seibert and vis 2016 suggested that better discharge volume information can improve model results for drier basins and indicated the need for further research in this field weeser et al 2019 tested the added value of a water balance filter which derived evapotranspiration etact value from modis data based on a parameter set selection that reduced the risk of biased model calibration the uncertainty of evapotranspiration derived using the budyko framework or the modis data set cannot be determined precisely since it depends on various local factors weeser et al 2019 when we compared the etact values derived using the budyko framework to those derived using a simple water balance method with observed precipitation minus the observed discharge and neglected storage changes senay et al 2011 we found an overestimation of 4 6 the resulting water balance filter range falls within the measured discharge values after applying an uncertainty compensation of 20 the mpr srf results indicated that model simulation efficiencies were improved when behavioral parameter sets of the mpr sr calibraiton scheme were further filtered in the mpr srf scheme the filter effectively removed behavioral parameter sets that resulted in total discharge volume underestimation therefore adding such a simple filter in the process of posteriori model selection can effectively reduce the inherent bias of model calibration with rspear as the objective function 5 3 the role of input mpr data besides mpr data we used precipitation and temperature data from hydrometeorological stations to demonstrate the feasibility of calibrating a model using mpr data mpr data derived from near infrared images can be available for most river basins particularly in regions where in situ monitoring networks are sparse li et al 2019 however selecting a suitable reference region and inundated region is critical to establish the correlation between discharge and mpr data li et al 2019 suggested selecting the gentle slope area of high mountains as the reference region in addition the shape of the inundated region and its location are important factors influencing the resulting correlation between simulated and observed discharge tarpanelli et al 2013b in this study the width of the inundated region was approximately equal to the maximum flood coverage the length and location of the inundated region were also closely related to the correlation between observed discharge and mpr data li et al 2019 we selected a downstream area 1 500 2 000 m away from the hydrological station as the inundated region where the influence of a bridge and the hydrological station construction on river state was negligible and the mpr data and observed discharge at the station maintained a close correlation li et al 2019 previous studies have found that there is a power function rating curve relationship between mpr data and daily gauged discharge which can be further studied by converting the objective function from daily gauged discharge to mpr data to calibrate a model sun et al 2018 li et al 2019 5 4 applicability of the mpr srf method the proposed mpr srf calibration scheme significantly expands the range of rivers that can be simulated using remote sensing images to calibrate hydrological models the results of this study clearly demonstrate the potential for using mpr data derived from near infrared images to calibrate hydrological models in mid size and small regional rivers having river channel widths greater than 30 m it is noted that the mpr srf calibration scheme is only applicable to discharge estimation in ungauged basins where discharge variations are highly correlated with the inundated extent most small rivers on the tibetan plateau are shallow braided rivers thus the mpr srf method is suitable previous studies have mainly focused on calibrating hydrological models for large river basins sun et al 2010 2015 milzow et al 2011 domeneghetti et al 2014 liu et al 2015 the proposed mpr srf calibration schemes produced comparable results to the discharge based calibration the increased uncertainty is therefore mainly induced by using the rspear and only marginally by the mpr data itself the mpr data only led to a decrease of the relative performance of around 5 for the nse bias and r2 error estimates during calibration mpr srf in comparison to the discharge based calibration q nse the conceptual model cemaneige gr4j used in this study has only six parameters which allowed a consistent calibration and avoided over parameterization kirchner 2006 in addition the model can be easily applied to ungauged basins because of the few parameters involved a more complex spatially distributed hydrological model might have benefits by providing the opportunity to use measured data from various sources and locations and integrate them into the model approach starkey et al 2017 in the future it is necessary to further investigate the performance of mpr data evaluate the calibration effect of hydrological models under different land use and climatic conditions and discuss the uncertainty of mpr data and water balance filters in calibrating small watersheds in ungauged basins 6 conclusions this study attempts at investigating the potential use of mpr data obtained from near infrared images for calibrating hydrological models for ungauged mid size and small river basins based on the study area of the babao and yeniugou river basin on the tibetan plateau the main conclusions are as follows 1 a hydrological model calibrated based solely on mpr data derived from remote sensing images estimated discharge with satisfactory accuracy however greater simulation uncertainty was observed compared with typical or traditional calibration using actual discharge data 2 by applying a simple water balance filter it was possible to achieve model efficiencies similar to those obtained from traditional calibration using gauged discharge we used a parsimonious water balance derived from a budyko framework and measured meteorological data avoiding data intense estimates combining the water balance filter with the conceptual model increased calibration reliability the filter can remove those parameter sets that result in total discharge volumes that are overestimated or underestimated and which can occur when only using the spearman rank correlation as an objective function 3 the mpr srf calibration scheme proposed here extends the range of model calibration to small river basins and provides an alternative for gauge stations that are not operational in some regions further studies will explore whether the approach is effective in different climatic and geophysical catchments

2201,accurate inflow forecasting is very important for the operation of reservoirs however in the actual inflow forecasting the differences between various parameters and external conditions will affect the forecast results of the model so it is necessary to correct the forecast results most of the existing researches on the correction of forecast results focus on considering the model uncertainty as a whole and there are few studies on the influence of different external factors on the forecast results in view of this the differences of external environment when the forecast occurs and the differences of forecast errors under different forecast scenarios are both considered in this paper according to the differences in key influencing factors such as rainfall conditions and foresight periods the forecast scenarios are divided and the forecast error distribution law under different scenarios is deduced based on the past forecast error data on this basis using variational mode decomposition vmd and long short term memory lstm neural network model a new multi dimensional and multi attribute inflow forecast correction method considering forecast errors and forecast scenarios is established this method breaks through the single dimensional single attribute time series limitations of the traditional inflow forecast correction methods through the case study of three gorges reservoir tgr it was found that compared with the actual situation the average relative error of the inflow forecast was reduced from the actual 8 32 to 6 36 a decrease of 1 96 and the reduction rate reached 23 6 in addition other indexes such as mean absolute error root mean square error and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient have all been improved to varying degrees it showed that the proposed method in this paper can simultaneously consider both the forecast error information of the previous periods and its corresponding forecast scenario information and increase the effective information input of the correction model to improve the accuracy of the inflow forecast model keywords forecast scenario inflow forecast correction method vmd lstm tgr data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction forecasted inflow of reservoir has a huge impact on the efficient use of water resources flood prevention disaster relief and power generation cloke and pappenberger 2009 jiang et al 2018a in the actual operation of reservoirs the maximum benefit could be obtained only by accurately forecasting the amount of the inflow in the future and carrying out a reasonable operation el shafie et al 2009 jiang et al 2019a therefore for hydrological forecasting the most concerned index is the accuracy of the forecast model tsai et al 2014 the forecast accuracy is affected by many uncertain factors such as input uncertainty of model structure uncertainty of model and artificial uncertainty bourdin et al 2014 jiang et al 2019b the accuracy of a forecast model can be obtained through relevant analysis of forecasted data and measured data after the model has been running for a while niu et al 2019 yang et al 2017 although many scholars have done a lot of researches on this issue there are few relevant studies on the influence of different external factors on the forecast results when the forecast occurs das et al 2018 liang et al 2017 in addition as one of the effective ways to improve the accuracy of inflow forecast models the different external environments during the forecast are also seldom considered in the correction study of forecast results which includes the differences of forecast scenarios and the differences of forecast difficulty brought by it for example the traditional inflow forecast correction model uses different models or forecast errors of the past time to correct the forecast results the basic idea is to analyze the existing error series as a time series to seek the existing rule of forecast error then extrapolate the forecast error in the future stages and finally correct the forecast value gragne et al 2015 however in hydrological forecasting there is a wide range of forecast error sources and these errors are generally inevitable and difficult to control huang et al 2020 schaefli et al 2007 in traditional methods the forecast error of current stage is mostly related to the forecast errors absolute or relative values in the previous stages the differences of forecast errors under different forecast scenarios are not considered different forecast scenarios and their corresponding forecast error distributions are an important information for estimating the magnitude of forecast errors in the future therefore when the previous forecast errors are known coupling the corresponding forecast scenarios and their distribution law information into the inflow forecast correction model is of great significance to improve the forecast accuracy of the model as a new neural network method long short term memory lstm model is generally used to solve the problem of long term dependence in general recurrent neural networks compared with the traditional recurrent neural network rnn model lstm model solves the problem of gradient disappearance and gradient explosion in the long sequence training process gers et al 2000 yu et al 2019 many scholars have compared lstm with other similar algorithms for example xiang et al 2020 found that lstm model is better than svm model in runoff prediction in the study of precipitation runoff model frame et al 2022 found that lstm is also accurate in predicting extreme events through case study yuan et al 2018 used ant lion optimizer algorithm to calibrate lstm parameters in their research and the results show that the calibrated model has higher accuracy than other models yin et al 2021 compared two different lstm models in the research of multi step ahead runoff predictions and found that coupling multi state vector into lstm model can achieve better results hu et al 2021 studied the coupling of lstm and vmd and found that the prediction accuracy and calculation efficiency of the coupling model were the highest among the candidate models lv et al 2022 combined vmd method and lstm model to predict power load in their research on power load forecasting and compared with other models it was found that this method had small prediction error and stable results wang et al 2021 combined vmd method with lstm model and pso model in runoff prediction of three hydrological stations in the main stream of the yellow river the results show that the error of the model is much smaller however the previous research on lstm rarely use the error and especially its law of error to correct the forecast results and didn t considered the differences of forecast errors under different forecast scenarios and the research on the confidence interval method to control the prediction error is also less in view of this considering the differences of the external environments and the different distribution laws of forecast errors under different forecast scenarios looper et al 2012 the forecast scenarios are divided in detail according to the different key external factors such as rainfall foresight periods inflow levels the change rate of inflow etc meanwhile the distribution laws of forecast errors under different scenarios are analyzed on this basis after the forecast scenarios are coupled to the inflow forecast correction model a new multi dimensional and multi attribute inflow forecast correction method considering the forecast errors and the forecast scenarios is proposed in this paper the novel aspects and advantages of the proposed method in this paper are as follows it can not only consider the forecast error information of the previous stages and its corresponding forecast scenario information and increase the effective information input for the correction model to improve the accuracy of the inflow forecast but it can also break through the limitations of the traditional inflow forecast correction method based on single dimensional single attribute time series of course although the proposed method in this paper has a strong innovation and practical application value it is inevitable that there are still some shortcomings in this study that is vmd used in this paper requires a given number of modes and the division of forecast scenarios also requires the extensive analysis of different hydrological data the division of forecast scenarios and modes has a certain impact on the results it requires a large amount of work to determine the appropriate number of modes and forecast scenarios the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the concepts of the used methods in detail including data verification and vmd method error forecast model based on lstm and the proposed correction method sections 3 present a real engineering case study and the corresponding results and discussion respectively the conclusions of this research have been presented in section 4 which is followed by the acknowledgement and references 2 methodology 2 1 data verification and vmd decomposition it is usually assumed that the changing trend of the past will continue to the future when time series data is used for forecasting by analyzing the characteristics of time series and according to the existing form or pattern of the series in the past the development direction trend and process of the next stage or several stages in the future can be forecasted huang et al 2019 huang et al 2014 therefore before the algorithm used to forecast the time series data time series analysis and preprocessing should be carried out first to judge whether the time series meets the hypothesis or not 2 1 1 data stationarity verification the stationarity of time series data has a crucial influence on the analysis method and the choice of forecast model at present the methods widely used to test the stationarity of time series include sequence diagram test autocorrelation diagram test and augmented dickey fuller adf test fang et al 2019 among these methods the sequence diagram test and the autocorrelation diagram test are two subjective methods and the test results will change according to the standards of different observers while the adf test is a method of stationarity test using strict statistical methods its principle is to judge whether there is a unit root in time series data if there is a unit root in time series it is a non stationary series otherwise it is a stationary series the model formulas of the adf test are shown in formula 1 1 δ x t σ x t 1 i 1 m β i δ x t i ε t δ x t α σ x t 1 i 1 m β i δ x t i ε t δ x t α β t σ x t 1 i 1 m β i δ x t i ε t where σ is the hypothesis test term representing the standard deviation β t represents the trend term α represents the constant term ε t represents the residual when the stationarity test is carried out the null hypothesis is that the original series has a unit root and the test is carried out according to the reverse order of the model in formula 1 if the null hypothesis is rejected there is no unit root in the test series so the original series is stationary and the test is stopped at this point otherwise continue testing until the three model formulas have been tested 2 1 2 vmd decomposition after the preliminary test it is usually found that the forecast effect is poor when the error sequence is directly input into the forecast model to further analyze the reasons an autocorrelation test on the input data is conducted and it is found that the autocorrelation of the forecasted relative error of inflow under different scenarios is poor so the data needs to be further processed by consulting the literatures we compared the advantages and disadvantages of vmd and wavelet analysis finally in this paper the vmd method has been used to process the data vmd is an adaptive completely non recursive method of modal variation and signal processing which has the advantage of determining the number of modal decompositions its disadvantage is that the choice of the penalty factor and the number of decomposition layers will affect the decomposition effect alizadeh et al 2019 the vmd process consists of two parts constructing the variational model and solving the variational model under the constraint of the original input signal f and the sum of all decomposed modal functions the variational model seeks h finite bandwidth modal functions to minimize the sum of the estimated bandwidths of each modal function the constrained variational optimization problem can be expressed as 2 min u k ω k k t δ t i π t u k t e j ω k t 2 2 s t k u k f where u k u 1 u 2 u 3 u k is each modal function w k w 1 w 2 w 3 w k is each center frequency δ t i π t u k t is the single side spectrum of each modal function obtained by hilbert transformation adarsh and janga reddy 2019 e j ω k t is used to modulate the spectrum of each modal function to the corresponding baseband and finally the signal is adjusted by gaussian smoothing to obtain the bandwidth of each modal function to solve the above constrained optimization problem the augmented lagrangian function is introduced by taking advantage of the quadratic penalty term and lagrangian multiplier method liu et al 2018 as shown below 3 l u k ω k λ α k t δ t i π t u k t e j ω k t 2 2 f t k u k t 2 2 λ t f t k u k t where α is the punishment parameter λ is the lagrange multiplier the alternating direction multiplier algorithm jia et al 2021 is used to perform a series of iterations to find the optimal solution finally the original signal f is decomposed into k imf intrinsic model function components for more explanation on the vmd decomposition method please refer to literatures by he et al 2019 and seo et al 2018 2 2 error forecast model based on lstm after literature research and data feature analysis khazaee poul et al 2019 li et al 2018 the lstm model is used for error forecast in this paper lstm is a time loop neural network which uses a long term effective short term memory to transfer the state on the time axis this state is called cell state and it is not only passed to the next time node but also valid for a long time in the following time sherstinsky 2020 the structure of lstm is shown in fig 1 in fig 1 there are three inputs at time t 1 the network input value xt at the current moment 2 the hidden value st 1 at the last moment and 3 the unit state ct 1 at the last moment there are two outputs at time t 1 the hidden value st at the current moment and 2 the unit state ct at the current moment lstm performs special processes by adding three gates inside the node to receive the information generated by the earlier node these three gates are forgotten gates input gates and output gates the internal structure of the lstm unit is shown in fig 2 the state transfer logic of lstm can be described as follows step1 multiply the hidden value st 1 with the input xt at the current moment and the weight matrix wf of this layer and then add the bias coefficient bf then map the result to the nonlinear space with sigmoid activation function to obtain ft then multiply ft and ct 1 to achieve the effect of forgetting 4 f t σ w f s t 1 x t b f where σ x 1 1 e x step2 in the input gate use the hidden unit h t 1 at the last moment and input x t at the current moment to multiply the weight matrix w i of this layer then add the bias value b i and finally the result is mapped to the nonlinear space by sigmoid activation function to obtain i t 5 i t σ w i s t 1 x t b i step3 in the same as step2 the activation function is changed from sigmoid to tanh to obtain a new candidate value vector c t 6 c t tanh w c s t 1 x t step 4 multiply the values obtained in step 2 and step 3 and add them to the results of step 1 to get a new cell state c t 7 c t f t c t 1 i t c t step5 calculate the output value the hidden layer at time t h t 1 and x t are first used to multiply the output layer weight matrix w o secondly add the output layer bias value b o and then processed by the activation function the output result o t at the current moment can be obtained the obtained new cell state is mapped to 1 and 1 after tanh processing then it is multiplied by the result of o t to obtain the updated hidden layer state s t 8 o t σ w o s t 1 x t b o 9 s t o t tanh c t step6 the updated hidden layer state s t is multiplied by the weight matrix w d and then the bias b d is added to obtain the final output y t at the current moment 10 y t w d s t b d in the state transfer logic of lstm step1 is completed in the forgotten gate steps 2 3 and 4 are completed in the input gate in turn step5 and step 6 are completed in the output layer for more introduction to lstm please refer to literatures by liu et al 2018 and ciechulski and osowski 2021 2 3 the proposed correction method in this paper based on the aforementioned methods the overall implementation steps of the proposed correction method in this paper can be described as follows step1 based on the collected inflow forecast error and measured data as well as other forecast information the factors that affect the forecast level such as rainfall and foresight period are considered to divide forecast scenarios step2 seek the distribution law of forecast errors under each scenario and determine the confidence interval under a certain confidence level step3 after the series of forecast errors in each scenario is tested for data stationarity and autocorrelation the vmd method is used to decompose the original forecast error series step4 based on the decomposed data the lstm model is used to forecast the inflow error under each forecast scenario then the interval correction of the forecast error is made through the error distribution rule of each scenario and then the corrected value of the forecast error can be obtained step5 finally based on the corrected forecast error the forecast value of the inflow is corrected to get a more accurate inflow value the flow chart of proposed methodology is shown in fig 3 3 case study the three gorges reservoir tgr of the yangtze river is the largest water conservancy project in the world the location of the tgr is shown in fig 4 with huge comprehensive benefits such as flood control power generation navigation irrigation and water supply the exact inflow forecast of the tgr is an important guarantee for achieving the scheduling goals of the reservoir so the accuracy of the inflow forecast is very important jiang et al 2018b at present the tgr has a relatively mature inflow forecast model and the forecast accuracy is relatively high but there is still some space for improvement especially on the correction research based on the forecast results therefore it is of great significance to strengthen the research on the forecast and correction of inflow for the operation of tgr so in this paper the tgr is taken as the research object and based on the proposed multi scenario coupled inflow forecast correction method the accuracy of the inflow forecast of tgr is improved 3 1 basic data this paper has collected the measured and forecasted inflow data of the tgr from august 1st 2018 to august 29th 2021 part of the data is shown in table 1 and the areal rainfall data of each region in the upstream of the tgr from august 1st 2018 to august 29th 2021 part of the data is shown in table 2 the forecast will start at 8 am every day using xin anjiang model li et al 2013 and there are six foresight periods namely the forecasted inflow of the second day the third day the fourth day the fifth day the sixth and seventh day can be obtained in current day 3 2 scenario division and error confidence interval calculation according to the rainfall and corresponding inflow data from august 2018 to august 2021 the forecast scenarios are divided firstly the rainfall scenarios are divided according to the sum of the areal rainfall in the upstream basin of tgr after the aforementioned three tests it is found that the rainfall data in each scenario obtained by dividing the rainfall data with 15 mm boundary is relatively uniform and this is conducive to the subsequent modeling and analysis so the rainfall scenarios are divided with the 15 mm boundary secondly according to the six foresight periods different forecast scenarios are obtained further and finally twelve forecast scenarios are obtained although the actual forecast scenarios may be more detailed this paper only divides these twelve scenarios due to the limitations of data information the corresponding conditions of the foresight period and rainfall under each scenario are shown in table 3 the scatter plots of the relative error of inflow forecasting under each scenario are shown in figs 5 and 6 it can be seen from fig 5 and fig 6 that the distribution of scattered points corresponding to different scenarios is different and some scenarios that have some abnormal values that deviate too much need to be eliminated or processed the normal distribution of relative errors of inflow forecasts under different scenarios can be derived according to the scatter plots the principle of deriving the theoretical curve of normal distribution based on the discrete points is shown in fig 7 and the results obtained are shown in figs 8 and 9 it can be seen from fig 8 and fig 9 that the relative error corresponding to different forecast scenarios obeys the normal distribution and its changing law is that with the extension of the foresight period the normal distribution curve changes from high lean type to short fat type which shows that with the extension of the foresight period the forecast error gradually increases the normal distribution curve of the scenario with areal rainfall below 15 mm is generally thinner than that of the scenario with areal rainfall above 15 mm which indicates that the forecast error increase with the increase of rainfall in addition after deleting outliers the confidence interval corresponding to 90 confidence is selected as the error correction interval events outside the confidence interval are considered to be low probability events and it does not occur in the default normal situation the obtained confidence intervals corresponding to different scenarios are shown in table 4 it can be seen from table 4 that the confidence intervals corresponding to the same confidence degree are different under different scenarios with the growth of the foresight period the confidence interval range under the same confidence degree keeps increasing the confidence interval of scenarios above 15 mm is generally larger than that of scenarios below 15 mm which is consistent with the distribution error rule of the previous analysis and verified the rationality of the obtained confidence interval 3 3 analysis of the corrected results 3 3 1 data verification and decomposition results of vmd 3 3 1 1 stationarity verification result adf test is conducted on the relative error data of the tgr inflow to verify its stability the test results are shown in table 5 the adf test is to judge whether there is a unit root in the sequence if the sequence is stable there is no unit root otherwise there will be a unit root therefore the h0 hypothesis of the adf test is the existence of a unit root if the obtained significance test statistics are less than the three confidence degrees 10 5 1 the null hypothesis is rejected with the confidence of due 90 95 99 from table 5 it can be seen that the absolute values of test statistics under different scenarios are not less than the three key values the p values are all less than 1 of the significance level that is the confidence level greater than 99 rejects the null hypothesis 3 3 1 2 decomposition results of vmd matlab software is used to program the vmd in this paper and the vmd can optimize the final number of decomposition modes according to the data situation the decided final number of decomposition modes of vmd is five the decomposition results of vmd under different scenarios are shown in fig 10 it can be seen from fig 10 that on the whole the vmd decomposition can effectively control the number of modal decompositions avoid the overlapping of modal components and retain the main intrinsic modal sequence when the modal number is 1 it contains the most noise and as the modal number increases low frequency baseline oscillations and most of the high frequency noise are gradually discarded in addition from fig 10 it can be seen that after decomposition the initial sequence with poor regularity is decomposed into five fluctuation sequences with strong regularity and different frequencies for example from the green line to the blue line the fluctuation frequency of the sequence increases gradually in this way when lstm is used for prediction later the prediction accuracy of each decomposition sequence will be better than before decomposition 3 3 2 error forecast results and correction results of inflow forecast based on the decomposed data series obtained above the front 75 of inflow forecast error data in each scenario is used as the training set to train the constructed lstm network and optimize the parameters and the rest 25 data is used as the test data during the application of the model the previous 10 error points are used to forecast the next one and each sequence component after vmd decomposition is forecasted separately finally the results are superimposed to obtain the forecasted relative error on this basis the error beyond the confidence interval is corrected to the confidence interval and then the final forecasted relative error can be obtained which is shown in fig 11 test period from fig 11 it can be seen that the overall fluctuation trend of the forecasted relative error is consistent with that of the actual relative error and the fluctuation range of the former is smaller than that of the latter this indicates that after the forecasted inflow is corrected by the forecasted error obtained through the proposed method in this paper there will not be excessive corrections and will make the forecasted inflow closer to the measured inflow in addition the statistical results of error points which undergone interval correction under different scenarios are shown in table 6 as can be seen from table 6 except for scenarios 10 and 12 some forecasted errors by the lstm model in other scenarios will exceed the given confidence interval which shows that the interval correction proposed in this paper is necessary and effective it can properly correct the extreme case of too large or too small of forecasted relative error finally the corrected inflow can be obtained by inverse calculation using the forecasted relative error as shown in fig 12 from fig 12 it can be seen that the forecast effect after the correction is much better in especial it can be seen from the part marked by the red circle in fig 12 that the forecast effect of inflow is better and the forecast accuracy is higher after the interval correction and error correction under different scenarios in the literature by yuan et al 2021 they used lstm and ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd methods to predict the runoff of three gorges reservoir and also achieved good results but there were some deviations in the prediction of some turning points and peak values of runoff sequences from the research results of this paper we can see that the error correction of simulation results and the screening within the confidence interval well corrected the prediction data at the turning points and extreme values reducing the prediction error of the model the improvements of the accuracy of the model are analyzed in detail through mean absolute error mean relative error root mean square error and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient as follows 3 3 3 statistical index analysis after using the established error forecast model to obtain the forecasted relative error of inflow the original forecasted inflow can be corrected at this time it is necessary to evaluate the final corrected forecast effect to analyze the accuracy and practicability of the corrected model the model accuracy evaluation mainly uses the following indexes frías paredes et al 2018 meng et al 2019 3 3 3 1 mean absolute error mae m3 s mae represents the absolute differences between the forecasted result and the real result the smaller the value is the better the forecasted results are the formula is as follows 11 mae 1 n i 1 n y c i y 0 i where n represents the number of forecasted results y 0 i represents the real results and y c i represents the forecasted results 3 3 3 2 mean relative error mre mre represents the relative gap between the forecasted result and the real result the smaller the value is the better the forecasted results are the formula is as follows 12 mre 1 n i 1 n y c i y 0 i y 0 i 3 3 3 3 root mean square error rmse m3 s the root mean square error represents the degree of deviation between the forecasted result and the real result the smaller the value is the better the forecasted results are the formula is as follows 13 rmse 1 n i 1 n y 0 i y c i 2 3 3 3 4 nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nse can be used as an index for the coincidence degree between the forecasted process and the real process and the closer the value is to 1 the better the forecasted results are the calculation formula is as follows 14 r 2 1 i 1 n y c i y 0 i 2 i 1 n y 0 i y 0 2 where y 0 represents the average of the real values 3 3 3 5 reduction rate re of the evaluation indicators re can be used to indicate the optimization degree of the corrected data relative to the original data and the calculation formula is as follows 15 re e e e 100 where e means the mean evaluation indicators after correction such as mae mre rmse nse etc e means the original mean evaluation indicators before correction after correction the corresponding mean absolute error mean relative error root mean square error and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient under different scenarios are obtained as shown in table 7 in table 7 the situation a represents the actual situation situation b represents the error correction but no interval correction situation c represents the error correction and interval correction from table 7 it can be seen that compared with the actual situation when there is error correction but no confidence interval correction the mae changes from 1116 42 to 869 15 which means the re of mae between situation a and situation b is 22 1 indicating that the effect of error correction is significant after the addition of confidence interval correction it decreases from 869 15 to 853 70 further which means the re of mae between situation b and situation c is 1 8 indicating that confidence interval correction can further improve the forecast accuracy on the whole the average absolute error changes from 1116 42 in the beginning to 853 70 at last a decrease of 262 72 which means the re of mae between situation a and situation c is 23 5 for mre compared with the actual situation when there is error correction but no confidence interval correction the average relative error changes from 8 32 to 6 43 which means the re of mre between situation a and situation b is 22 7 indicating that the effect of error correction is significant after the addition of confidence interval correction the average relative error decreases from 6 43 to 6 36 further which means the re of mre between situation b and situation c is 1 1 indicating that confidence interval correction can further improve the forecast accuracy on the whole the average relative error changes from the initial 8 32 to the final 6 36 a decrease of 1 96 which means the re of mre between situation a and situation c is 23 6 for rmse compared with the actual situation when there is error correction but no confidence interval correction the root mean square error changes from 1760 67 to 1292 71 which means the re of rmse between situation a and situation b is 26 6 indicating that the error correction effect is significant after the addition of confidence interval correction it also decreases from 1292 71 to 1250 55 which means the re of rmse between situation b and situation c is 3 3 indicating that confidence interval correction can further improve the forecast accuracy in general the root mean square error changes from the initial 1760 67 to the final 1250 55 a decrease of 510 12 which means the re of mre between situation a and situation c is 29 0 for nse compared with the actual situation when there is error correction but no confidence interval correction the nse changes from 0 877 to 0 938 with an increase of 7 0 indicating that the effect of error correction is significant after adding the confidence interval correction it increases from 0 938 to 0 941 with a 0 32 increase on the whole the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient changes from the initial 0 877 to the final 0 941 the increase range reaches 7 3 the above is the result after the rainfall scenario division to verify that the processing method of rainfall scenario division is conducive to the improvement of forecast accuracy the comparison of mean absolute error mean relative error root mean square error and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient before and after rainfall scenario division are provided below as shown in table 8 in table 8 all situations are divided into three categories i e a b and c situation a represents the actual situation situation b1 represents the situation before the rainfall scenarios division error correction no interval correction situation b2 represents the situation before the rainfall scenarios division error correction interval correction situation c1 represents the situation after rainfall scenarios division error correction no interval correction situation c2 represents the situation after rainfall scenarios division error correction interval correction the value of type b can be obtained by inputting the actual data into the lstm model the value of type c is calculated by combining the values obtained by 12 scenarios in units of the actual foresight period according to the time series from table 8 it can be seen that the effect after interval correction is better than the effect before interval correction and the result after the scenarios division is better than the result before the scenarios division with the gradual change of the following situations including the actual situation situation before the rain scenarios division situation after the rain scenarios division the result of every statistical index is getting better and better this shows that the method of scenario coupled error correction and interval correction proposed in this paper is feasible and effective 4 conclusions this paper proposed a multi scenarios coupling correction method for inflow prediction according to the inflow and rainfall data of the three gorges reservoir from august 2018 to august 2021 and considering different rainfall values and different inflow prediction periods 12 scenarios were divided and obtained the error sequence processed by stationarity test autocorrelation test and vmd decomposition was input into lstm model to obtain the prediction error value after it was corrected by the confidence interval the predicted inflow was corrected by the error to obtain more accurate predicted inflow according to the research results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 with the extension of the forecast periods the error distribution curve gradually changes from the high lean type to short fat type and the error curve with rainfall greater than 15 mm is wider and shorter than the error curve with rainfall less than 15 mm this indicates that the prediction error shows an increasing trend with the growth of the forecast period and the increase of rainfall 2 vmd decomposition of error signals and prediction can improve the prediction effect and accuracy of lstm model the results show that the average absolute error of predicted value and measured value has changed from 1116 42 to 869 15 the average relative error changed from 8 32 to 6 43 the root mean square error changed from 1760 67 to 1292 71 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient changed from 0 877 to 0 938 3 filtering the confidence of the prediction data can further improve the prediction accuracy and prevent the occurrence of excessive prediction deviation compared with the prediction data before filtering the average absolute error changed from 869 15 to 853 7 the average absolute error changed from 6 43 to 6 36 the root mean square error changed from 1292 71 to 1250 55 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient changed from 0 938 to 0 941 in general compared with the actual situation the correction method proposed in this paper can change the average absolute error from the initial 1116 42 to the final 853 70 reducing 262 72 and 23 5 the average relative error can be changed from 8 32 to 6 36 decreasing by 1 96 of absolute value and 23 6 of relative amplitude the root mean square error can be changed from 1760 67 to 1250 55 with a reduction of 510 12 and a reduction range of 29 0 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient can change from 0 877 to 0 941 with an increase of 0 064 and 7 3 overall hydrologic data decomposition and scenario division can improve the prediction accuracy of hydrological forecast the error correction method proposed in this paper can be one of the reference methods to improve the inflow prediction accuracy of different watersheds the main novelty of this paper is to divide the prediction scenarios under different conditions apply vmd method to error decomposition and then use lstm model to predict the error data and use confidence interval to update the data the vmd lstm tgr coupling model mentioned in this study can greatly reduce the error of the predicted inflow because different inflow prediction models inevitably have different degrees of error the method proposed in this paper can be applied to other basins to improve the prediction accuracy for the future studies the author believes that further research can be done on different model analysis that is different scenarios may use different models to predict the error not only a single lstm to achieve better results credit authorship contribution statement suiling wang data curation formal

2201,accurate inflow forecasting is very important for the operation of reservoirs however in the actual inflow forecasting the differences between various parameters and external conditions will affect the forecast results of the model so it is necessary to correct the forecast results most of the existing researches on the correction of forecast results focus on considering the model uncertainty as a whole and there are few studies on the influence of different external factors on the forecast results in view of this the differences of external environment when the forecast occurs and the differences of forecast errors under different forecast scenarios are both considered in this paper according to the differences in key influencing factors such as rainfall conditions and foresight periods the forecast scenarios are divided and the forecast error distribution law under different scenarios is deduced based on the past forecast error data on this basis using variational mode decomposition vmd and long short term memory lstm neural network model a new multi dimensional and multi attribute inflow forecast correction method considering forecast errors and forecast scenarios is established this method breaks through the single dimensional single attribute time series limitations of the traditional inflow forecast correction methods through the case study of three gorges reservoir tgr it was found that compared with the actual situation the average relative error of the inflow forecast was reduced from the actual 8 32 to 6 36 a decrease of 1 96 and the reduction rate reached 23 6 in addition other indexes such as mean absolute error root mean square error and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient have all been improved to varying degrees it showed that the proposed method in this paper can simultaneously consider both the forecast error information of the previous periods and its corresponding forecast scenario information and increase the effective information input of the correction model to improve the accuracy of the inflow forecast model keywords forecast scenario inflow forecast correction method vmd lstm tgr data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction forecasted inflow of reservoir has a huge impact on the efficient use of water resources flood prevention disaster relief and power generation cloke and pappenberger 2009 jiang et al 2018a in the actual operation of reservoirs the maximum benefit could be obtained only by accurately forecasting the amount of the inflow in the future and carrying out a reasonable operation el shafie et al 2009 jiang et al 2019a therefore for hydrological forecasting the most concerned index is the accuracy of the forecast model tsai et al 2014 the forecast accuracy is affected by many uncertain factors such as input uncertainty of model structure uncertainty of model and artificial uncertainty bourdin et al 2014 jiang et al 2019b the accuracy of a forecast model can be obtained through relevant analysis of forecasted data and measured data after the model has been running for a while niu et al 2019 yang et al 2017 although many scholars have done a lot of researches on this issue there are few relevant studies on the influence of different external factors on the forecast results when the forecast occurs das et al 2018 liang et al 2017 in addition as one of the effective ways to improve the accuracy of inflow forecast models the different external environments during the forecast are also seldom considered in the correction study of forecast results which includes the differences of forecast scenarios and the differences of forecast difficulty brought by it for example the traditional inflow forecast correction model uses different models or forecast errors of the past time to correct the forecast results the basic idea is to analyze the existing error series as a time series to seek the existing rule of forecast error then extrapolate the forecast error in the future stages and finally correct the forecast value gragne et al 2015 however in hydrological forecasting there is a wide range of forecast error sources and these errors are generally inevitable and difficult to control huang et al 2020 schaefli et al 2007 in traditional methods the forecast error of current stage is mostly related to the forecast errors absolute or relative values in the previous stages the differences of forecast errors under different forecast scenarios are not considered different forecast scenarios and their corresponding forecast error distributions are an important information for estimating the magnitude of forecast errors in the future therefore when the previous forecast errors are known coupling the corresponding forecast scenarios and their distribution law information into the inflow forecast correction model is of great significance to improve the forecast accuracy of the model as a new neural network method long short term memory lstm model is generally used to solve the problem of long term dependence in general recurrent neural networks compared with the traditional recurrent neural network rnn model lstm model solves the problem of gradient disappearance and gradient explosion in the long sequence training process gers et al 2000 yu et al 2019 many scholars have compared lstm with other similar algorithms for example xiang et al 2020 found that lstm model is better than svm model in runoff prediction in the study of precipitation runoff model frame et al 2022 found that lstm is also accurate in predicting extreme events through case study yuan et al 2018 used ant lion optimizer algorithm to calibrate lstm parameters in their research and the results show that the calibrated model has higher accuracy than other models yin et al 2021 compared two different lstm models in the research of multi step ahead runoff predictions and found that coupling multi state vector into lstm model can achieve better results hu et al 2021 studied the coupling of lstm and vmd and found that the prediction accuracy and calculation efficiency of the coupling model were the highest among the candidate models lv et al 2022 combined vmd method and lstm model to predict power load in their research on power load forecasting and compared with other models it was found that this method had small prediction error and stable results wang et al 2021 combined vmd method with lstm model and pso model in runoff prediction of three hydrological stations in the main stream of the yellow river the results show that the error of the model is much smaller however the previous research on lstm rarely use the error and especially its law of error to correct the forecast results and didn t considered the differences of forecast errors under different forecast scenarios and the research on the confidence interval method to control the prediction error is also less in view of this considering the differences of the external environments and the different distribution laws of forecast errors under different forecast scenarios looper et al 2012 the forecast scenarios are divided in detail according to the different key external factors such as rainfall foresight periods inflow levels the change rate of inflow etc meanwhile the distribution laws of forecast errors under different scenarios are analyzed on this basis after the forecast scenarios are coupled to the inflow forecast correction model a new multi dimensional and multi attribute inflow forecast correction method considering the forecast errors and the forecast scenarios is proposed in this paper the novel aspects and advantages of the proposed method in this paper are as follows it can not only consider the forecast error information of the previous stages and its corresponding forecast scenario information and increase the effective information input for the correction model to improve the accuracy of the inflow forecast but it can also break through the limitations of the traditional inflow forecast correction method based on single dimensional single attribute time series of course although the proposed method in this paper has a strong innovation and practical application value it is inevitable that there are still some shortcomings in this study that is vmd used in this paper requires a given number of modes and the division of forecast scenarios also requires the extensive analysis of different hydrological data the division of forecast scenarios and modes has a certain impact on the results it requires a large amount of work to determine the appropriate number of modes and forecast scenarios the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the concepts of the used methods in detail including data verification and vmd method error forecast model based on lstm and the proposed correction method sections 3 present a real engineering case study and the corresponding results and discussion respectively the conclusions of this research have been presented in section 4 which is followed by the acknowledgement and references 2 methodology 2 1 data verification and vmd decomposition it is usually assumed that the changing trend of the past will continue to the future when time series data is used for forecasting by analyzing the characteristics of time series and according to the existing form or pattern of the series in the past the development direction trend and process of the next stage or several stages in the future can be forecasted huang et al 2019 huang et al 2014 therefore before the algorithm used to forecast the time series data time series analysis and preprocessing should be carried out first to judge whether the time series meets the hypothesis or not 2 1 1 data stationarity verification the stationarity of time series data has a crucial influence on the analysis method and the choice of forecast model at present the methods widely used to test the stationarity of time series include sequence diagram test autocorrelation diagram test and augmented dickey fuller adf test fang et al 2019 among these methods the sequence diagram test and the autocorrelation diagram test are two subjective methods and the test results will change according to the standards of different observers while the adf test is a method of stationarity test using strict statistical methods its principle is to judge whether there is a unit root in time series data if there is a unit root in time series it is a non stationary series otherwise it is a stationary series the model formulas of the adf test are shown in formula 1 1 δ x t σ x t 1 i 1 m β i δ x t i ε t δ x t α σ x t 1 i 1 m β i δ x t i ε t δ x t α β t σ x t 1 i 1 m β i δ x t i ε t where σ is the hypothesis test term representing the standard deviation β t represents the trend term α represents the constant term ε t represents the residual when the stationarity test is carried out the null hypothesis is that the original series has a unit root and the test is carried out according to the reverse order of the model in formula 1 if the null hypothesis is rejected there is no unit root in the test series so the original series is stationary and the test is stopped at this point otherwise continue testing until the three model formulas have been tested 2 1 2 vmd decomposition after the preliminary test it is usually found that the forecast effect is poor when the error sequence is directly input into the forecast model to further analyze the reasons an autocorrelation test on the input data is conducted and it is found that the autocorrelation of the forecasted relative error of inflow under different scenarios is poor so the data needs to be further processed by consulting the literatures we compared the advantages and disadvantages of vmd and wavelet analysis finally in this paper the vmd method has been used to process the data vmd is an adaptive completely non recursive method of modal variation and signal processing which has the advantage of determining the number of modal decompositions its disadvantage is that the choice of the penalty factor and the number of decomposition layers will affect the decomposition effect alizadeh et al 2019 the vmd process consists of two parts constructing the variational model and solving the variational model under the constraint of the original input signal f and the sum of all decomposed modal functions the variational model seeks h finite bandwidth modal functions to minimize the sum of the estimated bandwidths of each modal function the constrained variational optimization problem can be expressed as 2 min u k ω k k t δ t i π t u k t e j ω k t 2 2 s t k u k f where u k u 1 u 2 u 3 u k is each modal function w k w 1 w 2 w 3 w k is each center frequency δ t i π t u k t is the single side spectrum of each modal function obtained by hilbert transformation adarsh and janga reddy 2019 e j ω k t is used to modulate the spectrum of each modal function to the corresponding baseband and finally the signal is adjusted by gaussian smoothing to obtain the bandwidth of each modal function to solve the above constrained optimization problem the augmented lagrangian function is introduced by taking advantage of the quadratic penalty term and lagrangian multiplier method liu et al 2018 as shown below 3 l u k ω k λ α k t δ t i π t u k t e j ω k t 2 2 f t k u k t 2 2 λ t f t k u k t where α is the punishment parameter λ is the lagrange multiplier the alternating direction multiplier algorithm jia et al 2021 is used to perform a series of iterations to find the optimal solution finally the original signal f is decomposed into k imf intrinsic model function components for more explanation on the vmd decomposition method please refer to literatures by he et al 2019 and seo et al 2018 2 2 error forecast model based on lstm after literature research and data feature analysis khazaee poul et al 2019 li et al 2018 the lstm model is used for error forecast in this paper lstm is a time loop neural network which uses a long term effective short term memory to transfer the state on the time axis this state is called cell state and it is not only passed to the next time node but also valid for a long time in the following time sherstinsky 2020 the structure of lstm is shown in fig 1 in fig 1 there are three inputs at time t 1 the network input value xt at the current moment 2 the hidden value st 1 at the last moment and 3 the unit state ct 1 at the last moment there are two outputs at time t 1 the hidden value st at the current moment and 2 the unit state ct at the current moment lstm performs special processes by adding three gates inside the node to receive the information generated by the earlier node these three gates are forgotten gates input gates and output gates the internal structure of the lstm unit is shown in fig 2 the state transfer logic of lstm can be described as follows step1 multiply the hidden value st 1 with the input xt at the current moment and the weight matrix wf of this layer and then add the bias coefficient bf then map the result to the nonlinear space with sigmoid activation function to obtain ft then multiply ft and ct 1 to achieve the effect of forgetting 4 f t σ w f s t 1 x t b f where σ x 1 1 e x step2 in the input gate use the hidden unit h t 1 at the last moment and input x t at the current moment to multiply the weight matrix w i of this layer then add the bias value b i and finally the result is mapped to the nonlinear space by sigmoid activation function to obtain i t 5 i t σ w i s t 1 x t b i step3 in the same as step2 the activation function is changed from sigmoid to tanh to obtain a new candidate value vector c t 6 c t tanh w c s t 1 x t step 4 multiply the values obtained in step 2 and step 3 and add them to the results of step 1 to get a new cell state c t 7 c t f t c t 1 i t c t step5 calculate the output value the hidden layer at time t h t 1 and x t are first used to multiply the output layer weight matrix w o secondly add the output layer bias value b o and then processed by the activation function the output result o t at the current moment can be obtained the obtained new cell state is mapped to 1 and 1 after tanh processing then it is multiplied by the result of o t to obtain the updated hidden layer state s t 8 o t σ w o s t 1 x t b o 9 s t o t tanh c t step6 the updated hidden layer state s t is multiplied by the weight matrix w d and then the bias b d is added to obtain the final output y t at the current moment 10 y t w d s t b d in the state transfer logic of lstm step1 is completed in the forgotten gate steps 2 3 and 4 are completed in the input gate in turn step5 and step 6 are completed in the output layer for more introduction to lstm please refer to literatures by liu et al 2018 and ciechulski and osowski 2021 2 3 the proposed correction method in this paper based on the aforementioned methods the overall implementation steps of the proposed correction method in this paper can be described as follows step1 based on the collected inflow forecast error and measured data as well as other forecast information the factors that affect the forecast level such as rainfall and foresight period are considered to divide forecast scenarios step2 seek the distribution law of forecast errors under each scenario and determine the confidence interval under a certain confidence level step3 after the series of forecast errors in each scenario is tested for data stationarity and autocorrelation the vmd method is used to decompose the original forecast error series step4 based on the decomposed data the lstm model is used to forecast the inflow error under each forecast scenario then the interval correction of the forecast error is made through the error distribution rule of each scenario and then the corrected value of the forecast error can be obtained step5 finally based on the corrected forecast error the forecast value of the inflow is corrected to get a more accurate inflow value the flow chart of proposed methodology is shown in fig 3 3 case study the three gorges reservoir tgr of the yangtze river is the largest water conservancy project in the world the location of the tgr is shown in fig 4 with huge comprehensive benefits such as flood control power generation navigation irrigation and water supply the exact inflow forecast of the tgr is an important guarantee for achieving the scheduling goals of the reservoir so the accuracy of the inflow forecast is very important jiang et al 2018b at present the tgr has a relatively mature inflow forecast model and the forecast accuracy is relatively high but there is still some space for improvement especially on the correction research based on the forecast results therefore it is of great significance to strengthen the research on the forecast and correction of inflow for the operation of tgr so in this paper the tgr is taken as the research object and based on the proposed multi scenario coupled inflow forecast correction method the accuracy of the inflow forecast of tgr is improved 3 1 basic data this paper has collected the measured and forecasted inflow data of the tgr from august 1st 2018 to august 29th 2021 part of the data is shown in table 1 and the areal rainfall data of each region in the upstream of the tgr from august 1st 2018 to august 29th 2021 part of the data is shown in table 2 the forecast will start at 8 am every day using xin anjiang model li et al 2013 and there are six foresight periods namely the forecasted inflow of the second day the third day the fourth day the fifth day the sixth and seventh day can be obtained in current day 3 2 scenario division and error confidence interval calculation according to the rainfall and corresponding inflow data from august 2018 to august 2021 the forecast scenarios are divided firstly the rainfall scenarios are divided according to the sum of the areal rainfall in the upstream basin of tgr after the aforementioned three tests it is found that the rainfall data in each scenario obtained by dividing the rainfall data with 15 mm boundary is relatively uniform and this is conducive to the subsequent modeling and analysis so the rainfall scenarios are divided with the 15 mm boundary secondly according to the six foresight periods different forecast scenarios are obtained further and finally twelve forecast scenarios are obtained although the actual forecast scenarios may be more detailed this paper only divides these twelve scenarios due to the limitations of data information the corresponding conditions of the foresight period and rainfall under each scenario are shown in table 3 the scatter plots of the relative error of inflow forecasting under each scenario are shown in figs 5 and 6 it can be seen from fig 5 and fig 6 that the distribution of scattered points corresponding to different scenarios is different and some scenarios that have some abnormal values that deviate too much need to be eliminated or processed the normal distribution of relative errors of inflow forecasts under different scenarios can be derived according to the scatter plots the principle of deriving the theoretical curve of normal distribution based on the discrete points is shown in fig 7 and the results obtained are shown in figs 8 and 9 it can be seen from fig 8 and fig 9 that the relative error corresponding to different forecast scenarios obeys the normal distribution and its changing law is that with the extension of the foresight period the normal distribution curve changes from high lean type to short fat type which shows that with the extension of the foresight period the forecast error gradually increases the normal distribution curve of the scenario with areal rainfall below 15 mm is generally thinner than that of the scenario with areal rainfall above 15 mm which indicates that the forecast error increase with the increase of rainfall in addition after deleting outliers the confidence interval corresponding to 90 confidence is selected as the error correction interval events outside the confidence interval are considered to be low probability events and it does not occur in the default normal situation the obtained confidence intervals corresponding to different scenarios are shown in table 4 it can be seen from table 4 that the confidence intervals corresponding to the same confidence degree are different under different scenarios with the growth of the foresight period the confidence interval range under the same confidence degree keeps increasing the confidence interval of scenarios above 15 mm is generally larger than that of scenarios below 15 mm which is consistent with the distribution error rule of the previous analysis and verified the rationality of the obtained confidence interval 3 3 analysis of the corrected results 3 3 1 data verification and decomposition results of vmd 3 3 1 1 stationarity verification result adf test is conducted on the relative error data of the tgr inflow to verify its stability the test results are shown in table 5 the adf test is to judge whether there is a unit root in the sequence if the sequence is stable there is no unit root otherwise there will be a unit root therefore the h0 hypothesis of the adf test is the existence of a unit root if the obtained significance test statistics are less than the three confidence degrees 10 5 1 the null hypothesis is rejected with the confidence of due 90 95 99 from table 5 it can be seen that the absolute values of test statistics under different scenarios are not less than the three key values the p values are all less than 1 of the significance level that is the confidence level greater than 99 rejects the null hypothesis 3 3 1 2 decomposition results of vmd matlab software is used to program the vmd in this paper and the vmd can optimize the final number of decomposition modes according to the data situation the decided final number of decomposition modes of vmd is five the decomposition results of vmd under different scenarios are shown in fig 10 it can be seen from fig 10 that on the whole the vmd decomposition can effectively control the number of modal decompositions avoid the overlapping of modal components and retain the main intrinsic modal sequence when the modal number is 1 it contains the most noise and as the modal number increases low frequency baseline oscillations and most of the high frequency noise are gradually discarded in addition from fig 10 it can be seen that after decomposition the initial sequence with poor regularity is decomposed into five fluctuation sequences with strong regularity and different frequencies for example from the green line to the blue line the fluctuation frequency of the sequence increases gradually in this way when lstm is used for prediction later the prediction accuracy of each decomposition sequence will be better than before decomposition 3 3 2 error forecast results and correction results of inflow forecast based on the decomposed data series obtained above the front 75 of inflow forecast error data in each scenario is used as the training set to train the constructed lstm network and optimize the parameters and the rest 25 data is used as the test data during the application of the model the previous 10 error points are used to forecast the next one and each sequence component after vmd decomposition is forecasted separately finally the results are superimposed to obtain the forecasted relative error on this basis the error beyond the confidence interval is corrected to the confidence interval and then the final forecasted relative error can be obtained which is shown in fig 11 test period from fig 11 it can be seen that the overall fluctuation trend of the forecasted relative error is consistent with that of the actual relative error and the fluctuation range of the former is smaller than that of the latter this indicates that after the forecasted inflow is corrected by the forecasted error obtained through the proposed method in this paper there will not be excessive corrections and will make the forecasted inflow closer to the measured inflow in addition the statistical results of error points which undergone interval correction under different scenarios are shown in table 6 as can be seen from table 6 except for scenarios 10 and 12 some forecasted errors by the lstm model in other scenarios will exceed the given confidence interval which shows that the interval correction proposed in this paper is necessary and effective it can properly correct the extreme case of too large or too small of forecasted relative error finally the corrected inflow can be obtained by inverse calculation using the forecasted relative error as shown in fig 12 from fig 12 it can be seen that the forecast effect after the correction is much better in especial it can be seen from the part marked by the red circle in fig 12 that the forecast effect of inflow is better and the forecast accuracy is higher after the interval correction and error correction under different scenarios in the literature by yuan et al 2021 they used lstm and ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd methods to predict the runoff of three gorges reservoir and also achieved good results but there were some deviations in the prediction of some turning points and peak values of runoff sequences from the research results of this paper we can see that the error correction of simulation results and the screening within the confidence interval well corrected the prediction data at the turning points and extreme values reducing the prediction error of the model the improvements of the accuracy of the model are analyzed in detail through mean absolute error mean relative error root mean square error and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient as follows 3 3 3 statistical index analysis after using the established error forecast model to obtain the forecasted relative error of inflow the original forecasted inflow can be corrected at this time it is necessary to evaluate the final corrected forecast effect to analyze the accuracy and practicability of the corrected model the model accuracy evaluation mainly uses the following indexes frías paredes et al 2018 meng et al 2019 3 3 3 1 mean absolute error mae m3 s mae represents the absolute differences between the forecasted result and the real result the smaller the value is the better the forecasted results are the formula is as follows 11 mae 1 n i 1 n y c i y 0 i where n represents the number of forecasted results y 0 i represents the real results and y c i represents the forecasted results 3 3 3 2 mean relative error mre mre represents the relative gap between the forecasted result and the real result the smaller the value is the better the forecasted results are the formula is as follows 12 mre 1 n i 1 n y c i y 0 i y 0 i 3 3 3 3 root mean square error rmse m3 s the root mean square error represents the degree of deviation between the forecasted result and the real result the smaller the value is the better the forecasted results are the formula is as follows 13 rmse 1 n i 1 n y 0 i y c i 2 3 3 3 4 nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nse can be used as an index for the coincidence degree between the forecasted process and the real process and the closer the value is to 1 the better the forecasted results are the calculation formula is as follows 14 r 2 1 i 1 n y c i y 0 i 2 i 1 n y 0 i y 0 2 where y 0 represents the average of the real values 3 3 3 5 reduction rate re of the evaluation indicators re can be used to indicate the optimization degree of the corrected data relative to the original data and the calculation formula is as follows 15 re e e e 100 where e means the mean evaluation indicators after correction such as mae mre rmse nse etc e means the original mean evaluation indicators before correction after correction the corresponding mean absolute error mean relative error root mean square error and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient under different scenarios are obtained as shown in table 7 in table 7 the situation a represents the actual situation situation b represents the error correction but no interval correction situation c represents the error correction and interval correction from table 7 it can be seen that compared with the actual situation when there is error correction but no confidence interval correction the mae changes from 1116 42 to 869 15 which means the re of mae between situation a and situation b is 22 1 indicating that the effect of error correction is significant after the addition of confidence interval correction it decreases from 869 15 to 853 70 further which means the re of mae between situation b and situation c is 1 8 indicating that confidence interval correction can further improve the forecast accuracy on the whole the average absolute error changes from 1116 42 in the beginning to 853 70 at last a decrease of 262 72 which means the re of mae between situation a and situation c is 23 5 for mre compared with the actual situation when there is error correction but no confidence interval correction the average relative error changes from 8 32 to 6 43 which means the re of mre between situation a and situation b is 22 7 indicating that the effect of error correction is significant after the addition of confidence interval correction the average relative error decreases from 6 43 to 6 36 further which means the re of mre between situation b and situation c is 1 1 indicating that confidence interval correction can further improve the forecast accuracy on the whole the average relative error changes from the initial 8 32 to the final 6 36 a decrease of 1 96 which means the re of mre between situation a and situation c is 23 6 for rmse compared with the actual situation when there is error correction but no confidence interval correction the root mean square error changes from 1760 67 to 1292 71 which means the re of rmse between situation a and situation b is 26 6 indicating that the error correction effect is significant after the addition of confidence interval correction it also decreases from 1292 71 to 1250 55 which means the re of rmse between situation b and situation c is 3 3 indicating that confidence interval correction can further improve the forecast accuracy in general the root mean square error changes from the initial 1760 67 to the final 1250 55 a decrease of 510 12 which means the re of mre between situation a and situation c is 29 0 for nse compared with the actual situation when there is error correction but no confidence interval correction the nse changes from 0 877 to 0 938 with an increase of 7 0 indicating that the effect of error correction is significant after adding the confidence interval correction it increases from 0 938 to 0 941 with a 0 32 increase on the whole the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient changes from the initial 0 877 to the final 0 941 the increase range reaches 7 3 the above is the result after the rainfall scenario division to verify that the processing method of rainfall scenario division is conducive to the improvement of forecast accuracy the comparison of mean absolute error mean relative error root mean square error and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient before and after rainfall scenario division are provided below as shown in table 8 in table 8 all situations are divided into three categories i e a b and c situation a represents the actual situation situation b1 represents the situation before the rainfall scenarios division error correction no interval correction situation b2 represents the situation before the rainfall scenarios division error correction interval correction situation c1 represents the situation after rainfall scenarios division error correction no interval correction situation c2 represents the situation after rainfall scenarios division error correction interval correction the value of type b can be obtained by inputting the actual data into the lstm model the value of type c is calculated by combining the values obtained by 12 scenarios in units of the actual foresight period according to the time series from table 8 it can be seen that the effect after interval correction is better than the effect before interval correction and the result after the scenarios division is better than the result before the scenarios division with the gradual change of the following situations including the actual situation situation before the rain scenarios division situation after the rain scenarios division the result of every statistical index is getting better and better this shows that the method of scenario coupled error correction and interval correction proposed in this paper is feasible and effective 4 conclusions this paper proposed a multi scenarios coupling correction method for inflow prediction according to the inflow and rainfall data of the three gorges reservoir from august 2018 to august 2021 and considering different rainfall values and different inflow prediction periods 12 scenarios were divided and obtained the error sequence processed by stationarity test autocorrelation test and vmd decomposition was input into lstm model to obtain the prediction error value after it was corrected by the confidence interval the predicted inflow was corrected by the error to obtain more accurate predicted inflow according to the research results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 with the extension of the forecast periods the error distribution curve gradually changes from the high lean type to short fat type and the error curve with rainfall greater than 15 mm is wider and shorter than the error curve with rainfall less than 15 mm this indicates that the prediction error shows an increasing trend with the growth of the forecast period and the increase of rainfall 2 vmd decomposition of error signals and prediction can improve the prediction effect and accuracy of lstm model the results show that the average absolute error of predicted value and measured value has changed from 1116 42 to 869 15 the average relative error changed from 8 32 to 6 43 the root mean square error changed from 1760 67 to 1292 71 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient changed from 0 877 to 0 938 3 filtering the confidence of the prediction data can further improve the prediction accuracy and prevent the occurrence of excessive prediction deviation compared with the prediction data before filtering the average absolute error changed from 869 15 to 853 7 the average absolute error changed from 6 43 to 6 36 the root mean square error changed from 1292 71 to 1250 55 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient changed from 0 938 to 0 941 in general compared with the actual situation the correction method proposed in this paper can change the average absolute error from the initial 1116 42 to the final 853 70 reducing 262 72 and 23 5 the average relative error can be changed from 8 32 to 6 36 decreasing by 1 96 of absolute value and 23 6 of relative amplitude the root mean square error can be changed from 1760 67 to 1250 55 with a reduction of 510 12 and a reduction range of 29 0 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient can change from 0 877 to 0 941 with an increase of 0 064 and 7 3 overall hydrologic data decomposition and scenario division can improve the prediction accuracy of hydrological forecast the error correction method proposed in this paper can be one of the reference methods to improve the inflow prediction accuracy of different watersheds the main novelty of this paper is to divide the prediction scenarios under different conditions apply vmd method to error decomposition and then use lstm model to predict the error data and use confidence interval to update the data the vmd lstm tgr coupling model mentioned in this study can greatly reduce the error of the predicted inflow because different inflow prediction models inevitably have different degrees of error the method proposed in this paper can be applied to other basins to improve the prediction accuracy for the future studies the author believes that further research can be done on different model analysis that is different scenarios may use different models to predict the error not only a single lstm to achieve better results credit authorship contribution statement suiling wang data curation formal

2202,though urban areas represent a small fraction of global land cover they have an outsized impact on hydrological processes within these areas the pathways that water follows are fundamentally transformed by the disturbance of soils land cover vegetation topography and built infrastructure while progress has been made across many cities to quantify interactions between hydrological processes and the urban environment many fundamental questions remain unanswered in this article we review the state of urban hydrologic science with an eye towards identifying gaps in our understanding of how water flows through built landscapes our review focuses on key topics within urban hydrology related to water quantity including runoff and streamflow generation soils and soil water groundwater vegetation and climate we also describe some of the challenges and opportunities within the field of urban hydrology that we envision will drive future work and collaboration keywords urban water management impervious surface cover stormwater climate infrastructure data availability data will be made available on request 1 urban land cover growth and changes in hydrology urban areas account for only 0 5 of the planet s land area angel et al 2011 yet are home to over half the world s population united nations 2017 these areas are defined by extensive built structures impervious surfaces and relatively large populations and consequently have a significant impact on global water resources flörke et al 2018 mcdonald et al 2014 seto et al 2012 along with well established urban areas many areas of the planet are experiencing an expansion of built up land uses e g residential commercial and industrial areas approximately one third of all rivers and streams on the planet are estimated to pass through agricultural industrial or urban infrastructure albert et al 2021 dramatically altering natural hydrologic processes past and future growth in urban land cover includes the construction of new roads and buildings as well as water and sanitation infrastructure all of which directly and indirectly alter the water cycle while work towards understanding the impacts of urban areas on the water cycle has been ongoing for over 50 years e g leopold 1968 it has primarily focused on the impacts of impervious surfaces on hydrological processes physical aspects of urbanization can lead to a reorganization of surface and subsurface flow pathways due to an increase in impervious surface cover isc and compacted soils subsurface drainage networks artificial usually straight surface drainage and vegetation removal these factors have important implications for the partitioning of precipitation fig 1 precipitation when it reaches the urban land surface will either initially be captured via interception on plants or other surfaces evaporate infiltrate or runoff as overland flow infiltration excess overland flow occurs when the rate of water input on the land surface exceeds the infiltration rate of the surface is one source of runoff that is commonly generated from buildings roads parking lots and other impervious surfaces and moves rapidly to the stream network either directly or via storm sewers when infiltration excess overland flow encounters stormwater control measures scm the timing and magnitude of water movement may be modified depending on the effectiveness of the scm saturation excess overland flow occurs when water inputs at the land surface cannot infiltrate due to saturated conditions has also been proposed as an important flow pathway for rapid water transport to urban streams stewart et al 2019 although it is rarely reported in field studies water that does infiltrate pervious surfaces and percolate to groundwater may still interact with urban infrastructure e g subsurface utility lines water supply sanitary storm pipes via preferential flow processes resulting in relatively fast movement of water to streams hibbs et al 2012 kaushal and belt 2012 subsurface water moving along slow pathways to the stream may contribute to streamflow depending on the extent of stream channel hardening which limits groundwater gains or losses to streams ledford and lautz 2015 responses along these pathways can be modified by climate over long time scales and perturbations during extreme conditions e g droughts and floods over short time scales an additional complexity in the urban water cycle is that water may be imported or exported across watershed topographic boundaries via water infrastructure and human withdrawal for public water supply through interbasin transfers water may be imported via pumping from deep groundwater that is otherwise disconnected from surface water or via piping from adjacent watersheds this imported water is redistributed in cities through pipe networks that often leak supplying subsurface flow in urban watersheds price 2011 during wet weather water may also be imported or exported through combined sewer pipes hopkins et al 2014 urban hydrology reviews from the past 12 years e g bonneau et al 2017 gessner et al 2014 hibbs et al 2012 mcgrane 2016 o driscoll et al 2010 have focused on characterization of urban areas and their impacts on the water cycle e g rainfall patterns rainfall runoff relationships hydrological losses and surface and subsurface flow dynamics water quality e g temperature suspended sediments contaminants of emerging concern and associated ecological implications e g nutrient cycling primary production abundance and diversity of aquatic organisms the impacts of urban water management in particular scm on the water cycle have also been described in past reviews ahiablame et al 2012 askarizadeh et al 2015 bell et al 2020 while there are similarities across these urban hydrology reviews there are also distinct differences some work focuses on specific geographic areas o driscoll et al 2010 while others focus on specific water flow paths bonneau et al 2017 hibbs et al 2012 mcgrane 2016 summarized the classic challenges in the field of urban hydrology which include scaling process understanding from the plot to catchment estimating and measuring key processes e g precipitation infiltration evapotranspiration and their spatial variability quantifying hydrological interactions between engineered and natural components of the urban water cycle including the role of pervious areas assessing the benefits of scm across scales and predicting the effects of climate change on urban hydrology today we still lack an understanding of the scales of heterogeneous processes in urban systems and what spatial and temporal scales are the most important to address different hydrologic questions the slow progress on answering these fundamental questions over the past 50 years since leopold 1968 leads us to write this review we focus on revisiting long standing urban hydrology questions and progress that has been made on answering them since the last relevant reviews we also identify current challenges in the field of urban hydrology and opportunities for moving past them in particular we highlight the need to fully characterize physiography and dominant hydrologic processes in urban catchments the data collection and logistics needed for this next steps in modeling urban systems and an overall need for more cross city comparisons our perspective is mainly derived from north america with some examples from europe we focus exclusively on the physical movement of water and do not address water quality issues in urban areas furthermore this review does not heavily integrate literature covering the hydraulic performance upscaling approaches or strategies for implementing green infrastructure and scm see baker et al 2022 golden and hoghooghi 2018 li et al 2019 for recent reviews we are not debating the definition of urban as we recognize that the term can mean different things to different readers nor are we focusing on socio hydrology or environmental justice issues around urban hydrology while noting that all are important topics we have structured the review to work through different compartments of the urban critical zone beginning with a review of urban runoff and streamflow generation and how infrastructure drives these processes section 2 individual sections follow on urban soils and soil water section 3 urban groundwater section 4 and urban greenspaces and the role of vegetation on urban hydrological processes section 5 we then summarize climatic processes that are impacted by urbanization and the importance of understanding future climate change section 6 we conclude our review with a discussion of remaining and new challenges in the field of urban hydrology and opportunities for addressing outstanding research questions section 7 2 urban runoff and streamflow generation 2 1 the shape of urban hydrographs urban watersheds are typically characterized by flashy hydrographs exhibiting a rapid rise in streamflow high peak flows and then a rapid recession of streamflow gurnell et al 2007 though we note that in highly arid places impervious watersheds can be less flashy than watersheds with low imperviousness mcphillips et al 2019 the dominant perceptual model seibert and mcdonnell 2002 of urban streamflow generation attributes this flashiness to rapid transport of rainfall and meltwater from impervious surfaces on the landscape via infiltration excess overland flow and pipe networks fig 1 leopold 1968 because urban areas are composed of impervious surfaces and many urban soils are compacted much of urban runoff is produced via infiltration excess overland flow however depending on precipitation event characteristics soil moisture and drainage patterns permeable surfaces in urban settings can become saturated and produce saturation excess overland flow miles and band 2015 valeo and moin 2001 creating dynamic conditions wherein the permeable surfaces may switch from a sink to a source of stormwater runoff despite the assumed paradigm of infiltration excess overland flow dominating urban stream response the shapes of urban hydrographs are variable fig 2 and the controls on watershed flashiness vary regionally with climate physical landscape characteristics and human impacts driving a substantial portion of the variability ariano and oswald 2022a gannon et al 2022 this variability in hydrograph response representing an integrated signal of all upstream and upslope processes shows that a diversity of flow paths drives urban response not just infiltration excess overland flow and isc one common approach for comparing the impacts of urbanization on streamflow time series is via the use of hydrologic signatures streamflow metrics that describe the properties of hydrologic time series datasets hydrologic signatures allow for the characterization of the flow regime to understand the degree of hydrologic alteration environmental flows and watershed processes mcmillan 2020 typical hydrologic signatures include metrics that describe behavior at low flow such as the baseflow index that characterize the magnitude and rate of change such as flashiness and that characterize high flows such as peak flow in watersheds with limited human influence analysis of hydrologic signatures typically links streamflow generation with a combination of climatic aridity and precipitation amount and physiographic drivers slope soils and vegetation wu et al 2021 in contrast hydrologic signatures in urban watersheds reveal a strong imprint of urbanization that varies across different climate regions tetzlaff et al 2005 generally urbanization produces variable patterns in low flow ledford et al 2020 variable flashiness ariano and oswald 2022a and increases in high flows hopkins et al 2015a hopkins et al 2015b with the largest differences in high flows observed in semi arid and arid regions bhaskar et al 2020 however as hypothesized by utz et al 2016 certain physiographic characteristics e g stormwater management soils and geology topography may buffer or offer some resistance to hydrological as well as ecological changes common in urban watersheds though the relative importance of these features to explaining hydrologic signatures remains variable and poorly understood streamflow responses to urbanization also vary spatially within a single watershed as well as through time bhaskar et al 2020 for example hydrograph characteristics such as flashiness can vary along a given stream as drainage area increases fig 3 this is illustrated for rocky branch a tributary to walnut creek in raleigh nc purported to be the flashiest u s geological survey usgs streamgage in the contiguous united states smith and smith 2015 for this system the peak dampens and the length of the rising limb and total duration lengthens moving downstream of rocky branch through the mainstem of walnut creek fig 3 the distribution and connectivity of isc infrastructure such as large reservoirs floodplain and wetland storage and the topology of the stream network all interact to shape how the flood peak moves through the larger walnut creek watershed 2 2 infrastructure based drivers of urban streamflow generation 2 2 1 impervious surface cover hydrograph flashiness of urban watersheds though influenced by watershed characteristics such as slope and surface roughness is primarily attributed to high levels of impervious surfaces and high densities of stormwater pipes that quickly route runoff to streams and rivers hopkins et al 2015a shuster et al 2005 fig 1 because isc can be tracked managed and forecasted schueler et al 2009 it has been used for decades to predict a range of urban impacts including hydrologic response habitat degradation and water quality impairment arnold and gibbons 1996 however increasing isc does not always provide adequate quantitative prediction of urban impacts ariano and oswald 2022a booth and jackson 1997 schueler et al 2009 due to differences in how impervious cover is estimated it is possible threshold relationships occur with hydrological and ecological variables jacobson 2011 for example impervious surfaces that are directly connected to the stream network such as transportation land cover that is often piped directly to receiving waters may have larger impacts on hydrologic response than overall isc hopkins et al 2015a mejía and moglen 2010 shuster et al 2007 consequently impervious surfaces are sometimes subset into those that are not directly connected to the stream and those that are directly connected e g roy and shuster 2009 or effectively connected e g ebrahimian et al 2016 effective and directly connected impervious areas differ in their methodological approaches with the former being statistically computed from rainfall runoff data and the latter typically being estimated using geospatial analysis of infrastructure and or land use land cover data and ground truthed at small spatial scales roy and shuster 2009 recent analysis of flashiness metrics across urbanization gradients shows the importance of underlying physiographic characteristics in driving streamflow response ariano and oswald 2022a a wide range of factors can influence hydrologic connectivity in urban watersheds and whether non directly connected impervious areas contribute significantly to runoff response this complexity limits our ability to quantify the portion of isc from which there is rapid mobilization of event water to the stream similar to the concept of hydrologic connectivity in less impacted watersheds although rainfall runoff observations have been used to estimate effective impervious area ebrahimian et al 2016 there are confounding factors large events can enhance apparent isc relationships delesantro et al 2021 and rainfall intensity and duration influence infiltration patterns sytsma et al 2020 another scale effect is watershed size fig 3 with greater isc impacts observed for small watersheds roodsari and chandler 2017 steeper slopes can enhance isc runoff hopkins et al 2015b kelleher and mcphillips 2020 estimating connectivity is also confounded by subsurface drainage networks which are often unmapped walsh et al 2022 for this reason caution should be used when estimating connected isc from remotely sensed data at large spatial scales as these additional influences may be obscured not all isc especially asphalt and concrete roads sidewalks and driveways are completely impervious as this infrastructure ages it weathers and cracks with some field studies showing deterioration of these surface materials can greatly increase porosity and infiltration ability ramier et al 2004 redfern et al 2016 wiles and sharp jr 2008 furthermore whether a non directly connected impervious area contributes to storm response can depend on down slope pervious surface characteristics although pervious surfaces are thought to provide more infiltration than impervious surfaces physical characteristics of pervious surfaces such as soil texture prior compaction microtopography antecedent soil moisture conditions and the presence of vegetation strongly influence infiltration rates and storage volumes transient factors such as rainfall and soil moisture are especially important in low permeability soils sytsma et al 2020 in other words not all pervious surfaces are alike as discussed below in section 3 urban soils and soil water 2 2 2 artificial drainage via sewers much above ground impervious surface coverage drains via surface pathways such as gutters and ditches to below ground pipe networks to decrease flooding and quickly and efficiently move water off the landscape and into streams and rivers in urban systems fig 1 these networks that move stormwater down slope from engineered headwaters fork et al 2018 to streams and rivers are an integral portion of the network of directly connected impervious areas and have been shown to significantly increase the rate of water flow to streams ress et al 2020 most commonly understanding the impact of subsurface drainage on urban hydrograph response has been framed as model based analysis e g nanía et al 2015 shrestha et al 2022 and is highly limited by data availability chegini and li 2022 modeling efforts show that watersheds with higher storm sewer densities increase the magnitude of peak discharge meierdiercks et al 2010 older cities typically have areas where streams have been buried into stormwater pipes elmore and kaushal 2008 hopkins and bain 2018 napieralski et al 2015 napieralski and welsh 2016 roy et al 2009 commonly located in the headwaters and moving both baseflow and stormflow combined sewer systems where stormwater and sewage are co located in pipes are also direct connections from isc to streams rivers and other water bodies during overflows but the total area of directly connected impervious area in a combined sewer system will vary with time as pipes shift from flowing to wastewater treatment plants wwtp during baseflow to overflowing into water bodies during storms fig 4 the rate and volume of water moved will depend on the shape of the pipe network and size of the pipes while pipe material will impact potential leakage or infiltration covered further in section 4 hopkins and bain 2018 sanitary sewers are not directly connected to isc or the river network but still represent important flow paths in the urban landscape see section 4 delesantro et al 2022 2 2 3 channel straightening hardening and other changes in stream morphology urban river form reflects human activity and direct intervention within the channel e g culvertizing or concrete lining of streams as well as the introduction of impervious surfaces in the upgradient watershed area draining to a given stream fig 1 chin 2006 gurnell et al 2007 such disturbances both along the channel and in the watershed can induce changes to channel morphology with subsequent impacts on hydrology in many cases urban channels have been engineered or designed specifically for flood management gurnell et al 2007 urban channels for a variety of reasons may be straightened confined e g levees and have armored beds and banks including channel hardening with concrete gabions and sheet piling booth and fischenich 2015 often these alterations to channel morphology result in a disconnection between urban streams and the surrounding floodplain which then modifies surface water groundwater responses ledford and lautz 2015 ryan et al 2010 straightening also serves to rapidly route flow downstream this in turn shapes hydrologic responses and sources of streamflow during high flow and baseflow periods upstream and upgradient urbanization can also alter the supply of sediment to a given stream reach with subsequent impacts on morphology gurnell et al 2007 2 2 4 stormwater management practices stormwater control measures are used to mitigate flashy urban streamflow although their longevity and effectiveness particularly at the watershed scale is not well known baker et al 2022 golden and hoghooghi 2018 national research council 2009 most field studies have been conducted on small scales e g individual scm or small sub basins while modeling is used to evaluate large scale e g watershed impacts baker et al 2022 jefferson et al 2017 stormwater control measures can function to increase the infiltration and storage of runoff and also include end of pipe controls the variety of scm encompasses infiltration controls infiltration trenches pervious pipe systems grassed swales vegetated buffer strips and more end of pipe controls constructed wetlands wet ponds dry ponds and soil amendments though we focus primarily on engineered scm in this section we note that shuster et al 2022 has coined the term passive green infrastructure to extend to other urban green spaces such as urban parks vegetated roadsides and vacant land we also refer to these practices as scm and not green infrastructure in light of the lack of universal definition and goals of green infrastructure matsler et al 2021 jefferson et al 2017 highlighted that employing scm to return streams to pre urban peaks and volumes is likely not a realistic goal furthermore scm are often intended to capture smaller storms that occur frequently 2 5 cm or 1 inch over 24 hours for many u s regulatory goals u s environmental protection agency 2016 ameliorating the impacts from larger storms that may occur more frequently under future climate scenarios will remain a challenge see section 6 3 baker et al 2022 rosenberger et al 2021 sohn et al 2019 another challenge in highly urban areas is finding space to install or retrofit scm that can hold or infiltrate meaningful amounts of stormwater relative to the total volume of stormwater in the basin during a given precipitation or snowmelt event therefore it is crucial to consider the pathways of urban runoff when investigating the effective placement of scm to enhance stormwater capture jefferson et al 2017 voter and loheide ii 2018 walsh et al 2022 the placement of scm along critical flowpaths can provide more stormwater capture than increasing the number of scm fry and maxwell 2017 additionally in arid areas the structure of urban stormwater networks may serve as a scm by increasing flow dispersion and reducing peak flows along the network jovanovic et al 2019 modeling studies focused on groundwater response to infiltration have demonstrated that infiltration based scm can increase groundwater recharge and subsequently streamflow barron et al 2013 bhaskar et al 2018 and have also shown that this response varies depending on local hydrogeologic conditions endreny and collins 2009 göbel et al 2004 hamel et al 2013 scaling up stormwater infiltration for purposeful aquifer recharge is increasing in popularity for example some cities have integrated a design framework that has focused on using multiple infrastructure approaches to address water quantity and quality issues li et al 2017 assessment of groundwater recharge following these water sensitive initiatives show decreased recharge compared to pre urbanization but still increased relative to traditional urban design however with the potential for groundwater mounding clogging and contamination howard et al 2007 meng et al 2022 zhang and chui 2019 climate has a strong control on the impact of scm on groundwater with infiltration from stormwater control measures in arid environments increasing groundwater recharge and baseflow mcphillips et al 2019 indeed stream flashiness can actually decrease in arid urban streams due in part to the introduction of scm like stormwater detention ponds which enhance water retention mcphillips et al 2019 while storm characteristics are an important control on the degree to which scm reduce event scale runoff holman dodds et al 2003 sohn et al 2019 their impact on runoff recharge and evapotranspiration at annual or longer time scales may be better explained by the aridity index and measures of precipitation intermittency voter and loheide 2021 2 2 5 canals and dams in many cities the river network and flow of water is augmented by the addition of canals and or dams canals have long been used to control the flow of water with many civilizations building canals for water transport and access over many kilometers fig 1 romero lankao 2010 wescoat jr et al 2018 canals can either be naturally lined or lined with concrete in some urban areas and are often used to transport stormwater away from urban areas huong and pathirana 2013 lim and lu 2016 canals were historically developed to support irrigation or agriculture in watersheds with mixed land use wescoat jr et al 2018 canals may exist within cities or as a means to transport water over large distances to cities the impact of canals on the river network will vary with configuration use and management the impact of dams on hydrographs is well researched graf 1999 habets et al 2018 magilligan and nislow 2005 given more than 60 of rivers exceeding 1000 km in length are no longer free flowing grill et al 2019 as dams are typically used for purposes that benefit cities e g water supply flood control navigation hydropower many cities either contain dams or are downstream of dams given the direct impact of dams on hydrologic response the presence of upstream dams may alter the typical shape of hydrographs expected in highly impervious areas for example a hydrograph from the don river in toronto ontario shows hydrographs for two events one with a stormflow peak and one immediately following where the radial arm gates at an upstream dam were closed and as a result sheared off the expected flood peak fig 5 given such widely recognized impacts it is crucial to document the presence of dams in urban areas in hydrologic investigations seeking to relate urban form e g isc and function e g hydrograph shape or hydrologic signatures 2 2 6 interbasin transfers many urban watersheds are not closed systems and experience interbasin transfers that move water across urban watershed boundaries fig 1 zhuang 2016 the most recent analysis of inter basin transfers in the united states identified many that impact urban areas including the delaware and catskills aqueducts that provide water to new york city water movement from the colorado river basin to los angeles and other california cities and the chattahoochee south river that supplies much of atlanta among numerous others dickson and dzombak 2017 approximately 10 of the largest population centers across the globe are estimated to rely on water piped from more than 265 km away mcdonald et al 2014 paliwal and baghela 2007 note that groundwater levels have risen as much as 30 m in jodhpur india which is hypothesized to be due to inter basin transfers of water into the city of the water pumped in 33 is not conveyed through wastewater infrastructure indicating it could be recharging groundwater or lost to evapotranspiration 2 2 7 wastewater treatment plants treated wastewater effluent discharges directly into many urban streams and rivers impacting the quantity and quality of streamflow fig 1 in the united states 80 of large cities by population that rely on surface water for drinking water withdraw water that includes treated wastewater turner et al 2021 while less detrimental to the receiving ecosystem than untreated waste these discharges can still have negative impacts on water quality e g nutrients metals and in stream ecological health carey and migliaccio 2009 though in select cases and for certain metals this effluent may dilute heavy metal concentrations wolfand et al 2022 small urban streams can have 50 or more of their total discharge sourced from wwtp effluent ledford et al 2021 even large rivers are impacted with the panke river in berlin germany sourcing up to 90 of its flow from wwtp effluent during dry periods marx et al 2021 and the south platte river usa sometimes entirely sourced from effluent dennehy et al 1998 these outputs have important implications for sustaining urban baseflow in areas that would otherwise have variable low flows ledford et al 2020 or would run dry as a result of climate change water reuse or water withdrawals elsewhere halaburka et al 2013 wolfand et al 2022 the impacts of wwtp releases are readily discernible from hydrographs and can show impacts many kilometers downstream fig 6 in many combined sewer systems deep pipe or reservoir storage facilities capture an exceptional volume of combined sewer overflows diverting a substantial portion of runoff long distances to a large centralized facility where this water is temporarily stored treated and then discharged to surface waterways allegheny county sanitary authority 2019 metropolitan water reclamation district of greater chicago 2021 pinney 2010 the overall impact of sustained wwtp discharge on the natural flow regime poff et al 1997 has not been well established and will equally shape the fate and transport of many types of pollutants including emerging contaminants and subsequent impact of effluent quality on downstream ecosystems 3 urban soils and soil water 3 1 importance of urban soils infiltration in urban areas is limited by the presence and characteristics of impervious surfaces this elevates the importance of pervious areas which generate less runoff than impervious surfaces and often play an important role in stormwater management by infiltrating runoff generated on nearby impervious surfaces law et al 2004 pervious surfaces may include natural areas and parks residential lawns mueller and thompson 2009 vacant lots kelleher et al 2020 riparian zones or floodplains manufactured surfaces such as permeable pavement palla and gnecco 2015 and certain types of scm within pervious areas soil properties such as porosity soil water retention characteristics and infiltration rates or hydraulic conductivity control partitioning between infiltration and runoff along with topographic gradients preferential flow pathways for example caused by desiccation cracks decaying tree roots worm burrows and animal excavations are also important in this regard soil properties also influence the storage and movement of water within the subsurface including depths to and movement of groundwater gillefalk et al 2022 in these ways soils control the timescales and pathways that water follows at the surface and in the subsurface and shape runoff behavior at point to plot to watershed scales the complex role of soil hydraulic properties on urban hydrology is compounded by the high spatio temporal heterogeneity of soils in urban areas where soils are formed and molded through human disturbance and modified by the presence of urban vegetation and subsurface infrastructure craul 1992 effland and pouyat 1997 lehmann and stahr 2007 shuster et al 2021 urban areas are likely to have soils with simpler profiles absence of b horizon or resequenced soil horizons which has implications for soil water storage herrmann et al 2018 quantifying urban soil properties especially infiltration rates and hydraulic conductivity is crucial for predicting urban runoff and estimating localized flooding impacts including where and when pervious areas are sinks versus sources via infiltration excess overland flow or saturation excess overland flow of stormwater runoff e g lim 2016 miles and band 2015 stewart et al 2019 understanding design issues that define where to target investment in scm and or other structural or non structural stormwater interventions e g kelleher et al 2020 lim and welty 2017 voter and loheide ii 2018 quantifying evaporation and evapotranspiration rates quantifying subsurface recharge groundwater tables and subsurface pathways of water contribution to urban streams and understanding how changes to soil properties through time may alter all of the above 3 2 disturbance and heterogeneity of urban soils urban landscapes are a hodgepodge of soil types and properties largely as a result of human activity in urban landscapes craul 1999 pickett and cadenasso 2009 schleuβ et al 1998 shuster et al 2014 within urban areas the u s natural resources conservation service has its own classification for urban soils craul 1985 to indicate that local measurements are needed this label represents the extensive disturbance that these areas experience via the removal of soils and addition of fill during construction the removal and addition of impervious surfaces and the cycle of demolition and rebuilding that characterizes urban landscapes craul 1985 o riordan et al 2021 yang and zhang 2015 additional descriptors are needed for urban landscapes impacted by warfare certini et al 2013 hupy and schaetzl 2006 international syntheses characterizing likely infiltration rates and other soil properties within urban areas are lacking schwartz and smith 2016 and existing approaches to estimate such properties poorly approximate observations schifman and shuster 2019 shuster et al 2021 described the complexities of urban soil histories for estimating hydraulic conductivity a crucial variable in most hydrologic modeling indeed hydraulic conductivity across urban areas can vary by many orders of magnitude and does not always decrease with depth shuster et al 2021 variations in urban soil properties with depth are poorly documented with many studies solely focusing on characterizations in the upper few centimeters of the soil profile soil compaction due to human activity is a common urban phenomenon in the top surface which has a strong influence on infiltration effland and pouyat 1997 pitt et al 2008 yang and zhang 2015 as such pervious areas e g open space vacant lots are known to experience a range of infiltration rates from high bergeson et al 2022 kelleher et al 2020 to low gregory et al 2006 shuster et al 2005 vegetated areas should not be assumed to have high infiltration because compaction occurs due to mowing and foot traffic especially in popular recreation areas when considering urban residential parcels voter and loheide ii 2018 highlighted through modeling that reducing compaction and amending soils is one of the best interventions that can be undertaken to reduce surface runoff and favor infiltration when and where urban soils are compacted heterogeneity in infiltration can even occur at small scales a few meters or even sub meter scales shuster et al 2014 as shown by pope et al 2023 during storm monitoring using electrical resistivity tomography fig 7 urban soils are further subject to a subsurface phenomenon termed urban karst wherein coarse materials surrounding subsurface infrastructure e g pipes may support rapid preferential flow bonneau et al 2017 hibbs et al 2012 kaushal and belt 2012 along with the need to characterize them urban soils and associated properties can be included as a design component in scm with a variety of soil amendments including compost thompson et al 2008 and biochar yi et al 2020 the primary function of amended soil is to maintain high porosity and infiltration rates though some amendments may also enhance nutrient removal tian et al 2019 or carbon sequestration smith 2016 because such a wide range of amendment materials and mixes are used it can be difficult to estimate the hydraulic properties of amended soil with confidence unless direct measurements are made in addition many studies have shown that such properties can vary through time in particular due to clogging le coustumer et al 2009 natarajan and davis 2015 given scm are typically vegetated identifying the balance between infiltration and evapotranspiration remains an important area of research hamel et al 2013 poozan et al 2022 as some work has shown that nearly all infiltrated stormwater during summer periods may quickly be evapotranspired bonneau et al 2018b 3 3 integrating soil properties hydrological processes and hydrological modeling given how important soil properties are to urban hydrologic processes selecting appropriate values or ranges for soil properties such as porosity soil water retention characteristics and infiltration rate or hydraulic conductivity is a key consideration for urban hydrologic modeling in the absence of direct observations common soil characterizations used by modelers are often based on data from agricultural soils using such estimates may over or underestimate infiltration rates and therefore misrepresent hydrological processes in urban areas bergeson et al 2022 schifman and shuster 2019 voter and loheide ii 2020 one alternative is to generate pedotransfer functions for hydraulic conductivity at the city scale jian et al 2021 however similar pedotransfer relationships for urban soil water retention characteristics remain unexplored a more expansive discussion of hydrologic modeling in urban systems follows in section 7 4 4 urban groundwater 4 1 the importance of groundwater in urban areas the study of urban groundwater has grown considerably over the past decade in recognition of the importance of this valuable water source giordano 2009 silva et al 2020 vázquez suñé et al 2010 groundwater sustains low flows for most surface water systems and is a critical source of potable drinking and irrigation water for communities worldwide crucially approximately 50 of the global potable water supply is provided by groundwater and nearly half of the world s population many of whom live in large cities relies on groundwater as their primary source of drinking water giordano 2009 with urban population growth the use of urban aquifers is expanding in an effort to build resilience in water supply systems scanlon et al 2016 wallace et al 2021 despite the alteration of natural flow pathways due to impervious surface cover and urban infrastructure groundwater still plays an important role in urban streamflow generation e g follstad shah et al 2019 meriano et al 2011

groundwater depending on local topographic gradients e g chloride from winter salts kaushal et al 2005 ledford et al 2016 roy 2019 understanding the impacts of urban infrastructure on the recharge and discharge of groundwater is critical for maintaining the services it provides humans and other organisms 4 2 dominant processes driving urban groundwater groundwater recharge and discharge in urban areas are intimately linked to the pervasiveness of isc and subsurface urban infrastructure often described as urban karst kaushal and belt 2012 in some of the most highly urbanized areas streams themselves have been buried and now flow through underground pipes elmore and kaushal 2008 forgrave et al 2022 napieralski et al 2015 many studies report a reduction in direct groundwater recharge from precipitation due to the high coverage of impervious surfaces shuster et al 2005 there are also trade offs between reduced evapotranspiration due to vegetation removal and increases in local infiltration in some cases lerner 2002 schirmer et al 2013 urban groundwater recharge can be enhanced by indirect recharge from leaky water supply pipes sanitary pipes e g kaushal and belt 2012 and septic systems e g capps et al 2020 as well as over irrigation of greenspaces fillo et al 2021 determining the direct impacts of pipe networks on subsurface flows is a great challenge due to uncertainty in the location and quality e g cracks of underground pipe infrastructure hibbs et al 2012 hopkins and bain 2018 kaushal and belt 2012 scm are typically used to promote infiltration at the plot scale but may equally impart catchment scale impacts on groundwater recharge e g meng et al 2022 groundwater discharge to surface waters can also be modified by urban infrastructure for example lining stream channels can result in decreased baseflow bhaskar et al 2020 urban groundwater can also infiltrate into sanitary and storm sewer pipes which then act as a preferential flow path to wwtp or streams e g pangle et al 2022 zhang and parolari 2022 the impacts of these altered flow pathways can be amplified when water is imported from adjacent watersheds e g dickson and dzombak 2017 determining which infrastructure mediated route was the source of baseflow in streams can be supported through fingerprinting approaches including with isotopes divers et al 2014 4 2 1 infrastructure mediated routes of urban groundwater recharge one of the underground water conveyance networks kaushal and belt 2012 that has a high potential to increase recharge to groundwater in urban environments is leaking potable water pipes reported rates of loss over distribution lines range from about 8 of the total volume of piped water lerner 1997 to 60 lerner 1986 with garcia fresca 2007 reporting typical values across the literature of 20 30 these estimations are frequently calculated by comparing volumes of water leaving drinking water treatment facilities to the volume of water billed to customers for consumptive use although it is worth noting that many municipalities have had failures in their water billing systems and estimates have to be made about non billable or non revenue uses or losses gonzález gómez et al 2011 liemberger and wyatt 2019 recent modeling work has shown that high permeability trenches that surround such water utilities may hold much of the exfiltrating water with less recharging urban aquifers than previously hypothesized especially in low permeability native soils but potentially create preferential flow along pipes d aniello et al 2021 along with leaks from pressurized drinking water pipes subsidies from stormwater pipes sewer overflows or water line breaks can result in runoff ratios greater than one in highly urbanized systems where headwater streams are buried forgrave et al 2022 in some parts of the world e g the united states and canada areas of urbanization that are more recently developed and or on the fringes or exurbs are frequently delayed in connectivity to a centralized sewer system lagro et al 2017 newburn and berck 2011 in these locations individual houses rely on on site wastewater treatment such as septic systems when working properly a septic system will recharge groundwater with leachate that has been fully treated through a leachate field to remove solids bacteria and nutrients however many septic systems have high potential to fail due to age of the system or lack of maintenance which is correlated with the socioeconomic status of the population capps et al 2020 most research around septic impact in urban environments focuses on contamination especially nutrient subsidies kaushal et al 2011 2006 lagro et al 2017 although other work has attributed high baseflow during dry periods to septic leachate burns et al 2005 4 2 2 infrastructure mediated routes of groundwater discharge both sanitary and storm sewers could either exfiltrate or infiltrate groundwater depending on the hydraulic head differential between the pipes and groundwater table nguyen et al 2021 infiltration of groundwater into sewers fig 8 when the groundwater table is high could result in a decrease in the groundwater table in addition rainfall can leak through manhole casings and other defects i e inflow so infiltration of rain and groundwater into sewer systems are frequently lumped into infiltration and inflow for infiltration and inflow into sanitary sewers water is routed to wastewater treatment facilities while infiltration and inflow into storm sewers will discharge to waterways pangle et al 2022 found that infiltration and inflow into sanitary sewers could divert one quarter to one third of the total streamflow to wastewater facilities in atlanta ga other work estimates 30 85 of sanitary sewage flow is sourced from groundwater infiltration during dry weather through chemical isotopic and numerical modeling or high frequency monitoring at the wastewater facility bareš et al 2009 dirckx et al 2009 kracht et al 2007 zhang and parolari 2022 storm sewers may contain the remnants of buried streams further complicating hydrologic flowpaths but may also have cracks allowing for groundwater infiltration and direct discharge to streams elmore and kaushal 2008 janke et al 2014 rodriguez et al 2020 5 urban greenspaces and the role of vegetation in urban hydrology 5 1 hydrologic partitioning within urban greenspaces urban green spaces include large tracts of natural areas floodplains parks nature preserves smaller tracks yards natural areas in residential areas highly managed commercial districts abandoned lots and scms these spaces provide numerous ecosystem services to urban regions e g extensive natural urban parks increase biodiversity habitat connectivity and provide numerous socio economic benefits such as improved health for citizens nielsen et al 2014 shuster et al 2022 world health organization regional office for europe 2016 urban green spaces also play a vital role in mitigating the effects of urbanization on the hydrologic cycle consequently the management design and creation of urban green space is critical to urban planning seeking to build resilience to climate change in cities and balance potentially competing water demands the importance of vegetation in regulating the global terrestrial hydrological cycle is widely recognized with transpiration being the dominant green water flux to the atmosphere compared to evaporation from soils and canopy interception in most environments good et al 2015 jasechko et al 2013 furthermore vegetation in urban green spaces not only affects green water fluxes evaporation and transpiration but equally impacts ecohydrological partitioning of precipitation into blue water runoff generation and groundwater recharge expectedly the ecohydrological function of urban green spaces is different from more natural areas kuhlemann et al 2021 and process understanding from non urban study sites may not be transferable vico et al 2014 in general tree canopy cover in urban landscapes increases rainfall interception wang et al 2008 but can also dampen rainfall intensities which has implications for runoff generation processes species specific differences in interception rates and volumes baptista et al 2018 however highlight the spatial variability of the provisioning of these services across urban landscapes urban vegetation often differs in height e g due to pruning and microclimate e g due to shading from buildings therefore water requirements are heterogeneously distributed across these complex anthropogenically altered landscapes nouri et al 2013 the differences in water use between contrasting generic vegetation types have been quantified in several empirical studies kannenberg et al 2021 werner et al 2021 some modeling studies have investigated precipitation partitioning into interception soil evaporation and transpiration for different urban vegetation assemblages e g gillefalk et al 2021 through evapotranspiration urban green spaces provide cooling effects mitigating urban heat islands balany et al 2020 gunawardena et al 2017 pataki et al 2011 peters et al 2011 usually urban areas include a mix of native and non native species and plants have to adapt to harsh environments with limited water availability where surface sealing is extensive and where they are affected by modified radiation and thermal regimes from shading by tall buildings asawa et al 2017 further artificial irrigation impervious cover and the urban heat island effect can extend the length of the growing season zipper et al 2016 all these factors can increase urban plant water requirements thereby posing a risk for dry season water stress zipper et al 2017 5 2 feedbacks between vegetation infiltration and groundwater with climate change predictions showing that the southeastern united states central europe and many other regions will become drier the role of lawn golf course and park irrigation to sustain urban vegetation can be expected to expand in importance see section 6 3 nouri et al 2013 irrigation that is not partitioned to evapotranspiration will instead follow other flowpaths to streams and rivers recent work showed that in the semi arid intermountain west in the united states 63 93 of summer low flow in urban streams could be sourced from tap water and once leaking infrastructure see section 4 2 1 was accounted for 32 82 of the flow was coming from lawn irrigation fillo et al 2021 modeling techniques have quantified the contribution of irrigation as a subsidy to groundwater and thus baseflow discharge sanzana et al 2019 as have opportunities to monitor change in streamflow during periods where lawn irrigation is prohibited manago and hogue 2017 in addition there are important implications when considering the impact soil compaction has on the ability of lawns to infiltrate edmondson et al 2011 that require further study but are well described in agricultural areas alaoui et al 2018 despite these recent studies our understanding of vegetation effects on urban water flows is still very limited kuhlemann et al 2021 understanding of the natural processes contributing to urban water partitioning such as an improved quantification of evapotranspiration from different vegetation communities remains challenging pataki et al 2011 smith et al 2022 locations where vegetation is highly dependent on groundwater tables may be the most susceptible to changes in evapotranspiration because of groundwater table fluctuations barron et al 2014 when the rooting zone falls below the groundwater table or the capillary fringe plants have shown strong resilience to drought in urban areas as they can source groundwater resulting in over 40 more transpiration than in locations where roots cannot access groundwater marchionni et al 2020 urban water management needs to be adapted to meet the water demand of green spaces under projected climate change with increased temperatures and changing precipitation patterns zipper et al 2017 6 urban climate 6 1 urbanization impacts on local and regional climate in addition to altering hydrologic processes urbanization can result in significant changes to local and regional climate for an in depth synthesis of urban climate research we refer readers to other reviews e g arnfield 2003 masson et al 2020 oke et al 2017 qian et al 2022 here we focus on how urbanization affects the hydrologic aspects of climate the most significant urbanization induced changes to local climate can be traced to the replacement of vegetation with high albedo urban materials like pavement and concrete replacement of vegetation reduces evapotranspiration and therefore latent heat flux heat used to evaporate water and the addition of high albedo materials increases sensible heat flux heat that causes changes in temperature relative to undeveloped conditions fig 9 the enhanced warming in urban areas relative to surrounding undeveloped or rural areas is known as the urban heat island effect bowler et al 2010 manoli et al 2019 oke 1973 one of the most studied aspects of urban climate souch and grimmond 2006 recent research shows that urban heat is controlled by mean annual precipitation manoli et al 2019 background climate i e aridity and humidity ibsen et al 2021 and the relative effectiveness of heat convection across urban rural areas zhao et al 2014 urban heat island effects are most dramatic in humid cities zhao et al 2014 though effects may be partially mitigated by a corresponding increase in evapotranspiration demand zipper et al 2017 by contrast arid cities can have relatively uniform temperatures across the urban rural gradient and at times can even exhibit negative urban heat island effects i e urban temperatures are cooler than rural temperatures moffett et al 2019 zhao et al 2014 urbanization also modifies precipitation in urban areas typically increasing rainfall downwind of cities and or over the city center liu and niyogi 2019 fig 9 urban rainfall modification is moderated by many factors including the strength of urban heat island effects changes to aerodynamic roughness i e due to urban buildings changnon 1981 increased wind speeds balling and cerveny 1987 and the extent of aerosol and pollutant loading liu and niyogi 2019 shepherd 2005 spatial variations in heat produced by the urban heat island effect in which heat generation enhances turbulent transport of water vapor to the upper atmosphere can result in highly spatially heterogeneous precipitation patterns increased rainfall is apparent at the scale of individual storms as well as at climatological scales liu and niyogi 2019 with urbanization statistically associated with intensification of extreme rainfall events singh et al 2020 measurements collected every 2 3 km spatially and every 5 min temporally have been identified as the threshold for accurate precipitation measurements for urban research berne et al 2004 the few studies that have focused on winter hydrology indicate that urbanization leads to a shift away from frozen precipitation changnon 2003 johnson and shepherd 2018 and a reduction in snow depths johnson et al 2021 methods of snow redistribution unique to urban areas e g shoveling walkways plowing may further alter snowmelt patterns valeo and ho 2004 6 2 climate impacts on hydrological processes in all landscapes including urban areas climate is a primary control on precipitation and how precipitation is partitioned by hydrologic processes strong geographic variation in dominant precipitation mechanisms e g convectional orographic cyclonic causes regional differences in the magnitude and pattern of precipitation these storm characteristics are often captured by intensity duration frequency curves or design storm hyetographs that are widely used in urban settings for infrastructure design and planning watt and marsalek 2013 short high intensity storms are likely to produce infiltration excess overland flow across impervious surfaces or low permeability soils horton 1933 stewart et al 2019 while long duration low intensity storm events are more likely to produce saturation excess overland flow across permeable areas although we note that direct observations to support these mechanisms are lacking perhaps due to the general focus in urban areas on impervious surfaces the role of precipitation patterns on urban hydrologic processes is better studied than other aspects of climate like the ratio of potential evapotranspiration to precipitation however the ratio of potential evapotranspiration to precipitation referred to as the aridity index is known to be a primary driver of long term water balance partitioning in natural landscapes across a wide range of climates padrón et al 2017 where potential evapotranspiration dominates over precipitation arid climates soil moisture tends to be consistently low and where precipitation dominates over potential evapotranspiration humid climates soil moisture tends to be consistently high grayson et al 1997 anthropogenic water inputs such as irrigation leaking pipes that contribute to soil moisture in urban areas would likely alter this relationship still low potential evapotranspiration relative to water inputs in humid cities implies that humid cities may be more susceptible to saturation excess overland flow events in which pervious areas are sources of runoff at the same time flashy flows driven by infiltration excess overland flow in arid cities may not be that different from flows in undeveloped arid locations where very dry soils with low hydraulic conductivity also generate infiltration excess overland flow the aridity index and related frameworks e g budyko 1974 porporato et al 2004 may also help explain the impacts of urban infrastructure on aspects of urban hydrology beyond runoff water that is infiltrated due to urban infrastructure e g via infiltration based scm leaking sewer pipes irrigation is likely to be captured for evapotranspiration in arid cities where soils are drier and vegetation is more water stressed but likely to become deep drainage and contribute to groundwater recharge in humid cities where soils are wetter and evapotranspiration is more limited by energy availability voter and loheide 2021 for similar reasons introducing green spaces to urban areas without irrigation or other water inputs e g depaving impervious surfaces adding green roofs is more likely to result in high evapotranspiration and cooling potential in humid cities but high water retention in arid cities cuthbert et al 2022 6 3 impacts of climate change on urban hydrology climate change is increasing extreme weather events particularly hot temperatures heavy rainfall and increasing risk of drought ipcc 2022 the long term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns associated with global climate change can alter the intensity and spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration leading to dynamic shifts in water and energy balances accounting for these changing conditions is a major challenge in urban hydrology a field that has long depended on the assumption of stationarity milly et al 2008 to understand how urban areas may respond to climate change updated projections of rainfall temperature and other meteorological parameters can be developed by dynamically or statistically downscaling global climate models to regional scales relevant for urban hydrology moore et al 2016 these predictions are commonly accomplished using ensembles of multiple models to account for uncertainty giorgi 2019 though considerable uncertainty also exists from extrapolating trends observed over only a few decades to the future onof and arnbjerg nielsen 2009 in some cases robust projections of current and future conditions may exist locally but centrally available statistics are more often out of date and do not consistently characterize uncertainty wright et al 2021 globally urban areas are projected to experience a 250 increase in exposure to drought and flood hazards in the near future güneralp et al 2015 the frequency and intensity of urban drought is increasing due to changes in precipitation mismanagement of water sources growing demand and pollution of water sources zhang et al 2019 one of the most visible examples of drought impacts on water supply occurred in cape town south africa which approached day zero of running out of potable water in 2018 pascale et al 2020 many cities address this risk with inter basin transfers of water which would decrease risk by tapping larger areas of water sources padowski and jawitz 2012 but it is unclear if this will be sufficient with the intensification of megadroughts williams et al 2022 drought decreases soil moisture ault 2020 redmond 2002 and can also shift the type of vegetation in cities miller et al 2022 this could in turn shift the partitioning of precipitation between evapotranspiration and runoff macedo et al 2022 saft et al 2015 increased precipitation intensity will increase pluvial flooding risk in cities güneralp et al 2015 tellman et al 2021 wing et al 2022 not considering such projected changes in precipitation regime will have serious consequences for urban hydrologic infrastructure much of which has been designed using rainfall statistics i e intensity duration frequency curves that are now decades out of date kourtis and tsihrintzis 2021 waters et al 2003 wright et al 2019 many studies on climate change impacts have focused on the response of scm to changes in storm event characteristics i e storm intensity storm duration storm frequency waters et al 2003 zahmatkesh et al 2015a antecedent soil moisture and uncertainty moore et al 2016 predicting the impacts that climate change will have on urban areas and associated hydrologic processes including scm performance flooding and other aspects of urban hydrology requires both accurate projections of climate change impacts at urban scales and robust hydrologic models capable of simulating complex urban dynamics unfortunately such modeling studies cannot be performed in regional climate models directly because they are run at relatively coarse 1 km2 resolutions and the associated land surface models do not resolve smaller scale urban hydrologic processes as a result evaluating the impact of climate change on urban hydrology requires forcing existing urban hydrologic models with a range of synthetic meteorological time series such synthetic time series scenarios may be generated from global climate models delta change factors zahmatkesh et al 2015b rainfall multipliers panos et al 2021 rossman 2014 or changes to regional intensity duration frequency curves guo 2006 mirhosseini et al 2013 7 challenges and opportunities in urban hydrology research 7 1 characterizing and considering the physiography of and water related infrastructure in urban watersheds above all a firm understanding of the characteristics of a given urban landscape is needed for urban hydrology research including meteorology climate and weather subsurface properties soils geology land surface properties land cover vegetation and built infrastructure so much of the work within urban hydrology has focused on quantifying isc that we often overlook the importance of characterizing the factors listed above that are drivers of hydrologic functioning most cities invest in meteorological infrastructure for the purposes of managing weather extremes so data on long term climatic trends and event dynamics are easily accessible several urban streamflow generation studies have highlighted the importance of rainfall duration and intensity along with directly connected impervious area or effective impervious area on dominant flow pathways e g jefferson et al 2015 pellerin et al 2008 and dominant runoff generation processes e g miles and band 2015 stewart et al 2019 providing a strong rationale for mining meteorological datasets more deeply this consideration of storm event types to improve our understanding of runoff generation is especially needed given predictions of major shifts in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events although there has been good progress when it comes to documenting the spatial variability in soils in u s cities more work is needed to extend field measurements of hydraulic conductivity depth to confining layer soil structure and slope to unravel the mechanisms that generate urban soil patterns shuster et al 2021 this data collection effort presents an opportunity to draw from the strength of the urban hydrology soil science and urban ecology communities to amalgamate existing datasets across cities see section 7 5 for further discussion of the need for collaboration and coordination given the wealth of observational data that exists in many cities further exploration of underutilized datasets could support inference of soil properties including soil boring data from utility work likewise municipal documentation on the density and types of vegetation as well as maintenance practices e g irrigation of street trees could be helpful for scaling up plot scale measurements of the ecohydrologic functioning of urban greenspaces larger scale efforts to map vegetation could also be integrated into urban hydrology studies for example the machine learning derived auto arborist dataset from google which includes public tree censuses from 23 cities in the united states and canada https google github io auto arborist beyond the physiographic aspects of the urban landscape more detailed characterization and inclusion of the built form of urban areas including water related infrastructure are critical for most urban hydrology studies the availability of geospatial data on water body characteristics e g channel morphologies water depth water distribution systems sanitary collection systems storm sewer networks and stormwater control assets varies across municipalities this challenge of access is explored more fully in section 7 2 below more reliable water distribution data especially those related to loss estimates and exfiltration are useful for closing urban water budgets bhaskar and welty 2012 likewise sanitary combined collection system data including flow data are useful for understanding infiltration and inflow impacts on groundwater levels and baseflow pangle et al 2022 storm sewer network data can be important for correcting total impervious area estimates and estimating directly connected impervious area at small spatial scales roy and shuster 2009 and scm asset data can support inter catchment comparison of hydrologic response especially where large gradients in the level of treatment exist choat et al 2022 morales and oswald 2020 continued development of watershed scale methods to estimate directly connected impervious area will improve the accuracy and consistency of urbanization metrics this will likely require the use of high resolution imagery and digital elevation data e g from lidar coupled with the water infrastructure data discussed above to determine fine scale drainage patterns water infrastructure data can be combined with key physiographic variables and land cover or isc data to develop composition and structure based typologies of urban and urbanizing landscapes such typologies have been shown to explain the majority of variation in select stream water quality parameters blaszczak et al 2019 delesantro et al 2021 but have yet to be tested on metrics of the streamflow regime e g hydrologic signatures mcmillan 2020 or water age in urban areas these types of integrated classification systems may be particularly useful for inter city urban hydrology comparison studies where the many dimensions of urban landscape characterization need to be simplified 7 2 facilitating data collection and logistics for urban hydrological research as compared to less disturbed and less trafficked watersheds urban areas pose unique challenges for collecting hydrologic data specifically issues surrounding access experimental control and vandalism in less disturbed settings where there may be a single landowner controlling a large area of interest researchers with permission can install myriad sensors that go undisturbed collect samples from almost any location and prioritize sensor and instrument placement based on their research question often with few challenges associated with access permitting or need for owner approval this is exemplified in the united states through research that can happen on federally controlled lands which can cover thousands of square kilometers through federal programs such as long term ecological research stations lter network 2022 critical zone networks cuahsi 2022 and watershed science focus areas u s department of energy 2022 there has been a long investment in understanding a range of hydrologic processes in mostly non urban systems in contrast researchers studying urban systems often face extensive efforts to gain permits approvals and permissions for data collection from a wide range of stakeholders and landowners in addition it may be more difficult to find urban watersheds that can be treated experimentally where certain variables can be controlled for a set of experiments e g there is probably no urban watershed where you could remove all the vegetation to measure the resulting streamflow response as was done at hubbard brook likens et al 1970 at the plot scale precipitation experiments and soil measurements have shown variability in infiltration in soils pope et al 2023 schifman and shuster 2019 but less work has been done to manipulate water flow paths at the watershed scale without such experiments it is distinctly difficult in urban systems to shift from measuring correlations to observing causation once equipment is installed there is a risk that equipment may be vandalized or stolen ryan et al 2011 especially for items the public can visibly identify such as solar panels or copper wire for these reasons identifying sites where data can be collected to answer a research question is especially challenging and sites are frequently chosen opportunistically for their safety or access not because they are the best places to answer a given research question this leads to an ongoing challenge how can we best collect data in urban areas the silver lining of urban hydrology research is that urban areas likely have data being collected by diverse stakeholders relative to many non urban systems table 1 accessing such datasets often requires first building a relationship with the data holders to both understand what the datasets are and understand how to access them for example in the united states many municipalities will only share data with an open records request which must be detailed and explicit urban watersheds also do not follow political boundaries while datasets frequently do this means that for getting both site and data access researchers must contact and negotiate with multiple municipalities ariano and oswald 2022a dickson et al 2020 even within a single municipality researchers may need to consult multiple departments or agencies for example one level of government e g city may be responsible for the streambed while another level e g county may be responsible for managing the riparian zone when datasets are obtained from stakeholders the methodologies used to collect data may be unclear e g calculated leakage rates from drinking water pipes agencies may have limited time periods for which they have to retain monitoring records or monitoring records may only recently have been started so evaluating change over time in urban areas can be extremely difficult there are datasets urban hydrologists need access to that may not exist without archival searches or municipalities or other data holders may simply be unwilling to share older urban areas may not have accurate maps of underground pipe locations maps may have been lost and or those maps may not be digitized researchers are sometimes informed that datasets cannot be shared under concern for security and or liability or that collecting and sharing the data requires staff time and researchers will be charged for such efforts making data cost prohibitive how do we improve this situation first continued relationship building with data holding stakeholders is crucial for advancing our understanding of how infrastructure shapes hydrological processes in this way scientists are emissaries to such entities and can explain open data requirements for journal publications which may help increase accessibility to data sources through time there is growing research into the use of machine learning techniques to build synthetic infrastructure datasets by using areas where enough data are available to predict wider coverage ahmad et al 2022 chegini and li 2022 jian et al 2021 there may also be opportunities for communities to collect datasets nardi et al 2022 although work must be done to make sure such practices are equitable and not extractive harris et al 2021 examples of citizen or community science hydrology initiatives already exist kampf et al 2018 lowry and fienen 2013 however the duration of these datasets are relatively short seibert et al 2022 the development and funding of citizen science groups that use standardized collection protocols develop open source data and improve upon technological innovations from the past decade e g data sharing applications could help to expand the spatial and temporal coverage of urban hydrological datasets outreach and education initiatives that communicate research findings will be useful for building the public s awareness of and interest in urban hydrological issues this may have the added benefit of increasing pressure on data holding stakeholders to be more transparent and collaborative we should also recognize that we may bias our research towards areas where data are more easily accessible either in terms of cities or even where we do research within cities for example academic research within a city may be biased to locations that are seen as being safer in order to lower the risk of theft or vandalism resulting in limited or no data from large areas of cities overall the centralization of a database that contains urban hydrologic datasets would be transformational both in setting metadata standards that could be applied across all urban systems and in allowing for cross city coordination see section 7 5 7 3 characterizing dominant hydrological processes in urban landscapes previous studies have demonstrated clear differences in the dominant hydrological processes that occur in urban areas compared to rural and or pristine areas as integrators of these processes urban streams are typically flashier than their unpaved counterparts however as mentioned above previous regional scale studies examining the role of isc on hydrologic response have suggested that underlying physiographic factors still play an important role in streamflow generation e g ariano and oswald 2022a hopkins et al 2015b it would be beneficial to expand on these studies by compiling streamflow data from urban watersheds that span climatic geologic and topographic gradients to further examine the relationships between physiographic characteristics isc and hydrologic signatures described in mcmillan 2020 in this way one could increase the statistical power of our analyses of patterns and behavior in urban hydrologic processes such investigations would allow researchers to challenge the still prevailing hypothesis that because urbanization leads to a homogenous looking landscape it should also lead to a convergence of hydrologic functioning more widespread application of the celerity the speed with which a perturbation to flow propagates through the flow domain e g hydrologic response versus velocity the mass flux of water concept mcdonnell and beven 2014 to urban watersheds would help test whether the assumption that new water running off impervious surfaces as infiltration excess overland flow is the dominant source of water generating urban stormflow integrating observations of conservative tracers into urban hydrological studies e g bonneau et al 2018a and employing tools such as isotope hydrograph separation e g ariano and oswald 2022b jefferson et al 2015 soulsby et al 2015 isotope based young water fraction marx et al 2022 and transit time analysis e g morales and oswald 2020 parajulee et al 2019 could offer important insights into bulk hydrologic transport the distribution of water ages and stormflow generation in urban watersheds all of which have important implications for understanding extreme events response times and water quality hrachowitz et al 2016 quantifying the role of urban pervious areas e g lawns parks ravines sports fields golf courses brownfields riparian areas in shaping runoff and streamflow generation remains an important and evolving area of exploration examples of important research questions include do all new water inputs infiltrate into pervious areas or does soil compaction lead to infiltration excess overland flow where and when does saturation excess overland flow occur what is the fate of infiltrated water in pervious areas how is urban vegetation affecting these processes where and how long is water stored in urban watersheds answering these questions requires a deep understanding of soil and vegetation characteristics as well as information on infrastructure that might underlie these spaces hence city wide assessments of the spatial variability of urban soil and vegetation characteristics are needed that make use of existing classification schemes e g rossiter 2007 for urban soils and itree nowak 2020 for urban vegetation such maps can be used as an initial assessment of the transferability of process based studies on soil hydrologic characteristics e g shuster et al 2021 infiltration e g kelleher et al 2020 and partitioning of rainfall and snowmelt into blue and green water fluxes by vegetation e g gillefalk et al 2022 kuhlemann et al 2021 but also to inform where reproducing these types of studies would advance our understanding of urban pervious area hydrology more broadly e g arid versus humid climates with different soil types and vegetation assemblages expansion of process based pervious area studies will require significant investment of time and resources in field based monitoring burt and mcdonnell 2015 direct observations of scm impact on groundwater recharge need to be documented as well as more work to scale up impacts from individual scm to scm effects at the watershed scale work is especially needed like that of thompson et al 2021 that considers the interactions between traditional gray infrastructure in this case sewer lines and groundwater dynamics that are driven by green stormwater infrastructure further efforts to upscale plot scale understanding of vegetation water interlinkages towards larger watershed or city scales smith et al 2022 would be beneficial at a basic level our ability to characterize process dominance within and across urban watersheds suffers from our inability to constrain the urban water budget solving the water balance in urban areas involves the typical challenges faced in rural and pristine catchments including potential biases in precipitation data accurately measuring evapotranspiration dealing with a paucity of subsurface measurements and spatially variable topography vegetation and subsurface characteristics kampf et al 2020 however as outlined in this review urbanization adds additional complexity in the form of inter basin transfers combined sewer overflows and sanitary sewer overflows groundwater infiltration and loss into sanitary sewers groundwater recharge from septic leachate and or leaking potable water distribution pipes and or irrigation and alteration of flow pathways due to the urban karst effect bonneau et al 2017 potentially limiting the representativeness of subsurface measurements the data required to tackle the urban water balance are highly complex and site specific including both primary and secondary data collection from a variety of sources see section 7 1 and 7 2 as previously mentioned conservative tracers such as stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in water or artificial tracers e g rhodamine fluoresceine could have huge potential for elucidating the hidden sources stores and pathways that water takes through urban areas see ehleringer et al 2016 fillo et al 2021 expanded monitoring networks are needed including nested sites that align with transitions in land use land cover or age of development which could help to refine estimates of individual water balance components for the entire watershed any growth spatial temporal new measurements in monitoring programs will require larger funding commitments but the benefits in terms of the usefulness of the data should outweigh additional costs 7 4 frameworks and approaches for modeling urban systems while extensive hydrological modeling efforts exist in urban areas modeling remains a key challenge for improving our hydrological understanding of how water moves through these unique and heterogeneous areas hydrological modeling in urban areas faces several issues with possibly the following being the most important ones 1 lack of data for constraining and parameterizing models see section 7 1 7 2 2 limited ability to represent key hydrological processes outside of runoff generation from isc and flow through engineered drainage systems see section 7 3 and 3 limited understanding of how processes vary spatially and temporally in urban environments which is key to upscaling efforts see section 7 3 as dictated by model selection modeling analyses often require extensive data as input to mathematically represent key properties of urban form especially given that some properties of urban areas are more heterogeneous than less impacted catchments cadenasso et al 2007 liu and niyogi 2019 steele and wolz 2019 however data availability to constrain model parameters and other inputs is often lacking especially spatially variable inputs for distributed models commonly applied to urban environments both lumped and distributed models require a strong understanding of the numerical constraints on water body characteristics e g channel morphology soil and vegetation properties land use and surface and subsurface infrastructure the lack of such data often means modelers must make many assumptions utilize imperfect datasets and generalize from existing observations in other cities that may or may not be a good proxy for the system to be simulated in some cases models may not fully incorporate all aspects of urban form such as the impact of building shading when simulating urban energy fluxes or connected versus disconnected impervious flow paths at the watershed level modeling is also challenged by our inability to constrain the extent of an urban watershed with a lack of consensus within the urban hydrology community regarding how such areas should be delineated e g based on topographic boundaries incorporating sewer drainages validating model simulations is equally challenging given the lack of observations of different hydrological processes especially soil moisture groundwater table depth and evapotranspiration within urban areas gillefalk et al 2022 while observations of streamflow may exist these are often only useful for simulating streamflow responses at the watershed scale rather than capturing varying hydrological processes notably in the absence of other observations for comparison and given the nonuniqueness of solution e g equifinality inherent to hydrological model applications there is great potential for wide uncertainty bounds when simulating other fluxes if calibration and validation for an urban application are based on streamflow alone beven 2006 because numerical models are mathematical representations of how we conceptualize water flow in a given environment they simplify our understanding of key water sources stores and pathways in urban hydrologic systems given the historical focus in urban hydrology on isc and engineered drainage systems most urban hydrologic models e g the u s environmental protection agency s stormwater management model rossman 2014 specialize in robustly representing rainfall runoff dynamics of isc and the hydraulics of engineered drainage systems and scm fletcher et al 2013 however some commonly used and open source models oversimplify groundwater flow evapotranspiration and other ecohydrologic processes this is problematic for representing hydrologic processes within urban areas but also in non urban areas e g agricultural natural forested elsewhere in the drainage system particularly if these non urban areas are upgradient of the urban area as is especially common in coastal systems at the same time state of the art models for simulating ecohydrologic processes in natural and agricultural areas are challenged in representing isc and engineered drainage networks without customization e g bhaskar et al 2015 lim and welty 2017 voter and loheide ii 2018 zhang and chui 2020 as our perceptual understanding of key pathways in urban areas fig 1 expands to include saturation excess overland flow lim and lu 2016 miles and band 2015 stewart et al 2019 below ground partitioning of infiltration cuthbert et al 2022 voter and loheide 2021 leakage from drinking water and sewer pipes pangle et al 2022 zhang and parolari 2022 and other previously minimized processes so too must our perceptual models of urban hydrology our understanding of these pathways and their relative importance is still nascent though it is improving through time thus maintaining flexibility in model frameworks will be necessary to ensure that our ability to simulate urban areas keeps pace with our understanding of how these systems truly work we therefore encourage the urban hydrology community to consider the ways in which open source hydrological models could be improved in the context of simulating urban landscapes improving our approaches to hydrologic modeling in urban areas goes hand in hand with resolving the challenges outlined in sections 7 1 7 2 and 7 3 we need more observations and process level understanding to guide our modeling efforts and model framework improvements this will then allow us to use the models as learning frameworks to guide improved future monitoring in the absence of certain types of data one approach may be to combine existing observations from large datasets with machine learning to generate richer datasets for model input or validation e g bergeson et al 2022 given the uncertainty inherent to model applications in urban environments any modeling exercises should explicitly incorporate and estimate the impact of parameter uncertainty on model predictions via uncertainty and sensitivity analysis e g schifman et al 2018 in this vein an open question is whether our uncertainty in some input datasets ultimately matters to a prediction of interest therefore modeling analyses to ascertain how data availability impacts model predictions e g shrestha et al 2022 will be crucial to advancing understanding though modeling of urban areas is especially challenging there are many creative ways modelers have leveraged community science observations kelleher and mcphillips 2020 built strong partnerships with municipal organizations mcgrath et al 2019 acquired novel field observations and integrated them into tracer aided models e g isotopes gillefalk et al 2021 stevenson et al 2022 or generated synthetic models sytsma et al 2022 voter and loheide ii 2018 that continue to move our understanding of urban hydrology forward these examples highlight that there are many approaches and huge future potential for innovating within the hydrological modeling space 7 5 the need for inter site and inter city synthesis studies most of the urban hydrology research especially field based research is specific to single metropolitan areas limiting our ability to identify critical processes that are consistent across cities from those that may be more site specific inter site and inter city comparisons are crucial to contextualize and extrapolate our understanding and to overcome the uniqueness of place beven 2020 2000 cross city work that has been done has identified the importance of timing of urbanization on stream response due to the kind of stormwater infrastructure that was installed hopkins et al 2015a mcphillips and matsler 2018 the importance of physiographic and land cover characteristics on streamflow response ariano and oswald 2022a debbage and shepherd 2018 hopkins et al 2015b ledford et al 2020 and variability in response to urbanization between high and low flows bhaskar et al 2020 previous federal investment in the united states typically focused on single metropolitan areas e g baltimore ecosystem study pickett et al 2008 and central arizona phoenix cap lter 2022 long term ecological research sites although some newly funded projects aim to work across cities e g the urban critical zone cluster urban critical zone cluster 2022 as far as we are aware the few cross city comparisons that have been made have focused on single continents urban hydrologists frequently research where they live so building these cross city comparisons will require building large collaborations across metropolitan areas and urban hydrologists would benefit from applying to funding opportunities for such collaborations such integrated knowledge processing will also only work with widely and freely shared datasets even those that require large resource investment to acquire or make see section 7 3 standardized data collection methods development of standard metrics and clear sharing of metadata so that comparison is possible an equally pressing need is for the development of coordinated in terms of timing across sites and harmonized in terms of parameters measured and methods used at each site long term datasets to tease apart processes driven by climate from land use change from other long term dynamics while these data exist for streamflow in certain places e g bhaskar et al 2020 ficklin et al 2018 more information on other hydrologic fluxes such as evapotranspiration and infiltration specific to urban environments is needed ad hoc projects that monitor one location for a year or two are often the norm in urban areas and may add limited understanding to a broader scale site intercomparison initiative especially in the face of extensive inter and intra annual variability though long term observations are desired sustainability of long term monitoring is always challenging and requires sustained funding support tetzlaff et al 2017 this means urban hydrologists must continuously emphasize the importance of monitoring programs that are run by local state provincial or federal stakeholders and aggressively seek funding for international collaborations 8 conclusions the existing body of urban hydrology literature lays bare the complexities of water flow through cities and developed areas drainage area delineation transport along infrastructure mediated flow pathways stormwater management practices inter basin transfers interactions between stormwater and wastewater hydrologic functioning of pervious areas and the impacts of urbanization on hydroclimatic processes are just a few of the unique features of urban areas to consider when studying the sources stores and pathways of water given this complexity it is not surprising that urban hydrologic response is not uniform across catchments despite conventional assumptions to the contrary this complexity also befuddles our attempts to solve the urban water balance and develop representative models this review has led the authors to conclude that we need to move beyond thinking that isc is the only driver of urban hydrologic response and focus our efforts on developing an integrated understanding of water sources stores and pathways in urban areas better characterization and integration of physiographic variables and water related infrastructure into urban hydrology studies is critical to achieve this goal research should also carefully consider the role of pervious areas and the mosaic of soils managed vegetation and scm in storing and routing water through urban landscapes tracer applications will be particularly helpful in this regard and for attempts to solve the urban water balance above all inter site inter city comparisons are needed to overcome the lack of representativeness of individual cities and test the transferability of perceptual models of the key hydrological processes in urban areas this will only be possible by embracing the full community of researchers practitioners and stakeholders working within cities including those who may not label themselves as hydrologists geographers engineers ecologists urban planners community members local and state level stakeholders these types of expertise are all needed to fully quantify critical urban hydrologic processes and to leverage this knowledge in beneficial ways that will improve the urban community urban hydrology cannot be done alone we need to work with everyone invested in the watershed to truly understand how these systems

2202,though urban areas represent a small fraction of global land cover they have an outsized impact on hydrological processes within these areas the pathways that water follows are fundamentally transformed by the disturbance of soils land cover vegetation topography and built infrastructure while progress has been made across many cities to quantify interactions between hydrological processes and the urban environment many fundamental questions remain unanswered in this article we review the state of urban hydrologic science with an eye towards identifying gaps in our understanding of how water flows through built landscapes our review focuses on key topics within urban hydrology related to water quantity including runoff and streamflow generation soils and soil water groundwater vegetation and climate we also describe some of the challenges and opportunities within the field of urban hydrology that we envision will drive future work and collaboration keywords urban water management impervious surface cover stormwater climate infrastructure data availability data will be made available on request 1 urban land cover growth and changes in hydrology urban areas account for only 0 5 of the planet s land area angel et al 2011 yet are home to over half the world s population united nations 2017 these areas are defined by extensive built structures impervious surfaces and relatively large populations and consequently have a significant impact on global water resources flörke et al 2018 mcdonald et al 2014 seto et al 2012 along with well established urban areas many areas of the planet are experiencing an expansion of built up land uses e g residential commercial and industrial areas approximately one third of all rivers and streams on the planet are estimated to pass through agricultural industrial or urban infrastructure albert et al 2021 dramatically altering natural hydrologic processes past and future growth in urban land cover includes the construction of new roads and buildings as well as water and sanitation infrastructure all of which directly and indirectly alter the water cycle while work towards understanding the impacts of urban areas on the water cycle has been ongoing for over 50 years e g leopold 1968 it has primarily focused on the impacts of impervious surfaces on hydrological processes physical aspects of urbanization can lead to a reorganization of surface and subsurface flow pathways due to an increase in impervious surface cover isc and compacted soils subsurface drainage networks artificial usually straight surface drainage and vegetation removal these factors have important implications for the partitioning of precipitation fig 1 precipitation when it reaches the urban land surface will either initially be captured via interception on plants or other surfaces evaporate infiltrate or runoff as overland flow infiltration excess overland flow occurs when the rate of water input on the land surface exceeds the infiltration rate of the surface is one source of runoff that is commonly generated from buildings roads parking lots and other impervious surfaces and moves rapidly to the stream network either directly or via storm sewers when infiltration excess overland flow encounters stormwater control measures scm the timing and magnitude of water movement may be modified depending on the effectiveness of the scm saturation excess overland flow occurs when water inputs at the land surface cannot infiltrate due to saturated conditions has also been proposed as an important flow pathway for rapid water transport to urban streams stewart et al 2019 although it is rarely reported in field studies water that does infiltrate pervious surfaces and percolate to groundwater may still interact with urban infrastructure e g subsurface utility lines water supply sanitary storm pipes via preferential flow processes resulting in relatively fast movement of water to streams hibbs et al 2012 kaushal and belt 2012 subsurface water moving along slow pathways to the stream may contribute to streamflow depending on the extent of stream channel hardening which limits groundwater gains or losses to streams ledford and lautz 2015 responses along these pathways can be modified by climate over long time scales and perturbations during extreme conditions e g droughts and floods over short time scales an additional complexity in the urban water cycle is that water may be imported or exported across watershed topographic boundaries via water infrastructure and human withdrawal for public water supply through interbasin transfers water may be imported via pumping from deep groundwater that is otherwise disconnected from surface water or via piping from adjacent watersheds this imported water is redistributed in cities through pipe networks that often leak supplying subsurface flow in urban watersheds price 2011 during wet weather water may also be imported or exported through combined sewer pipes hopkins et al 2014 urban hydrology reviews from the past 12 years e g bonneau et al 2017 gessner et al 2014 hibbs et al 2012 mcgrane 2016 o driscoll et al 2010 have focused on characterization of urban areas and their impacts on the water cycle e g rainfall patterns rainfall runoff relationships hydrological losses and surface and subsurface flow dynamics water quality e g temperature suspended sediments contaminants of emerging concern and associated ecological implications e g nutrient cycling primary production abundance and diversity of aquatic organisms the impacts of urban water management in particular scm on the water cycle have also been described in past reviews ahiablame et al 2012 askarizadeh et al 2015 bell et al 2020 while there are similarities across these urban hydrology reviews there are also distinct differences some work focuses on specific geographic areas o driscoll et al 2010 while others focus on specific water flow paths bonneau et al 2017 hibbs et al 2012 mcgrane 2016 summarized the classic challenges in the field of urban hydrology which include scaling process understanding from the plot to catchment estimating and measuring key processes e g precipitation infiltration evapotranspiration and their spatial variability quantifying hydrological interactions between engineered and natural components of the urban water cycle including the role of pervious areas assessing the benefits of scm across scales and predicting the effects of climate change on urban hydrology today we still lack an understanding of the scales of heterogeneous processes in urban systems and what spatial and temporal scales are the most important to address different hydrologic questions the slow progress on answering these fundamental questions over the past 50 years since leopold 1968 leads us to write this review we focus on revisiting long standing urban hydrology questions and progress that has been made on answering them since the last relevant reviews we also identify current challenges in the field of urban hydrology and opportunities for moving past them in particular we highlight the need to fully characterize physiography and dominant hydrologic processes in urban catchments the data collection and logistics needed for this next steps in modeling urban systems and an overall need for more cross city comparisons our perspective is mainly derived from north america with some examples from europe we focus exclusively on the physical movement of water and do not address water quality issues in urban areas furthermore this review does not heavily integrate literature covering the hydraulic performance upscaling approaches or strategies for implementing green infrastructure and scm see baker et al 2022 golden and hoghooghi 2018 li et al 2019 for recent reviews we are not debating the definition of urban as we recognize that the term can mean different things to different readers nor are we focusing on socio hydrology or environmental justice issues around urban hydrology while noting that all are important topics we have structured the review to work through different compartments of the urban critical zone beginning with a review of urban runoff and streamflow generation and how infrastructure drives these processes section 2 individual sections follow on urban soils and soil water section 3 urban groundwater section 4 and urban greenspaces and the role of vegetation on urban hydrological processes section 5 we then summarize climatic processes that are impacted by urbanization and the importance of understanding future climate change section 6 we conclude our review with a discussion of remaining and new challenges in the field of urban hydrology and opportunities for addressing outstanding research questions section 7 2 urban runoff and streamflow generation 2 1 the shape of urban hydrographs urban watersheds are typically characterized by flashy hydrographs exhibiting a rapid rise in streamflow high peak flows and then a rapid recession of streamflow gurnell et al 2007 though we note that in highly arid places impervious watersheds can be less flashy than watersheds with low imperviousness mcphillips et al 2019 the dominant perceptual model seibert and mcdonnell 2002 of urban streamflow generation attributes this flashiness to rapid transport of rainfall and meltwater from impervious surfaces on the landscape via infiltration excess overland flow and pipe networks fig 1 leopold 1968 because urban areas are composed of impervious surfaces and many urban soils are compacted much of urban runoff is produced via infiltration excess overland flow however depending on precipitation event characteristics soil moisture and drainage patterns permeable surfaces in urban settings can become saturated and produce saturation excess overland flow miles and band 2015 valeo and moin 2001 creating dynamic conditions wherein the permeable surfaces may switch from a sink to a source of stormwater runoff despite the assumed paradigm of infiltration excess overland flow dominating urban stream response the shapes of urban hydrographs are variable fig 2 and the controls on watershed flashiness vary regionally with climate physical landscape characteristics and human impacts driving a substantial portion of the variability ariano and oswald 2022a gannon et al 2022 this variability in hydrograph response representing an integrated signal of all upstream and upslope processes shows that a diversity of flow paths drives urban response not just infiltration excess overland flow and isc one common approach for comparing the impacts of urbanization on streamflow time series is via the use of hydrologic signatures streamflow metrics that describe the properties of hydrologic time series datasets hydrologic signatures allow for the characterization of the flow regime to understand the degree of hydrologic alteration environmental flows and watershed processes mcmillan 2020 typical hydrologic signatures include metrics that describe behavior at low flow such as the baseflow index that characterize the magnitude and rate of change such as flashiness and that characterize high flows such as peak flow in watersheds with limited human influence analysis of hydrologic signatures typically links streamflow generation with a combination of climatic aridity and precipitation amount and physiographic drivers slope soils and vegetation wu et al 2021 in contrast hydrologic signatures in urban watersheds reveal a strong imprint of urbanization that varies across different climate regions tetzlaff et al 2005 generally urbanization produces variable patterns in low flow ledford et al 2020 variable flashiness ariano and oswald 2022a and increases in high flows hopkins et al 2015a hopkins et al 2015b with the largest differences in high flows observed in semi arid and arid regions bhaskar et al 2020 however as hypothesized by utz et al 2016 certain physiographic characteristics e g stormwater management soils and geology topography may buffer or offer some resistance to hydrological as well as ecological changes common in urban watersheds though the relative importance of these features to explaining hydrologic signatures remains variable and poorly understood streamflow responses to urbanization also vary spatially within a single watershed as well as through time bhaskar et al 2020 for example hydrograph characteristics such as flashiness can vary along a given stream as drainage area increases fig 3 this is illustrated for rocky branch a tributary to walnut creek in raleigh nc purported to be the flashiest u s geological survey usgs streamgage in the contiguous united states smith and smith 2015 for this system the peak dampens and the length of the rising limb and total duration lengthens moving downstream of rocky branch through the mainstem of walnut creek fig 3 the distribution and connectivity of isc infrastructure such as large reservoirs floodplain and wetland storage and the topology of the stream network all interact to shape how the flood peak moves through the larger walnut creek watershed 2 2 infrastructure based drivers of urban streamflow generation 2 2 1 impervious surface cover hydrograph flashiness of urban watersheds though influenced by watershed characteristics such as slope and surface roughness is primarily attributed to high levels of impervious surfaces and high densities of stormwater pipes that quickly route runoff to streams and rivers hopkins et al 2015a shuster et al 2005 fig 1 because isc can be tracked managed and forecasted schueler et al 2009 it has been used for decades to predict a range of urban impacts including hydrologic response habitat degradation and water quality impairment arnold and gibbons 1996 however increasing isc does not always provide adequate quantitative prediction of urban impacts ariano and oswald 2022a booth and jackson 1997 schueler et al 2009 due to differences in how impervious cover is estimated it is possible threshold relationships occur with hydrological and ecological variables jacobson 2011 for example impervious surfaces that are directly connected to the stream network such as transportation land cover that is often piped directly to receiving waters may have larger impacts on hydrologic response than overall isc hopkins et al 2015a mejía and moglen 2010 shuster et al 2007 consequently impervious surfaces are sometimes subset into those that are not directly connected to the stream and those that are directly connected e g roy and shuster 2009 or effectively connected e g ebrahimian et al 2016 effective and directly connected impervious areas differ in their methodological approaches with the former being statistically computed from rainfall runoff data and the latter typically being estimated using geospatial analysis of infrastructure and or land use land cover data and ground truthed at small spatial scales roy and shuster 2009 recent analysis of flashiness metrics across urbanization gradients shows the importance of underlying physiographic characteristics in driving streamflow response ariano and oswald 2022a a wide range of factors can influence hydrologic connectivity in urban watersheds and whether non directly connected impervious areas contribute significantly to runoff response this complexity limits our ability to quantify the portion of isc from which there is rapid mobilization of event water to the stream similar to the concept of hydrologic connectivity in less impacted watersheds although rainfall runoff observations have been used to estimate effective impervious area ebrahimian et al 2016 there are confounding factors large events can enhance apparent isc relationships delesantro et al 2021 and rainfall intensity and duration influence infiltration patterns sytsma et al 2020 another scale effect is watershed size fig 3 with greater isc impacts observed for small watersheds roodsari and chandler 2017 steeper slopes can enhance isc runoff hopkins et al 2015b kelleher and mcphillips 2020 estimating connectivity is also confounded by subsurface drainage networks which are often unmapped walsh et al 2022 for this reason caution should be used when estimating connected isc from remotely sensed data at large spatial scales as these additional influences may be obscured not all isc especially asphalt and concrete roads sidewalks and driveways are completely impervious as this infrastructure ages it weathers and cracks with some field studies showing deterioration of these surface materials can greatly increase porosity and infiltration ability ramier et al 2004 redfern et al 2016 wiles and sharp jr 2008 furthermore whether a non directly connected impervious area contributes to storm response can depend on down slope pervious surface characteristics although pervious surfaces are thought to provide more infiltration than impervious surfaces physical characteristics of pervious surfaces such as soil texture prior compaction microtopography antecedent soil moisture conditions and the presence of vegetation strongly influence infiltration rates and storage volumes transient factors such as rainfall and soil moisture are especially important in low permeability soils sytsma et al 2020 in other words not all pervious surfaces are alike as discussed below in section 3 urban soils and soil water 2 2 2 artificial drainage via sewers much above ground impervious surface coverage drains via surface pathways such as gutters and ditches to below ground pipe networks to decrease flooding and quickly and efficiently move water off the landscape and into streams and rivers in urban systems fig 1 these networks that move stormwater down slope from engineered headwaters fork et al 2018 to streams and rivers are an integral portion of the network of directly connected impervious areas and have been shown to significantly increase the rate of water flow to streams ress et al 2020 most commonly understanding the impact of subsurface drainage on urban hydrograph response has been framed as model based analysis e g nanía et al 2015 shrestha et al 2022 and is highly limited by data availability chegini and li 2022 modeling efforts show that watersheds with higher storm sewer densities increase the magnitude of peak discharge meierdiercks et al 2010 older cities typically have areas where streams have been buried into stormwater pipes elmore and kaushal 2008 hopkins and bain 2018 napieralski et al 2015 napieralski and welsh 2016 roy et al 2009 commonly located in the headwaters and moving both baseflow and stormflow combined sewer systems where stormwater and sewage are co located in pipes are also direct connections from isc to streams rivers and other water bodies during overflows but the total area of directly connected impervious area in a combined sewer system will vary with time as pipes shift from flowing to wastewater treatment plants wwtp during baseflow to overflowing into water bodies during storms fig 4 the rate and volume of water moved will depend on the shape of the pipe network and size of the pipes while pipe material will impact potential leakage or infiltration covered further in section 4 hopkins and bain 2018 sanitary sewers are not directly connected to isc or the river network but still represent important flow paths in the urban landscape see section 4 delesantro et al 2022 2 2 3 channel straightening hardening and other changes in stream morphology urban river form reflects human activity and direct intervention within the channel e g culvertizing or concrete lining of streams as well as the introduction of impervious surfaces in the upgradient watershed area draining to a given stream fig 1 chin 2006 gurnell et al 2007 such disturbances both along the channel and in the watershed can induce changes to channel morphology with subsequent impacts on hydrology in many cases urban channels have been engineered or designed specifically for flood management gurnell et al 2007 urban channels for a variety of reasons may be straightened confined e g levees and have armored beds and banks including channel hardening with concrete gabions and sheet piling booth and fischenich 2015 often these alterations to channel morphology result in a disconnection between urban streams and the surrounding floodplain which then modifies surface water groundwater responses ledford and lautz 2015 ryan et al 2010 straightening also serves to rapidly route flow downstream this in turn shapes hydrologic responses and sources of streamflow during high flow and baseflow periods upstream and upgradient urbanization can also alter the supply of sediment to a given stream reach with subsequent impacts on morphology gurnell et al 2007 2 2 4 stormwater management practices stormwater control measures are used to mitigate flashy urban streamflow although their longevity and effectiveness particularly at the watershed scale is not well known baker et al 2022 golden and hoghooghi 2018 national research council 2009 most field studies have been conducted on small scales e g individual scm or small sub basins while modeling is used to evaluate large scale e g watershed impacts baker et al 2022 jefferson et al 2017 stormwater control measures can function to increase the infiltration and storage of runoff and also include end of pipe controls the variety of scm encompasses infiltration controls infiltration trenches pervious pipe systems grassed swales vegetated buffer strips and more end of pipe controls constructed wetlands wet ponds dry ponds and soil amendments though we focus primarily on engineered scm in this section we note that shuster et al 2022 has coined the term passive green infrastructure to extend to other urban green spaces such as urban parks vegetated roadsides and vacant land we also refer to these practices as scm and not green infrastructure in light of the lack of universal definition and goals of green infrastructure matsler et al 2021 jefferson et al 2017 highlighted that employing scm to return streams to pre urban peaks and volumes is likely not a realistic goal furthermore scm are often intended to capture smaller storms that occur frequently 2 5 cm or 1 inch over 24 hours for many u s regulatory goals u s environmental protection agency 2016 ameliorating the impacts from larger storms that may occur more frequently under future climate scenarios will remain a challenge see section 6 3 baker et al 2022 rosenberger et al 2021 sohn et al 2019 another challenge in highly urban areas is finding space to install or retrofit scm that can hold or infiltrate meaningful amounts of stormwater relative to the total volume of stormwater in the basin during a given precipitation or snowmelt event therefore it is crucial to consider the pathways of urban runoff when investigating the effective placement of scm to enhance stormwater capture jefferson et al 2017 voter and loheide ii 2018 walsh et al 2022 the placement of scm along critical flowpaths can provide more stormwater capture than increasing the number of scm fry and maxwell 2017 additionally in arid areas the structure of urban stormwater networks may serve as a scm by increasing flow dispersion and reducing peak flows along the network jovanovic et al 2019 modeling studies focused on groundwater response to infiltration have demonstrated that infiltration based scm can increase groundwater recharge and subsequently streamflow barron et al 2013 bhaskar et al 2018 and have also shown that this response varies depending on local hydrogeologic conditions endreny and collins 2009 göbel et al 2004 hamel et al 2013 scaling up stormwater infiltration for purposeful aquifer recharge is increasing in popularity for example some cities have integrated a design framework that has focused on using multiple infrastructure approaches to address water quantity and quality issues li et al 2017 assessment of groundwater recharge following these water sensitive initiatives show decreased recharge compared to pre urbanization but still increased relative to traditional urban design however with the potential for groundwater mounding clogging and contamination howard et al 2007 meng et al 2022 zhang and chui 2019 climate has a strong control on the impact of scm on groundwater with infiltration from stormwater control measures in arid environments increasing groundwater recharge and baseflow mcphillips et al 2019 indeed stream flashiness can actually decrease in arid urban streams due in part to the introduction of scm like stormwater detention ponds which enhance water retention mcphillips et al 2019 while storm characteristics are an important control on the degree to which scm reduce event scale runoff holman dodds et al 2003 sohn et al 2019 their impact on runoff recharge and evapotranspiration at annual or longer time scales may be better explained by the aridity index and measures of precipitation intermittency voter and loheide 2021 2 2 5 canals and dams in many cities the river network and flow of water is augmented by the addition of canals and or dams canals have long been used to control the flow of water with many civilizations building canals for water transport and access over many kilometers fig 1 romero lankao 2010 wescoat jr et al 2018 canals can either be naturally lined or lined with concrete in some urban areas and are often used to transport stormwater away from urban areas huong and pathirana 2013 lim and lu 2016 canals were historically developed to support irrigation or agriculture in watersheds with mixed land use wescoat jr et al 2018 canals may exist within cities or as a means to transport water over large distances to cities the impact of canals on the river network will vary with configuration use and management the impact of dams on hydrographs is well researched graf 1999 habets et al 2018 magilligan and nislow 2005 given more than 60 of rivers exceeding 1000 km in length are no longer free flowing grill et al 2019 as dams are typically used for purposes that benefit cities e g water supply flood control navigation hydropower many cities either contain dams or are downstream of dams given the direct impact of dams on hydrologic response the presence of upstream dams may alter the typical shape of hydrographs expected in highly impervious areas for example a hydrograph from the don river in toronto ontario shows hydrographs for two events one with a stormflow peak and one immediately following where the radial arm gates at an upstream dam were closed and as a result sheared off the expected flood peak fig 5 given such widely recognized impacts it is crucial to document the presence of dams in urban areas in hydrologic investigations seeking to relate urban form e g isc and function e g hydrograph shape or hydrologic signatures 2 2 6 interbasin transfers many urban watersheds are not closed systems and experience interbasin transfers that move water across urban watershed boundaries fig 1 zhuang 2016 the most recent analysis of inter basin transfers in the united states identified many that impact urban areas including the delaware and catskills aqueducts that provide water to new york city water movement from the colorado river basin to los angeles and other california cities and the chattahoochee south river that supplies much of atlanta among numerous others dickson and dzombak 2017 approximately 10 of the largest population centers across the globe are estimated to rely on water piped from more than 265 km away mcdonald et al 2014 paliwal and baghela 2007 note that groundwater levels have risen as much as 30 m in jodhpur india which is hypothesized to be due to inter basin transfers of water into the city of the water pumped in 33 is not conveyed through wastewater infrastructure indicating it could be recharging groundwater or lost to evapotranspiration 2 2 7 wastewater treatment plants treated wastewater effluent discharges directly into many urban streams and rivers impacting the quantity and quality of streamflow fig 1 in the united states 80 of large cities by population that rely on surface water for drinking water withdraw water that includes treated wastewater turner et al 2021 while less detrimental to the receiving ecosystem than untreated waste these discharges can still have negative impacts on water quality e g nutrients metals and in stream ecological health carey and migliaccio 2009 though in select cases and for certain metals this effluent may dilute heavy metal concentrations wolfand et al 2022 small urban streams can have 50 or more of their total discharge sourced from wwtp effluent ledford et al 2021 even large rivers are impacted with the panke river in berlin germany sourcing up to 90 of its flow from wwtp effluent during dry periods marx et al 2021 and the south platte river usa sometimes entirely sourced from effluent dennehy et al 1998 these outputs have important implications for sustaining urban baseflow in areas that would otherwise have variable low flows ledford et al 2020 or would run dry as a result of climate change water reuse or water withdrawals elsewhere halaburka et al 2013 wolfand et al 2022 the impacts of wwtp releases are readily discernible from hydrographs and can show impacts many kilometers downstream fig 6 in many combined sewer systems deep pipe or reservoir storage facilities capture an exceptional volume of combined sewer overflows diverting a substantial portion of runoff long distances to a large centralized facility where this water is temporarily stored treated and then discharged to surface waterways allegheny county sanitary authority 2019 metropolitan water reclamation district of greater chicago 2021 pinney 2010 the overall impact of sustained wwtp discharge on the natural flow regime poff et al 1997 has not been well established and will equally shape the fate and transport of many types of pollutants including emerging contaminants and subsequent impact of effluent quality on downstream ecosystems 3 urban soils and soil water 3 1 importance of urban soils infiltration in urban areas is limited by the presence and characteristics of impervious surfaces this elevates the importance of pervious areas which generate less runoff than impervious surfaces and often play an important role in stormwater management by infiltrating runoff generated on nearby impervious surfaces law et al 2004 pervious surfaces may include natural areas and parks residential lawns mueller and thompson 2009 vacant lots kelleher et al 2020 riparian zones or floodplains manufactured surfaces such as permeable pavement palla and gnecco 2015 and certain types of scm within pervious areas soil properties such as porosity soil water retention characteristics and infiltration rates or hydraulic conductivity control partitioning between infiltration and runoff along with topographic gradients preferential flow pathways for example caused by desiccation cracks decaying tree roots worm burrows and animal excavations are also important in this regard soil properties also influence the storage and movement of water within the subsurface including depths to and movement of groundwater gillefalk et al 2022 in these ways soils control the timescales and pathways that water follows at the surface and in the subsurface and shape runoff behavior at point to plot to watershed scales the complex role of soil hydraulic properties on urban hydrology is compounded by the high spatio temporal heterogeneity of soils in urban areas where soils are formed and molded through human disturbance and modified by the presence of urban vegetation and subsurface infrastructure craul 1992 effland and pouyat 1997 lehmann and stahr 2007 shuster et al 2021 urban areas are likely to have soils with simpler profiles absence of b horizon or resequenced soil horizons which has implications for soil water storage herrmann et al 2018 quantifying urban soil properties especially infiltration rates and hydraulic conductivity is crucial for predicting urban runoff and estimating localized flooding impacts including where and when pervious areas are sinks versus sources via infiltration excess overland flow or saturation excess overland flow of stormwater runoff e g lim 2016 miles and band 2015 stewart et al 2019 understanding design issues that define where to target investment in scm and or other structural or non structural stormwater interventions e g kelleher et al 2020 lim and welty 2017 voter and loheide ii 2018 quantifying evaporation and evapotranspiration rates quantifying subsurface recharge groundwater tables and subsurface pathways of water contribution to urban streams and understanding how changes to soil properties through time may alter all of the above 3 2 disturbance and heterogeneity of urban soils urban landscapes are a hodgepodge of soil types and properties largely as a result of human activity in urban landscapes craul 1999 pickett and cadenasso 2009 schleuβ et al 1998 shuster et al 2014 within urban areas the u s natural resources conservation service has its own classification for urban soils craul 1985 to indicate that local measurements are needed this label represents the extensive disturbance that these areas experience via the removal of soils and addition of fill during construction the removal and addition of impervious surfaces and the cycle of demolition and rebuilding that characterizes urban landscapes craul 1985 o riordan et al 2021 yang and zhang 2015 additional descriptors are needed for urban landscapes impacted by warfare certini et al 2013 hupy and schaetzl 2006 international syntheses characterizing likely infiltration rates and other soil properties within urban areas are lacking schwartz and smith 2016 and existing approaches to estimate such properties poorly approximate observations schifman and shuster 2019 shuster et al 2021 described the complexities of urban soil histories for estimating hydraulic conductivity a crucial variable in most hydrologic modeling indeed hydraulic conductivity across urban areas can vary by many orders of magnitude and does not always decrease with depth shuster et al 2021 variations in urban soil properties with depth are poorly documented with many studies solely focusing on characterizations in the upper few centimeters of the soil profile soil compaction due to human activity is a common urban phenomenon in the top surface which has a strong influence on infiltration effland and pouyat 1997 pitt et al 2008 yang and zhang 2015 as such pervious areas e g open space vacant lots are known to experience a range of infiltration rates from high bergeson et al 2022 kelleher et al 2020 to low gregory et al 2006 shuster et al 2005 vegetated areas should not be assumed to have high infiltration because compaction occurs due to mowing and foot traffic especially in popular recreation areas when considering urban residential parcels voter and loheide ii 2018 highlighted through modeling that reducing compaction and amending soils is one of the best interventions that can be undertaken to reduce surface runoff and favor infiltration when and where urban soils are compacted heterogeneity in infiltration can even occur at small scales a few meters or even sub meter scales shuster et al 2014 as shown by pope et al 2023 during storm monitoring using electrical resistivity tomography fig 7 urban soils are further subject to a subsurface phenomenon termed urban karst wherein coarse materials surrounding subsurface infrastructure e g pipes may support rapid preferential flow bonneau et al 2017 hibbs et al 2012 kaushal and belt 2012 along with the need to characterize them urban soils and associated properties can be included as a design component in scm with a variety of soil amendments including compost thompson et al 2008 and biochar yi et al 2020 the primary function of amended soil is to maintain high porosity and infiltration rates though some amendments may also enhance nutrient removal tian et al 2019 or carbon sequestration smith 2016 because such a wide range of amendment materials and mixes are used it can be difficult to estimate the hydraulic properties of amended soil with confidence unless direct measurements are made in addition many studies have shown that such properties can vary through time in particular due to clogging le coustumer et al 2009 natarajan and davis 2015 given scm are typically vegetated identifying the balance between infiltration and evapotranspiration remains an important area of research hamel et al 2013 poozan et al 2022 as some work has shown that nearly all infiltrated stormwater during summer periods may quickly be evapotranspired bonneau et al 2018b 3 3 integrating soil properties hydrological processes and hydrological modeling given how important soil properties are to urban hydrologic processes selecting appropriate values or ranges for soil properties such as porosity soil water retention characteristics and infiltration rate or hydraulic conductivity is a key consideration for urban hydrologic modeling in the absence of direct observations common soil characterizations used by modelers are often based on data from agricultural soils using such estimates may over or underestimate infiltration rates and therefore misrepresent hydrological processes in urban areas bergeson et al 2022 schifman and shuster 2019 voter and loheide ii 2020 one alternative is to generate pedotransfer functions for hydraulic conductivity at the city scale jian et al 2021 however similar pedotransfer relationships for urban soil water retention characteristics remain unexplored a more expansive discussion of hydrologic modeling in urban systems follows in section 7 4 4 urban groundwater 4 1 the importance of groundwater in urban areas the study of urban groundwater has grown considerably over the past decade in recognition of the importance of this valuable water source giordano 2009 silva et al 2020 vázquez suñé et al 2010 groundwater sustains low flows for most surface water systems and is a critical source of potable drinking and irrigation water for communities worldwide crucially approximately 50 of the global potable water supply is provided by groundwater and nearly half of the world s population many of whom live in large cities relies on groundwater as their primary source of drinking water giordano 2009 with urban population growth the use of urban aquifers is expanding in an effort to build resilience in water supply systems scanlon et al 2016 wallace et al 2021 despite the alteration of natural flow pathways due to impervious surface cover and urban infrastructure groundwater still plays an important role in urban streamflow generation e g follstad shah et al 2019 meriano et al 2011

groundwater depending on local topographic gradients e g chloride from winter salts kaushal et al 2005 ledford et al 2016 roy 2019 understanding the impacts of urban infrastructure on the recharge and discharge of groundwater is critical for maintaining the services it provides humans and other organisms 4 2 dominant processes driving urban groundwater groundwater recharge and discharge in urban areas are intimately linked to the pervasiveness of isc and subsurface urban infrastructure often described as urban karst kaushal and belt 2012 in some of the most highly urbanized areas streams themselves have been buried and now flow through underground pipes elmore and kaushal 2008 forgrave et al 2022 napieralski et al 2015 many studies report a reduction in direct groundwater recharge from precipitation due to the high coverage of impervious surfaces shuster et al 2005 there are also trade offs between reduced evapotranspiration due to vegetation removal and increases in local infiltration in some cases lerner 2002 schirmer et al 2013 urban groundwater recharge can be enhanced by indirect recharge from leaky water supply pipes sanitary pipes e g kaushal and belt 2012 and septic systems e g capps et al 2020 as well as over irrigation of greenspaces fillo et al 2021 determining the direct impacts of pipe networks on subsurface flows is a great challenge due to uncertainty in the location and quality e g cracks of underground pipe infrastructure hibbs et al 2012 hopkins and bain 2018 kaushal and belt 2012 scm are typically used to promote infiltration at the plot scale but may equally impart catchment scale impacts on groundwater recharge e g meng et al 2022 groundwater discharge to surface waters can also be modified by urban infrastructure for example lining stream channels can result in decreased baseflow bhaskar et al 2020 urban groundwater can also infiltrate into sanitary and storm sewer pipes which then act as a preferential flow path to wwtp or streams e g pangle et al 2022 zhang and parolari 2022 the impacts of these altered flow pathways can be amplified when water is imported from adjacent watersheds e g dickson and dzombak 2017 determining which infrastructure mediated route was the source of baseflow in streams can be supported through fingerprinting approaches including with isotopes divers et al 2014 4 2 1 infrastructure mediated routes of urban groundwater recharge one of the underground water conveyance networks kaushal and belt 2012 that has a high potential to increase recharge to groundwater in urban environments is leaking potable water pipes reported rates of loss over distribution lines range from about 8 of the total volume of piped water lerner 1997 to 60 lerner 1986 with garcia fresca 2007 reporting typical values across the literature of 20 30 these estimations are frequently calculated by comparing volumes of water leaving drinking water treatment facilities to the volume of water billed to customers for consumptive use although it is worth noting that many municipalities have had failures in their water billing systems and estimates have to be made about non billable or non revenue uses or losses gonzález gómez et al 2011 liemberger and wyatt 2019 recent modeling work has shown that high permeability trenches that surround such water utilities may hold much of the exfiltrating water with less recharging urban aquifers than previously hypothesized especially in low permeability native soils but potentially create preferential flow along pipes d aniello et al 2021 along with leaks from pressurized drinking water pipes subsidies from stormwater pipes sewer overflows or water line breaks can result in runoff ratios greater than one in highly urbanized systems where headwater streams are buried forgrave et al 2022 in some parts of the world e g the united states and canada areas of urbanization that are more recently developed and or on the fringes or exurbs are frequently delayed in connectivity to a centralized sewer system lagro et al 2017 newburn and berck 2011 in these locations individual houses rely on on site wastewater treatment such as septic systems when working properly a septic system will recharge groundwater with leachate that has been fully treated through a leachate field to remove solids bacteria and nutrients however many septic systems have high potential to fail due to age of the system or lack of maintenance which is correlated with the socioeconomic status of the population capps et al 2020 most research around septic impact in urban environments focuses on contamination especially nutrient subsidies kaushal et al 2011 2006 lagro et al 2017 although other work has attributed high baseflow during dry periods to septic leachate burns et al 2005 4 2 2 infrastructure mediated routes of groundwater discharge both sanitary and storm sewers could either exfiltrate or infiltrate groundwater depending on the hydraulic head differential between the pipes and groundwater table nguyen et al 2021 infiltration of groundwater into sewers fig 8 when the groundwater table is high could result in a decrease in the groundwater table in addition rainfall can leak through manhole casings and other defects i e inflow so infiltration of rain and groundwater into sewer systems are frequently lumped into infiltration and inflow for infiltration and inflow into sanitary sewers water is routed to wastewater treatment facilities while infiltration and inflow into storm sewers will discharge to waterways pangle et al 2022 found that infiltration and inflow into sanitary sewers could divert one quarter to one third of the total streamflow to wastewater facilities in atlanta ga other work estimates 30 85 of sanitary sewage flow is sourced from groundwater infiltration during dry weather through chemical isotopic and numerical modeling or high frequency monitoring at the wastewater facility bareš et al 2009 dirckx et al 2009 kracht et al 2007 zhang and parolari 2022 storm sewers may contain the remnants of buried streams further complicating hydrologic flowpaths but may also have cracks allowing for groundwater infiltration and direct discharge to streams elmore and kaushal 2008 janke et al 2014 rodriguez et al 2020 5 urban greenspaces and the role of vegetation in urban hydrology 5 1 hydrologic partitioning within urban greenspaces urban green spaces include large tracts of natural areas floodplains parks nature preserves smaller tracks yards natural areas in residential areas highly managed commercial districts abandoned lots and scms these spaces provide numerous ecosystem services to urban regions e g extensive natural urban parks increase biodiversity habitat connectivity and provide numerous socio economic benefits such as improved health for citizens nielsen et al 2014 shuster et al 2022 world health organization regional office for europe 2016 urban green spaces also play a vital role in mitigating the effects of urbanization on the hydrologic cycle consequently the management design and creation of urban green space is critical to urban planning seeking to build resilience to climate change in cities and balance potentially competing water demands the importance of vegetation in regulating the global terrestrial hydrological cycle is widely recognized with transpiration being the dominant green water flux to the atmosphere compared to evaporation from soils and canopy interception in most environments good et al 2015 jasechko et al 2013 furthermore vegetation in urban green spaces not only affects green water fluxes evaporation and transpiration but equally impacts ecohydrological partitioning of precipitation into blue water runoff generation and groundwater recharge expectedly the ecohydrological function of urban green spaces is different from more natural areas kuhlemann et al 2021 and process understanding from non urban study sites may not be transferable vico et al 2014 in general tree canopy cover in urban landscapes increases rainfall interception wang et al 2008 but can also dampen rainfall intensities which has implications for runoff generation processes species specific differences in interception rates and volumes baptista et al 2018 however highlight the spatial variability of the provisioning of these services across urban landscapes urban vegetation often differs in height e g due to pruning and microclimate e g due to shading from buildings therefore water requirements are heterogeneously distributed across these complex anthropogenically altered landscapes nouri et al 2013 the differences in water use between contrasting generic vegetation types have been quantified in several empirical studies kannenberg et al 2021 werner et al 2021 some modeling studies have investigated precipitation partitioning into interception soil evaporation and transpiration for different urban vegetation assemblages e g gillefalk et al 2021 through evapotranspiration urban green spaces provide cooling effects mitigating urban heat islands balany et al 2020 gunawardena et al 2017 pataki et al 2011 peters et al 2011 usually urban areas include a mix of native and non native species and plants have to adapt to harsh environments with limited water availability where surface sealing is extensive and where they are affected by modified radiation and thermal regimes from shading by tall buildings asawa et al 2017 further artificial irrigation impervious cover and the urban heat island effect can extend the length of the growing season zipper et al 2016 all these factors can increase urban plant water requirements thereby posing a risk for dry season water stress zipper et al 2017 5 2 feedbacks between vegetation infiltration and groundwater with climate change predictions showing that the southeastern united states central europe and many other regions will become drier the role of lawn golf course and park irrigation to sustain urban vegetation can be expected to expand in importance see section 6 3 nouri et al 2013 irrigation that is not partitioned to evapotranspiration will instead follow other flowpaths to streams and rivers recent work showed that in the semi arid intermountain west in the united states 63 93 of summer low flow in urban streams could be sourced from tap water and once leaking infrastructure see section 4 2 1 was accounted for 32 82 of the flow was coming from lawn irrigation fillo et al 2021 modeling techniques have quantified the contribution of irrigation as a subsidy to groundwater and thus baseflow discharge sanzana et al 2019 as have opportunities to monitor change in streamflow during periods where lawn irrigation is prohibited manago and hogue 2017 in addition there are important implications when considering the impact soil compaction has on the ability of lawns to infiltrate edmondson et al 2011 that require further study but are well described in agricultural areas alaoui et al 2018 despite these recent studies our understanding of vegetation effects on urban water flows is still very limited kuhlemann et al 2021 understanding of the natural processes contributing to urban water partitioning such as an improved quantification of evapotranspiration from different vegetation communities remains challenging pataki et al 2011 smith et al 2022 locations where vegetation is highly dependent on groundwater tables may be the most susceptible to changes in evapotranspiration because of groundwater table fluctuations barron et al 2014 when the rooting zone falls below the groundwater table or the capillary fringe plants have shown strong resilience to drought in urban areas as they can source groundwater resulting in over 40 more transpiration than in locations where roots cannot access groundwater marchionni et al 2020 urban water management needs to be adapted to meet the water demand of green spaces under projected climate change with increased temperatures and changing precipitation patterns zipper et al 2017 6 urban climate 6 1 urbanization impacts on local and regional climate in addition to altering hydrologic processes urbanization can result in significant changes to local and regional climate for an in depth synthesis of urban climate research we refer readers to other reviews e g arnfield 2003 masson et al 2020 oke et al 2017 qian et al 2022 here we focus on how urbanization affects the hydrologic aspects of climate the most significant urbanization induced changes to local climate can be traced to the replacement of vegetation with high albedo urban materials like pavement and concrete replacement of vegetation reduces evapotranspiration and therefore latent heat flux heat used to evaporate water and the addition of high albedo materials increases sensible heat flux heat that causes changes in temperature relative to undeveloped conditions fig 9 the enhanced warming in urban areas relative to surrounding undeveloped or rural areas is known as the urban heat island effect bowler et al 2010 manoli et al 2019 oke 1973 one of the most studied aspects of urban climate souch and grimmond 2006 recent research shows that urban heat is controlled by mean annual precipitation manoli et al 2019 background climate i e aridity and humidity ibsen et al 2021 and the relative effectiveness of heat convection across urban rural areas zhao et al 2014 urban heat island effects are most dramatic in humid cities zhao et al 2014 though effects may be partially mitigated by a corresponding increase in evapotranspiration demand zipper et al 2017 by contrast arid cities can have relatively uniform temperatures across the urban rural gradient and at times can even exhibit negative urban heat island effects i e urban temperatures are cooler than rural temperatures moffett et al 2019 zhao et al 2014 urbanization also modifies precipitation in urban areas typically increasing rainfall downwind of cities and or over the city center liu and niyogi 2019 fig 9 urban rainfall modification is moderated by many factors including the strength of urban heat island effects changes to aerodynamic roughness i e due to urban buildings changnon 1981 increased wind speeds balling and cerveny 1987 and the extent of aerosol and pollutant loading liu and niyogi 2019 shepherd 2005 spatial variations in heat produced by the urban heat island effect in which heat generation enhances turbulent transport of water vapor to the upper atmosphere can result in highly spatially heterogeneous precipitation patterns increased rainfall is apparent at the scale of individual storms as well as at climatological scales liu and niyogi 2019 with urbanization statistically associated with intensification of extreme rainfall events singh et al 2020 measurements collected every 2 3 km spatially and every 5 min temporally have been identified as the threshold for accurate precipitation measurements for urban research berne et al 2004 the few studies that have focused on winter hydrology indicate that urbanization leads to a shift away from frozen precipitation changnon 2003 johnson and shepherd 2018 and a reduction in snow depths johnson et al 2021 methods of snow redistribution unique to urban areas e g shoveling walkways plowing may further alter snowmelt patterns valeo and ho 2004 6 2 climate impacts on hydrological processes in all landscapes including urban areas climate is a primary control on precipitation and how precipitation is partitioned by hydrologic processes strong geographic variation in dominant precipitation mechanisms e g convectional orographic cyclonic causes regional differences in the magnitude and pattern of precipitation these storm characteristics are often captured by intensity duration frequency curves or design storm hyetographs that are widely used in urban settings for infrastructure design and planning watt and marsalek 2013 short high intensity storms are likely to produce infiltration excess overland flow across impervious surfaces or low permeability soils horton 1933 stewart et al 2019 while long duration low intensity storm events are more likely to produce saturation excess overland flow across permeable areas although we note that direct observations to support these mechanisms are lacking perhaps due to the general focus in urban areas on impervious surfaces the role of precipitation patterns on urban hydrologic processes is better studied than other aspects of climate like the ratio of potential evapotranspiration to precipitation however the ratio of potential evapotranspiration to precipitation referred to as the aridity index is known to be a primary driver of long term water balance partitioning in natural landscapes across a wide range of climates padrón et al 2017 where potential evapotranspiration dominates over precipitation arid climates soil moisture tends to be consistently low and where precipitation dominates over potential evapotranspiration humid climates soil moisture tends to be consistently high grayson et al 1997 anthropogenic water inputs such as irrigation leaking pipes that contribute to soil moisture in urban areas would likely alter this relationship still low potential evapotranspiration relative to water inputs in humid cities implies that humid cities may be more susceptible to saturation excess overland flow events in which pervious areas are sources of runoff at the same time flashy flows driven by infiltration excess overland flow in arid cities may not be that different from flows in undeveloped arid locations where very dry soils with low hydraulic conductivity also generate infiltration excess overland flow the aridity index and related frameworks e g budyko 1974 porporato et al 2004 may also help explain the impacts of urban infrastructure on aspects of urban hydrology beyond runoff water that is infiltrated due to urban infrastructure e g via infiltration based scm leaking sewer pipes irrigation is likely to be captured for evapotranspiration in arid cities where soils are drier and vegetation is more water stressed but likely to become deep drainage and contribute to groundwater recharge in humid cities where soils are wetter and evapotranspiration is more limited by energy availability voter and loheide 2021 for similar reasons introducing green spaces to urban areas without irrigation or other water inputs e g depaving impervious surfaces adding green roofs is more likely to result in high evapotranspiration and cooling potential in humid cities but high water retention in arid cities cuthbert et al 2022 6 3 impacts of climate change on urban hydrology climate change is increasing extreme weather events particularly hot temperatures heavy rainfall and increasing risk of drought ipcc 2022 the long term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns associated with global climate change can alter the intensity and spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration leading to dynamic shifts in water and energy balances accounting for these changing conditions is a major challenge in urban hydrology a field that has long depended on the assumption of stationarity milly et al 2008 to understand how urban areas may respond to climate change updated projections of rainfall temperature and other meteorological parameters can be developed by dynamically or statistically downscaling global climate models to regional scales relevant for urban hydrology moore et al 2016 these predictions are commonly accomplished using ensembles of multiple models to account for uncertainty giorgi 2019 though considerable uncertainty also exists from extrapolating trends observed over only a few decades to the future onof and arnbjerg nielsen 2009 in some cases robust projections of current and future conditions may exist locally but centrally available statistics are more often out of date and do not consistently characterize uncertainty wright et al 2021 globally urban areas are projected to experience a 250 increase in exposure to drought and flood hazards in the near future güneralp et al 2015 the frequency and intensity of urban drought is increasing due to changes in precipitation mismanagement of water sources growing demand and pollution of water sources zhang et al 2019 one of the most visible examples of drought impacts on water supply occurred in cape town south africa which approached day zero of running out of potable water in 2018 pascale et al 2020 many cities address this risk with inter basin transfers of water which would decrease risk by tapping larger areas of water sources padowski and jawitz 2012 but it is unclear if this will be sufficient with the intensification of megadroughts williams et al 2022 drought decreases soil moisture ault 2020 redmond 2002 and can also shift the type of vegetation in cities miller et al 2022 this could in turn shift the partitioning of precipitation between evapotranspiration and runoff macedo et al 2022 saft et al 2015 increased precipitation intensity will increase pluvial flooding risk in cities güneralp et al 2015 tellman et al 2021 wing et al 2022 not considering such projected changes in precipitation regime will have serious consequences for urban hydrologic infrastructure much of which has been designed using rainfall statistics i e intensity duration frequency curves that are now decades out of date kourtis and tsihrintzis 2021 waters et al 2003 wright et al 2019 many studies on climate change impacts have focused on the response of scm to changes in storm event characteristics i e storm intensity storm duration storm frequency waters et al 2003 zahmatkesh et al 2015a antecedent soil moisture and uncertainty moore et al 2016 predicting the impacts that climate change will have on urban areas and associated hydrologic processes including scm performance flooding and other aspects of urban hydrology requires both accurate projections of climate change impacts at urban scales and robust hydrologic models capable of simulating complex urban dynamics unfortunately such modeling studies cannot be performed in regional climate models directly because they are run at relatively coarse 1 km2 resolutions and the associated land surface models do not resolve smaller scale urban hydrologic processes as a result evaluating the impact of climate change on urban hydrology requires forcing existing urban hydrologic models with a range of synthetic meteorological time series such synthetic time series scenarios may be generated from global climate models delta change factors zahmatkesh et al 2015b rainfall multipliers panos et al 2021 rossman 2014 or changes to regional intensity duration frequency curves guo 2006 mirhosseini et al 2013 7 challenges and opportunities in urban hydrology research 7 1 characterizing and considering the physiography of and water related infrastructure in urban watersheds above all a firm understanding of the characteristics of a given urban landscape is needed for urban hydrology research including meteorology climate and weather subsurface properties soils geology land surface properties land cover vegetation and built infrastructure so much of the work within urban hydrology has focused on quantifying isc that we often overlook the importance of characterizing the factors listed above that are drivers of hydrologic functioning most cities invest in meteorological infrastructure for the purposes of managing weather extremes so data on long term climatic trends and event dynamics are easily accessible several urban streamflow generation studies have highlighted the importance of rainfall duration and intensity along with directly connected impervious area or effective impervious area on dominant flow pathways e g jefferson et al 2015 pellerin et al 2008 and dominant runoff generation processes e g miles and band 2015 stewart et al 2019 providing a strong rationale for mining meteorological datasets more deeply this consideration of storm event types to improve our understanding of runoff generation is especially needed given predictions of major shifts in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events although there has been good progress when it comes to documenting the spatial variability in soils in u s cities more work is needed to extend field measurements of hydraulic conductivity depth to confining layer soil structure and slope to unravel the mechanisms that generate urban soil patterns shuster et al 2021 this data collection effort presents an opportunity to draw from the strength of the urban hydrology soil science and urban ecology communities to amalgamate existing datasets across cities see section 7 5 for further discussion of the need for collaboration and coordination given the wealth of observational data that exists in many cities further exploration of underutilized datasets could support inference of soil properties including soil boring data from utility work likewise municipal documentation on the density and types of vegetation as well as maintenance practices e g irrigation of street trees could be helpful for scaling up plot scale measurements of the ecohydrologic functioning of urban greenspaces larger scale efforts to map vegetation could also be integrated into urban hydrology studies for example the machine learning derived auto arborist dataset from google which includes public tree censuses from 23 cities in the united states and canada https google github io auto arborist beyond the physiographic aspects of the urban landscape more detailed characterization and inclusion of the built form of urban areas including water related infrastructure are critical for most urban hydrology studies the availability of geospatial data on water body characteristics e g channel morphologies water depth water distribution systems sanitary collection systems storm sewer networks and stormwater control assets varies across municipalities this challenge of access is explored more fully in section 7 2 below more reliable water distribution data especially those related to loss estimates and exfiltration are useful for closing urban water budgets bhaskar and welty 2012 likewise sanitary combined collection system data including flow data are useful for understanding infiltration and inflow impacts on groundwater levels and baseflow pangle et al 2022 storm sewer network data can be important for correcting total impervious area estimates and estimating directly connected impervious area at small spatial scales roy and shuster 2009 and scm asset data can support inter catchment comparison of hydrologic response especially where large gradients in the level of treatment exist choat et al 2022 morales and oswald 2020 continued development of watershed scale methods to estimate directly connected impervious area will improve the accuracy and consistency of urbanization metrics this will likely require the use of high resolution imagery and digital elevation data e g from lidar coupled with the water infrastructure data discussed above to determine fine scale drainage patterns water infrastructure data can be combined with key physiographic variables and land cover or isc data to develop composition and structure based typologies of urban and urbanizing landscapes such typologies have been shown to explain the majority of variation in select stream water quality parameters blaszczak et al 2019 delesantro et al 2021 but have yet to be tested on metrics of the streamflow regime e g hydrologic signatures mcmillan 2020 or water age in urban areas these types of integrated classification systems may be particularly useful for inter city urban hydrology comparison studies where the many dimensions of urban landscape characterization need to be simplified 7 2 facilitating data collection and logistics for urban hydrological research as compared to less disturbed and less trafficked watersheds urban areas pose unique challenges for collecting hydrologic data specifically issues surrounding access experimental control and vandalism in less disturbed settings where there may be a single landowner controlling a large area of interest researchers with permission can install myriad sensors that go undisturbed collect samples from almost any location and prioritize sensor and instrument placement based on their research question often with few challenges associated with access permitting or need for owner approval this is exemplified in the united states through research that can happen on federally controlled lands which can cover thousands of square kilometers through federal programs such as long term ecological research stations lter network 2022 critical zone networks cuahsi 2022 and watershed science focus areas u s department of energy 2022 there has been a long investment in understanding a range of hydrologic processes in mostly non urban systems in contrast researchers studying urban systems often face extensive efforts to gain permits approvals and permissions for data collection from a wide range of stakeholders and landowners in addition it may be more difficult to find urban watersheds that can be treated experimentally where certain variables can be controlled for a set of experiments e g there is probably no urban watershed where you could remove all the vegetation to measure the resulting streamflow response as was done at hubbard brook likens et al 1970 at the plot scale precipitation experiments and soil measurements have shown variability in infiltration in soils pope et al 2023 schifman and shuster 2019 but less work has been done to manipulate water flow paths at the watershed scale without such experiments it is distinctly difficult in urban systems to shift from measuring correlations to observing causation once equipment is installed there is a risk that equipment may be vandalized or stolen ryan et al 2011 especially for items the public can visibly identify such as solar panels or copper wire for these reasons identifying sites where data can be collected to answer a research question is especially challenging and sites are frequently chosen opportunistically for their safety or access not because they are the best places to answer a given research question this leads to an ongoing challenge how can we best collect data in urban areas the silver lining of urban hydrology research is that urban areas likely have data being collected by diverse stakeholders relative to many non urban systems table 1 accessing such datasets often requires first building a relationship with the data holders to both understand what the datasets are and understand how to access them for example in the united states many municipalities will only share data with an open records request which must be detailed and explicit urban watersheds also do not follow political boundaries while datasets frequently do this means that for getting both site and data access researchers must contact and negotiate with multiple municipalities ariano and oswald 2022a dickson et al 2020 even within a single municipality researchers may need to consult multiple departments or agencies for example one level of government e g city may be responsible for the streambed while another level e g county may be responsible for managing the riparian zone when datasets are obtained from stakeholders the methodologies used to collect data may be unclear e g calculated leakage rates from drinking water pipes agencies may have limited time periods for which they have to retain monitoring records or monitoring records may only recently have been started so evaluating change over time in urban areas can be extremely difficult there are datasets urban hydrologists need access to that may not exist without archival searches or municipalities or other data holders may simply be unwilling to share older urban areas may not have accurate maps of underground pipe locations maps may have been lost and or those maps may not be digitized researchers are sometimes informed that datasets cannot be shared under concern for security and or liability or that collecting and sharing the data requires staff time and researchers will be charged for such efforts making data cost prohibitive how do we improve this situation first continued relationship building with data holding stakeholders is crucial for advancing our understanding of how infrastructure shapes hydrological processes in this way scientists are emissaries to such entities and can explain open data requirements for journal publications which may help increase accessibility to data sources through time there is growing research into the use of machine learning techniques to build synthetic infrastructure datasets by using areas where enough data are available to predict wider coverage ahmad et al 2022 chegini and li 2022 jian et al 2021 there may also be opportunities for communities to collect datasets nardi et al 2022 although work must be done to make sure such practices are equitable and not extractive harris et al 2021 examples of citizen or community science hydrology initiatives already exist kampf et al 2018 lowry and fienen 2013 however the duration of these datasets are relatively short seibert et al 2022 the development and funding of citizen science groups that use standardized collection protocols develop open source data and improve upon technological innovations from the past decade e g data sharing applications could help to expand the spatial and temporal coverage of urban hydrological datasets outreach and education initiatives that communicate research findings will be useful for building the public s awareness of and interest in urban hydrological issues this may have the added benefit of increasing pressure on data holding stakeholders to be more transparent and collaborative we should also recognize that we may bias our research towards areas where data are more easily accessible either in terms of cities or even where we do research within cities for example academic research within a city may be biased to locations that are seen as being safer in order to lower the risk of theft or vandalism resulting in limited or no data from large areas of cities overall the centralization of a database that contains urban hydrologic datasets would be transformational both in setting metadata standards that could be applied across all urban systems and in allowing for cross city coordination see section 7 5 7 3 characterizing dominant hydrological processes in urban landscapes previous studies have demonstrated clear differences in the dominant hydrological processes that occur in urban areas compared to rural and or pristine areas as integrators of these processes urban streams are typically flashier than their unpaved counterparts however as mentioned above previous regional scale studies examining the role of isc on hydrologic response have suggested that underlying physiographic factors still play an important role in streamflow generation e g ariano and oswald 2022a hopkins et al 2015b it would be beneficial to expand on these studies by compiling streamflow data from urban watersheds that span climatic geologic and topographic gradients to further examine the relationships between physiographic characteristics isc and hydrologic signatures described in mcmillan 2020 in this way one could increase the statistical power of our analyses of patterns and behavior in urban hydrologic processes such investigations would allow researchers to challenge the still prevailing hypothesis that because urbanization leads to a homogenous looking landscape it should also lead to a convergence of hydrologic functioning more widespread application of the celerity the speed with which a perturbation to flow propagates through the flow domain e g hydrologic response versus velocity the mass flux of water concept mcdonnell and beven 2014 to urban watersheds would help test whether the assumption that new water running off impervious surfaces as infiltration excess overland flow is the dominant source of water generating urban stormflow integrating observations of conservative tracers into urban hydrological studies e g bonneau et al 2018a and employing tools such as isotope hydrograph separation e g ariano and oswald 2022b jefferson et al 2015 soulsby et al 2015 isotope based young water fraction marx et al 2022 and transit time analysis e g morales and oswald 2020 parajulee et al 2019 could offer important insights into bulk hydrologic transport the distribution of water ages and stormflow generation in urban watersheds all of which have important implications for understanding extreme events response times and water quality hrachowitz et al 2016 quantifying the role of urban pervious areas e g lawns parks ravines sports fields golf courses brownfields riparian areas in shaping runoff and streamflow generation remains an important and evolving area of exploration examples of important research questions include do all new water inputs infiltrate into pervious areas or does soil compaction lead to infiltration excess overland flow where and when does saturation excess overland flow occur what is the fate of infiltrated water in pervious areas how is urban vegetation affecting these processes where and how long is water stored in urban watersheds answering these questions requires a deep understanding of soil and vegetation characteristics as well as information on infrastructure that might underlie these spaces hence city wide assessments of the spatial variability of urban soil and vegetation characteristics are needed that make use of existing classification schemes e g rossiter 2007 for urban soils and itree nowak 2020 for urban vegetation such maps can be used as an initial assessment of the transferability of process based studies on soil hydrologic characteristics e g shuster et al 2021 infiltration e g kelleher et al 2020 and partitioning of rainfall and snowmelt into blue and green water fluxes by vegetation e g gillefalk et al 2022 kuhlemann et al 2021 but also to inform where reproducing these types of studies would advance our understanding of urban pervious area hydrology more broadly e g arid versus humid climates with different soil types and vegetation assemblages expansion of process based pervious area studies will require significant investment of time and resources in field based monitoring burt and mcdonnell 2015 direct observations of scm impact on groundwater recharge need to be documented as well as more work to scale up impacts from individual scm to scm effects at the watershed scale work is especially needed like that of thompson et al 2021 that considers the interactions between traditional gray infrastructure in this case sewer lines and groundwater dynamics that are driven by green stormwater infrastructure further efforts to upscale plot scale understanding of vegetation water interlinkages towards larger watershed or city scales smith et al 2022 would be beneficial at a basic level our ability to characterize process dominance within and across urban watersheds suffers from our inability to constrain the urban water budget solving the water balance in urban areas involves the typical challenges faced in rural and pristine catchments including potential biases in precipitation data accurately measuring evapotranspiration dealing with a paucity of subsurface measurements and spatially variable topography vegetation and subsurface characteristics kampf et al 2020 however as outlined in this review urbanization adds additional complexity in the form of inter basin transfers combined sewer overflows and sanitary sewer overflows groundwater infiltration and loss into sanitary sewers groundwater recharge from septic leachate and or leaking potable water distribution pipes and or irrigation and alteration of flow pathways due to the urban karst effect bonneau et al 2017 potentially limiting the representativeness of subsurface measurements the data required to tackle the urban water balance are highly complex and site specific including both primary and secondary data collection from a variety of sources see section 7 1 and 7 2 as previously mentioned conservative tracers such as stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in water or artificial tracers e g rhodamine fluoresceine could have huge potential for elucidating the hidden sources stores and pathways that water takes through urban areas see ehleringer et al 2016 fillo et al 2021 expanded monitoring networks are needed including nested sites that align with transitions in land use land cover or age of development which could help to refine estimates of individual water balance components for the entire watershed any growth spatial temporal new measurements in monitoring programs will require larger funding commitments but the benefits in terms of the usefulness of the data should outweigh additional costs 7 4 frameworks and approaches for modeling urban systems while extensive hydrological modeling efforts exist in urban areas modeling remains a key challenge for improving our hydrological understanding of how water moves through these unique and heterogeneous areas hydrological modeling in urban areas faces several issues with possibly the following being the most important ones 1 lack of data for constraining and parameterizing models see section 7 1 7 2 2 limited ability to represent key hydrological processes outside of runoff generation from isc and flow through engineered drainage systems see section 7 3 and 3 limited understanding of how processes vary spatially and temporally in urban environments which is key to upscaling efforts see section 7 3 as dictated by model selection modeling analyses often require extensive data as input to mathematically represent key properties of urban form especially given that some properties of urban areas are more heterogeneous than less impacted catchments cadenasso et al 2007 liu and niyogi 2019 steele and wolz 2019 however data availability to constrain model parameters and other inputs is often lacking especially spatially variable inputs for distributed models commonly applied to urban environments both lumped and distributed models require a strong understanding of the numerical constraints on water body characteristics e g channel morphology soil and vegetation properties land use and surface and subsurface infrastructure the lack of such data often means modelers must make many assumptions utilize imperfect datasets and generalize from existing observations in other cities that may or may not be a good proxy for the system to be simulated in some cases models may not fully incorporate all aspects of urban form such as the impact of building shading when simulating urban energy fluxes or connected versus disconnected impervious flow paths at the watershed level modeling is also challenged by our inability to constrain the extent of an urban watershed with a lack of consensus within the urban hydrology community regarding how such areas should be delineated e g based on topographic boundaries incorporating sewer drainages validating model simulations is equally challenging given the lack of observations of different hydrological processes especially soil moisture groundwater table depth and evapotranspiration within urban areas gillefalk et al 2022 while observations of streamflow may exist these are often only useful for simulating streamflow responses at the watershed scale rather than capturing varying hydrological processes notably in the absence of other observations for comparison and given the nonuniqueness of solution e g equifinality inherent to hydrological model applications there is great potential for wide uncertainty bounds when simulating other fluxes if calibration and validation for an urban application are based on streamflow alone beven 2006 because numerical models are mathematical representations of how we conceptualize water flow in a given environment they simplify our understanding of key water sources stores and pathways in urban hydrologic systems given the historical focus in urban hydrology on isc and engineered drainage systems most urban hydrologic models e g the u s environmental protection agency s stormwater management model rossman 2014 specialize in robustly representing rainfall runoff dynamics of isc and the hydraulics of engineered drainage systems and scm fletcher et al 2013 however some commonly used and open source models oversimplify groundwater flow evapotranspiration and other ecohydrologic processes this is problematic for representing hydrologic processes within urban areas but also in non urban areas e g agricultural natural forested elsewhere in the drainage system particularly if these non urban areas are upgradient of the urban area as is especially common in coastal systems at the same time state of the art models for simulating ecohydrologic processes in natural and agricultural areas are challenged in representing isc and engineered drainage networks without customization e g bhaskar et al 2015 lim and welty 2017 voter and loheide ii 2018 zhang and chui 2020 as our perceptual understanding of key pathways in urban areas fig 1 expands to include saturation excess overland flow lim and lu 2016 miles and band 2015 stewart et al 2019 below ground partitioning of infiltration cuthbert et al 2022 voter and loheide 2021 leakage from drinking water and sewer pipes pangle et al 2022 zhang and parolari 2022 and other previously minimized processes so too must our perceptual models of urban hydrology our understanding of these pathways and their relative importance is still nascent though it is improving through time thus maintaining flexibility in model frameworks will be necessary to ensure that our ability to simulate urban areas keeps pace with our understanding of how these systems truly work we therefore encourage the urban hydrology community to consider the ways in which open source hydrological models could be improved in the context of simulating urban landscapes improving our approaches to hydrologic modeling in urban areas goes hand in hand with resolving the challenges outlined in sections 7 1 7 2 and 7 3 we need more observations and process level understanding to guide our modeling efforts and model framework improvements this will then allow us to use the models as learning frameworks to guide improved future monitoring in the absence of certain types of data one approach may be to combine existing observations from large datasets with machine learning to generate richer datasets for model input or validation e g bergeson et al 2022 given the uncertainty inherent to model applications in urban environments any modeling exercises should explicitly incorporate and estimate the impact of parameter uncertainty on model predictions via uncertainty and sensitivity analysis e g schifman et al 2018 in this vein an open question is whether our uncertainty in some input datasets ultimately matters to a prediction of interest therefore modeling analyses to ascertain how data availability impacts model predictions e g shrestha et al 2022 will be crucial to advancing understanding though modeling of urban areas is especially challenging there are many creative ways modelers have leveraged community science observations kelleher and mcphillips 2020 built strong partnerships with municipal organizations mcgrath et al 2019 acquired novel field observations and integrated them into tracer aided models e g isotopes gillefalk et al 2021 stevenson et al 2022 or generated synthetic models sytsma et al 2022 voter and loheide ii 2018 that continue to move our understanding of urban hydrology forward these examples highlight that there are many approaches and huge future potential for innovating within the hydrological modeling space 7 5 the need for inter site and inter city synthesis studies most of the urban hydrology research especially field based research is specific to single metropolitan areas limiting our ability to identify critical processes that are consistent across cities from those that may be more site specific inter site and inter city comparisons are crucial to contextualize and extrapolate our understanding and to overcome the uniqueness of place beven 2020 2000 cross city work that has been done has identified the importance of timing of urbanization on stream response due to the kind of stormwater infrastructure that was installed hopkins et al 2015a mcphillips and matsler 2018 the importance of physiographic and land cover characteristics on streamflow response ariano and oswald 2022a debbage and shepherd 2018 hopkins et al 2015b ledford et al 2020 and variability in response to urbanization between high and low flows bhaskar et al 2020 previous federal investment in the united states typically focused on single metropolitan areas e g baltimore ecosystem study pickett et al 2008 and central arizona phoenix cap lter 2022 long term ecological research sites although some newly funded projects aim to work across cities e g the urban critical zone cluster urban critical zone cluster 2022 as far as we are aware the few cross city comparisons that have been made have focused on single continents urban hydrologists frequently research where they live so building these cross city comparisons will require building large collaborations across metropolitan areas and urban hydrologists would benefit from applying to funding opportunities for such collaborations such integrated knowledge processing will also only work with widely and freely shared datasets even those that require large resource investment to acquire or make see section 7 3 standardized data collection methods development of standard metrics and clear sharing of metadata so that comparison is possible an equally pressing need is for the development of coordinated in terms of timing across sites and harmonized in terms of parameters measured and methods used at each site long term datasets to tease apart processes driven by climate from land use change from other long term dynamics while these data exist for streamflow in certain places e g bhaskar et al 2020 ficklin et al 2018 more information on other hydrologic fluxes such as evapotranspiration and infiltration specific to urban environments is needed ad hoc projects that monitor one location for a year or two are often the norm in urban areas and may add limited understanding to a broader scale site intercomparison initiative especially in the face of extensive inter and intra annual variability though long term observations are desired sustainability of long term monitoring is always challenging and requires sustained funding support tetzlaff et al 2017 this means urban hydrologists must continuously emphasize the importance of monitoring programs that are run by local state provincial or federal stakeholders and aggressively seek funding for international collaborations 8 conclusions the existing body of urban hydrology literature lays bare the complexities of water flow through cities and developed areas drainage area delineation transport along infrastructure mediated flow pathways stormwater management practices inter basin transfers interactions between stormwater and wastewater hydrologic functioning of pervious areas and the impacts of urbanization on hydroclimatic processes are just a few of the unique features of urban areas to consider when studying the sources stores and pathways of water given this complexity it is not surprising that urban hydrologic response is not uniform across catchments despite conventional assumptions to the contrary this complexity also befuddles our attempts to solve the urban water balance and develop representative models this review has led the authors to conclude that we need to move beyond thinking that isc is the only driver of urban hydrologic response and focus our efforts on developing an integrated understanding of water sources stores and pathways in urban areas better characterization and integration of physiographic variables and water related infrastructure into urban hydrology studies is critical to achieve this goal research should also carefully consider the role of pervious areas and the mosaic of soils managed vegetation and scm in storing and routing water through urban landscapes tracer applications will be particularly helpful in this regard and for attempts to solve the urban water balance above all inter site inter city comparisons are needed to overcome the lack of representativeness of individual cities and test the transferability of perceptual models of the key hydrological processes in urban areas this will only be possible by embracing the full community of researchers practitioners and stakeholders working within cities including those who may not label themselves as hydrologists geographers engineers ecologists urban planners community members local and state level stakeholders these types of expertise are all needed to fully quantify critical urban hydrologic processes and to leverage this knowledge in beneficial ways that will improve the urban community urban hydrology cannot be done alone we need to work with everyone invested in the watershed to truly understand how these systems

2203,energy efficiency plays an important role in the sustainable operation of the world s largest water transfer project i e china s south to north water transfer project by reducing its energy related operating costs however effective energy saving measures are still under development for the project due to its huge scale and complexity an optimized operational model was established in this study to reduce the energy use of the eastern route of the south to north water transfer project by optimally scheduling the water pumping process of the different pumps along the transfer route in the context of hydrological variability the optimized operational rules and recommended operational parameters were obtained the results show that the proposed operational rules in the form of piecewise functions can reduce the water pumping of the project thus providing a basis for reducing energy consumption the energy use of the project s water pumping could also be reduced in the wet years by using the local water in midstream lakes along the transfer route rather than the pumped water from the yangtze river at the southern terminus of the route in addition it was also found that the initial water storage of the lakes along the southern part of the route has a greater impact on the volume of the water pumping raising the water levels of these southern lakes using local runoff at the beginning of a year would help reduce the subsequent water pumping from the yangtze river and the relative energy use of the project in addition the key areas for energy saving along the eastern route of the south north water transfer project were identified providing new insights for understanding the water energy nexus behaviors of a long distance water transfer project keywords

currently 3 6 billion people roughly half of the world s population living in water deficient regions that face intensive competition between human water uses and ecological flows cosgrove and loucks 2015 haddeland et al 2014 su and chen 2021 in these regions increasing the water supply to human sectors directly reduces the water availability for ecological systems causing ecological degradation such as vegetation degradation as a result of groundwater depletion long et al 2020 yin et al 2022 and fish extinction due to insufficient environmental flows capon et al 2018 meng et al 2019 although water saving is considered to be the primary measure to reduce the water demand of human sectors and thus increase the ecological water supplies zhang et al 2014 the effects of demand management approaches are limited due to the increasing population and people s increasing requirements for affluent lives with fewer natural resource constraints especially in developing countries in addition to water demand management a water transfer project diverting water from water rich areas to water deficient areas is regarded as an effective engineering measure for improving the water security of water receiving areas through water supply augmentation liu et al 2020 rollason et al 2022 sinha et al 2020 globally there are numerous water transfer projects including several famous projects e g the california water transfer project in the united states the quebec water transfer project in canada the snowy mountains scheme in australia and china s south north water transfer project grigg 2021 guan et al 2011 hanson et al 2007 zhao et al 2017 all of these projects deliver the water through a series of infrastructure including channels sluices pipelines and pumps dadmand et al 2020 lei et al 2021 generally in developed countries such as the u s these projects have adopted high quality but relatively expensive pipes for water transfer to reduce water losses while open channels are used in china where a large amount of water needs to be transferred at a relatively low cost these water transfer projects connect watersheds or regions that were previously hydraulically separated in a hard engineering manner and thus create new water and energy flows among the regions these water transfer projects have inherent environmental impacts jiao et al 2021 sheng and tang 2021 in addition these impacts increase as the scale of the project increases because more catchments are connected and more water is transferred shumilova et al 2018 as the largest water transfer project in the world china s south north water transfer project snwtp is of great concern globally in terms of its ecological impacts and sustainability yan and chen 2013 zhang 2007 zhang et al 2009 the snwtp supplies surface water to northern china which is facing severe water shortages and over exploitation of groundwater four major catchments the yangtze river the yellow river the huaihe river and the haihe river are linked by the project from south to north when completed this project will require the construction of three diversion routes i e the eastern middle and western routes currently the eastern and middle routes have been constructed and had accumulatively supplied more than 46 billion cubic meters of water to northern china as of 2021 benefiting more than 140 million people over the past decades plenty of efforts have been made to evaluate the snwtp s impacts on both human society and ecological systems including its effectiveness in reducing water shortages and restoring the groundwater aquifers in the water receiving areas ouyang et al 2020 sun et al 2021 yin et al 2020 the reduction of the water availability in the water donor areas chang et al 2011 zhou et al 2017 and the changes in the regional climate water quality and aquatic ecosystems caused by connecting catchments with diverse biochemical characteristics chen and xie 2010 yan et al 2012 yi et al 2017 zhuang 2016 as well as the failure risks of the various parts of the infrastructure of the project gu et al 2012 wang et al 2022 a major topic of the above studies is whether the snwtp does more harm than good or vice versa however there are no definitive conclusions due to the complexity of the project in addition the methodologies of these studies were relatively simplified since they only considered the snwtp as a whole entity when exploring the relationship between the project s impacts and the attributions barnett et al 2015 for example the energy consumption of the eastern route of the snwtp was assessed using a linear function of the transferred water volume and the average hydraulic heads of the pump stations rather than using the actual hydraulic conditions of each pump due to a lack of detailed data chen et al 2019 these studies provide valuable information for resolving the debate regarding the necessity of the snwtp and they provide meaningful references for reviewing other water diversion projects around the world however the detailed analysis of how the snwtp s performance is influenced by its internal components and inner dynamic processes is limited this leads to insufficient solutions for reducing the negative impacts of the project by adjusting its internal structures or tuning its operations thus studies have shed light on the optimal operation of the snwtp to improve its efficiency li et al 2017 ma et al 2016 yang et al 2021 or reduce the negative impacts li et al 2021 peng et al 2021 wei et al 2010 zhou et al 2017 however one of the key issues that remain underexplored is the energy cost of the project s operation the high operational expenditure caused by pumping the water is one of the most challenging problems influencing the benefits of the snwtp the electricity consumption of the pumps is not only related to the total water volume transported by the project but also by the locations of the pumps the timing of the pumping and the duration and the water head of each pump anilkumar et al 2017 bhayo et al 2020 detailed studies are required to reduce the power uses of the project by considering the operations of the pumps given the above issues in this study a model for the optimal operation of the eastern route of the snwtp was established to reduce its energy consumption in the context of hydrological variability this model can identify the operational rules of the project contributing to the reduction of the water pumping of the project for the first time this paper reveals how the electricity was consumed by the pumps along parallel water transfer canals with multiple water sources from both the yangtze river and the midstream catchments of the eastern route of the snwtp under changing hydrological conditions the findings of this study are applicable for developing more adaptive strategies for improving the energy efficiency of the eastern route of the snwtp and similar long distance water transfer projects globally the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 and 3 introduce methods and the data respectively sections 4 and 5 present the results and discussion respectively and section 6 presents the conclusions 2 methodology 2 1 methodological framework the methodological framework comprising of three steps is shown in fig 1 these steps were used to determine the optimized operational strategies for the water transfer project in the context of hydrological uncertainty first a set of operational rules for pumping releasing and supplying water at the pumps lakes and canals respectively were defined to calculate how much water could be pumped from the yangtze river to the midstream lakes along the project s eastern route and how much water could be supplied from the lakes to users under a given set of hydrological conditions second a multi objective optimization model was established by simulating the water balance between the pumping stations lakes and canal networks using the abovementioned operational rules the vector evaluated genetic algorithm vega was used to determine the optimal parameters of the rules that could maximize the water supply and minimize the water pumping third a set of optimized operational rules were obtained by running the model repeatedly using different synthetic inflows of lakes as the model inputs each time the inflows of the lakes were generated via stochastic simulations based on historical data the optimized operational rules represent how the system can behave efficiently in terms of reducing the water pumping and the relative energy costs under various possible hydrological conditions thus these rules are valuable for broader applications in actual situations with uncertain hydrological conditions 2 2 operational rules of the water transfer project operational rules are generally applied in reservoir operations worldwide connaughton et al 2014 zhao et al 2011 when implementing these rules the storage capacity of a reservoir is divided into several zones in terms of the water levels water is supplied from a reservoir through an alternative release strategy according to which zone the water storage of the reservoir falls within an operational rule can be expressed as a set of mathematical functions with water storage as the input and water supplies or releases as the output in addition these functions vary across different zones of the reservoir s storage capacity one issue in determining the optimal operational rules is how to identify the proper functions that can lead to efficient water supply from the reservoir under hydrological uncertainty this is a scientific question that numerous previous studies have attempted to address mateus and tullos 2017 based on the above research in this study an advanced method of optimizing the parameters of the operational functions to achieve energy efficiency of the eastern route of the snwtp was established different from the current reservoir operations the water pumping process from the water donation areas to the midstream lakes along the transfer route was modeled in this study both the pumped water from the yangtze river and the inflows from local catchments were counted as the water inflows of the midstream lakes when applying the operational rules this scheme is shown in fig 2 to involve the water pumping process in the functions of the operational rules two assumptions were introduced in this study first it was assumed that there was a negative relationship between the water pumping and the water storage of the lake if there was insufficient water stored in the lake the pumping stations beside the lake were turned on on the contrary the pumps were turned off if the water storage of the target lake reached a relatively high level second it was assumed that the water supplies from the midstream lakes were also determined by water storage users water demands could be fully satisfied by supplies from these lakes if the lakes water storage was in the zone with a relatively high level the water supplies were reduced if there was insufficient water in the lake water would be released out of the lake for flood control when the storage was close to the lake s storage capacity in the flood season four storage capacity zones were defined for each lake using three water level lines namely the upper median and lower lines fig 3 given these hypotheses a set of piecewise functions were defined in this study to model the operational rules of the water transfer project for water pumping water supply and flood release equations 1 3 the optimal parameters of these functions were obtained by repeatedly modifying and updating the parameters in the direction that simultaneously contributed to increasing the water supplies and reducing the water pumping until the model objectives were satisfied vega scahffer 1985 was used to optimize the parameters of the operational rules the optimization process began by randomly generating a population of initialized parameters between 0 and 1 the fitness of this population was then evaluated and recorded by calculating the model objectives equations 4 and 5 the elite populations that significantly contributed to the model objectives were reserved and copied to the next generation the rest of the populations were modified through crossover and mutation and were then transferred to the new generation finally a set of parameters that could efficiently map the pareto frontiers of the model objectives was obtained after a given number of repeated and updated generations 2 2 1 operational rule for pumping water the operational rule for pumping water is expressed as follows 1 p i t 0 l i t l i upper α i low p i max l i

in this study to generate hydrological scenarios consisting of various inflows to the lakes monte carlo simulation has been used in numerous previous studies to deal with the hydrological uncertainty in reservoir operations laloy et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 it generally solves probabilistic problems by applying random sampling and statistical modeling to mimic the probabilistic behaviors of a complex system sadegh and vrugt 2014 in this study 100 groups of random inflows were generated and then applied one by one as the input scenario of the optimization model for each scenario a set of operational functions were obtained using the optimization algorithm described above as a result 100 sets of optimized functions were obtained which represented the possible strategies for determining how the water could be transferred efficiently in the context of hydrological variability the inflows were generated using the kirsch nowak streamflow generator which is an open source streamflow generator for generating correlated synthetic daily streamflow time series at multiple sites under stationary hydrology in this study the monthly flows were generated using cholesky decomposition kirsch et al 2013 and then these monthly flows were disaggregated to a daily time step from a randomly selected historical month nowak et al 2010 this method has been applied in previous studies to achieve random streamflow generation quinn et al 2017 zatarain salazar et al 2017 3 material and methods 3 1 study area the eastern route of the snwtp in china was adopted as the study area the project supplies approximately 3 6 billion m3 of water to its riparian provinces namely jiangsu shandong and anhui provinces for regular use every year it also reserves 183 million m3 of water for emergency use in hebei province and tianjin city which are located to the north of the current terminus of the project water is transferred from the yangtze river to northern china across 1467 km in this process the water is first lifted 65 m through pumping stations on 13 cascades from the lower reaches of the yangtze river to dongping lake in shandong province which is the highest spot along the transfer route after this the water flows under the force of gravity to the north and the east through two branched lines the one to the north crosses the yellow river via an underground tunnel and then delivers the water to the datun reservoir in the northern part of shandong province this line is also responsible for supplying water to hebei province and tianjin city when they experience droughts the other line to the east supplies water to the eastern part of shandong province by delivering water to the minshan reservoir in weihai city these water transfer pathways and the distribution of pumping stations are shown in fig 4 approximately 0 13 billion kwh of electricity is used each year this electricity consumption comprises a major part of the operation s expenditure and is eventually paid for by the individual water users this reduces the sustainability of the project not only because of its negative environmental impacts e g increasing carbon emissions but also due to the unbearable water charges to the users to cover the operational cost of the project the pumping stations along the eastern route are located along two parallel canals as shown in the fig 5 one is the beijing hangzhou grand canal built about 2000 years ago by the chinese people and the other one is composed of several connected modern channels beside the beijing hangzhou grand canal this structure provides the project with the potential to deliver water via alternative canals on a flexible schedule the amount of water transferred from the yangtze river could be reduced at times by either terminating the pumping along one canal or decreasing the number of pumps in operation on both canals if there are sufficient lateral inflows to the canals to meet the water demand of the users the pumping stations located along these distinct parallel canals can be used alternately in the context of the hydrological variability along the transfer route therefore it is justifiable that there would be a potential subset of all of the pumping stations in operation which would consume the minimum amount of electricity needed to pump sufficient water from the yangzi river 3 2 lists of variables parameters and data in this study the consumptive water demand of 16 bulk water users was adopted the water demand of a bulk water user was calculated by summing the scattered water demand between two cascades of pumping stations using the data in the feasibility report on the first stage of the east route of the snwt table 1 the locations of these users are shown in fig 2 the details of the pumping stations are presented in table 2 the water losses along the transfer route include the water evaporated and leaked from the channels and lakes on the project as well as the water losses in the navigation lock for the shipping operation the water loss of each section is shown in table 3 the upper median and lower lines of the lakes as shown in fig 3 were set up basing on the current operational policies used in the sntwp these lines remained constant across different years details are given in table 4 parameters used in vega are shown in table 5 3 3 synthetic inflows to the lakes along the eastern route of the snwtp fig 6 shows the distributions of the historical and synthetic monthly inflows to the lakes from 1962 to 2018 in the form of boxplots the range of the synthetic inflows in each month was close to that of the historical values indicating that the generated values were statistically reasonable based on their ability to simulate the variations in the historical inflows moreover the patterns of the inflow changes were similar among the five lakes that is the inflows increased after april and reached peaks in the flood season during july and august in addition hongze lake the first lake along the south to north transfer route has the largest amount of inflow while dongping lake at the northern end of the route has the smallest inflow 3 4 non inferior solutions of the optimization model fig 7 shows the solutions of the model obtained using 100 groups of synthetic inflows the value of the first objective is represented by the x axis which shows the water supplies from the water transfer project the value of the second objective is represented by the y axis which shows the water pumped by the project each blue dot in the figure represents the result of one intermediate generation in the optimization process obtained using the vega each red dot represents the result of the last generation where the optimization process ended each red dot can be deemed to be a relatively optimal result of the model objectives under a given set of lake inflows it was found that the red dots in the figure were plotted in two groups namely group a and group b the dots in group a tended to maximize the water supplies from the water transfer project while the dots in group b tended to minimize the water pumped and thus reduced the energy cost of the project a set of operational rules and relative parameters that resulted in the objective values of each red dot were calculated as a potential operational strategy for the water transfer project furthermore a recommended set of operational rules to maximize the water supplies was obtained by averaging all of the sets of operational parameters corresponding to the red dots in group a similarly a recommend set of operational rules to reduce water pumping was obtained based on the operational parameters of the red dots in group b the values of the recommended parameters are presented in table 6 3 5 modeled water supplies and water pumping using recommended operational rules the water supplies and water pumping of the project under 100 sets of synthetic inflows using the operational parameters in table 3 are shown in fig 8 the volumes of the water supplied and pumped calculated using the operational parameters for group a were larger than those calculated using the operational parameters for group b to satisfy the water demand as much as possible on the contrary the distribution of the water pumping volume was narrower and the value was smaller when using the operational parameters for group b this means that the model can adjust the water pumping to a relatively smaller range by applying the optimized operational rules for group b under changing hydrological conditions thereby reducing the energy consumption fig 9 shows the water pumping volume of each pumping station under 100 sets of synthetic inflows to the midstream lakes as is shown in fig 9 the water pumping volume from the stations that are on the southern section of the transfer route i e p1 2 p1 1 p22 p21 p32 and p31 had a larger variability than the pumping stations on the northern section of the project i e p13 p12 and p11 the hydrological uncertainty had a greater impact on the pumping stations in the water donation area of the transfer project that is to provide stable water supplies to the users these pumping stations dealt with the hydrological uncertainty by continuously adjusting the amount of water pumped into the midstream lakes as the lakes inflows changed the pumping volume of the northern pumping stations i e p11 p12 and p13 was relatively stable across the various sets of hydrological conditions this is because the designed pumping capacities of these pumping stations are smaller than those of the southern pumping stations the pumping stations in the south have to be capable of supplying water to all of the users along the transfer route by pumping water from the yangzi river if there is insufficient water stored in the midstream lakes in the dry seasons however the northern pumping stations only need to supply water to local users by either using the water transferred from the yangzi river or the water from nearby lakes therefore the northern pumping stations are relatively less affected by the hydrological variability fig 10 shows the ratio of the water supply to the water demand namely the water supply demand ratio of the user in this study the distribution of the users water supply demand ratios under 100 sets of synthetic inflows is depicted in the form of box violin plots the water demand of the users i e d1 d2 d3 and d4 was completely satisfied because these users are located at the southernmost end of the water transfer route they can directly pump water from the yangtze river without being affected by the changes in the inflows of the midstream lakes the water supply demand ratios calculated using the model and the operational parameters for group b fig 10 b which tend to minimize the energy cost were relatively lower than those calculated using the operational parameters for group a fig 10 a under the energy saving preference fig 10 b the supply demand ratios of the users i e d9 d11 and dh3 at the middle and end sections of the water transfer route varied significantly as the inflows changed this is because the water supplies to the users in the middle section of the transfer route relied on the water in the midstream lakes the inflows and water storage of these lakes decreased during droughts reducing the water available for the users depending on these lakes in addition the limited water in the lakes had to be pumped out and transferred to the north to provide supplies to the terminal users all of these factors caused water shortages for the midstream users during droughts that is the water supplies to the users in the middle section of the transfer route were more vulnerable under hydrological variability the average volume of water pumping calculated by the recommended operation rules for group a and group b under 100 sets of synthetic inflows was compared with the volume under the current policy details are shown in table 7 the average water pumping volumes calculated by the rules for group a and b under various synthetic inflows were lower than that of existing policies it means that the recommended operation rules in this study have a potential of a range from 2 to 34 in reducing the energy cost of snwtp besides the reduction of the carbon emission was calculated following the method by dan et al 2019 under the three scenarios including the recommended operation rule for group a the recommended operation rule for group b and the current polices application of the operation rules for group a can reduce 0 076 mtco2e of carbon emission while for group b the reduction can be up to 0 87 mtco2e 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of initial water storage of midstream lakes along the water transfer route as previously mentioned the midstream lakes on the eastern route of the snwtp have significant impacts on the water pumping and supplies of the project these lakes enable a relatively stable water supply to be delivered to the users by storing the pumped water from the yangtze river and the lateral inflows from the local catchments fig 11 shows the changes in the water storage of the lakes under three initial storage scenarios initial water storage of 100 70 and 50 were used as model inputs that is each lake was at 100 70 and 50 of its capacity at the start of the modeling respectively the values of the operational parameters in table 3 were used in the modeling fig 11 a and 11 b illustrate the changes in the storage under the operations to maximize water supplies group a in table 3 and the operations with the goal of energy usage reduction group b in table 3 respectively in fig 11 the black lines represent the changes in the maximum and minimum storage limits in a year the maximum storage limits of the lakes were reduced in the wet season from june to september to empty the lakes for flood regulation in contrast the maximum storage limits were increased in the dry season between october and may to store more water for supply to users as is shown in fig 11 the lakes water storage varied between the maximum and minimum limits indicating that the operational rules equations 1 3 and recommended parameters table 3 are effective in limiting the lakes storage in the given zones by regulating the water pumping and supplies from the lakes in the dry season the water storage decreased due to the water supplies obtained from the lakes however in the wet season the water storage remained at relatively high levels because there was plenty of local runoff into the lakes that could be used to satisfy the water supplies in this case the energy used for pumping water could be reduced by using the local water rather than transferring water from the yangtze river far away in the south this finding is consistent with previous studies which reported that the optimal scheduling of multiple water sources played an important role in reducing the energy use of the eastern route of the snwtp wen et al 2022 in addition a lower level of initial storage had a greater impact on the northern lakes namely dongping lake shangji lake and xiaji lake than the southern lakes namely luoma lake and hongze lake this is because the local runoff into the northern lakes was smaller than the local runoff into the southern lakes due to the dryer climate in northern china it was found that the intra annual regulations on the northern lakes were more sensitive to the initial water storage at the beginning of the year fig 12 shows the volume of pumped water calculated using the initial storage of the lakes mentioned above and the operational parameters in table 3 the labels on the x axis of fig 12 represent the five sections delineated along the transfer project from south to north fig 2 the volume of pumped water in each section increased as the lakes initial storage decreased this is because more water had to be pumped to the midstream lakes from the yangtze river to ensure the water supplies to the northern users if there was less water in the lakes at the beginning of the year which would increase the energy consumption of the transfer project in addition the increases in the water pumping in the southern sections i e s1 s2 and s3 were more significant than those in the northern sections i e s4 and s5 when the lakes initial storage was reduced this further demonstrates that the pumping stations in the southern sections of the transfer route would consume more energy when the hydrological conditions changed that is raising the water levels and storing more water in the southern lakes at the beginning of the year would help to reduce the water pumping and energy consumption this finding which is consistent with those of previous studies li et al 2020 is valuable for increasing the energy efficiency of the project s operation 4 2 impacts of hydrological variability on the water transfer as an additional water source for the eastern route of the snwtp local inflows to the midstream lakes played an important role in enhancing the energy reduction of the project to highlight the impact of the variations in these inflows on the energy consumption of the project two hydrological scenarios in which all the midstream lakes experienced floods or droughts are discussed fig 13 shows the water pumping in the wet p 25 normal p 50 and dry p 75 hydrological years the annual volume of the water pumping in each section with the goal of energy reduction parameters for group b in table 3 was smaller than that with the goal of water supply group a moreover the volume of water pumping in the wet and normal years was smaller than that in the dry year this is because more water demands of riparian users could be supplied by the inflows of the lakes in the wet or normal year with less water pumped from the yangtze river comparing with the dry year in contrast to the water pumpings north of the hongze lake s2 s6 the amount of water pumped from the yangtze river the water pumped in the section s1 was more strongly influenced by the hydrological variability this can be seen from the details shown in fig 13 for group a the water pumping volume of the s1 in the dry year was 5 5 times that of normal water years and 5 6 times that of wet years for group b water pumping volume of s1 in the dry year was 3 6 times that in normal and wet years it indicates that the water from the yangtze river significantly guarantees the water supplies to the north regions in the dry year for s2 s6 hydrological variability has relatively less impact on the water pumpings in the areas regardless of group a or group b the amount of water pumped in the dry year in those sections is no more than 1 2 times that of the normal year or the wet year besides the operational preferences of the water transfer project affected different regions differently for example in the normal year from s1 to s5 the pumping volume of group a in each section is 1 02 1 20 1 35 1 53 and 1 69 times that of group b respectively the further north the more the operational preference played a major role in reducing the energy consumption of pumping in the section the water pumping along the eastern route of the snwtp and its energy cost were influenced by the climatic variability of the midstream catchments and lakes therefore the water price of the project which was used to cover the energy cost could float as the climatic conditions changed the water price could be reduced to some extent when there was less water pumping in a wet year the reduced water price could benefit the water users by reducing their water charges 4 3 water price of the transfer project referring to the water charges of the eastern route there are two concepts namely the water price and the water fee the water price is the rate that the water users should pay for using the water supplied by the project the water fee is the total amount charged in a year the water price consists of two parts namely the basic water price and the metered price the basic water price pays for the loan and interest for the project s construction and the basic expenses related to maintaining the project minimum costs of maintaining the infrastructure when the project is not running the metered price is calculated based on the costs of pumping water from the yangtze river the water users should pay a higher metered price if they are located farther from the yangtze river the current water prices along the eastern route are shown in table 8 in which the basic and metered water prices remain unchanged from year to year even though the hydrological conditions change according to table 4 users need to pay the basic and metered water fees every year the water fees are calculated using equations 8 and 9 8 basic w a t e r f e e p e r y e a r b a s i c w a t e r p r i c e p l a n n e d v o l u m e o f w a t e r u s e i n t h e y e a r 9 metered w a t e r f e e p e r y e a r m e t e r e d w a t e r p r i c e a c t u a l v o l u m e o f w a t e r u s e i n t h e y e a r however one problem with this water pricing system is that the metered water price for a user is estimated based on the cost of transferring water from the yangtze river even if the user uses local water from the midstream lakes some of the time for example the metered water price for section 6 which is located farthest from the yangtze river is up to 1 65 yuan per cubic meter this is quite a bit higher than the price for the users in sections 1 3 which are closest to the yangtze river however the water users could use local water from their nearby lakes in the wet years rather than the water transferred from the yangtze river in this case the user is overcharged when the current fixed metered water price is used this is an issue with the eastern route of the snwtp that is the fixed and relatively high metered water prices are affecting the sustainability of the project by inhibiting the users from using the water from the snwtp in order to compare the energy cost under various inflow conditions the total water pumping using the operational parameters for group a and b under the 100 sets of lake inflows was represented in fig 14 it can be seen that a great potential of energy reduction exists when the inflow increases in addition the red line and the bule line were fitted to explicitly demonstrate the change of water pumping in the context of hydrological variability this means a more flexible system of water pricing is required and it should consider the changes in the water volume actually transferred from the yangtze river under the hydrological variability 5 limitations the discussions of the impacts of the hydrological variability presented in this paper only considered two climatic scenarios in which all of the lakes were simultaneously experiencing floods or droughts however the five lakes along the eastern route are located in different catchments including the yangtze river basin the haihe river basin and the yellow river basin which cover both northern and southern china and a distance of more than 1400 km the different climatic and hydrological characteristics of these catchments lead to variations in the flood and drought conditions of the lakes in a given year for example there was a drought in the hongze lake region in the southern part of the project in 2020 while the dongping lake region in the north was experiencing flooding further research is required to understand the operational behaviors of the project when the midstream lakes experience different climatic events in a year in addition the energy consumption of the project was represented by the volume of water pumped instead of the actual electricity use the electricity consumption is influenced by additional parameters such as the water levels of the channels and the power unit of each pumping station hydraulic simulations of the channels need to be conducted to achieve more accurate calculations of the water heads and electricity uses of the pumps this is suggested to be conducted for future studies 6 conclusions the water pumping behaviors of the eastern route of the snwtp china in the context of hydrological variability were determined by optimizing the operational process of the project under the goal of energy reduction a model for the optimal operation of the water pumping and water supply using a set of operational rules in the form of piecewise functions was established in this study the recommended values of the parameters in these rules under the hydrological uncertainty were obtained through multi objective optimizations and monte carlo simulations the proposed model and rules are practical for enhancing the energy reduction of the eastern route of the snwtp by shedding light on the water energy nexus behaviors of this long distance water transfer project based on the findings of this study we suggest the following strategies for energy efficient operation of the project 1 the water pumped along the eastern route could be reduced by optimizing the scheduling of the water transfer from multiple water sources by alternating pumping along parallel transfer canals and the usage of the water storage of the midstream lakes this could be an effective measure to reduce the energy use of the project by reducing the pumping from the yangtze river and using the local inflows of the midstream lakes as water supplies in wet years 2 reducing the variations in the pumping volumes of the pumps in the southern sections of the transfer route is more conducive to increasing the energy efficiency of the entire project because the southern pumps are more affected by hydrological variability 3 increasing the water levels of the southern lakes using the local runoff at the beginning of a year would help reduce the subsequent water pumping from the yangtze river and the relative energy use of the project in addition a more flexible water pricing system is required to adjust the water charges to the users according to the changes in the water volume pumped from the yangtze river if local water from the midstream lakes is used adjustable water prices are beneficial to increasing the sustainability of the eastern route of the snwtp in the

2203,energy efficiency plays an important role in the sustainable operation of the world s largest water transfer project i e china s south to north water transfer project by reducing its energy related operating costs however effective energy saving measures are still under development for the project due to its huge scale and complexity an optimized operational model was established in this study to reduce the energy use of the eastern route of the south to north water transfer project by optimally scheduling the water pumping process of the different pumps along the transfer route in the context of hydrological variability the optimized operational rules and recommended operational parameters were obtained the results show that the proposed operational rules in the form of piecewise functions can reduce the water pumping of the project thus providing a basis for reducing energy consumption the energy use of the project s water pumping could also be reduced in the wet years by using the local water in midstream lakes along the transfer route rather than the pumped water from the yangtze river at the southern terminus of the route in addition it was also found that the initial water storage of the lakes along the southern part of the route has a greater impact on the volume of the water pumping raising the water levels of these southern lakes using local runoff at the beginning of a year would help reduce the subsequent water pumping from the yangtze river and the relative energy use of the project in addition the key areas for energy saving along the eastern route of the south north water transfer project were identified providing new insights for understanding the water energy nexus behaviors of a long distance water transfer project keywords

arid regions in the context of climate change and population growth is an ongoing challenge in water resource management worldwide kummu et al 2016 oki and kanae 2006 stringer et al 2021 there are currently 3 6 billion people roughly half of the world s population living in water deficient regions that face intensive competition between human water uses and ecological flows cosgrove and loucks 2015 haddeland et al 2014 su and chen 2021 in these regions increasing the water supply to human sectors directly reduces the water availability for ecological systems causing ecological degradation such as vegetation degradation as a result of groundwater depletion long et al 2020 yin et al 2022 and fish extinction due to insufficient environmental flows capon et al 2018 meng et al 2019 although water saving is considered to be the primary measure to reduce the water demand of human sectors and thus increase the ecological water supplies zhang et al 2014 the effects of demand management approaches are limited due to the increasing population and people s increasing requirements for affluent lives with fewer natural resource constraints especially in developing countries in addition to water demand management a water transfer project diverting water from water rich areas to water deficient areas is regarded as an effective engineering measure for improving the water security of water receiving areas through water supply augmentation liu et al 2020 rollason et al 2022 sinha et al 2020 globally there are numerous water transfer projects including several famous projects e g the california water transfer project in the united states the quebec water transfer project in canada the snowy mountains scheme in australia and china s south north water transfer project grigg 2021 guan et al 2011 hanson et al 2007 zhao et al 2017 all of these projects deliver the water through a series of infrastructure including channels sluices pipelines and pumps dadmand et al 2020 lei et al 2021 generally in developed countries such as the u s these projects have adopted high quality but relatively expensive pipes for water transfer to reduce water losses while open channels are used in china where a large amount of water needs to be transferred at a relatively low cost these water transfer projects connect watersheds or regions that were previously hydraulically separated in a hard engineering manner and thus create new water and energy flows among the regions these water transfer projects have inherent environmental impacts jiao et al 2021 sheng and tang 2021 in addition these impacts increase as the scale of the project increases because more catchments are connected and more water is transferred shumilova et al 2018 as the largest water transfer project in the world china s south north water transfer project snwtp is of great concern globally in terms of its ecological impacts and sustainability yan and chen 2013 zhang 2007 zhang et al 2009 the snwtp supplies surface water to northern china which is facing severe water shortages and over exploitation of groundwater four major catchments the yangtze river the yellow river the huaihe river and the haihe river are linked by the project from south to north when completed this project will require the construction of three diversion routes i e the eastern middle and western routes currently the eastern and middle routes have been constructed and had accumulatively supplied more than 46 billion cubic meters of water to northern china as of 2021 benefiting more than 140 million people over the past decades plenty of efforts have been made to evaluate the snwtp s impacts on both human society and ecological systems including its effectiveness in reducing water shortages and restoring the groundwater aquifers in the water receiving areas ouyang et al 2020 sun et al 2021 yin et al 2020 the reduction of the water availability in the water donor areas chang et al 2011 zhou et al 2017 and the changes in the regional climate water quality and aquatic ecosystems caused by connecting catchments with diverse biochemical characteristics chen and xie 2010 yan et al 2012 yi et al 2017 zhuang 2016 as well as the failure risks of the various parts of the infrastructure of the project gu et al 2012 wang et al 2022 a major topic of the above studies is whether the snwtp does more harm than good or vice versa however there are no definitive conclusions due to the complexity of the project in addition the methodologies of these studies were relatively simplified since they only considered the snwtp as a whole entity when exploring the relationship between the project s impacts and the attributions barnett et al 2015 for example the energy consumption of the eastern route of the snwtp was assessed using a linear function of the transferred water volume and the average hydraulic heads of the pump stations rather than using the actual hydraulic conditions of each pump due to a lack of detailed data chen et al 2019 these studies provide valuable information for resolving the debate regarding the necessity of the snwtp and they provide meaningful references for reviewing other water diversion projects around the world however the detailed analysis of how the snwtp s performance is influenced by its internal components and inner dynamic processes is limited this leads to insufficient solutions for reducing the negative impacts of the project by adjusting its internal structures or tuning its operations thus studies have shed light on the optimal operation of the snwtp to improve its efficiency li et al 2017 ma et al 2016 yang et al 2021 or reduce the negative impacts li et al 2021 peng et al 2021 wei et al 2010 zhou et al 2017 however one of the key issues that remain underexplored is the energy cost of the project s operation the high operational expenditure caused by pumping the water is one of the most challenging problems influencing the benefits of the snwtp the electricity consumption of the pumps is not only related to the total water volume transported by the project but also by the locations of the pumps the timing of the pumping and the duration and the water head of each pump anilkumar et al 2017 bhayo et al 2020 detailed studies are required to reduce the power uses of the project by considering the operations of the pumps given the above issues in this study a model for the optimal operation of the eastern route of the snwtp was established to reduce its energy consumption in the context of hydrological variability this model can identify the operational rules of the project contributing to the reduction of the water pumping of the project for the first time this paper reveals how the electricity was consumed by the pumps along parallel water transfer canals with multiple water sources from both the yangtze river and the midstream catchments of the eastern route of the snwtp under changing hydrological conditions the findings of this study are applicable for developing more adaptive strategies for improving the energy efficiency of the eastern route of the snwtp and similar long distance water transfer projects globally the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 and 3 introduce methods and the data respectively sections 4 and 5 present the results and discussion respectively and section 6 presents the conclusions 2 methodology 2 1 methodological framework the methodological framework comprising of three steps is shown in fig 1 these steps were used to determine the optimized operational strategies for the water transfer project in the context of hydrological uncertainty first a set of operational rules for pumping releasing and supplying water at the pumps lakes and canals respectively were defined to calculate how much water could be pumped from the yangtze river to the midstream lakes along the project s eastern route and how much water could be supplied from the lakes to users under a given set of hydrological conditions second a multi objective optimization model was established by simulating the water balance between the pumping stations lakes and canal networks using the abovementioned operational rules the vector evaluated genetic algorithm vega was used to determine the optimal parameters of the rules that could maximize the water supply and minimize the water pumping third a set of optimized operational rules were obtained by running the model repeatedly using different synthetic inflows of lakes as the model inputs each time the inflows of the lakes were generated via stochastic simulations based on historical data the optimized operational rules represent how the system can behave efficiently in terms of reducing the water pumping and the relative energy costs under various possible hydrological conditions thus these rules are valuable for broader applications in actual situations with uncertain hydrological conditions 2 2 operational rules of the water transfer project operational rules are generally applied in reservoir operations worldwide connaughton et al 2014 zhao et al 2011 when implementing these rules the storage capacity of a reservoir is divided into several zones in terms of the water levels water is supplied from a reservoir through an alternative release strategy according to which zone the water storage of the reservoir falls within an operational rule can be expressed as a set of mathematical functions with water storage as the input and water supplies or releases as the output in addition these functions vary across different zones of the reservoir s storage capacity one issue in determining the optimal operational rules is how to identify the proper functions that can lead to efficient water supply from the reservoir under hydrological uncertainty this is a scientific question that numerous previous studies have attempted to address mateus and tullos 2017 based on the above research in this study an advanced method of optimizing the parameters of the operational functions to achieve energy efficiency of the eastern route of the snwtp was established different from the current reservoir operations the water pumping process from the water donation areas to the midstream lakes along the transfer route was modeled in this study both the pumped water from the yangtze river and the inflows from local catchments were counted as the water inflows of the midstream lakes when applying the operational rules this scheme is shown in fig 2 to involve the water pumping process in the functions of the operational rules two assumptions were introduced in this study first it was assumed that there was a negative relationship between the water pumping and the water storage of the lake if there was insufficient water stored in the lake the pumping stations beside the lake were turned on on the contrary the pumps were turned off if the water storage of the target lake reached a relatively high level second it was assumed that the water supplies from the midstream lakes were also determined by water storage users water demands could be fully satisfied by supplies from these lakes if the lakes water storage was in the zone with a relatively high level the water supplies were reduced if there was insufficient water in the lake water would be released out of the lake for flood control when the storage was close to the lake s storage capacity in the flood season four storage capacity zones were defined for each lake using three water level lines namely the upper median and lower lines fig 3 given these hypotheses a set of piecewise functions were defined in this study to model the operational rules of the water transfer project for water pumping water supply and flood release equations 1 3 the optimal parameters of these functions were obtained by repeatedly modifying and updating the parameters in the direction that simultaneously contributed to increasing the water supplies and reducing the water pumping until the model objectives were satisfied vega scahffer 1985 was used to optimize the parameters of the operational rules the optimization process began by randomly generating a population of initialized parameters between 0 and 1 the fitness of this population was then evaluated and recorded by calculating the model objectives equations 4 and 5 the elite populations that significantly contributed to the model objectives were reserved and copied to the next generation the rest of the populations were modified through crossover and mutation and were then transferred to the new generation finally a set of parameters that could efficiently map the pareto frontiers of the model objectives was obtained after a given number of repeated and updated generations 2 2 1 operational rule for pumping water the operational rule for pumping water is expressed as follows 1 p i t 0 l i t l i upper α i low p i max l i

in this study to generate hydrological scenarios consisting of various inflows to the lakes monte carlo simulation has been used in numerous previous studies to deal with the hydrological uncertainty in reservoir operations laloy et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 it generally solves probabilistic problems by applying random sampling and statistical modeling to mimic the probabilistic behaviors of a complex system sadegh and vrugt 2014 in this study 100 groups of random inflows were generated and then applied one by one as the input scenario of the optimization model for each scenario a set of operational functions were obtained using the optimization algorithm described above as a result 100 sets of optimized functions were obtained which represented the possible strategies for determining how the water could be transferred efficiently in the context of hydrological variability the inflows were generated using the kirsch nowak streamflow generator which is an open source streamflow generator for generating correlated synthetic daily streamflow time series at multiple sites under stationary hydrology in this study the monthly flows were generated using cholesky decomposition kirsch et al 2013 and then these monthly flows were disaggregated to a daily time step from a randomly selected historical month nowak et al 2010 this method has been applied in previous studies to achieve random streamflow generation quinn et al 2017 zatarain salazar et al 2017 3 material and methods 3 1 study area the eastern route of the snwtp in china was adopted as the study area the project supplies approximately 3 6 billion m3 of water to its riparian provinces namely jiangsu shandong and anhui provinces for regular use every year it also reserves 183 million m3 of water for emergency use in hebei province and tianjin city which are located to the north of the current terminus of the project water is transferred from the yangtze river to northern china across 1467 km in this process the water is first lifted 65 m through pumping stations on 13 cascades from the lower reaches of the yangtze river to dongping lake in shandong province which is the highest spot along the transfer route after this the water flows under the force of gravity to the north and the east through two branched lines the one to the north crosses the yellow river via an underground tunnel and then delivers the water to the datun reservoir in the northern part of shandong province this line is also responsible for supplying water to hebei province and tianjin city when they experience droughts the other line to the east supplies water to the eastern part of shandong province by delivering water to the minshan reservoir in weihai city these water transfer pathways and the distribution of pumping stations are shown in fig 4 approximately 0 13 billion kwh of electricity is used each year this electricity consumption comprises a major part of the operation s expenditure and is eventually paid for by the individual water users this reduces the sustainability of the project not only because of its negative environmental impacts e g increasing carbon emissions but also due to the unbearable water charges to the users to cover the operational cost of the project the pumping stations along the eastern route are located along two parallel canals as shown in the fig 5 one is the beijing hangzhou grand canal built about 2000 years ago by the chinese people and the other one is composed of several connected modern channels beside the beijing hangzhou grand canal this structure provides the project with the potential to deliver water via alternative canals on a flexible schedule the amount of water transferred from the yangtze river could be reduced at times by either terminating the pumping along one canal or decreasing the number of pumps in operation on both canals if there are sufficient lateral inflows to the canals to meet the water demand of the users the pumping stations located along these distinct parallel canals can be used alternately in the context of the hydrological variability along the transfer route therefore it is justifiable that there would be a potential subset of all of the pumping stations in operation which would consume the minimum amount of electricity needed to pump sufficient water from the yangzi river 3 2 lists of variables parameters and data in this study the consumptive water demand of 16 bulk water users was adopted the water demand of a bulk water user was calculated by summing the scattered water demand between two cascades of pumping stations using the data in the feasibility report on the first stage of the east route of the snwt table 1 the locations of these users are shown in fig 2 the details of the pumping stations are presented in table 2 the water losses along the transfer route include the water evaporated and leaked from the channels and lakes on the project as well as the water losses in the navigation lock for the shipping operation the water loss of each section is shown in table 3 the upper median and lower lines of the lakes as shown in fig 3 were set up basing on the current operational policies used in the sntwp these lines remained constant across different years details are given in table 4 parameters used in vega are shown in table 5 3 3 synthetic inflows to the lakes along the eastern route of the snwtp fig 6 shows the distributions of the historical and synthetic monthly inflows to the lakes from 1962 to 2018 in the form of boxplots the range of the synthetic inflows in each month was close to that of the historical values indicating that the generated values were statistically reasonable based on their ability to simulate the variations in the historical inflows moreover the patterns of the inflow changes were similar among the five lakes that is the inflows increased after april and reached peaks in the flood season during july and august in addition hongze lake the first lake along the south to north transfer route has the largest amount of inflow while dongping lake at the northern end of the route has the smallest inflow 3 4 non inferior solutions of the optimization model fig 7 shows the solutions of the model obtained using 100 groups of synthetic inflows the value of the first objective is represented by the x axis which shows the water supplies from the water transfer project the value of the second objective is represented by the y axis which shows the water pumped by the project each blue dot in the figure represents the result of one intermediate generation in the optimization process obtained using the vega each red dot represents the result of the last generation where the optimization process ended each red dot can be deemed to be a relatively optimal result of the model objectives under a given set of lake inflows it was found that the red dots in the figure were plotted in two groups namely group a and group b the dots in group a tended to maximize the water supplies from the water transfer project while the dots in group b tended to minimize the water pumped and thus reduced the energy cost of the project a set of operational rules and relative parameters that resulted in the objective values of each red dot were calculated as a potential operational strategy for the water transfer project furthermore a recommended set of operational rules to maximize the water supplies was obtained by averaging all of the sets of operational parameters corresponding to the red dots in group a similarly a recommend set of operational rules to reduce water pumping was obtained based on the operational parameters of the red dots in group b the values of the recommended parameters are presented in table 6 3 5 modeled water supplies and water pumping using recommended operational rules the water supplies and water pumping of the project under 100 sets of synthetic inflows using the operational parameters in table 3 are shown in fig 8 the volumes of the water supplied and pumped calculated using the operational parameters for group a were larger than those calculated using the operational parameters for group b to satisfy the water demand as much as possible on the contrary the distribution of the water pumping volume was narrower and the value was smaller when using the operational parameters for group b this means that the model can adjust the water pumping to a relatively smaller range by applying the optimized operational rules for group b under changing hydrological conditions thereby reducing the energy consumption fig 9 shows the water pumping volume of each pumping station under 100 sets of synthetic inflows to the midstream lakes as is shown in fig 9 the water pumping volume from the stations that are on the southern section of the transfer route i e p1 2 p1 1 p22 p21 p32 and p31 had a larger variability than the pumping stations on the northern section of the project i e p13 p12 and p11 the hydrological uncertainty had a greater impact on the pumping stations in the water donation area of the transfer project that is to provide stable water supplies to the users these pumping stations dealt with the hydrological uncertainty by continuously adjusting the amount of water pumped into the midstream lakes as the lakes inflows changed the pumping volume of the northern pumping stations i e p11 p12 and p13 was relatively stable across the various sets of hydrological conditions this is because the designed pumping capacities of these pumping stations are smaller than those of the southern pumping stations the pumping stations in the south have to be capable of supplying water to all of the users along the transfer route by pumping water from the yangzi river if there is insufficient water stored in the midstream lakes in the dry seasons however the northern pumping stations only need to supply water to local users by either using the water transferred from the yangzi river or the water from nearby lakes therefore the northern pumping stations are relatively less affected by the hydrological variability fig 10 shows the ratio of the water supply to the water demand namely the water supply demand ratio of the user in this study the distribution of the users water supply demand ratios under 100 sets of synthetic inflows is depicted in the form of box violin plots the water demand of the users i e d1 d2 d3 and d4 was completely satisfied because these users are located at the southernmost end of the water transfer route they can directly pump water from the yangtze river without being affected by the changes in the inflows of the midstream lakes the water supply demand ratios calculated using the model and the operational parameters for group b fig 10 b which tend to minimize the energy cost were relatively lower than those calculated using the operational parameters for group a fig 10 a under the energy saving preference fig 10 b the supply demand ratios of the users i e d9 d11 and dh3 at the middle and end sections of the water transfer route varied significantly as the inflows changed this is because the water supplies to the users in the middle section of the transfer route relied on the water in the midstream lakes the inflows and water storage of these lakes decreased during droughts reducing the water available for the users depending on these lakes in addition the limited water in the lakes had to be pumped out and transferred to the north to provide supplies to the terminal users all of these factors caused water shortages for the midstream users during droughts that is the water supplies to the users in the middle section of the transfer route were more vulnerable under hydrological variability the average volume of water pumping calculated by the recommended operation rules for group a and group b under 100 sets of synthetic inflows was compared with the volume under the current policy details are shown in table 7 the average water pumping volumes calculated by the rules for group a and b under various synthetic inflows were lower than that of existing policies it means that the recommended operation rules in this study have a potential of a range from 2 to 34 in reducing the energy cost of snwtp besides the reduction of the carbon emission was calculated following the method by dan et al 2019 under the three scenarios including the recommended operation rule for group a the recommended operation rule for group b and the current polices application of the operation rules for group a can reduce 0 076 mtco2e of carbon emission while for group b the reduction can be up to 0 87 mtco2e 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of initial water storage of midstream lakes along the water transfer route as previously mentioned the midstream lakes on the eastern route of the snwtp have significant impacts on the water pumping and supplies of the project these lakes enable a relatively stable water supply to be delivered to the users by storing the pumped water from the yangtze river and the lateral inflows from the local catchments fig 11 shows the changes in the water storage of the lakes under three initial storage scenarios initial water storage of 100 70 and 50 were used as model inputs that is each lake was at 100 70 and 50 of its capacity at the start of the modeling respectively the values of the operational parameters in table 3 were used in the modeling fig 11 a and 11 b illustrate the changes in the storage under the operations to maximize water supplies group a in table 3 and the operations with the goal of energy usage reduction group b in table 3 respectively in fig 11 the black lines represent the changes in the maximum and minimum storage limits in a year the maximum storage limits of the lakes were reduced in the wet season from june to september to empty the lakes for flood regulation in contrast the maximum storage limits were increased in the dry season between october and may to store more water for supply to users as is shown in fig 11 the lakes water storage varied between the maximum and minimum limits indicating that the operational rules equations 1 3 and recommended parameters table 3 are effective in limiting the lakes storage in the given zones by regulating the water pumping and supplies from the lakes in the dry season the water storage decreased due to the water supplies obtained from the lakes however in the wet season the water storage remained at relatively high levels because there was plenty of local runoff into the lakes that could be used to satisfy the water supplies in this case the energy used for pumping water could be reduced by using the local water rather than transferring water from the yangtze river far away in the south this finding is consistent with previous studies which reported that the optimal scheduling of multiple water sources played an important role in reducing the energy use of the eastern route of the snwtp wen et al 2022 in addition a lower level of initial storage had a greater impact on the northern lakes namely dongping lake shangji lake and xiaji lake than the southern lakes namely luoma lake and hongze lake this is because the local runoff into the northern lakes was smaller than the local runoff into the southern lakes due to the dryer climate in northern china it was found that the intra annual regulations on the northern lakes were more sensitive to the initial water storage at the beginning of the year fig 12 shows the volume of pumped water calculated using the initial storage of the lakes mentioned above and the operational parameters in table 3 the labels on the x axis of fig 12 represent the five sections delineated along the transfer project from south to north fig 2 the volume of pumped water in each section increased as the lakes initial storage decreased this is because more water had to be pumped to the midstream lakes from the yangtze river to ensure the water supplies to the northern users if there was less water in the lakes at the beginning of the year which would increase the energy consumption of the transfer project in addition the increases in the water pumping in the southern sections i e s1 s2 and s3 were more significant than those in the northern sections i e s4 and s5 when the lakes initial storage was reduced this further demonstrates that the pumping stations in the southern sections of the transfer route would consume more energy when the hydrological conditions changed that is raising the water levels and storing more water in the southern lakes at the beginning of the year would help to reduce the water pumping and energy consumption this finding which is consistent with those of previous studies li et al 2020 is valuable for increasing the energy efficiency of the project s operation 4 2 impacts of hydrological variability on the water transfer as an additional water source for the eastern route of the snwtp local inflows to the midstream lakes played an important role in enhancing the energy reduction of the project to highlight the impact of the variations in these inflows on the energy consumption of the project two hydrological scenarios in which all the midstream lakes experienced floods or droughts are discussed fig 13 shows the water pumping in the wet p 25 normal p 50 and dry p 75 hydrological years the annual volume of the water pumping in each section with the goal of energy reduction parameters for group b in table 3 was smaller than that with the goal of water supply group a moreover the volume of water pumping in the wet and normal years was smaller than that in the dry year this is because more water demands of riparian users could be supplied by the inflows of the lakes in the wet or normal year with less water pumped from the yangtze river comparing with the dry year in contrast to the water pumpings north of the hongze lake s2 s6 the amount of water pumped from the yangtze river the water pumped in the section s1 was more strongly influenced by the hydrological variability this can be seen from the details shown in fig 13 for group a the water pumping volume of the s1 in the dry year was 5 5 times that of normal water years and 5 6 times that of wet years for group b water pumping volume of s1 in the dry year was 3 6 times that in normal and wet years it indicates that the water from the yangtze river significantly guarantees the water supplies to the north regions in the dry year for s2 s6 hydrological variability has relatively less impact on the water pumpings in the areas regardless of group a or group b the amount of water pumped in the dry year in those sections is no more than 1 2 times that of the normal year or the wet year besides the operational preferences of the water transfer project affected different regions differently for example in the normal year from s1 to s5 the pumping volume of group a in each section is 1 02 1 20 1 35 1 53 and 1 69 times that of group b respectively the further north the more the operational preference played a major role in reducing the energy consumption of pumping in the section the water pumping along the eastern route of the snwtp and its energy cost were influenced by the climatic variability of the midstream catchments and lakes therefore the water price of the project which was used to cover the energy cost could float as the climatic conditions changed the water price could be reduced to some extent when there was less water pumping in a wet year the reduced water price could benefit the water users by reducing their water charges 4 3 water price of the transfer project referring to the water charges of the eastern route there are two concepts namely the water price and the water fee the water price is the rate that the water users should pay for using the water supplied by the project the water fee is the total amount charged in a year the water price consists of two parts namely the basic water price and the metered price the basic water price pays for the loan and interest for the project s construction and the basic expenses related to maintaining the project minimum costs of maintaining the infrastructure when the project is not running the metered price is calculated based on the costs of pumping water from the yangtze river the water users should pay a higher metered price if they are located farther from the yangtze river the current water prices along the eastern route are shown in table 8 in which the basic and metered water prices remain unchanged from year to year even though the hydrological conditions change according to table 4 users need to pay the basic and metered water fees every year the water fees are calculated using equations 8 and 9 8 basic w a t e r f e e p e r y e a r b a s i c w a t e r p r i c e p l a n n e d v o l u m e o f w a t e r u s e i n t h e y e a r 9 metered w a t e r f e e p e r y e a r m e t e r e d w a t e r p r i c e a c t u a l v o l u m e o f w a t e r u s e i n t h e y e a r however one problem with this water pricing system is that the metered water price for a user is estimated based on the cost of transferring water from the yangtze river even if the user uses local water from the midstream lakes some of the time for example the metered water price for section 6 which is located farthest from the yangtze river is up to 1 65 yuan per cubic meter this is quite a bit higher than the price for the users in sections 1 3 which are closest to the yangtze river however the water users could use local water from their nearby lakes in the wet years rather than the water transferred from the yangtze river in this case the user is overcharged when the current fixed metered water price is used this is an issue with the eastern route of the snwtp that is the fixed and relatively high metered water prices are affecting the sustainability of the project by inhibiting the users from using the water from the snwtp in order to compare the energy cost under various inflow conditions the total water pumping using the operational parameters for group a and b under the 100 sets of lake inflows was represented in fig 14 it can be seen that a great potential of energy reduction exists when the inflow increases in addition the red line and the bule line were fitted to explicitly demonstrate the change of water pumping in the context of hydrological variability this means a more flexible system of water pricing is required and it should consider the changes in the water volume actually transferred from the yangtze river under the hydrological variability 5 limitations the discussions of the impacts of the hydrological variability presented in this paper only considered two climatic scenarios in which all of the lakes were simultaneously experiencing floods or droughts however the five lakes along the eastern route are located in different catchments including the yangtze river basin the haihe river basin and the yellow river basin which cover both northern and southern china and a distance of more than 1400 km the different climatic and hydrological characteristics of these catchments lead to variations in the flood and drought conditions of the lakes in a given year for example there was a drought in the hongze lake region in the southern part of the project in 2020 while the dongping lake region in the north was experiencing flooding further research is required to understand the operational behaviors of the project when the midstream lakes experience different climatic events in a year in addition the energy consumption of the project was represented by the volume of water pumped instead of the actual electricity use the electricity consumption is influenced by additional parameters such as the water levels of the channels and the power unit of each pumping station hydraulic simulations of the channels need to be conducted to achieve more accurate calculations of the water heads and electricity uses of the pumps this is suggested to be conducted for future studies 6 conclusions the water pumping behaviors of the eastern route of the snwtp china in the context of hydrological variability were determined by optimizing the operational process of the project under the goal of energy reduction a model for the optimal operation of the water pumping and water supply using a set of operational rules in the form of piecewise functions was established in this study the recommended values of the parameters in these rules under the hydrological uncertainty were obtained through multi objective optimizations and monte carlo simulations the proposed model and rules are practical for enhancing the energy reduction of the eastern route of the snwtp by shedding light on the water energy nexus behaviors of this long distance water transfer project based on the findings of this study we suggest the following strategies for energy efficient operation of the project 1 the water pumped along the eastern route could be reduced by optimizing the scheduling of the water transfer from multiple water sources by alternating pumping along parallel transfer canals and the usage of the water storage of the midstream lakes this could be an effective measure to reduce the energy use of the project by reducing the pumping from the yangtze river and using the local inflows of the midstream lakes as water supplies in wet years 2 reducing the variations in the pumping volumes of the pumps in the southern sections of the transfer route is more conducive to increasing the energy efficiency of the entire project because the southern pumps are more affected by hydrological variability 3 increasing the water levels of the southern lakes using the local runoff at the beginning of a year would help reduce the subsequent water pumping from the yangtze river and the relative energy use of the project in addition a more flexible water pricing system is required to adjust the water charges to the users according to the changes in the water volume pumped from the yangtze river if local water from the midstream lakes is used adjustable water prices are beneficial to increasing the sustainability of the eastern route of the snwtp in the

2204,bioretention systems have been showcased to be effective in reducing stormwater quantity and improving stormwater quality however the systems can also leach nutrients especially during their initial operation which needs to be mitigated to optimize their benefits to examine the efficiency of six amendments selected primarily for reducing phosphorus p leaching six amended and two control cells were constructed and monitored soon after their construction in the field of the 2020 growing season the effects of the amendments on both the hydrological performance in terms of water retention rate wrr and water quality performance in terms of the event mean concentration and pollutant removal rate were investigated the results showed that all amendments had the capability of preventing or mitigating p leaching from bioretention systems to varying degrees with the water treatment residual wtr outperforming all other amendments followed by the activated aluminum aa and sorptivemedia sm amendments in addition some of the amendments i e drywall dry wtr and sm were also found to be beneficial in reducing the nitrogen n leaching to a slight degree whereas eggshell egg introduced an extra source of n leached furthermore the temporal evolution of the p leaching of the amendment cells was found to be different from that of the control cells the same result was not observed for the temporal evolution of the n leaching implying that the amendments except egg did not largely affect the n leaching among the amendments effect on wrr there was no obvious difference whereas the observed differences between the control cells and some amendment cells in vegetation growth and antecedent media moisture condition might imply their potential impacts on the hydrologic performance overall other than p leaching the use of amendments affected other functions of bioretention systems which should be taken into consideration when selecting an amendment for practice keywords water retention nutrient leaching concentration removal efficiency antecedent moisture condition vegetation data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction urbanization leads to an increase of impermeable surfaces in urbanized environments consequently it alters the urban hydrological cycle reflected by increasing the flow rate and the volume of stormwater runoff decreasing infiltration and deteriorating the water quality of receiving water bodies walsh et al 2005 katsifarakis et al 2015 in the paradigm of conventional centralized stormwater management stormwater runoff has been collected and conveyed through storm sewers and discharged into end of pipe treatment facilities i e stormwater ponds or receiving water bodies centralized management systems are often accompanied with high construction cost large space requirements for water storage and the destruction of natural landscapes as a result stormwater management strategies have recently shifted from a centralized management to a decentralized management for instance implementing stormwater control measures scms aiming to improve management efficiencies and reduce cost besides scms have secondary benefits of increasing water supply restoring the pre development hydrologic regime in addition to mitigating the impact of climate change on urban stormwater runoff zahmatkesh et al 2015 among various scms bioretention systems have been showcased to be effective in reducing stormwater runoff volume and removing various pollutants including suspended solids heavy metals nutrients and many others muhammad 2016 yan et al 2018 chapman et al 2010 in the context of stormwater quality among various pollutants nutrients in particular phosphorus p are of particular interest to stormwater managers as their excessive loading could result in eutrophication of receiving water bodies the impact of p on aquatic ecosystems depends on the specific conditions of water receiving bodies and hence canada does not have a single maximum p concentration limit for surface waters to protect aquatic life the canadian council of ministters of the environment ccme 2016 and alberta government 2018 recommend that total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn concentrations should not exceed 0 05 mg l and 1 0 mg l respectively accompanied by narrative statements for lakes rivers and other water bodies in addition a water body in which tp exceeds 0 035 mg l is considered eutrophic and thus detrimental to aquatic life ccme 2004 in the u s guidelines have recommended that tp should not exceed 0 05 mg l releasing into water bodies and 0 1 mg l in flowing water to prevent eutrophication us epa 2007 as the typical tp concentration in urban stormwater runoff is often in the range of 0 42 to 2 8 mg l depending on the season and the location yang and lusk 2018 reducing p from stormwater runoff is indeed necessary to protect ecosystems bioretention systems have been shown to be effective in removing various pollutants including organic and inorganic compounds such as p from stormwater runoff li and davis 2014 on average scms remove particles larger than 20 µm in diameter and about 70 of tp and phosphate from stormwater clary et al 2020 in addition a field study by passeport et al 2009 demonstrated that bioretention systems effectively removed tp and reactive phosphate rp by reducing their inflow concentrations by 58 63 and 74 78 respectively however the existing body of knowledge has also demonstrated that bioretention systems can leach pollutants and consequently lead to increased p concentrations and or mass loadings in stormwater a number of previous studies e g hager et al 2019 mangangka et al 2014 reported that bioretention systems can remove and leach rp as its removal efficiency varies from 90 to 400 in practice it is common that nutrient enriched media have been used to construct bioretention systems to support the establishment and survival of vegetation dagenaisa et al 2018 compost has been commonly added to bioretention media to improve media aggregation and increase porosity and consequently improve the infiltration rate as well as the water retention capacity from the aspect of water quality compost is able to absorb or aid in the degradation of some pollutants such as hydrocarbons solvents and heavy metals while also reduce the use of fertilizers by improving the soil nutrient holding capacity sun et al 2020 hurley et al 2017 in contrast the decomposition of compost in bioretention media acts as an extra source of nutrients thus it is not uncommon to observe nutrient leaching from bioretention systems tirpak et al 2021 brown et al 2013 shrestha et al 2018 especially at the beginning of their operation in addition akther et al 2020 kohlsmith et al 2021 and hurley et al 2017 also indicated that the nutrient leaching is largely related to the cumulative inflow and decreases over time in particular akther et al 2020 argued that the decrease of the nutrient leaching could be ascribed to the decrease of leachable nutrients in media although nutrient leaching might decline over time preventing or mitigating nutrient leaching from bioretention systems is critical to promote the benefits of the systems in managing stormwater to date more than 50 amendments for improving p removal or reducing p leaching has been researched in particular in laboratory settings many studies e g marvin et al 2020 tirpak et al 2021 han et al 2017 liu and davis 2014 demonstrated that amendments such as water and wastewater treatment residual biochar coconut coir fly ash iron based amendments and zeolite containing adsorptive metals such as aluminum al iron fe and calcium ca can increase the p adsorption capacity of bioretention media and thus improve the p removal rate of bioretention systems thus in general amendments are categorized into four groups namely ca rich fe rich al rich and other sorptive metals based on their dominant metals marvin et al 2020 amendments that contain metal ions e g fe al and or ca would undergo agglomeration with rp and adsorb rp and have been reported to enhance p removal malcolm et al 2014 goh et al 2015 lalley et al 2015 o neill and davis 2012 yan et al 2017 kang et al 2019 for instance o neill and davis 2012 observed through a long term column study that bioretention media amended with al based wtr adsorbed 88 5 of the applied p mass whereas the control media increased p mass by 71 2 tp in stormwater runoff consists of soluble and particulate p which are removed by different mechanisms the particulate p is primarily removed by the filtration and sedimentation liu et al 2014 li and davis 2008 li and davis 2009 whereas adsorption to media is the governing mechanism to remove dissolved p absorption and microbial fixation also play an important but secondary role lucas and greenway 2011 tirpak et al 2021 thus the performance of an amended bioretention system would be influenced by the amendment types and characteristics o neill and davis 2012 in view of the above the prevention of nutrient leaching and or the improvement of the nutrient removal of bioretention systems are desired while a number of previous studies have examined the efficiency of various bioretention amendments in a laboratory controlled environment field studies are very limited differences in the ambient environment as well as the way to apply hydrological loading between the laboratory and field studies could lead to different study results akther et al 2021 owing to the fact that the knowledge derived from laboratory investigations might be discrepant from that from field examinations field investigations are necessary for effective implementation therefore the objective of this paper is to examine the efficiency of several selected amendments which are commercially and locally available for p retention as well as the impact of the amendments on n leaching during the initial operation of bioretention systems amended and control bioretention cells were constructed in okotoks alberta canada and exposed to simulated hydrologic regime which mimics the median natural hydrologic regime of the study region the effects of the amendments on the hydrologic and water quality performance of the cells were evaluated and the temporal evolution of the outflow water quality was characterized 2 study materials and method 2 1 study site and bioretention cells a bioretention research facility was constructed in the town of okotoks which is 45 km south of the city of calgary alberta canada the climate of okotoks and calgary is characterized as semi arid with short warm summers and long cold winters in the research facility eight bioretention cells each 1 m2 in surface area were constructed using pvc frames totes and monitored in simulated events during june to october in 2020 growing season during the season the average monthly high temperature ranged from 12 21 and the monthly precipitation was in the range of 25 7 to 113 2 mm these bioretention cells were constructed with one designated bioretention media i e the mix 40 media of the city of calgary city of calgary 2016 during fall of 2019 and spring of 2020 the media was sourced from a local supplier eagle lake landscaping the dry bulk density and the average particle size of the media are 0 86 g cm3 and 0 58 mm respectively the media contains 16 4 organic matter compost with 4 6 mg l no3 n 5 6 mg l rp and 6 mg l tp initially two of the cells were control cells c1 and c2 without amendments while the remaining six cells included amendments selected for this study the cells were planted with the same vegetation including 16 different native deep rooting types of grass and forbs appendix a at the same density each cell consisted of a 0 2 m ponding area on the top followed by a 0 6 m growing media layer and a 0 2 m drainage layer fine sand at the bottom fig 1 these cells were installed above the ground thus they received the direct rainfall but not stormwater runoff from the ambient areas during natural rain events considering local accessibility six amendments including two ca rich eggshell egg and drywall in gypsum dry fe rich sorptivemedia sm and phosfilter pf and al rich water treatment residual wtr and activated aluminum aa amendments were selected the cells containing these amendments are called aa sm pf egg dry and wtr cells throughout this paper among these selected amendments egg dry and wtr were available at no cost and were mixed with media at 10 in volume egg dry and wtr were sourced locally from a processing company epic egg shells a landfill foothills regional landfill and resource recovery centre and water treatment plants glenmore and bearspaw drinking water treatment plants respectively in the landfill drywalls were piled and sorted into a separate location aa sm and pf were sourced commercially from delta absorbents imbrium systems and ultratech respectively these three amendments were mixed with media at 5 in volume the amendments and the mixture percentages were selected determined also in consultation with the city of calgary considering their cost in real practice the commercial amendments were mixed with bioretention media directly whereas egg dry and wtr were further processed on site before mixing with media eggshells were grounded to less than 10 mm in size drywalls were manually crushed and shifted through 10 mm sieve wtrs were manually extruded through a 10 mm sieve and then air dried for a couple of hours prior to mixing with bioretention media 2 2 field monitoring and water sample analysis the cells were monitored for 20 simulated events during the period of june through october 2020 these simulated events had four different magnitudes i e rainfall depth including 4 9 14 and 24 mm the simulated events mimicked the rainfall regime in the study region in terms of precipitation amount and distribution in the growing seasons in the field season 10 4 4 and 2 of 4 9 14 and 24 mm events respectively were applied to each cell the hydrologic loading for each magnitude event was determined using the i p ratio of 15 city of calgary 2016 the i p ratio is the ratio of contributing catchment area assumed to be impervious for simplicity to the surface area of bioretention system pervious these simulated events had 5 day inter event intervals in general to represent the local condition except for the 24 mm events each of which had a 10 day interval to the next simulated event the water applied to the cells in a simulated event was withdrawn from a nearby stormwater pond in the town of okotoks on the day of the event as the concentration of total suspended solids tss of the pond water was not representative of stormwater runoff sediments were added to represent the typical tss concentration 400 mg l of stormwater runoff in the city of calgary street sweepings from the town dried and sifted through a 1 mm sieve were added to each cell in each simulated event the average concentrations of n and p of the pond water 1 mg l of tn and 0 05 mg l of tp were below their typical concentrations of stormwater runoff 2 mg l of tn and 0 30 mg l of tp city of calgary 2011 as the primary objective of this paper was to investigate the effectiveness of various amendments in reducing mitigating p leaching from the growing media itself the inflow was not spiked to the typical concentrations of n and p of stormwater runoff for each simulated event a composite water sample was collected from each cell for water quality assay and the outflow volume was measured the gravity drainage was observed to continue in the following day of a simulated event therefore two water samples were collected one from the completely mixed water collected on the day of the simulated event sample 1 300 ml and one from the completely mixed water collated on the next day till the end of the gravity drainage sample 2 300 ml from each cell a composite sample was prepared by combining the two samples according to the proportion of the volumes measured on the simulated event day and the following day thus the pollutant concentrations were reported as event mean concentrations emcs also called the event based emcs in this paper as they were measured and reported for each simulated event the total outflow volume was the sum of the volumes measured on these two days three water samples of completely mixed inflow were also collected for each simulated event and the concentrations of inflow were thus also reported as emcs sample preparation storage and analysis complied with standard methods for water and wastewater rice et al 2017 the water samples were stored in a cooler on site and refrigerator in the laboratory before water quality assay using hatch s methods the nutrient species analyzed in this study include rp method tnt 25 tp method tnt 25 tn method tnt 826 and nitrate method tnt 835 2 3 data analysis both pollutant loadings and concentrations have been cited in guidelines and regulations for stormwater management e g city of calgary 2011 ontario ministry of the environment 2003 in a number of previous works on the effects of amendments on bioretention systems yan et al 2018 yan et al 2017 liu et al 2014 concentrations and loadings in terms of the prr have been examined therefore both of these were used to examine the effects of the amendments on nutrient discharge in this paper in terms of hydrological performance of bioretention systems the water retention rate wrr has been argued to be a factor largely contributing to pollutant removal the infiltration rate which affects the ponding depth and length is the other important parameter to be considered in the design of bioretention systems as the examination of pollutant removal leaching is the primary focus of this paper the wrr was chosen as the key metric for evaluating the hydrological performance in this paper in this paper both the hydrological and water quality performance of the cells were assessed at two temporal scales namely the event based and seasonal over the study period scales thus the event based and seasonal water quantity and quality metrics were derived as the water quantity and quality monitoring was from the onset of a simulated event to the end of gravity drainage the calculations of the season based metrics did not account for the period from the end of gravity drainage to the onset of the next simulated event in which natural events might occur the wrr in was calculated by wrr v in v out v in 100 where v in l and v out l are the volumes of inflow and outflow respectively per event or per season the wrr derived for per event and over the monitoring season are called the event based wrr and the seasonal wrr respectively in this paper the seasonal emc of outflow over the monitoring season was derived using the event based emc measured for the simulated events as follows emc 1 n c i v i 1 n v i where c i mg l and v i l are the event based emc and volume of outflow respectively of an event i and n is the total number of the simulated events 20 events here the pollutant removal rate prr in of a pollutant constituent of a cell was calculated as p r r l in l out l in 100 where l in mg and l out mg are the pollutant loading of inflow and outflow respectively per event or per season loading is the product of emc and volume the prr derived for per event and over the monitoring season are called the event based prr and the seasonal prr respectively a positive prr indicates that the cell acts as a sink of pollution and removes the pollutant from the inflow while a negative prr suggests that the cell is a source of pollution and leaches the pollutant as the quantity and quality datasets collected from the cells were generally found to not be normally distributed using the anderson darling test nonparametric statistic tests were employed herein note that the data used are not censored the mann whitney test was applied to compare the medians of two samples while the kruskal wallis test was used for comparison among more than two samples to characterize the temporal evolution of water quality both n and p of cell outflow the non parametric mann kendall test was employed to detect the presence of an upward or downward trend with the event number namely time the correlation analysis spearman s correlation was used to calculate the correlation coefficient between two variables in addition the nonlinear regression using the exponential function was employed to examine the relationship between the n leaching and the cumulative inflow the cumulative inflow is the cumulated hydrological loading to the cells from the beginning of the study period to a simulated event the regression equation can be used as a regression model for predicting the dependent variable the n leaching the regression residual analysis and the regression model performance evaluation were also conducted in the regression residual analysis the anderson darling test and run test were employed to validate the assumptions of normal distribution and independence of residuals respectively to evaluate the regression model performance the determination of coefficient r2 and root mean square error rmse were employed all statistical tests were performed at the 5 significance level which is commonly used in the literature 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrological performance the seasonal wrr indicating the hydrological performance over the study period is presented in table 1 for all cells the seasonal wrr of the amendment cells except the egg cell was in the range of 35 39 note that there was about a 10 difference in the seasonal wrr of the two control cells c1 and c2 in addition as discussed in the following sections differences in water quality between these two control cells were also observed among all of these cells the egg cell which had a seasonal wrr of 46 3 appeared to outperform all other amendment and control cells in retaining stormwater over the study period all other amendment cells had a slightly lower and higher wrr compared to the c1 and c2 cells respectively as all cells have the same configuration the difference in the seasonal wrr can be associated with various factors such as vegetation growth and moisture condition in addition the infiltration rates measured in the first three simulated events were in the range of 150 350 mm hr and not observed to decrease over time during the study period furthermore fig 2 displays the variation in the average event based wrr among the 4 9 14 and 24 mm events respectively for each cell it is apparent that for all cells the event based wrr always decreased with an increase in event magnitude more specifically the average event based wrr of all cells decreased from approximately 50 in the 4 mm events to around 20 in the 24 mm events this result is consistent with the findings in previous studies liu et al 2014 li et al 2009 and mahmoud et al 2019 argued that bioretention systems are more effective in reducing runoff in small to medium sized storm events in addition thompson et al 2008 also found a negative correlation between the wrr of bioretention systems and the rainfall depth the findings can be explained by the fact that the spaces to store and hold water in the media is independent of the event magnitude consequently the increased inflow event magnitude leads to the decreased wrr observed in addition for the 4 and 9 mm events the egg cell appeared to be superior in retaining water among all cells while its superiority was not apparent in the 14 and 24 mm events the higher seasonal wrr observed from the egg cell was due to its higher wrr in the small to medium sized events in contrast the c2 cell which had the lowest seasonal wrr generally had the lowest event based wrr over all the different magnitude events 3 2 seasonal water quality performance it has been acknowledged that pollutant removal by bioretention systems can be partially ascribed to their water retention liu et al 2014 brown and hunt 2012 komlos and traver 2012 for unlined bioretention systems pollutants further percolating into underlying soil also counts as pollutants removed by the systems however in this study due to the absence of percolation into underlying soil pollutants removed are completely retained within the cells the observed differences in the wrr among the cells and among the different event sizes further indicate the need to examine the water quality performance of the cells in terms of both loading and concentration therefore the effects of the amendments on n and p discharge were examined in terms of both the emc and prr in the following sections throughout this paper if an amendment cell has a higher i e in absolute terms negative prr than the control cells the amendment cell leached more pollutant than the control cell and thus the amendment is considered ineffective in reducing the leaching of the pollutant and vice versa if the emc of a pollutant of an amendment cell is higher than that of the control cells the amendment is considered ineffective in reducing the degree concentration of leaching and vice versa table 2 summarizes the seasonal emcs of p rp and tp and n nitrate and tn of the inflow and the outflow of the cells as well as their seasonal prrs both the control cells leached rp and tp which are indicated by their negative seasonal prrs 463 81 and 999 36 for rp and 31 92 and 112 46 for tp for the c1 and c2 cells respectively therefore the control cells behaved as sources of rp and tp over the study period the seasonal prrs of rp of the wtr 52 80 sm 44 17 and aa 28 01 cells were positive and thus the cells were sinks of rp in contrast the other three amendment cells were a source of rp indicated by their negative seasonal prrs 125 14 101 22 and 125 21 for the egg dry and pf cells respectively nevertheless compared to the control cells 1 11 and 1 77 mg l the lower seasonal emcs of rp of these three amendment cells in the range of 0 08 0 46 mg l suggest that these amendment cells leached rp to a lesser degree differing from rp the seasonal prrs of tp of all amendment cells in the range of 2 82 to 59 67 were positive thus all amendment cells behaved as sinks of tp whereas the control cells leached tp over the study period all these results demonstrate that all amendments investigated were effective in preventing or mitigating p leaching from bioretention systems but at different degrees among the amendment cells the wtr cell outperformed all other amendment cells as it had a positive and highest seasonal pprs 52 80 for rp and 59 67 for tp as well as the lowest seasonal emcs 0 08 mg l for rp and 0 49 mg l for tp of p in addition the sm and aa cells also performed well as they also behaved as sinks of both rp and tp over the study period as for nitrate and tn negative seasonal prrs were calculated for all cells including the control cells over the study period table 2 as a result all cells leached both n species whereas some cells i e the dry wtr and sm cells exported less n than the control cells as the seasonal prrs of these cells are higher than those of both control cells therefore these amendments the dry wtr and sm were also beneficial in reducing n leaching relative to the control cells however the other amendments especially egg might increase n leaching when comparing with the seasonal emcs of nitrate and tn of the control cells amendments such as dry wtr and sm were shown to be beneficial in reducing mitigating the degree of n leaching as these cells had lower seasonal emcs whereas other amendments i e the egg pf and aa were not it has been acknowledged that n leaching can be quite variable as bioretention media often contain different nitrogen containing compounds and n transformations can occur within the systems patel et al 2020 among the amendments the egg consisted of a hard outer shell and a soft inner white skin which contains organic matter including nitrogen in the form of proteins the highest seasonal emcs and the lowest seasonal prrs of n species observed from the egg cell among all cells including the control cells support that using egg to amend bioretention media would introduce an additional source of n to bioretention systems dattatray and nair 2019 as for the aa and pf amendments which are two commercial amendments and do not contain n the al aa and fe pf ions could accelerate the dissociation of water molecules in bioretention systems and consequently accelerate the nitrification of n in media and cause the leaching of n rosenband and gany 2010 3 3 event based performance on phosphorus discharge 3 3 1 phosphorus event mean concentration as discussed previously all amendments were shown to be capable of preventing mitigating p leaching of bioretention systems over the study period the effects of amendments in reducing p concentrations were further examined at the event based scale fig 3 shows the event based emcs of rp and tp of all simulated events for each cell using whisker box plots it is apparent that overall the emcs of rp and tp of all amendment cells were lower than those of the control cells the medians of the event based tp and rp emcs of the c2 cell were found to be significantly higher than those of the c1 cell in the mann whitney test although significant differences in the event based emcs between the c1 and c2 cells were detected the medians of the event based emcs of all amendment cells were significantly lower than those of both the c1 and c2 cells tested using the kruskal wallis test this reaffirms that all amendments were capable of reducing the p concentrations of the outflow among the amendment cells wtr sm and aa cells were significantly more effective in reducing the p concentrations as their medians were significantly lower than those of the other amendment cells tested using the kruskal wallis test among the wtr sm and aa cells the medians of emcs of p species of the wtr cell were in general but not significantly lower than the other two cells tested using the kruskal wallis test recall that the wtr sm and aa amendments outperformed the other amendments when evaluating in terms of the seasonal emcs of p as their seasonal emcs are lower than those of the other amendments table 2 therefore in terms of reducing p concentrations of the outflow the wtr amendment appeared to be superior followed by the sm and aa amendments in general the ratio of rp to tp of the growing media calculated using rp and tp measured from nutrient extraction right before the cell construction and the average ratio of rp and tp of inflows over the study period were 93 3 and 17 3 respectively the ratio of the outflow varied significantly among the cells in the outflow of the c1 and c2 cells rp accounted for 62 4 and 72 0 of tp respectively in contrast the ratio of rp in the outflow of the amendment cells ranged from 16 3 to 45 5 which was lower than that of the control cells and bioretention media thus it is not surprising that the adsorption of the soluble p i e rp is the primary mechanism behind the function of the amendments besides vegetation uptake can be the other mechanism to reduce p leaching from the vegetated cells the role of vegetation is discussed in more details in section 3 5 2 3 3 2 temporal evolution of phosphorus event mean concentration the average rp and tp emcs of the inflow were 0 16 and 0 69 mg l respectively while their standard deviations were 0 27 and 0 42 mg l respectively among the cells some cells leached p in similar temporal evolution patterns fig 4 illustrates the temporal evolution with the event number of the event based emcs of tp and rp for three selected cells the c2 sm and pf cells as examples the c2 cell demonstrated increasing p emcs with the event number namely time overall moreover the mann kendall test confirmed the presence of the significant upward trend in the p emcs of the c2 cell as well as the c1 cell in contrast as shown in fig 4 both the sm and egg cells did not show an obvious increase in the p emcs with time the significant upward trend was not detected in the p emcs of all amendment cells in the mann kendall test in particular a significant downward trend in the p emcs was detected for the aa and sm cells over the study period in the mann kendall test the contrasting temporal evolution of the p emcs between the amendment cells and the control cells suggests that the effect of the amendments in reducing p concentrations became more prominent with time in the study period it is worth mentioning that the rp emc of the egg cell however notably increased after event 14 in addition as shown in fig 4 the p emcs of the c2 and egg cells were largely higher in events 6 and 9 than those in other events the time interval between these two events and their previous simulated event was 10 days which was longer than the time interval of the rest of the events 5 days this was also observed for the c1 dry and pf cells the result implies that more p was available in the cells to be discharged prior to these events due to the longer time interval a number of previous studies e g hunt et al 2006 shrestha et al 2018 cho et al 2011 li and davis 2016 pointed out that bioretention media drying dramatically increases the amount of leachable p because of crystallization of minerals and subsequently media could release additional p due to desorption under wetting conditions li et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 and mangangka et al 2014 also attributed a decreased p removal rate of bioretention systems to a long event interval in addition microbially bound nutrients are subject to release upon changing conditions such as in wetting and drying cycles parmar and singh 2014 although the microbial community is capable of enhancing nutrient removal through microbial assisted uptake and storing a significant portion of soil nutrients in their biomass on the other hand media saturation could increase p solubility due to desorption under extended saturation ann et al 1999 hurley et l 2017 therefore the long time interval between events and or the long saturation period in high magnitude events as well as the release of microbially bound nutrients might result in the observed elevated p emcs in these two events however the obviously high p emcs in these two events were not observed for the wtr sm and aa cells which were shown to be more effective in reducing p concentrations compared to the other amendment cells ultimately owing to the limited capacity of p adsorption of amendments it is thus desirable to observe the efficiency of amendments over a longer period of time for examining their service life 3 3 3 impact of the event magnitude on the event based phosphorus removal rate similar to the event based hydrological performance i e the event based wrr the event based prrs of tp and rp were found to be also associated with the event magnitude fig 5 shows the average event based prrs of tp and rp respectively for different event sizes for all cells both the c1 and c2 cells leached rp and tp in all events irrespective of the event magnitude except the c1 cell for the 4 mm events recall that over the study period positive seasonal prrs of rp were calculated from the wtr sm and aa cells while all amendment cells were reported to have positive seasonal prrs of tp table 2 the average event based prr of tp of the amendment cells was in general positive for all different event magnitudes except the pf cell in the medium to high magnitude events i e the 9 14 and 24 mm events and the egg and dry cells in the high magnitude events i e the 24 mm events however the average event based prr of rp of the amendment cells was in general negative for all different event magnitudes a positive average event based prr of rp was observed for the wtr sm and aa cells in the medium magnitude events and for wtr for the high magnitude events overall the amendment cells except the pf cell were effective in reducing tp loading in the small to medium magnitude events while some cells including the wtr sm and aa cells reduced the rp loading in the medium and or high magnitude events the results revealed that tp was more susceptible to a discharge from the systems with increase in event magnitude whereas rp was more susceptible to a discharge for the smaller magnitude events water movement through media soil is a function of both the hydraulic conductivity and the driving force according to darcy s law under saturated conditions the driving force would be higher in large magnitude events which can be ascribed to a high ponding depth and or a long ponding duration compared to small magnitude events shrestha et al 2018 which monitored eight roadside bioretention cells demonstrated that the increased outflow rate was significantly positively correlated to precipitation depth increased peak inflow rate and others thus more particulate p could be washed out during the larger magnitude events due to more rapid flow the observed differences in behavior in rp and tp of the amendment cells can be explained by the different processes governing their removal leaching particulate p is mostly removed by filtration and sedimentation while soluble p is removed by adsorption li and davis 2016 shrestha et al 2018 therefore the discharge of soluble p is speculated to be both a function of the amount of leachable soluble p in bioretention systems and the adsorption capacity of media rather than the flow rate event magnitude whereas more particulate p would be discharged in lager events 3 3 4 effects of the mixture percentage and the type of amendments on phosphorus discharge in literature a large number of amendments at various mixture percentages ranging from 3 to 17 in volume have been used to improve p removal and or reduce p leaching of bioretention systems e g goh et al 2015 balch et al 2013 yan et al 2018 malcolm et al 2014 whereas the majority of the previous studies have used a mixture percentage that is in a 5 to 10 range among the six amendments investigated the egg dry and wtr amendments were mixed at 10 in volume with bioretention media while the aa sm and pf amendments were mixed at 5 in volume as shown in table 2 and figs 3 and 5 all amendment cells outperformed the two control cells in reducing tp and rp concentrations and their loading in the outflow while the wtr cell performed best among the amendment cells closely followed by the sm and aa cells given that the mixture percentage of the wtr was double of that of the sm and aa amendments the higher content of the wtr in the cell might lead to its superior performance thus further exploration on the optimal mixture percentage of amendments is desirable in addition although the use of the wtr amendment is economical its composition can vary with the operation of water treatment plants the wtr amendment used in this study is al rich while the wtr can also be fe rich a few studies liu et al 2014 o neill and davis 2012 agyin birikorang and o connor 2009 patel et al 2020 have even pointed out that the addition of other adsorbent metals to the wtr amendment might be necessary to improve its efficiency moreover the no cost amendments i e dry and egg amendments are not readily available as granular media the granulation of the materials is speculated to affect their performance as finer products might perform better from quality perspective but not from the hydrologic perspective therefore to guarantee the efficiency of the no cost amendments such as the wtr and dry ones in real practice the quality assurance and control of the products would be required the amendments applied in bioretention systems have often been metal ion based and thus expected to enhance the adsorption of soluble p as well as p sedimentation in which the metal ions of the amendments facilitate sorption or precipitation among the commercial amendments including the sm pf and aa ones at the same 5 mixture percentage the sm and aa amendments performed similarly and both were superior to the pf one comparing the sm and pf amendments both of which are fe rich amendments the minor amount of oxide aluminum granular in the sm one might be the reason why the sm cell outperformed the pf cell in addition among the no cost amendments including the wtr egg and dry ones at the same 10 mixture percentage the wtr amendment containing both al primarily and fe significantly outperformed the egg and dry ones both of which are ca rich amendments it has been well demonstrated in the literature e g siwek et al 2019 yan et al 2017 gypser et al 2021 almanassra et al 2021 that metal ions ca fe or al have adsorption capacity for p among the metal ions ca is shown to have the lowest capacity of p sorption almanassra et al 2021 this explains the lower performance of both the egg and dry amendments in particular when compared to the wtr sm and aa ones therefore the al rich and fe rich amendements might outperform the ca rich amendments in general when applied with the same mixture percentage 3 4 event based performance on nitrogen discharge 3 4 1 nitrogen event mean concentration as discussed previously all amendment cells leached n over the study period but some amendments including the dry wtr and sm ones were shown to be beneficial in reducing the n leaching as less n leached from these cells compared to the control cells table 2 the metal oxidation can increase the negative surface charge density thereby increasing the adsorption of nitrate and ammonium mia et al 2017 in contrast the other amendments in particular the egg one were found to introduce extra n into the bioretention cells table 2 in general the average ratios of nitrate to tn of the outflows of all cells including the control cells were significantly different from that of the inflow in the outflow of all cells nitrate accounted for 87 3 93 9 of tn while in the inflow nitrate only amounted to 29 1 of tn these results further suggest that n leached from the media and or amendments within the cells similarly the emcs of n of the cells also showed that the egg amendment constituted a consistent source of n over the study period fig 6 shows the event based emcs of tn and nitrate of all simulated events for each cell using whisker box plots both the medians of the event based emcs of tn and nitrate of the egg cell were significantly higher than those of all the other cells including the two control cells tested using the kruskal wallis test when comparing the medians of the event based emcs of tn and nitrate of all the other amendment cells to those of the control cells using the kruskal wallis test the medians of the pf and dry cells were found to be statistically equivalent to those of the control cells while the medians of the wtr sm and aa cells were significantly lower than those of the control cells these results suggest that when selecting an amendment to reduce p leaching or improve p removal consideration of whether the amendment would introduce more leachable n into bioretention systems is desirable the processes to remove n include ammonification nitrification denitrification volatilization and vegetation uptake liu et al 2014 the addition of the amendments which are designated for reducing p leaching is not expected to directly improve or hinder these processes and consequently not largely affect the system performance in removing or leaching n the observed differences among the cells except the egg cell in leaching n might be ascribed to other factors such as media moisture and vegetation etc which was further discussed in section 3 5 of this paper 3 4 2 temporal evolution of nitrogen event mean concentration except the egg cell all other cells including the control cells demonstrated the same pattern of the temporal evolution of n leaching fig 7 thus illustrates the temporal evolution with the event number of the event based emcs of tn and nitrate for three selected cells including a control cell i e the c2 cell the egg cell and one other amended cell i e the wtr cell as examples differing from the temporal evolution of the emcs of p species both the emcs of tn and nitrate significantly decreased with the event number over time tested by the mann kendall test in particular the emcs of n of both control cells c1 and c2 and the amended cells except the egg cell largely declined with time before event 7 and then slowly decreased afterwards compared among the amendment cells the egg cell appeared to leach n at a higher rate over the study period the hydrological loading from the beginning of the study to event 7 was about 35 of the total hydrological loading while the loadings of nitrate and tn of outflow of the cells were 83 99 and 81 98 of their total loadings over the study period respectively these results suggest that the majority of n quickly leached out from these cells at the beginning of the study period the observations on the n leaching from the cells appeared to be consistent with those observed from bioretention systems by chahal et al 2016 and palmer et al 2013 as well as from the green roofs by akther et al 2021 moreover akther et al 2021 argued that the n leaching is primarily governed by the wash off process and can be mathematically represented by the exponential decay function of the cumulative inflow fig 8 shows the regression lines models i e the exponential equations of the event based emcs of tn and nitrate on the cumulative inflow as well as the residuals and the model performance evaluation metrics including r2 and rmse of the regression models for the c2 egg and wtr cells as examples the residuals were found not normally distributed in the lilliefors test whereas they were found to be random in several cases e g nitrate of the c1 and egg cells and tn of the c1 cells in the run test each dataset consists of 20 data points which are not considered large generally speaking a larger sample is desired to correctly reject the null hypothesis in hypothesis tests when evaluating the performance of the regression models the r2 of the models is larger than 0 95 while the root mean square error rmse is less than 10 mg l for all cells except the egg cell regardless of whether the cells were amended or not therefore from the modeling perspective the cumulative inflow can reasonably well predict the leaching of tn and nitrate in general as for the egg cell a high rmse greater than20 mg l was reported although a high r2 was calculated for the event based emcs of nitrate and tn the relatively low performance of the regression model for the egg cell would suggest that for the egg amendment the additional source of n might alter the wash off process of the n leaching to a certain degree due to the decomposition of the egg amendment in bioretention media over the study period 3 5 other potential influential factors on amended bioretention systems 3 5 1 effects of antecedent media moisture during the study period the antecedent moisture right before the onset of the simulated events at the surface 5 cm depth of all cells were measured manually and it ranged from 0 076 to 0 426 m3 m3 as illustrated in fig 9 and the test results of the sample comparison in the kruskal wallis test the median of the antecedent moisture of the egg cell was statistically equivalent to that of the two control cells whereas significantly lower than that of all the other amendment cells recall that the seasonal wrr of the egg cell was highest among all cells followed by the c1 cell table 2 to a certain extent the low antecedent moisture of the egg and c1 cells could explain their higher seasonal wrr over the study period moreover the event based wrr was found to be significantly negatively correlated with the antecedent moisture for the cells except for the egg and dry cells as the calculated spearman s correlation coefficient was in the range of 0 59 to 0 66 the insignificant spearman s correlation coefficients calculated for the egg and dry cells were 0 22 and 0 38 respectively it has been acknowledged that the capacity of media storage for retaining water is dependent on both the intrinsic media properties and the associated effective storage capacity prior to a storm event which relates to the environmental factors fassman beck et al 2015 the addition of the amendments which were in different sizes e g coarser dry and egg amendments than others is speculated to affect the intrinsic media properties and thus the water holding capacity of media at different degrees the observed relationship between the antecedent moisture and the event based wrr in general might suggest the impact of the effective storage prior to a storm event on the event based wrr might be more prominent than the impact of the addition of amendments at the mixture percentage either 5 or 10 on the intrinsic media properties several previous studies khan et al 2012 li et al 2009 thompson et al 2008 have pointed out the importance of the antecedent moisture condition on the water retention especially for small magnitude events of bioretention systems the results from this study support the above arguments that a lower antecedent soil moisture which makes more storage available before a storm event will result in a higher wrr with respect to water quality in general low and insignificant spearman s correlation coefficients negative or positive were calculated between the antecedent moisture and the event based emcs of nutrients however among the amendment cells the egg and pf cells had a relatively but not significantly lower antecedent moisture fig 9 tested in the kruskal wallis test which was coincident with the observed significantly or relatively higher emcs and the seasonal prrs of p and n of these two cells table 2 and figs 3 and 6 this result imply that the drier condition between events for these cells might likely lead to a higher discharge of nutrients this is consistent with the notion that media drying after wetting can increase the amount of leachable nutrients and thus release additional p and n during subsequent rainfall events as discussed previously 3 5 2 effects of vegetation to quantitatively measure the growth of vegetation in the cells the height of the deschampsia cespitosa commonly knows as tufted hairgrass which was highest was measured at the beginning and end of the study period among all the cells the tufted hairgrass in the egg cell 44 9 cm was reported to have the highest growth followed by the two control cells 43 5 43 7 cm while the tufted hairgrass growth of all the other amendment cells was similar in the range of 39 9 42 0 cm and lower than that of the egg and the two control cells although it is challenging to measure vegetation height accurately the preliminary observation implies that the use of the amendments possibly has influence on the vegetation growth among the amendments the egg one is known to be capable of enhancing vegetation growth dattatray et al 2019 the vegetation growth measured appears to be consistent with the calculated seasonal wrr of all cells except the cell c2 namely a higher seasonal wrr corresponded to a higher vegetation growth their positive but insignificant spearman s correlation coefficient 0 14 might imply the potential role of vegetation on the wrr furthermore the egg cell and the two control cells which were observed to have a higher vegetation growth were reported to have a lower antecedent moisture fig 9 this appears to confirm the role of vegetation in enhancing the hydrological performance of bioretention systems namely in increasing the wrr through vegetative transpiration the role of vegetative transpiration on the hydrological performance has been also observed by li et al 2009 wadzuk et al 2015 and ebrahimian et al 2019 besides vegetation of bioretention systems has been demonstrated to be beneficial in improving nutrient removal for example through the nutrient uptake from the media dagenaisa et al 2018 liu et al 2014 shrestha et al 2018 however the spearman s correlation coefficients of the vegetation growth and the seasonal emcs of nutrients were significant and positive in the range of 0 69 0 91 the calculated positive correlation coefficients implies that the expected role of vegetation through nutrient uptake on the water quality performance of the cells was absent further investigation on the role of vegetation using more elaborate vegetation traits such as biomass and leaf area index is recommended 4 study implications and limitations in literature nutrient leaching from bioretention systems has been documented in particular during their initial conditions this might be resulted from the use of nutrient rich growing media to support the establishment and development of vegetation the field experiment in this paper demonstrated nutrient leaching from the control cells without amendments which would be a critical issue to be dealt with when implementing bioretention systems for better stormwater management a study by akther et al 2020 concluded that the initial nutrient contents of growing media might be an important factor affecting the degree of nutrient leaching the physicochemical properties of growing media of biorientation systems could be largely different due to the use of different media in different regions the potential and degree of nutrient leaching as well as the length of nutrient leaching might vary among different media and consequently bioretention systems thus in practice the examination of nutrient leaching of growing media before field installation is recommended in addition the results from this paper also revealed the different performance of different amendments in mitigating nutrient leaching the use of amendments for reducing p leaching would possibly increase n leaching e g the egg cell in this paper therefore the selection of appropriate or optimal amendments would be the key to ensure the success of the strategy of using amendments to mitigate nutrient leaching of bioretention systems to amend bioretention media various waste by products have been examined and implemented to enhance nutrient removal or to mitigate nutrient leaching of bioretention systems this paper also confirmed that amending media with waste by products i e egg dry wtr can mitigate p leaching from bioretention systems however differing from commercial products their physiochemical properties may vary for instance nutrients may be present in wtr such as nutrients removed from source water in addition wtr contents may vary seasonally as the quality of source water can present seasonal variation moreover the results from this paper demonstrated that eggshells could be the extra source of n leached from the egg cell thus waste by products might potentially become extra sources of nutrients leached although the use of waste by products is economical further research is recommended to relate their performance to their physicochemical parameters to ensure selecting efficient and reliable waste by products for mitigating nutrient leaching in practice it is worth mentioning that the field observation was conducted during the initial conditions i e the first year of the operation of the bioretention cells as demonstrated by the results in this paper the degree of nutrient leaching i e emcs of nutrients is not stationary and evolves changes with time figs 4 and 7 therefore it is speculated that the degree of nutrient leaching observed from the cells in the first year of their operation would differ from that observed in the next years more specifically as growing media are the primary source of nutrients leached during the initial conditions the degree of nutrient leaching would overall decline with the progression of nutrient leaching this could be ascribed to the reduction of leachable nutrients in growing media whereas the length of nutrient leaching might vary between n and p as well as the physicochemical properties of media and or amendments used moreover amendments mixed at a percentage in construction are not expected to function in mitigating p leaching or improving p removal over the lifespan of bioretention systems a long term study spanning multiple years is indeed required to examine the efficiency of the amendments over a long time period for example until the cease of nutrient leaching or the end of the function of amendments in addition the field monitoring of the cells was conducted in the growing season in the study area bioretention systems would experience several freezing and thawing cycles ftcs in long and cold winters due to the interspersed brief warm periods locally known as chinooks several times in a year ding et al 2019 confirmed in the laboratory setting that ftc can increase the saturated hydraulic conductivity and nearly completely remove nitrate and phosphate applied to the experimental bioretention columns moreover kratky et al 2017 argued that the removal of nutrients as well as other dissolved contaminants are significantly variable in cold temperatures the temperature is expected to affect the adsorption of amendments and consequently the efficacy of amendments in mitigating nutrient leaching in cold winter further research on the performance of amendments in cold winters is of particular interest for cold climate regions in this field experimental study the control cell was duplicated while the amendment cells were constructed without duplication as shown by the results differences in the seasonal wrr about 10 and water quality were observed between these two control cells whereas the temporal evolution pattern of the event based nutrient emcs with time event number observed from these two control cells was similar the inhomogeneous media might be the possible cause of the observed quantitative differences between these two control cells the inclusion of replication of the amendment cells are desired however the use of replicated cells is often limited due to economic constraints especially when conducting research in the field to examine a large number of treatments for instance a study by ding et al 2019 which examined the effects of freezing and thawing on water infiltration and nutrient removal of bioretention cells under cold climate conditions in the laboratory setting validated the observation among the data collected from six injections rather than single injection short term experiments in which replicates are key to draw reliable conclusions although the amendment cells were not duplicated triplicated each cell was monitored in 20 simulated events during the study period the similar temporal evolution of n leaching except the egg cell in which egg is expected to be the additional source of n could validate the consistency in the results to quantify the error for amended cells which could originate from various potential sources including homogeneity of materials measurements experimental procedure etc the use of replications is desired if it is not cost prohibitive during the study period the cells also received natural rainfall if outflow is generated in a natural event nutrients also leach out from the cells the amount of natural rainfall measured during the study period is 154 mm recoded by the meteorological station installed onsite while the total rainfall of simulated events is 200 mm in addition note that the i p ratio is 1 for natural events whereas it is 15 for simulate events as a result the hydrological loading of natural events was much lower than that of simulated events therefore this study did not take natural rainfall into account when assessing the seasonal performance of the bioretention cells 5 conclusions to examine the efficiency of six selected amendments in reducing p discharge from bioretention systems during their initial operation six amended cells and two control cells were constructed and monitored soon after their construction in the 2020 growing season in a field experiment the effects of amendments on both the hydrological performance in terms of wrr and water quality performance in terms of emc and prr were investigated overall the amendments did not have a significant impact on the wrr it was not surprising to find that the wrr decreased with increasing event magnitude all amendments were found to be capable of preventing or mitigating p leaching from bioretention systems over the study period but to different degrees this was clearly reflected by the increased prrs and the decreased emcs of tp and rp of the amended cells compared to those of the control cells among the amendments the egg one was demonstrated to constitute an extra source of n leached as eggshells contain organic compounds i e shell membrane which is rich in protein and therefore n all other amendments were shown to not significantly alter the prrs and emcs of tn and nitrate relatively to the control cells and have similar temporal evolution patterns as the control cells namely decreasing with time the cumulative inflow exponentially overall the amendments except for the egg one did not obviously affect the n discharge from bioretention systems in addition regardless of whether the cells were amended or not the antecedent moisture and the vegetation growth which are potentially linked appeared to affect the wrr overall among the six selected amendments the egg one even though economical might not be a good option as it did not outperform the other amendments in reducing p discharge but did introduce extra leachable n into the systems even though it improved the wrr and possibly enhanced vegetation growth the wtr amendment mixed at 10 outperformed all other amendments followed by the aa and sm ones mixed at 5 thus further investigation on the mixture percentage of the amendments is recommended moreover the composition of the wtr amendment might vary as a function of the operation of the water treatment plant that supplied the material extra caution is therefore needed when using wtr amendments to amend bioretention systems although n leaches rapidly at the beginning of the system operation its mitigation is also desired to enhance the benefits of bioretention systems in managing stormwater runoff as the removal of n and p is governed by different processes technologies for reducing n leaching e g temporally creating a saturated zone in the drainage layer to promote denitrification could be combined with the use of amendments to reduce the leaching of nutrients both n and p from bioretention systems credit authorship contribution statement y zhang

2204,bioretention systems have been showcased to be effective in reducing stormwater quantity and improving stormwater quality however the systems can also leach nutrients especially during their initial operation which needs to be mitigated to optimize their benefits to examine the efficiency of six amendments selected primarily for reducing phosphorus p leaching six amended and two control cells were constructed and monitored soon after their construction in the field of the 2020 growing season the effects of the amendments on both the hydrological performance in terms of water retention rate wrr and water quality performance in terms of the event mean concentration and pollutant removal rate were investigated the results showed that all amendments had the capability of preventing or mitigating p leaching from bioretention systems to varying degrees with the water treatment residual wtr outperforming all other amendments followed by the activated aluminum aa and sorptivemedia sm amendments in addition some of the amendments i e drywall dry wtr and sm were also found to be beneficial in reducing the nitrogen n leaching to a slight degree whereas eggshell egg introduced an extra source of n leached furthermore the temporal evolution of the p leaching of the amendment cells was found to be different from that of the control cells the same result was not observed for the temporal evolution of the n leaching implying that the amendments except egg did not largely affect the n leaching among the amendments effect on wrr there was no obvious difference whereas the observed differences between the control cells and some amendment cells in vegetation growth and antecedent media moisture condition might imply their potential impacts on the hydrologic performance overall other than p leaching the use of amendments affected other functions of bioretention systems which should be taken into consideration when selecting an amendment for practice keywords water retention nutrient leaching concentration removal efficiency antecedent moisture condition vegetation data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction urbanization leads to an increase of impermeable surfaces in urbanized environments consequently it alters the urban hydrological cycle reflected by increasing the flow rate and the volume of stormwater runoff decreasing infiltration and deteriorating the water quality of receiving water bodies walsh et al 2005 katsifarakis et al 2015 in the paradigm of conventional centralized stormwater management stormwater runoff has been collected and conveyed through storm sewers and discharged into end of pipe treatment facilities i e stormwater ponds or receiving water bodies centralized management systems are often accompanied with high construction cost large space requirements for water storage and the destruction of natural landscapes as a result stormwater management strategies have recently shifted from a centralized management to a decentralized management for instance implementing stormwater control measures scms aiming to improve management efficiencies and reduce cost besides scms have secondary benefits of increasing water supply restoring the pre development hydrologic regime in addition to mitigating the impact of climate change on urban stormwater runoff zahmatkesh et al 2015 among various scms bioretention systems have been showcased to be effective in reducing stormwater runoff volume and removing various pollutants including suspended solids heavy metals nutrients and many others muhammad 2016 yan et al 2018 chapman et al 2010 in the context of stormwater quality among various pollutants nutrients in particular phosphorus p are of particular interest to stormwater managers as their excessive loading could result in eutrophication of receiving water bodies the impact of p on aquatic ecosystems depends on the specific conditions of water receiving bodies and hence canada does not have a single maximum p concentration limit for surface waters to protect aquatic life the canadian council of ministters of the environment ccme 2016 and alberta government 2018 recommend that total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn concentrations should not exceed 0 05 mg l and 1 0 mg l respectively accompanied by narrative statements for lakes rivers and other water bodies in addition a water body in which tp exceeds 0 035 mg l is considered eutrophic and thus detrimental to aquatic life ccme 2004 in the u s guidelines have recommended that tp should not exceed 0 05 mg l releasing into water bodies and 0 1 mg l in flowing water to prevent eutrophication us epa 2007 as the typical tp concentration in urban stormwater runoff is often in the range of 0 42 to 2 8 mg l depending on the season and the location yang and lusk 2018 reducing p from stormwater runoff is indeed necessary to protect ecosystems bioretention systems have been shown to be effective in removing various pollutants including organic and inorganic compounds such as p from stormwater runoff li and davis 2014 on average scms remove particles larger than 20 µm in diameter and about 70 of tp and phosphate from stormwater clary et al 2020 in addition a field study by passeport et al 2009 demonstrated that bioretention systems effectively removed tp and reactive phosphate rp by reducing their inflow concentrations by 58 63 and 74 78 respectively however the existing body of knowledge has also demonstrated that bioretention systems can leach pollutants and consequently lead to increased p concentrations and or mass loadings in stormwater a number of previous studies e g hager et al 2019 mangangka et al 2014 reported that bioretention systems can remove and leach rp as its removal efficiency varies from 90 to 400 in practice it is common that nutrient enriched media have been used to construct bioretention systems to support the establishment and survival of vegetation dagenaisa et al 2018 compost has been commonly added to bioretention media to improve media aggregation and increase porosity and consequently improve the infiltration rate as well as the water retention capacity from the aspect of water quality compost is able to absorb or aid in the degradation of some pollutants such as hydrocarbons solvents and heavy metals while also reduce the use of fertilizers by improving the soil nutrient holding capacity sun et al 2020 hurley et al 2017 in contrast the decomposition of compost in bioretention media acts as an extra source of nutrients thus it is not uncommon to observe nutrient leaching from bioretention systems tirpak et al 2021 brown et al 2013 shrestha et al 2018 especially at the beginning of their operation in addition akther et al 2020 kohlsmith et al 2021 and hurley et al 2017 also indicated that the nutrient leaching is largely related to the cumulative inflow and decreases over time in particular akther et al 2020 argued that the decrease of the nutrient leaching could be ascribed to the decrease of leachable nutrients in media although nutrient leaching might decline over time preventing or mitigating nutrient leaching from bioretention systems is critical to promote the benefits of the systems in managing stormwater to date more than 50 amendments for improving p removal or reducing p leaching has been researched in particular in laboratory settings many studies e g marvin et al 2020 tirpak et al 2021 han et al 2017 liu and davis 2014 demonstrated that amendments such as water and wastewater treatment residual biochar coconut coir fly ash iron based amendments and zeolite containing adsorptive metals such as aluminum al iron fe and calcium ca can increase the p adsorption capacity of bioretention media and thus improve the p removal rate of bioretention systems thus in general amendments are categorized into four groups namely ca rich fe rich al rich and other sorptive metals based on their dominant metals marvin et al 2020 amendments that contain metal ions e g fe al and or ca would undergo agglomeration with rp and adsorb rp and have been reported to enhance p removal malcolm et al 2014 goh et al 2015 lalley et al 2015 o neill and davis 2012 yan et al 2017 kang et al 2019 for instance o neill and davis 2012 observed through a long term column study that bioretention media amended with al based wtr adsorbed 88 5 of the applied p mass whereas the control media increased p mass by 71 2 tp in stormwater runoff consists of soluble and particulate p which are removed by different mechanisms the particulate p is primarily removed by the filtration and sedimentation liu et al 2014 li and davis 2008 li and davis 2009 whereas adsorption to media is the governing mechanism to remove dissolved p absorption and microbial fixation also play an important but secondary role lucas and greenway 2011 tirpak et al 2021 thus the performance of an amended bioretention system would be influenced by the amendment types and characteristics o neill and davis 2012 in view of the above the prevention of nutrient leaching and or the improvement of the nutrient removal of bioretention systems are desired while a number of previous studies have examined the efficiency of various bioretention amendments in a laboratory controlled environment field studies are very limited differences in the ambient environment as well as the way to apply hydrological loading between the laboratory and field studies could lead to different study results akther et al 2021 owing to the fact that the knowledge derived from laboratory investigations might be discrepant from that from field examinations field investigations are necessary for effective implementation therefore the objective of this paper is to examine the efficiency of several selected amendments which are commercially and locally available for p retention as well as the impact of the amendments on n leaching during the initial operation of bioretention systems amended and control bioretention cells were constructed in okotoks alberta canada and exposed to simulated hydrologic regime which mimics the median natural hydrologic regime of the study region the effects of the amendments on the hydrologic and water quality performance of the cells were evaluated and the temporal evolution of the outflow water quality was characterized 2 study materials and method 2 1 study site and bioretention cells a bioretention research facility was constructed in the town of okotoks which is 45 km south of the city of calgary alberta canada the climate of okotoks and calgary is characterized as semi arid with short warm summers and long cold winters in the research facility eight bioretention cells each 1 m2 in surface area were constructed using pvc frames totes and monitored in simulated events during june to october in 2020 growing season during the season the average monthly high temperature ranged from 12 21 and the monthly precipitation was in the range of 25 7 to 113 2 mm these bioretention cells were constructed with one designated bioretention media i e the mix 40 media of the city of calgary city of calgary 2016 during fall of 2019 and spring of 2020 the media was sourced from a local supplier eagle lake landscaping the dry bulk density and the average particle size of the media are 0 86 g cm3 and 0 58 mm respectively the media contains 16 4 organic matter compost with 4 6 mg l no3 n 5 6 mg l rp and 6 mg l tp initially two of the cells were control cells c1 and c2 without amendments while the remaining six cells included amendments selected for this study the cells were planted with the same vegetation including 16 different native deep rooting types of grass and forbs appendix a at the same density each cell consisted of a 0 2 m ponding area on the top followed by a 0 6 m growing media layer and a 0 2 m drainage layer fine sand at the bottom fig 1 these cells were installed above the ground thus they received the direct rainfall but not stormwater runoff from the ambient areas during natural rain events considering local accessibility six amendments including two ca rich eggshell egg and drywall in gypsum dry fe rich sorptivemedia sm and phosfilter pf and al rich water treatment residual wtr and activated aluminum aa amendments were selected the cells containing these amendments are called aa sm pf egg dry and wtr cells throughout this paper among these selected amendments egg dry and wtr were available at no cost and were mixed with media at 10 in volume egg dry and wtr were sourced locally from a processing company epic egg shells a landfill foothills regional landfill and resource recovery centre and water treatment plants glenmore and bearspaw drinking water treatment plants respectively in the landfill drywalls were piled and sorted into a separate location aa sm and pf were sourced commercially from delta absorbents imbrium systems and ultratech respectively these three amendments were mixed with media at 5 in volume the amendments and the mixture percentages were selected determined also in consultation with the city of calgary considering their cost in real practice the commercial amendments were mixed with bioretention media directly whereas egg dry and wtr were further processed on site before mixing with media eggshells were grounded to less than 10 mm in size drywalls were manually crushed and shifted through 10 mm sieve wtrs were manually extruded through a 10 mm sieve and then air dried for a couple of hours prior to mixing with bioretention media 2 2 field monitoring and water sample analysis the cells were monitored for 20 simulated events during the period of june through october 2020 these simulated events had four different magnitudes i e rainfall depth including 4 9 14 and 24 mm the simulated events mimicked the rainfall regime in the study region in terms of precipitation amount and distribution in the growing seasons in the field season 10 4 4 and 2 of 4 9 14 and 24 mm events respectively were applied to each cell the hydrologic loading for each magnitude event was determined using the i p ratio of 15 city of calgary 2016 the i p ratio is the ratio of contributing catchment area assumed to be impervious for simplicity to the surface area of bioretention system pervious these simulated events had 5 day inter event intervals in general to represent the local condition except for the 24 mm events each of which had a 10 day interval to the next simulated event the water applied to the cells in a simulated event was withdrawn from a nearby stormwater pond in the town of okotoks on the day of the event as the concentration of total suspended solids tss of the pond water was not representative of stormwater runoff sediments were added to represent the typical tss concentration 400 mg l of stormwater runoff in the city of calgary street sweepings from the town dried and sifted through a 1 mm sieve were added to each cell in each simulated event the average concentrations of n and p of the pond water 1 mg l of tn and 0 05 mg l of tp were below their typical concentrations of stormwater runoff 2 mg l of tn and 0 30 mg l of tp city of calgary 2011 as the primary objective of this paper was to investigate the effectiveness of various amendments in reducing mitigating p leaching from the growing media itself the inflow was not spiked to the typical concentrations of n and p of stormwater runoff for each simulated event a composite water sample was collected from each cell for water quality assay and the outflow volume was measured the gravity drainage was observed to continue in the following day of a simulated event therefore two water samples were collected one from the completely mixed water collected on the day of the simulated event sample 1 300 ml and one from the completely mixed water collated on the next day till the end of the gravity drainage sample 2 300 ml from each cell a composite sample was prepared by combining the two samples according to the proportion of the volumes measured on the simulated event day and the following day thus the pollutant concentrations were reported as event mean concentrations emcs also called the event based emcs in this paper as they were measured and reported for each simulated event the total outflow volume was the sum of the volumes measured on these two days three water samples of completely mixed inflow were also collected for each simulated event and the concentrations of inflow were thus also reported as emcs sample preparation storage and analysis complied with standard methods for water and wastewater rice et al 2017 the water samples were stored in a cooler on site and refrigerator in the laboratory before water quality assay using hatch s methods the nutrient species analyzed in this study include rp method tnt 25 tp method tnt 25 tn method tnt 826 and nitrate method tnt 835 2 3 data analysis both pollutant loadings and concentrations have been cited in guidelines and regulations for stormwater management e g city of calgary 2011 ontario ministry of the environment 2003 in a number of previous works on the effects of amendments on bioretention systems yan et al 2018 yan et al 2017 liu et al 2014 concentrations and loadings in terms of the prr have been examined therefore both of these were used to examine the effects of the amendments on nutrient discharge in this paper in terms of hydrological performance of bioretention systems the water retention rate wrr has been argued to be a factor largely contributing to pollutant removal the infiltration rate which affects the ponding depth and length is the other important parameter to be considered in the design of bioretention systems as the examination of pollutant removal leaching is the primary focus of this paper the wrr was chosen as the key metric for evaluating the hydrological performance in this paper in this paper both the hydrological and water quality performance of the cells were assessed at two temporal scales namely the event based and seasonal over the study period scales thus the event based and seasonal water quantity and quality metrics were derived as the water quantity and quality monitoring was from the onset of a simulated event to the end of gravity drainage the calculations of the season based metrics did not account for the period from the end of gravity drainage to the onset of the next simulated event in which natural events might occur the wrr in was calculated by wrr v in v out v in 100 where v in l and v out l are the volumes of inflow and outflow respectively per event or per season the wrr derived for per event and over the monitoring season are called the event based wrr and the seasonal wrr respectively in this paper the seasonal emc of outflow over the monitoring season was derived using the event based emc measured for the simulated events as follows emc 1 n c i v i 1 n v i where c i mg l and v i l are the event based emc and volume of outflow respectively of an event i and n is the total number of the simulated events 20 events here the pollutant removal rate prr in of a pollutant constituent of a cell was calculated as p r r l in l out l in 100 where l in mg and l out mg are the pollutant loading of inflow and outflow respectively per event or per season loading is the product of emc and volume the prr derived for per event and over the monitoring season are called the event based prr and the seasonal prr respectively a positive prr indicates that the cell acts as a sink of pollution and removes the pollutant from the inflow while a negative prr suggests that the cell is a source of pollution and leaches the pollutant as the quantity and quality datasets collected from the cells were generally found to not be normally distributed using the anderson darling test nonparametric statistic tests were employed herein note that the data used are not censored the mann whitney test was applied to compare the medians of two samples while the kruskal wallis test was used for comparison among more than two samples to characterize the temporal evolution of water quality both n and p of cell outflow the non parametric mann kendall test was employed to detect the presence of an upward or downward trend with the event number namely time the correlation analysis spearman s correlation was used to calculate the correlation coefficient between two variables in addition the nonlinear regression using the exponential function was employed to examine the relationship between the n leaching and the cumulative inflow the cumulative inflow is the cumulated hydrological loading to the cells from the beginning of the study period to a simulated event the regression equation can be used as a regression model for predicting the dependent variable the n leaching the regression residual analysis and the regression model performance evaluation were also conducted in the regression residual analysis the anderson darling test and run test were employed to validate the assumptions of normal distribution and independence of residuals respectively to evaluate the regression model performance the determination of coefficient r2 and root mean square error rmse were employed all statistical tests were performed at the 5 significance level which is commonly used in the literature 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrological performance the seasonal wrr indicating the hydrological performance over the study period is presented in table 1 for all cells the seasonal wrr of the amendment cells except the egg cell was in the range of 35 39 note that there was about a 10 difference in the seasonal wrr of the two control cells c1 and c2 in addition as discussed in the following sections differences in water quality between these two control cells were also observed among all of these cells the egg cell which had a seasonal wrr of 46 3 appeared to outperform all other amendment and control cells in retaining stormwater over the study period all other amendment cells had a slightly lower and higher wrr compared to the c1 and c2 cells respectively as all cells have the same configuration the difference in the seasonal wrr can be associated with various factors such as vegetation growth and moisture condition in addition the infiltration rates measured in the first three simulated events were in the range of 150 350 mm hr and not observed to decrease over time during the study period furthermore fig 2 displays the variation in the average event based wrr among the 4 9 14 and 24 mm events respectively for each cell it is apparent that for all cells the event based wrr always decreased with an increase in event magnitude more specifically the average event based wrr of all cells decreased from approximately 50 in the 4 mm events to around 20 in the 24 mm events this result is consistent with the findings in previous studies liu et al 2014 li et al 2009 and mahmoud et al 2019 argued that bioretention systems are more effective in reducing runoff in small to medium sized storm events in addition thompson et al 2008 also found a negative correlation between the wrr of bioretention systems and the rainfall depth the findings can be explained by the fact that the spaces to store and hold water in the media is independent of the event magnitude consequently the increased inflow event magnitude leads to the decreased wrr observed in addition for the 4 and 9 mm events the egg cell appeared to be superior in retaining water among all cells while its superiority was not apparent in the 14 and 24 mm events the higher seasonal wrr observed from the egg cell was due to its higher wrr in the small to medium sized events in contrast the c2 cell which had the lowest seasonal wrr generally had the lowest event based wrr over all the different magnitude events 3 2 seasonal water quality performance it has been acknowledged that pollutant removal by bioretention systems can be partially ascribed to their water retention liu et al 2014 brown and hunt 2012 komlos and traver 2012 for unlined bioretention systems pollutants further percolating into underlying soil also counts as pollutants removed by the systems however in this study due to the absence of percolation into underlying soil pollutants removed are completely retained within the cells the observed differences in the wrr among the cells and among the different event sizes further indicate the need to examine the water quality performance of the cells in terms of both loading and concentration therefore the effects of the amendments on n and p discharge were examined in terms of both the emc and prr in the following sections throughout this paper if an amendment cell has a higher i e in absolute terms negative prr than the control cells the amendment cell leached more pollutant than the control cell and thus the amendment is considered ineffective in reducing the leaching of the pollutant and vice versa if the emc of a pollutant of an amendment cell is higher than that of the control cells the amendment is considered ineffective in reducing the degree concentration of leaching and vice versa table 2 summarizes the seasonal emcs of p rp and tp and n nitrate and tn of the inflow and the outflow of the cells as well as their seasonal prrs both the control cells leached rp and tp which are indicated by their negative seasonal prrs 463 81 and 999 36 for rp and 31 92 and 112 46 for tp for the c1 and c2 cells respectively therefore the control cells behaved as sources of rp and tp over the study period the seasonal prrs of rp of the wtr 52 80 sm 44 17 and aa 28 01 cells were positive and thus the cells were sinks of rp in contrast the other three amendment cells were a source of rp indicated by their negative seasonal prrs 125 14 101 22 and 125 21 for the egg dry and pf cells respectively nevertheless compared to the control cells 1 11 and 1 77 mg l the lower seasonal emcs of rp of these three amendment cells in the range of 0 08 0 46 mg l suggest that these amendment cells leached rp to a lesser degree differing from rp the seasonal prrs of tp of all amendment cells in the range of 2 82 to 59 67 were positive thus all amendment cells behaved as sinks of tp whereas the control cells leached tp over the study period all these results demonstrate that all amendments investigated were effective in preventing or mitigating p leaching from bioretention systems but at different degrees among the amendment cells the wtr cell outperformed all other amendment cells as it had a positive and highest seasonal pprs 52 80 for rp and 59 67 for tp as well as the lowest seasonal emcs 0 08 mg l for rp and 0 49 mg l for tp of p in addition the sm and aa cells also performed well as they also behaved as sinks of both rp and tp over the study period as for nitrate and tn negative seasonal prrs were calculated for all cells including the control cells over the study period table 2 as a result all cells leached both n species whereas some cells i e the dry wtr and sm cells exported less n than the control cells as the seasonal prrs of these cells are higher than those of both control cells therefore these amendments the dry wtr and sm were also beneficial in reducing n leaching relative to the control cells however the other amendments especially egg might increase n leaching when comparing with the seasonal emcs of nitrate and tn of the control cells amendments such as dry wtr and sm were shown to be beneficial in reducing mitigating the degree of n leaching as these cells had lower seasonal emcs whereas other amendments i e the egg pf and aa were not it has been acknowledged that n leaching can be quite variable as bioretention media often contain different nitrogen containing compounds and n transformations can occur within the systems patel et al 2020 among the amendments the egg consisted of a hard outer shell and a soft inner white skin which contains organic matter including nitrogen in the form of proteins the highest seasonal emcs and the lowest seasonal prrs of n species observed from the egg cell among all cells including the control cells support that using egg to amend bioretention media would introduce an additional source of n to bioretention systems dattatray and nair 2019 as for the aa and pf amendments which are two commercial amendments and do not contain n the al aa and fe pf ions could accelerate the dissociation of water molecules in bioretention systems and consequently accelerate the nitrification of n in media and cause the leaching of n rosenband and gany 2010 3 3 event based performance on phosphorus discharge 3 3 1 phosphorus event mean concentration as discussed previously all amendments were shown to be capable of preventing mitigating p leaching of bioretention systems over the study period the effects of amendments in reducing p concentrations were further examined at the event based scale fig 3 shows the event based emcs of rp and tp of all simulated events for each cell using whisker box plots it is apparent that overall the emcs of rp and tp of all amendment cells were lower than those of the control cells the medians of the event based tp and rp emcs of the c2 cell were found to be significantly higher than those of the c1 cell in the mann whitney test although significant differences in the event based emcs between the c1 and c2 cells were detected the medians of the event based emcs of all amendment cells were significantly lower than those of both the c1 and c2 cells tested using the kruskal wallis test this reaffirms that all amendments were capable of reducing the p concentrations of the outflow among the amendment cells wtr sm and aa cells were significantly more effective in reducing the p concentrations as their medians were significantly lower than those of the other amendment cells tested using the kruskal wallis test among the wtr sm and aa cells the medians of emcs of p species of the wtr cell were in general but not significantly lower than the other two cells tested using the kruskal wallis test recall that the wtr sm and aa amendments outperformed the other amendments when evaluating in terms of the seasonal emcs of p as their seasonal emcs are lower than those of the other amendments table 2 therefore in terms of reducing p concentrations of the outflow the wtr amendment appeared to be superior followed by the sm and aa amendments in general the ratio of rp to tp of the growing media calculated using rp and tp measured from nutrient extraction right before the cell construction and the average ratio of rp and tp of inflows over the study period were 93 3 and 17 3 respectively the ratio of the outflow varied significantly among the cells in the outflow of the c1 and c2 cells rp accounted for 62 4 and 72 0 of tp respectively in contrast the ratio of rp in the outflow of the amendment cells ranged from 16 3 to 45 5 which was lower than that of the control cells and bioretention media thus it is not surprising that the adsorption of the soluble p i e rp is the primary mechanism behind the function of the amendments besides vegetation uptake can be the other mechanism to reduce p leaching from the vegetated cells the role of vegetation is discussed in more details in section 3 5 2 3 3 2 temporal evolution of phosphorus event mean concentration the average rp and tp emcs of the inflow were 0 16 and 0 69 mg l respectively while their standard deviations were 0 27 and 0 42 mg l respectively among the cells some cells leached p in similar temporal evolution patterns fig 4 illustrates the temporal evolution with the event number of the event based emcs of tp and rp for three selected cells the c2 sm and pf cells as examples the c2 cell demonstrated increasing p emcs with the event number namely time overall moreover the mann kendall test confirmed the presence of the significant upward trend in the p emcs of the c2 cell as well as the c1 cell in contrast as shown in fig 4 both the sm and egg cells did not show an obvious increase in the p emcs with time the significant upward trend was not detected in the p emcs of all amendment cells in the mann kendall test in particular a significant downward trend in the p emcs was detected for the aa and sm cells over the study period in the mann kendall test the contrasting temporal evolution of the p emcs between the amendment cells and the control cells suggests that the effect of the amendments in reducing p concentrations became more prominent with time in the study period it is worth mentioning that the rp emc of the egg cell however notably increased after event 14 in addition as shown in fig 4 the p emcs of the c2 and egg cells were largely higher in events 6 and 9 than those in other events the time interval between these two events and their previous simulated event was 10 days which was longer than the time interval of the rest of the events 5 days this was also observed for the c1 dry and pf cells the result implies that more p was available in the cells to be discharged prior to these events due to the longer time interval a number of previous studies e g hunt et al 2006 shrestha et al 2018 cho et al 2011 li and davis 2016 pointed out that bioretention media drying dramatically increases the amount of leachable p because of crystallization of minerals and subsequently media could release additional p due to desorption under wetting conditions li et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 and mangangka et al 2014 also attributed a decreased p removal rate of bioretention systems to a long event interval in addition microbially bound nutrients are subject to release upon changing conditions such as in wetting and drying cycles parmar and singh 2014 although the microbial community is capable of enhancing nutrient removal through microbial assisted uptake and storing a significant portion of soil nutrients in their biomass on the other hand media saturation could increase p solubility due to desorption under extended saturation ann et al 1999 hurley et l 2017 therefore the long time interval between events and or the long saturation period in high magnitude events as well as the release of microbially bound nutrients might result in the observed elevated p emcs in these two events however the obviously high p emcs in these two events were not observed for the wtr sm and aa cells which were shown to be more effective in reducing p concentrations compared to the other amendment cells ultimately owing to the limited capacity of p adsorption of amendments it is thus desirable to observe the efficiency of amendments over a longer period of time for examining their service life 3 3 3 impact of the event magnitude on the event based phosphorus removal rate similar to the event based hydrological performance i e the event based wrr the event based prrs of tp and rp were found to be also associated with the event magnitude fig 5 shows the average event based prrs of tp and rp respectively for different event sizes for all cells both the c1 and c2 cells leached rp and tp in all events irrespective of the event magnitude except the c1 cell for the 4 mm events recall that over the study period positive seasonal prrs of rp were calculated from the wtr sm and aa cells while all amendment cells were reported to have positive seasonal prrs of tp table 2 the average event based prr of tp of the amendment cells was in general positive for all different event magnitudes except the pf cell in the medium to high magnitude events i e the 9 14 and 24 mm events and the egg and dry cells in the high magnitude events i e the 24 mm events however the average event based prr of rp of the amendment cells was in general negative for all different event magnitudes a positive average event based prr of rp was observed for the wtr sm and aa cells in the medium magnitude events and for wtr for the high magnitude events overall the amendment cells except the pf cell were effective in reducing tp loading in the small to medium magnitude events while some cells including the wtr sm and aa cells reduced the rp loading in the medium and or high magnitude events the results revealed that tp was more susceptible to a discharge from the systems with increase in event magnitude whereas rp was more susceptible to a discharge for the smaller magnitude events water movement through media soil is a function of both the hydraulic conductivity and the driving force according to darcy s law under saturated conditions the driving force would be higher in large magnitude events which can be ascribed to a high ponding depth and or a long ponding duration compared to small magnitude events shrestha et al 2018 which monitored eight roadside bioretention cells demonstrated that the increased outflow rate was significantly positively correlated to precipitation depth increased peak inflow rate and others thus more particulate p could be washed out during the larger magnitude events due to more rapid flow the observed differences in behavior in rp and tp of the amendment cells can be explained by the different processes governing their removal leaching particulate p is mostly removed by filtration and sedimentation while soluble p is removed by adsorption li and davis 2016 shrestha et al 2018 therefore the discharge of soluble p is speculated to be both a function of the amount of leachable soluble p in bioretention systems and the adsorption capacity of media rather than the flow rate event magnitude whereas more particulate p would be discharged in lager events 3 3 4 effects of the mixture percentage and the type of amendments on phosphorus discharge in literature a large number of amendments at various mixture percentages ranging from 3 to 17 in volume have been used to improve p removal and or reduce p leaching of bioretention systems e g goh et al 2015 balch et al 2013 yan et al 2018 malcolm et al 2014 whereas the majority of the previous studies have used a mixture percentage that is in a 5 to 10 range among the six amendments investigated the egg dry and wtr amendments were mixed at 10 in volume with bioretention media while the aa sm and pf amendments were mixed at 5 in volume as shown in table 2 and figs 3 and 5 all amendment cells outperformed the two control cells in reducing tp and rp concentrations and their loading in the outflow while the wtr cell performed best among the amendment cells closely followed by the sm and aa cells given that the mixture percentage of the wtr was double of that of the sm and aa amendments the higher content of the wtr in the cell might lead to its superior performance thus further exploration on the optimal mixture percentage of amendments is desirable in addition although the use of the wtr amendment is economical its composition can vary with the operation of water treatment plants the wtr amendment used in this study is al rich while the wtr can also be fe rich a few studies liu et al 2014 o neill and davis 2012 agyin birikorang and o connor 2009 patel et al 2020 have even pointed out that the addition of other adsorbent metals to the wtr amendment might be necessary to improve its efficiency moreover the no cost amendments i e dry and egg amendments are not readily available as granular media the granulation of the materials is speculated to affect their performance as finer products might perform better from quality perspective but not from the hydrologic perspective therefore to guarantee the efficiency of the no cost amendments such as the wtr and dry ones in real practice the quality assurance and control of the products would be required the amendments applied in bioretention systems have often been metal ion based and thus expected to enhance the adsorption of soluble p as well as p sedimentation in which the metal ions of the amendments facilitate sorption or precipitation among the commercial amendments including the sm pf and aa ones at the same 5 mixture percentage the sm and aa amendments performed similarly and both were superior to the pf one comparing the sm and pf amendments both of which are fe rich amendments the minor amount of oxide aluminum granular in the sm one might be the reason why the sm cell outperformed the pf cell in addition among the no cost amendments including the wtr egg and dry ones at the same 10 mixture percentage the wtr amendment containing both al primarily and fe significantly outperformed the egg and dry ones both of which are ca rich amendments it has been well demonstrated in the literature e g siwek et al 2019 yan et al 2017 gypser et al 2021 almanassra et al 2021 that metal ions ca fe or al have adsorption capacity for p among the metal ions ca is shown to have the lowest capacity of p sorption almanassra et al 2021 this explains the lower performance of both the egg and dry amendments in particular when compared to the wtr sm and aa ones therefore the al rich and fe rich amendements might outperform the ca rich amendments in general when applied with the same mixture percentage 3 4 event based performance on nitrogen discharge 3 4 1 nitrogen event mean concentration as discussed previously all amendment cells leached n over the study period but some amendments including the dry wtr and sm ones were shown to be beneficial in reducing the n leaching as less n leached from these cells compared to the control cells table 2 the metal oxidation can increase the negative surface charge density thereby increasing the adsorption of nitrate and ammonium mia et al 2017 in contrast the other amendments in particular the egg one were found to introduce extra n into the bioretention cells table 2 in general the average ratios of nitrate to tn of the outflows of all cells including the control cells were significantly different from that of the inflow in the outflow of all cells nitrate accounted for 87 3 93 9 of tn while in the inflow nitrate only amounted to 29 1 of tn these results further suggest that n leached from the media and or amendments within the cells similarly the emcs of n of the cells also showed that the egg amendment constituted a consistent source of n over the study period fig 6 shows the event based emcs of tn and nitrate of all simulated events for each cell using whisker box plots both the medians of the event based emcs of tn and nitrate of the egg cell were significantly higher than those of all the other cells including the two control cells tested using the kruskal wallis test when comparing the medians of the event based emcs of tn and nitrate of all the other amendment cells to those of the control cells using the kruskal wallis test the medians of the pf and dry cells were found to be statistically equivalent to those of the control cells while the medians of the wtr sm and aa cells were significantly lower than those of the control cells these results suggest that when selecting an amendment to reduce p leaching or improve p removal consideration of whether the amendment would introduce more leachable n into bioretention systems is desirable the processes to remove n include ammonification nitrification denitrification volatilization and vegetation uptake liu et al 2014 the addition of the amendments which are designated for reducing p leaching is not expected to directly improve or hinder these processes and consequently not largely affect the system performance in removing or leaching n the observed differences among the cells except the egg cell in leaching n might be ascribed to other factors such as media moisture and vegetation etc which was further discussed in section 3 5 of this paper 3 4 2 temporal evolution of nitrogen event mean concentration except the egg cell all other cells including the control cells demonstrated the same pattern of the temporal evolution of n leaching fig 7 thus illustrates the temporal evolution with the event number of the event based emcs of tn and nitrate for three selected cells including a control cell i e the c2 cell the egg cell and one other amended cell i e the wtr cell as examples differing from the temporal evolution of the emcs of p species both the emcs of tn and nitrate significantly decreased with the event number over time tested by the mann kendall test in particular the emcs of n of both control cells c1 and c2 and the amended cells except the egg cell largely declined with time before event 7 and then slowly decreased afterwards compared among the amendment cells the egg cell appeared to leach n at a higher rate over the study period the hydrological loading from the beginning of the study to event 7 was about 35 of the total hydrological loading while the loadings of nitrate and tn of outflow of the cells were 83 99 and 81 98 of their total loadings over the study period respectively these results suggest that the majority of n quickly leached out from these cells at the beginning of the study period the observations on the n leaching from the cells appeared to be consistent with those observed from bioretention systems by chahal et al 2016 and palmer et al 2013 as well as from the green roofs by akther et al 2021 moreover akther et al 2021 argued that the n leaching is primarily governed by the wash off process and can be mathematically represented by the exponential decay function of the cumulative inflow fig 8 shows the regression lines models i e the exponential equations of the event based emcs of tn and nitrate on the cumulative inflow as well as the residuals and the model performance evaluation metrics including r2 and rmse of the regression models for the c2 egg and wtr cells as examples the residuals were found not normally distributed in the lilliefors test whereas they were found to be random in several cases e g nitrate of the c1 and egg cells and tn of the c1 cells in the run test each dataset consists of 20 data points which are not considered large generally speaking a larger sample is desired to correctly reject the null hypothesis in hypothesis tests when evaluating the performance of the regression models the r2 of the models is larger than 0 95 while the root mean square error rmse is less than 10 mg l for all cells except the egg cell regardless of whether the cells were amended or not therefore from the modeling perspective the cumulative inflow can reasonably well predict the leaching of tn and nitrate in general as for the egg cell a high rmse greater than20 mg l was reported although a high r2 was calculated for the event based emcs of nitrate and tn the relatively low performance of the regression model for the egg cell would suggest that for the egg amendment the additional source of n might alter the wash off process of the n leaching to a certain degree due to the decomposition of the egg amendment in bioretention media over the study period 3 5 other potential influential factors on amended bioretention systems 3 5 1 effects of antecedent media moisture during the study period the antecedent moisture right before the onset of the simulated events at the surface 5 cm depth of all cells were measured manually and it ranged from 0 076 to 0 426 m3 m3 as illustrated in fig 9 and the test results of the sample comparison in the kruskal wallis test the median of the antecedent moisture of the egg cell was statistically equivalent to that of the two control cells whereas significantly lower than that of all the other amendment cells recall that the seasonal wrr of the egg cell was highest among all cells followed by the c1 cell table 2 to a certain extent the low antecedent moisture of the egg and c1 cells could explain their higher seasonal wrr over the study period moreover the event based wrr was found to be significantly negatively correlated with the antecedent moisture for the cells except for the egg and dry cells as the calculated spearman s correlation coefficient was in the range of 0 59 to 0 66 the insignificant spearman s correlation coefficients calculated for the egg and dry cells were 0 22 and 0 38 respectively it has been acknowledged that the capacity of media storage for retaining water is dependent on both the intrinsic media properties and the associated effective storage capacity prior to a storm event which relates to the environmental factors fassman beck et al 2015 the addition of the amendments which were in different sizes e g coarser dry and egg amendments than others is speculated to affect the intrinsic media properties and thus the water holding capacity of media at different degrees the observed relationship between the antecedent moisture and the event based wrr in general might suggest the impact of the effective storage prior to a storm event on the event based wrr might be more prominent than the impact of the addition of amendments at the mixture percentage either 5 or 10 on the intrinsic media properties several previous studies khan et al 2012 li et al 2009 thompson et al 2008 have pointed out the importance of the antecedent moisture condition on the water retention especially for small magnitude events of bioretention systems the results from this study support the above arguments that a lower antecedent soil moisture which makes more storage available before a storm event will result in a higher wrr with respect to water quality in general low and insignificant spearman s correlation coefficients negative or positive were calculated between the antecedent moisture and the event based emcs of nutrients however among the amendment cells the egg and pf cells had a relatively but not significantly lower antecedent moisture fig 9 tested in the kruskal wallis test which was coincident with the observed significantly or relatively higher emcs and the seasonal prrs of p and n of these two cells table 2 and figs 3 and 6 this result imply that the drier condition between events for these cells might likely lead to a higher discharge of nutrients this is consistent with the notion that media drying after wetting can increase the amount of leachable nutrients and thus release additional p and n during subsequent rainfall events as discussed previously 3 5 2 effects of vegetation to quantitatively measure the growth of vegetation in the cells the height of the deschampsia cespitosa commonly knows as tufted hairgrass which was highest was measured at the beginning and end of the study period among all the cells the tufted hairgrass in the egg cell 44 9 cm was reported to have the highest growth followed by the two control cells 43 5 43 7 cm while the tufted hairgrass growth of all the other amendment cells was similar in the range of 39 9 42 0 cm and lower than that of the egg and the two control cells although it is challenging to measure vegetation height accurately the preliminary observation implies that the use of the amendments possibly has influence on the vegetation growth among the amendments the egg one is known to be capable of enhancing vegetation growth dattatray et al 2019 the vegetation growth measured appears to be consistent with the calculated seasonal wrr of all cells except the cell c2 namely a higher seasonal wrr corresponded to a higher vegetation growth their positive but insignificant spearman s correlation coefficient 0 14 might imply the potential role of vegetation on the wrr furthermore the egg cell and the two control cells which were observed to have a higher vegetation growth were reported to have a lower antecedent moisture fig 9 this appears to confirm the role of vegetation in enhancing the hydrological performance of bioretention systems namely in increasing the wrr through vegetative transpiration the role of vegetative transpiration on the hydrological performance has been also observed by li et al 2009 wadzuk et al 2015 and ebrahimian et al 2019 besides vegetation of bioretention systems has been demonstrated to be beneficial in improving nutrient removal for example through the nutrient uptake from the media dagenaisa et al 2018 liu et al 2014 shrestha et al 2018 however the spearman s correlation coefficients of the vegetation growth and the seasonal emcs of nutrients were significant and positive in the range of 0 69 0 91 the calculated positive correlation coefficients implies that the expected role of vegetation through nutrient uptake on the water quality performance of the cells was absent further investigation on the role of vegetation using more elaborate vegetation traits such as biomass and leaf area index is recommended 4 study implications and limitations in literature nutrient leaching from bioretention systems has been documented in particular during their initial conditions this might be resulted from the use of nutrient rich growing media to support the establishment and development of vegetation the field experiment in this paper demonstrated nutrient leaching from the control cells without amendments which would be a critical issue to be dealt with when implementing bioretention systems for better stormwater management a study by akther et al 2020 concluded that the initial nutrient contents of growing media might be an important factor affecting the degree of nutrient leaching the physicochemical properties of growing media of biorientation systems could be largely different due to the use of different media in different regions the potential and degree of nutrient leaching as well as the length of nutrient leaching might vary among different media and consequently bioretention systems thus in practice the examination of nutrient leaching of growing media before field installation is recommended in addition the results from this paper also revealed the different performance of different amendments in mitigating nutrient leaching the use of amendments for reducing p leaching would possibly increase n leaching e g the egg cell in this paper therefore the selection of appropriate or optimal amendments would be the key to ensure the success of the strategy of using amendments to mitigate nutrient leaching of bioretention systems to amend bioretention media various waste by products have been examined and implemented to enhance nutrient removal or to mitigate nutrient leaching of bioretention systems this paper also confirmed that amending media with waste by products i e egg dry wtr can mitigate p leaching from bioretention systems however differing from commercial products their physiochemical properties may vary for instance nutrients may be present in wtr such as nutrients removed from source water in addition wtr contents may vary seasonally as the quality of source water can present seasonal variation moreover the results from this paper demonstrated that eggshells could be the extra source of n leached from the egg cell thus waste by products might potentially become extra sources of nutrients leached although the use of waste by products is economical further research is recommended to relate their performance to their physicochemical parameters to ensure selecting efficient and reliable waste by products for mitigating nutrient leaching in practice it is worth mentioning that the field observation was conducted during the initial conditions i e the first year of the operation of the bioretention cells as demonstrated by the results in this paper the degree of nutrient leaching i e emcs of nutrients is not stationary and evolves changes with time figs 4 and 7 therefore it is speculated that the degree of nutrient leaching observed from the cells in the first year of their operation would differ from that observed in the next years more specifically as growing media are the primary source of nutrients leached during the initial conditions the degree of nutrient leaching would overall decline with the progression of nutrient leaching this could be ascribed to the reduction of leachable nutrients in growing media whereas the length of nutrient leaching might vary between n and p as well as the physicochemical properties of media and or amendments used moreover amendments mixed at a percentage in construction are not expected to function in mitigating p leaching or improving p removal over the lifespan of bioretention systems a long term study spanning multiple years is indeed required to examine the efficiency of the amendments over a long time period for example until the cease of nutrient leaching or the end of the function of amendments in addition the field monitoring of the cells was conducted in the growing season in the study area bioretention systems would experience several freezing and thawing cycles ftcs in long and cold winters due to the interspersed brief warm periods locally known as chinooks several times in a year ding et al 2019 confirmed in the laboratory setting that ftc can increase the saturated hydraulic conductivity and nearly completely remove nitrate and phosphate applied to the experimental bioretention columns moreover kratky et al 2017 argued that the removal of nutrients as well as other dissolved contaminants are significantly variable in cold temperatures the temperature is expected to affect the adsorption of amendments and consequently the efficacy of amendments in mitigating nutrient leaching in cold winter further research on the performance of amendments in cold winters is of particular interest for cold climate regions in this field experimental study the control cell was duplicated while the amendment cells were constructed without duplication as shown by the results differences in the seasonal wrr about 10 and water quality were observed between these two control cells whereas the temporal evolution pattern of the event based nutrient emcs with time event number observed from these two control cells was similar the inhomogeneous media might be the possible cause of the observed quantitative differences between these two control cells the inclusion of replication of the amendment cells are desired however the use of replicated cells is often limited due to economic constraints especially when conducting research in the field to examine a large number of treatments for instance a study by ding et al 2019 which examined the effects of freezing and thawing on water infiltration and nutrient removal of bioretention cells under cold climate conditions in the laboratory setting validated the observation among the data collected from six injections rather than single injection short term experiments in which replicates are key to draw reliable conclusions although the amendment cells were not duplicated triplicated each cell was monitored in 20 simulated events during the study period the similar temporal evolution of n leaching except the egg cell in which egg is expected to be the additional source of n could validate the consistency in the results to quantify the error for amended cells which could originate from various potential sources including homogeneity of materials measurements experimental procedure etc the use of replications is desired if it is not cost prohibitive during the study period the cells also received natural rainfall if outflow is generated in a natural event nutrients also leach out from the cells the amount of natural rainfall measured during the study period is 154 mm recoded by the meteorological station installed onsite while the total rainfall of simulated events is 200 mm in addition note that the i p ratio is 1 for natural events whereas it is 15 for simulate events as a result the hydrological loading of natural events was much lower than that of simulated events therefore this study did not take natural rainfall into account when assessing the seasonal performance of the bioretention cells 5 conclusions to examine the efficiency of six selected amendments in reducing p discharge from bioretention systems during their initial operation six amended cells and two control cells were constructed and monitored soon after their construction in the 2020 growing season in a field experiment the effects of amendments on both the hydrological performance in terms of wrr and water quality performance in terms of emc and prr were investigated overall the amendments did not have a significant impact on the wrr it was not surprising to find that the wrr decreased with increasing event magnitude all amendments were found to be capable of preventing or mitigating p leaching from bioretention systems over the study period but to different degrees this was clearly reflected by the increased prrs and the decreased emcs of tp and rp of the amended cells compared to those of the control cells among the amendments the egg one was demonstrated to constitute an extra source of n leached as eggshells contain organic compounds i e shell membrane which is rich in protein and therefore n all other amendments were shown to not significantly alter the prrs and emcs of tn and nitrate relatively to the control cells and have similar temporal evolution patterns as the control cells namely decreasing with time the cumulative inflow exponentially overall the amendments except for the egg one did not obviously affect the n discharge from bioretention systems in addition regardless of whether the cells were amended or not the antecedent moisture and the vegetation growth which are potentially linked appeared to affect the wrr overall among the six selected amendments the egg one even though economical might not be a good option as it did not outperform the other amendments in reducing p discharge but did introduce extra leachable n into the systems even though it improved the wrr and possibly enhanced vegetation growth the wtr amendment mixed at 10 outperformed all other amendments followed by the aa and sm ones mixed at 5 thus further investigation on the mixture percentage of the amendments is recommended moreover the composition of the wtr amendment might vary as a function of the operation of the water treatment plant that supplied the material extra caution is therefore needed when using wtr amendments to amend bioretention systems although n leaches rapidly at the beginning of the system operation its mitigation is also desired to enhance the benefits of bioretention systems in managing stormwater runoff as the removal of n and p is governed by different processes technologies for reducing n leaching e g temporally creating a saturated zone in the drainage layer to promote denitrification could be combined with the use of amendments to reduce the leaching of nutrients both n and p from bioretention systems credit authorship contribution statement y zhang
