8020,study region cathedral peak research catchments ukhahlamba drakensberg mountain range south africa study focus the focus was to determine the seasonal pattern of evapotranspiration et over a bracken canopy which is a product of degradation within the montane grasslands of the ukhahlamba drakensberg mountains surface renewal sr was investigated as a viable alternative to eddy covariance for long term estimation of et within a remote high rainfall montane landscape the sr dissipation method was used to observe et over the bracken canopy for 23 months across two consecutive years with variable seasonal rainfall timing and amounts besides et rainfall and energy flux components were observed new hydrological insights for the region the sr dissipation method was shown to be adequate for the long term estimation of evapotranspiration over a bracken canopy within a remote high summer rainfall montane landscape the bracken canopy was found to have a distinct seasonal cycle autumn was most sensitive to rainfall amount and timing as late annual rainfall during autumn decreases bracken et compared to higher summer rainfall followed by a lower autumn rainfall comparing the evapotranspiration of bracken from this study to the evapotranspiration of natural grassland in previous studies the largest difference in evapotranspiration between the canopies occurs in winter keywords bracken energy balance land cover change mountainous region 1 introduction following years of overgrazing and poor land management in areas of the northern drakensberg strategic water source area swsa south africa parts of the landscape have become heavily degraded hoffman and todd 2000 grab and knight 2018 the degradation manifests as reduced ground cover changes in species composition invasion of non native species and erosion of high carbon rich soils asmal 1995 bangamwabo 2009 everson et al 2011 grellier et al 2013 a common invader associated with the degradation of the montane grasslands within the drakensberg escarpment is pterdium aquilnim grab and knight 2018 which is an aggressive and dominating weed mcglone et al 2005 commonly referred to as bracken there is a heavy dependence on the natural resource base of this landscape at national regional and local scales as a result the livelihoods of the local population are closely linked to the natural resources and ecosystem integrity thus the need for sustainable and equitable management of land water and soil is crucial however the influence of degradation on the water balance of these high altitude fire adapted montane grassland areas is not well understood one of the contributing reasons is a lack of hydroclimatic data available for high altitude fire adapted mountainous regions particularly in developing countries a key component of the hydrological cycle that is altered by the change in land cover due to degradation is evapotranspiration et li et al 2017 et is also the process which links the energy and water balances castellví 2011 since et is comprised of evaporation and transpiration pozníková et al 2018 mbangiwa et al 2019 both are altered when a land cover change occurs net radiation r n air temperature humidity wind speed and canopy conductance influence cause the variability of et while the closeness of actual et to potential et is determined by precipitation and soil water huizhi and jianwu 2012 how et is altered by land degradation in montane grasslands areas is not well understood and the most effective method to achieve this is through in situ observations williams et al 2012 south africa is a developing country where infrastructure for observation and long term datasets are scarce risk of theft of equipment and damage by animals or fires is high in the remote fire adapted montane grasslands of the northern drakensberg escarpment brown and bezuidenhout 2020 combined with extreme topographical characteristics of the drakensberg escarpment these risks added restrictions on the equipment that can be placed at a monitoring site therefore the need to identify and validate a viable and adequate method for the estimation of et within such a summer rainfall landscape is required to be able to contribute to the knowledge on seasonal et over degraded montane grasslands the most common and robust method used for the measurement of et is the eddy covariance ec method snyder et al 2008 castellví and snyder 2009a kelley and higgins 2018 cui and chui 2019 morán et al 2020 the ec approach does however come with several limitations such as a strict fetch requirement a need for a homogeneous canopy and relatively flat terrain castellví et al 2002 snyder et al 2008 haymann et al 2019 as well as energy balance closure discrepancies linquist et al 2015 the ec methodology and sensors are also complex and expensive snyder et al 2008 castellví and snyder 2009a poblete echeverría et al 2014 morán et al 2020 the complexity of the method combined with the expense has limited the application of the method in resource constrained countries and situations rosa et al 2013 hu et al 2018 suvočarev et al 2020 these factors have driven evapotranspiration research towards alternatives to ec with fewer limitations and a simpler methodology over the recent decades an example of an alternative method for et estimation is that of surface renewal sr snyder et al 2008 the sr method uses high frequency air temperature measurements and the structure function theory van atta 1977 to estimate h from which le may be calculated as a residual of the shortened energy balance the ability of sr to estimate h and to estimate it well is an important aspect of the method as h is a parameter for the sr method snyder et al 2008 morán et al 2020 furthermore the sr method also consists of a simpler methodology to achieve et estimations with less strict fetch and siting requirements snyder et al 2015 and utilises fewer sensors than the ec method drexler et al 2004 castellví et al 2006 snyder et al 2008 kelley and higgins 2018 using the shortened surface energy balance le can be estimated as a residual once net radiation r n and soil heat flux g are accounted for snyder et al 1996 spano et al 2000 as a result accurate measurement of r n is critical for accurate et estimation using sr hu et al 2018 the sr method has been shown to be a viable method over both homogeneous and heterogeneous canopies mengistu and savage 2010b suvočarev et al 2014 sr is potentially a more viable option for the long term monitoring of et within developing countries where long term datasets are scarce kelley and higgins 2018 the sr method is based on the theory presented in the appendix an exchange of fluxes occurs when a parcel of air makes contact with the canopy top mengistu and savage 2010b these exchanges are identified in the high frequency air temperature measurements as ramp events mengistu and savage 2010b see appendix ramp events paragraph the original sr approach sr1 method follows this approach for the estimation of h which is considered uncorrected due to the understanding that since it does not account for the uneven heating of the air parcel castellví et al 2002 2016 an α value is then calculated through calibration which is carried out by concurrent sr1 measurements of h and an independent measure of h at the same site the α is determined as the slope of the regression between the uncorrected h of sr1 and the independent measure of h which is often ec poblete echeverría et al 2014 shapland et al 2014 the α value is applied to the uncorrected h h ucsr1 to calculate the corrected h h sr1 estimated by sr1 the calibration of the sr1 method is only required once or twice per season for a canopy that does not significantly change in height or density and can be applied to sites with similar vegetation structure and measurement height snyder et al 2008 currently a significant limitation of sr1 is the requirement for a calibration period with an independent measure of h drexler et al 2004 castellví and snyder 2009b mengistu and savage 2010b poblete echeverría et al 2014 however alternative sr approaches have been developed that make the requirement for calibration unnecessary the alternative sr approach the sr dissipation theory srdt method of castellví and snyder 2009b see appendix srdt paragraph follows the same theory as sr1 but uses the standard deviation of air temperature σ t mengistu and savage 2010b and the determination of zero plane displacement d castellví and snyder 2009b to determine an α value with no additional sensors comparisons between ec and sr have been documented for natural vegetation types such as grasslands snyder et al 1996 spano et al 1997 castellví and snyder 2009b 2010 savage 2014 and wetlands zapata and martínez cob 2001 drexler et al 2004 clulow et al 2012 over grassland the sr1 method has been shown to compare favourably with ec measurements of h snyder et al 1996 spano et al 1997 as has the srdt method which provided a good estimation for unstable conditions and thus bodes well for the estimation of et castellví and snyder 2009b globally observation of seasonal et over grassland burba and verma 2005 li et al 2005 mielnick et al 2005 zhang et al 2007 wieser et al 2008 krishnan et al 2012 da silva et al 2017 han et al 2018 rubert et al 2018 yue et al 2019 has been widely documented in literature as well as for degraded grasslands due to land abandonment rosset et al 2001 or overgrazing and intensive farming which leads to increased bare soil coverage liu et al 2008 huizhi and jianwu 2012 coners et al 2016 feng and liu 2016 reichert et al 2017 interestingly li et al 2012 found et over a degraded grassland during the growing season was sensitive to r n in comparison with a good condition grassland et of the degraded grassland was shown to be lower in the growing season due to less vegetation cover and higher in the non growing season rosset et al 2001 found that the overall difference in et of a managed and abandoned grassland was small but larger differences were found during early and late stages of canopy development as compared to the small differences when both canopies were more active liu et al 2008 and liu and feng 2012 found degraded grasslands to have an et near to total precipitation for the observation period while reichert et al 2017 found et to be about 30 of precipitation indicating that et is potentially related to a difference in climate variables at the site in consideration the dominant invader of the drakensberg montane grasslands bracken has received attention in literature where it too is a common invader in cultivated landscapes in mexico schnieder 2004 douterlungne et al 2010 berget et al 2015 and found in areas of human disturbance in new zealand mcglone et al 2005 the focus of such literature is on the removal and reduction in the spread of bracken but literature on understanding the hydrological implications of bracken invasion is lacking the only known study by springer et al 2006 investigated the et of a bracken fern and graminoid understory in a semi arid climate using temporal change in volumetric water content to draw conclusions regarding et given this background the objective of the paper was to determine the seasonal pattern of et for a bracken canopy in a degraded montane grassland including the influence of seasonal variations in rainfall on the et the focus is on the seasonal et of the bracken canopy which is the land cover often associated with degradation within the montane grasslands of the ukhahlamba drakensberg mountain range to achieve this sr with a focus on which sr method sr1 or srdt was evaluated as a viable alternative to ec for the long term estimation of et for the bracken canopy there is a dearth of information on seasonal bracken et which is addressed through this research besides clulow et al 2012 the use of sr within south africa and internationally for long term et estimates of natural vegetation is rare 2 materials and methods 2 1 research site the cathedral peak research catchments 28 58 32 14 s 29 14 8 72 e fig 1 located within the drakensberg mountain range have a long history of hydrological monitoring going back to 1948 nanni 1956 the research catchments consist of ten hydrologically separate catchments which were used historically to investigate the impacts of different land management treatments on streamflow nanni 1956 this current study was undertaken in catchment iii ciii of these ten research catchments the indigenous fire adapted themeda triandra grassland catchment was planted to pinus patula in 1959 toucher et al 2016 cathedral peak ciii is located in a high summer rainfall area within the drakensberg escarpment which has been identified as a strategic water resource area le maitre et al 2018 the region experiences wet hot summers and cool dry winters toucher et al 2016 ciii s mean annual precipitation map is 1 564 mm toucher et al 2016 summer rainfall which occurs mainly between october and march is driven by orographic mechanisms and is dominated by thunderstorms nanni 1956 bosch 1979 the hydrological year in the region begins in october and ends in september since the current period of observation 2014 present began in ciii the map has been 1 216 mm the 2018 2019 hydrological year was drier than average with 182 mm less rainfall than the 2014 2020 average while the 2019 2020 hydrological year received 68 mm more rainfall than average ciii has a north west aspect ranges in altitude from 1 845 2 317 m a s l and is the second largest of the research catchments with a catchment area of 1 4 km2 toucher et al 2016 following a fire in the catchment in 1981 which destroyed the p patula rehabilitation of the original grassland was attempted by planting the catchment to eragrositis curvula and an infrequent burning regime informed by experts was implemented toucher et al 2016 the rehabilitation was unsuccessful and the catchment has transitioned towards a degraded state with severe erosion on the upper steep slopes the degraded state of the catchment has led to the invasion by bracken which now dominates the catchment during the observation period an arson fire occurred on the 19th july 2019 which burnt out the entire catchment the soil was left exposed resulting in further erosion and complete repeated sedimentation of the weir at the outlet of the catchment although the bracken re established itself in the two months that followed the fire there was no litter layer below the bracken canopy and erosion continued prior to the arson fire the catchment had not been burnt for five years the pre fire vegetation was denser and had a litter layer contrasting with the post fire canopy the bracken changed seasonally with a dense green canopy in summer and senescence in winter resulting in a sparse canopy cover fig 2 the canopy height did not exceed 0 6 m during the observation period 2 2 observation equipment for the long term estimation of et 23 months the sr system was used the sr system was installed onto a tripod within a level area of ciii fig 1 on the 18th november 2018 the sr system consisted of two type e fine wire 76 µm diameter thermocouples campbell scientific inc logan united states of america placed at 1 0 m primary and 1 5 m secondary above the ground which were used for high frequency 10 hz air temperature measurements a four component net radiometer cnr4 kipp zonen delft the netherlands was positioned 2 5 m above the ground and extended 1 5 m out from the tripod on a cross arm and measured net radiation r n and albedo two self calibrating soil heat flux plates hfp01sc l hukseflux delft the netherlands were installed 0 08 m below the soil surface and 1 m apart alongside these plates four soil temperature averaging probes were installed two placed 0 06 m and the other two placed 0 02 m below the soil surface and above each soil heat flux plate between the soil heat flux plates a soil water reflectometer was installed at 0 025 m below the soil surface cs616 campbell these components were used to estimate soil heat flux g the sensors mentioned above were coupled to a campbell datalogger cr1000 the system was severely damaged in the arson fire on the 19th july 2019 procurement of replacement equipment took four months due to budget restrictions and insurance processes however observations re commencing on 31st october 2019 in order to demonstrate the adequacy of the sr approach a summer and winter campaign where an ec system was used alongside the sr system were conducted the ec system used included a 3 d sonic anemometer csat3a campbell combined with an open path gas analyser for h2o and co2 fluxes ec150 campbell which were positioned 2 5 m above the ground and attached to the tripod next to the sr system these two sensors were connected to an electronics panel ec100 campbell the electronics panel was then coupled to a campbell datalogger cr3000 the campbell easyflux dl program was used for ec data collection and processing of the h component of the shortened energy balance measured during the summer and winter campaigns rainfall was measured by a long term tipping bucket rain gauge te525 texas electronics texas united states of america 0 254 mm tip installed with the rim 1 2 m above the ground and located in close proximity to the tripod 160 m 2 3 estimation of energy fluxes following the estimation of h h srdt by the srdt method detailed in the introduction le can be calculated as the residual castellví 2004 hu et al 2018 of the shortened surface energy balance 1 r n g h le where r n is net radiation the soil heat flux g is calculated by accounting for that measured at a determined depth z and then determining the soil heat storage s above that depth by measuring the change in soil temperature δt s over time t and the calculated heat capacity of moist soil c s following the sampling of the bulk density of the soil at the site campbell scientific 2018 2 s t s c s z t following the calculation of le et can be estimated by accounting for the latent heat of vaporisation of water hu et al 2018 2 4 calculation of et o and k c the crop coefficient k c is a method used to understand the productivity of the vegetation which is estimated by comparing the estimate of the grass reference evapotranspiration et o with the estimated et et srdt from the srdt method 3 k c et srdt et o although the kc method is not commonly applied to determine natural vegetation productivity it has been successfully applied using et derived from the surface renewal method over natural vegetation types by drexler et al 2008 and clulow et al 2012 as well as being stated to be applicable to natural vegetation by allen 2003 and pereira et al 2015 the kc values estimated in eq 3 within this study are non standard as they are considered for varied environmental conditions and not standard conditions as outlined in fao 56 allen et al 1998 the fao penman monteith method which makes use of weather station data to provide an estimate of the et o and is a representation of the evaporative demand of the atmosphere at a given time was used allen et al 1998 2 5 data analysis a summer and winter campaign with ec and sr systems used concurrently was conducted to calibrate and determine α values required to calibrate the sr1 method and evaluate the performance of the sr method s ability to estimate h and subsequently et compared to the ec method only unstable atmospheric conditions were considered as these correspond to the times when most et occurs the summer campaign was conducted over eight days from 12 12 2019 19 12 2019 and the winter campaign conducted over nine days from 28 07 2020 05 08 2020 the estimation of h h sr1 by the sr1 method was achieved by processing the 10 hz high frequency air temperature measurements from the fine wire thermocouples and collected by the cr1000 datalogger from the primary fine wire thermocouple the secondary fine wire was used as a back up should the primary fine wire break during both the summer and winter campaigns no fine wire breakages were experienced following data download the calculated 30 minute second s r 2 third s r 3 and fifth order s r 5 air temperature structure functions were inserted into a formulated sr excel spreadsheet for the sr1 savage 2017 and srdt savage 2014 methods estimations of h ucsr1 were conducted for both time lags of 0 4 and 0 8 s the magnitude of the time lags is determined by the datalogger capabilities and are applied to the high frequency temperature measurements to determine the second third and fifth orders of structure function theory in real time van atta 1977 savage 2017 see appendix ramp events paragraph for the sr1 method an α value was calculated for both 0 4 and 0 8 s lags and applied to the 30 min h ucsr1 for both lags to provide 30 min h sr1 the h estimations for each lag were then averaged to provide a final 30 min h sr1 and h srdt as this method of averaging the different lags produced the lowest standard error when compared to h ec for the estimation of h h ec by the ec method data were processed by the cr3000 datalogger using the easyflux dl program from campbell scientific which is designed for open path ec systems the easyflux dl program provided corrected 30 min h ec values as well as data quality grades and the number of samples taken for each 30 min period a data quality grade is a rating from 0 to 9 calculated based on a series of criteria developed by foken et al 2012 these values are assigned following analysis of measurement characteristics with an example being wind flow distortion this is when measurements recorded under a wind direction where the sensor is downwind of the mast or apparatus negatively impacting the precision of the measurement will be allocated a poorer quality rating using these variables 30 min periods where a data quality grade of 9 or above were assigned foken et al 2012 and a sample size of 30 or less were removed from the comparison the remaining 30 min h ec values were used in the comparison with h sr1 and h srdt following the comparison of h for all methods le le srdt using the srdt method was estimated as a residual of the shortened energy balance equation from which et et srdt was then estimated for the srdt method only stability conditions were considered separately with unstable conditions defined as periods when r n was positive r n 0 w m 2 and the occurrence of a positive sr ramp amplitude see appendix ramp events paragraph corresponds to a negative third order air temperature structure function under both lags sr 3 0 as stated in savage 2014 for the srdt method canopy height measurements were taken during each campaign for the calculation of zero plane displacement height d which was estimated at 2 3 of canopy height the canopy height for the summer campaign was 0 55 m and 0 40 m for the winter campaign following the analysis of the summer and winter campaigns for the measurement of the seasonal et srdt the srdt method appendix srdt paragraph was used for the full observation period which began on the 13th november 2018 and concluded on the 31st october 2020 for the seasonal analysis summer december january february autumn march april may winter june july august and spring september october november were considered 2 6 patching missing data due to the occurrence of the fire on the 19th july 2019 and the malfunctioning of equipment during may and june 2020 patching of the data during these periods was conducted to provide an indication of et srdt and shortened energy balance partitioning the patched data for the period following the fire does not provide an indication of et srdt following a fire but rather et srdt for non fire conditions following the fire no data at the site were recorded until the 31st october 2019 while during the period of equipment malfunction r n and g were still observed daily et srdt for both periods were patched using meteorological data available from the nearby 2 km mike s pass meteorological station using the available meteorological data daily et o was calculated using the fao penman monteith method equation 4 and multiplied by the k c values eq 3 calculated during either the previous or following year for that month the shortened energy balance partitioning was patched for the fire period by finding the relationship between the solar radiation observed at the mike s pass meteorological station and for ciii the r n observed by the sr system the relationship was then applied to the solar radiation data to determine the r n for ciii during the periods when it was not observed the g component was considered a representative percentage of daily r n as was found for a representative month for both periods the le component was determined from the patched daily et srdt and the h srdt component was calculated as the residual of the shortened energy balance eq 1 having determined the remaining three components 3 results 3 1 determination of α for calibration of the sr1 method the initial step required before the methods could be compared was the calibration of the sr1 method using ec an α value was calculated from the slope of the linear regression between the h ucsr1 x and h ec y for stable and unstable conditions only the unstable α value was reported as et occurs predominantly when conditions are unstable and the performance of the method for unstable conditions is of interest an α was calculated for unstable conditions table 1 for both the 0 4 and 0 8 s lags and for summer and winter respectively 3 2 comparison between ec sr1 and srdt methods following the calibration of the sr1 method and calculating h sr1 a comparison between the h ec h sr1 and h srdt was conducted using linear regressions fig 3 for both the summer slope 0 86 intercept 20 13 w m 2 r2 0 75 and rmse 39 56 w m 2 and winter campaigns slope 0 83 intercept 40 31 w m 2 r2 0 81 and rmse 41 84 w m 2 h sr1 was lower compared to h ec the estimation of h srdt showed a good relationship with h ec in the summer campaign slope 1 03 intercept 15 02 w m 2 r2 0 79 and rmse 38 77 w m 2 and a slight underestimation in the winter campaign slope 0 91 intercept 37 08 w m 2 r2 0 84 and rmse 41 80 w m 2 h srdt showed a closer relationship to h ec for both campaigns with h sr1 and h srdt being closer to h ec during summer than in winter based on these comparisons of the two sr methods the srdt method showed the more statistically significant relationship with the ec method for the estimation of h due to this finding the assumption was made that the srdt method will accurately estimate long term h which can be used for the estimation of the long term et the srdt method was therefore the method chosen for the seasonal analysis of et over the bracken canopy more importantly though the srdt method does not require ec measurements with the parameter estimated see appendix srdt paragraph 3 3 assessment of seasonality of et based on hsrdt the change in the relationship of the shortened energy balance components between seasons is an important part of understanding the changes in et between seasons as expected r n was high during summer fig 4 with late spring november 2019 experiencing the highest average daily r n per month during the observation period a decline in r n occurred from summer through to autumn and into winter where the lowest daily average r n per month was experienced when average daily r n was high le srdt was the dominant component accounting for on average 77 of r n in summer due to a reduced average daily r n decreased and conditions became drier through autumn into winter the le srdt component decreased and the h srdt component increased while the g component remained low year round in relation to the average daily r n but was as slightly higher in summer autumn and winter 7 and lower in spring 5 during winter h srdt and le srdt were similar accounting for an average 41 and 51 of r n respectively following the first rainfalls in early spring le srdt increased again as h srdt decreased it is clear fig 4 that during summer the majority of r n g was partitioned into le srdt while in winter r n g was evenly partitioned between h srdt and le srdt over an observation period of 23 months of which et srdt was estimated for 17 months and patched for 6 months a strong seasonal pattern in et fig 5 as indicated by the changes in the shortened energy balance over the same period was evident the fire created a break in the observed et srdt data record due to the loss of the sr equipment the rain gauge was able to be replaced instantaneously after the fire as the sr system was initially installed in the middle of november 2018 and the replacement of the sr system following the fire was completed at the beginning of november 2019 two distinct periods in the data set occurred for comparison purposes between the two sites only data from 1 december was used the first period starting on the 1st december 2018 to the 18th july 2018 7 6 months and is referred to as the pre fire period the second period starting on the 1st december 2019 and ending on the 18th july 2020 7 6 months is referred to as the post fire period the pre fire period fell within the drier 2018 2019 hydrological year with 763 mm of rainfall occurring in the pre fire period while the post fire period experienced 1 115 mm of rainfall with 42 of that falling during february 2020 fig 5 a further standout difference in rainfall between the two periods was that the pre fire autumn period mar may received 62 mm more rainfall than the post fire autumn period despite the post fire period being overall much wetter the highest monthly observed total et srdt of 146 mm which included gap filled data occurred in november 2019 fig 5 the summer months of december january and february showed similar monthly total et srdt across both periods despite a difference in rainfall of 416 mm between the two summers of observation the seasonal trends highlighted at the monthly scale are clearly evident when using a 30 day moving average fig 6 across the observation period there is a strong seasonal trend in daily et srdt as well as higher inter daily variability in summer and autumn compared to spring and winter the 30 day moving average et srdt peaks in late spring early summer and although variable day to day a gradual decline occurs through summer fig 6 despite continued rainfall through autumn daily et srdt continues to decline possibly in response to the decline in r n the k c was calculated at a daily scale and averaged to provide a monthly k c fig 6 a k c value provides an indication of the et activity of the canopy as well as potential insight into water stress and climate limitations the highest k c value was found during summer with a maximum at approximately 0 75 when it can be presumed that the activity of the canopy is highest and water and r n are readily available as the observed et was closest to the potential et spring was characterised by a comparatively high k c value with a steep increase following winter again indicative that the two seasons when the canopy is the most active despite a higher average daily et srdt measured during spring than in summer the k c indicates that the canopy is still not meeting the potential et as it comes close to in summer possibly suggesting r n and water availability as limiting factors in spring this is observed in the patched october 2019 values with the highest monthly et srdt following a wetter september increasing water availability in october leading to a higher et o autumn sees a steep decline in k c where observed et srdt is much lower than the potential et possibly due to the end of the rainfall season and declining r n as expected k c in winter has the lowest values when resources are the least available to the canopy the average daily et per month reveals further details of seasonality from daily et srdt averages were calculated as representatives of each month the highest average daily et srdt 4 86 mm occurred in november 2019 the second highest was for december 2019 4 35 mm the lowest average daily et srdt was found for june 2019 1 70 mm and june 2020 1 17 mm for days when rainfall occurred daily et srdt was expected to be reduced due to stomatal closure and reduced r n to investigate this average daily et srdt was calculated only including dry days which were days where no rainfall event occurred daily rainfall 2 mm the highest average dry daily et et dd occurred in december 2019 6 13 mm in general the et dd in summer months exceeded spring autumn and winter months unlike the aforementioned average daily et the periods which saw the greatest change in average daily et srdt when considering only dry days vs all days were the months during the transition from summer to autumn viz february and march a maximum daily et srdt of 8 09 mm was observed in december 2019 and a minimum of 0 40 mm in june 2020 a 30 day moving average of daily et srdt for the pre and post fire periods were compared alongside the cumulative daily rainfall fig 7 the monthly total et srdt of december 2018 and december 2019 had a difference of only 1 64 mm during early summer january and february the et srdt response of the pre and post fire canopies were similar with a difference either way due to periods of rainfall which resulted in lower et srdt as shown in fig 7 the accumulated r n follows a similar pattern to that of the accumulated et srdt for the middle of april and the middle of autumn a divergence in both accumulated et srdt and accumulated r n occurred during the autumn period in march the post fire canopy et srdt was 7 4 mm more than the pre fire canopy which increased to 13 3 mm more in april the other months never showed a difference greater than 3 mm rainfall in both periods ceased around the end of april over the comparison period there was a difference of 22 2 mm in et with the post fire canopy et srdt being higher the pre fire period received 763 mm of rainfall while the post fire period had received 1 115 mm of rainfall the post fire canopy also experienced 36 71 mj m 2 more r n over the month than the pre fire canopy thus over the comparison period the post fire canopy experienced more r n and rainfall and a higher et srdt of the rainfall et accounted for 91 during the pre fire period and 65 during the post fire period 4 discussion to be able to analyse and understand the seasonal et of a bracken canopy a suitable long term method for the observation of et needed to be identified that falls within the requirements of a remote fire adapted high altitude grassland monitoring network as mentioned previously there are few published studies on the et of invader bracken canopies eg springer et al 2006 the sr method provides a simpler alternative to the ec method for the long term estimations of et but has limited validation over natural vegetation types and within mountainous terrain from the summer and winter campaigns the performance of the sr1 and the independent srdt methods for the estimation of h was good as shown by the close relationships found with the benchmark ec method the relationship between the sr methods and the ec method was closer in summer than winter with the srdt closest to the ec method in summer slope 1 03 intercept 15 02 w m 2 r2 0 79 and rmse 38 77 w m 2 prefaced on the good relationship found between the srdt method and the ec method for the estimation of h using the remaining shortened energy balance components et estimations were assumed to follow the same relationship between the methods the srdt method was therefore applied for the estimation of et over the bracken canopy within the cathedral peak research catchments and will continue to be utilised into the future for long term observation of et at the site conducted by the south african environmental observation network saeon the et srdt showed the invader bracken to have a strongly seasonal et the bracken canopy structure was highly variable between seasons fig 2 from a dense summer canopy which begins to brown in autumn following senescence and completely dies off in winter the response in spring is slow with initial spots of greening in october following the start of the rainfall season the seasonal cycle of the bracken canopy was found to be similar to that of the montane grasslands of the region everson et al 2001 during summer water and energy are considered readily available during summer r n g was partitioned mainly into le fig 4 as expected due to the wetter soil conditions following summer rainfall during winter when conditions were drier the dominance of le was reduced and h and le were similar as h and le are equally proportioned this could be an indication that despite drier conditions and a lack of rainfall in winter there is still no severe water stress as le accounts for up 50 of the available energy flux across all seasons le accounted for 74 of r n g which is considerable compared to that for a grassland for example over a mixed grassland community in a humid region following 18 months of observation savage et al 2004 found le to account for just under 50 of r n g over a grassland the final energy balance component g was found to be small under the bracken canopy across all seasons this could be representative of the dense canopy cover characteristic of the bracken canopy especially in summer as well as indicating a higher soil water retention the g component was found to be similar in summer autumn and winter and slightly reduced in spring the small differences in soil heat flux between the seasons could be indicative in part of a high soil water holding capacity explaining the lack of severe water stress during the drier months the dense nature of the bracken canopy differentiates this form of degradation from other types of degradation degradation within a grassland is often considered to be a loss of grassland canopy cover and results in an increase in bare soil in terms of this study degradation is considered to be the loss of natural grassland canopy by the invasion of bracken canopy the change in canopy structure and characteristics results in a change in et the findings from this study suggest a similar seasonal et cycle between the grassland and bracken canopies but a higher year round et from the bracken canopy over the cathedral peak ciii bracken canopy the highest et occurred during the hot and wet periods of summer and spring the highest average daily et srdt 4 9 mm and highest monthly total et srdt 145 mm occurred towards the end of spring nov 2019 the highest daily et srdt 8 1 mm occurred in december 2019 with daily et during the hot and wet summer periods regularly exceeding 5 mm the only other known comparable study on the et of a bracken canopy was conducted by springer et al 2006 in the semi arid hart prairie united states of america springer et al 2006 used volumetric water content to estimate et of a bracken fern and graminoid understory springer et al 2006 observed only the growing season and periods when monsoon rainfall did not occur due to limitations of the method when precipitation occurred the canopy studied by springer et al 2006 consisted of two dominating vegetation types bracken and kentucky bluegrass poa pratensis which needs to be considered when drawing comparisons between the findings of springer et al 2006 and the complete bracken dominated canopy of this study the study by springer et al 2006 also took place over three dry years with annual rainfalls all under the site map during the drier growing period the average daily et was 4 5 mm in the slightly dry year 3 7 mm in the moderately dry year and 1 9 mm in the extremely dry year springer et al 2006 this is comparable to the spring period before the summer rainfall in cathedral peak where the daily et srdt was 4 mm fig 6 in cathedral peak towards the start of summer rainfall daily average et srdt peaked but did not reach the post monsoon growing period level average daily et of 7 0 mm in the extremely dry year 7 1 mm in the moderately dry year and 7 9 mm in the slightly dry year found by springer et al 2006 this however could be comparable to the daily high of 8 1 mm measured at cathedral peak during december 2019 which was following a wet period with a rainfall of 156 mm in two weeks springer et al 2006 found the bracken canopy to be sensitive to drought with evaporation being the larger component of et than transpiration the study site of springer et al 2006 is much drier being semi arid and suggests that at the lower end of water availability bracken is sensitive to water stress which may not be the case in cathedral peak due to its location in a high rainfall area within the northern drakensberg grasslands in a neighbouring research catchment everson 2001 observed the natural grassland seasonal et everson 2001 found the grassland et to be high during the wet and hot summer and spring seasons and negligible during the dry cold winter seasons a similar seasonal trend to that of the bracken canopy shown in this study however the bracken summer maximum daily et srdt exceeded the maximum daily et 7 mm measured for the grassland by everson 2001 the range of daily et observed for the bracken and grassland were found to be similar during the wet season with a bracken average daily et srdt of 4 mm during the winter dry period everson 2001 found the grassland daily et to never exceed 1 mm while the bracken average daily et srdt was 2 mm with a maximum daily et srdt of over 3 mm the average of the monthly totals for et srdt in june 2019 2020 and july 2020 was 53 mm during which the average monthly rainfall was 1 5 mm for those three months based on the comparison with the winter dry season findings of everson 2001 it could be expected that a transition from grassland to degraded state invaded by bracken would have the greatest impact on the water balance of a catchment during the winter dry season it was suggested that the bracken canopy is not soil moisture limited based on the observation of equal cumulated et srdt at the end of summer for the pre and post fire periods despite a difference of 416 mm in rainfall this is further justified by the finding of everson 2001 that at an annual scale changes in et of the neighbouring grassland were not substantial despite a rainfall variability of 300 mm over a four year period indicating no soil moisture stress was occurring within the grassland suggesting no soil moisture stress occurs within both the bracken and grassland canopy is one perspective the two observation periods split by the fire provided a valuable comparison where despite a large difference in rainfall between the two periods the et srdt was similar at the end of summer following summer autumn was the season during which the largest difference in et srdt 20 mm was measured between the two periods the post fire period was the wetter year with 42 of the rainfall during february the autumn of the pre fire drier period experienced 61 mm more rainfall than the post fire period despite this the post fire period showed a higher total et for autumn 20 mm more than the pre fire period a potential explanation for this is that the above average february rainfall resulted in a higher soil water content during the following autumn which outweighed the 61 mm deficit in rainfall thus autumn et could be considered sensitive to the timing and amount of summer rainfall the role of r n also needs to be considered the pre fire summer period received 29 23 mj m 2 more r n than the post fire summer whereas the pre fire autumn received 71 90 mj m 2 less than the post fire autumn despite the difference in available energy flux during summer the post fire and pre fire summer et srdt totals were equal whereas the larger difference in available energy flux resulted in a lower pre fire et srdt regardless of the wetter pre fire autumn the higher rainfall occurrence is likely associated with a reduced r n due to more cloud cover similarly everson 2001 concluded for the neighbouring grassland catchment that the higher et in the drier years was attributable to the higher solar radiation due to reduced cloud cover over the year the importance of this observation is that a later autumn rainfall had a larger impact on the available energy flux than an earlier summer rainfall due to the lower solar radiation levels during autumn than summer therefore compared to an earlier and larger summer rainfall a later rainfall reduces r n and summer soil water content for the first time an understanding of the seasonal changes of bracken et allows for inferences on the influence of this form of degradation on the water balance of these high altitude fire adapted montane grasslands catchments and a base of information from which further studies can be undertaken it was found that the seasonal cycle of the bracken et was similar to that of the fire adapted grassland however the et was much greater especially in winter implying an influence on the water balance particularly during winter during the dry period a larger proportion of the available water will be used by bracken for et possibly leading to a reduction in streamflow which should be investigated further a loss of grassland within these montane areas could therefore have considerable effects on winter low flows and water resources during the dry season with the high summer rainfalls the hot wet season is likely less affected however the timing of the wet season rainfall influences the autumn et of the bracken canopy with higher rainfall during summer resulting in higher autumn et while higher autumn rainfall results in a lower autumn et therefore a wet summer followed by a drier autumn could result in a higher autumn et which may translate through to the water balance further influencing the dry season flows the influence of the changes in et found in this study need to be further examined including how they will affect the water balance and water supply and to what extent degradation followed by invasion by bracken of the high altitude fire adapted montane grasslands will have an effect on water supply from this region 5 conclusions with the lack of published literature on the et of a bracken canopy this research provides unique dataset on the seasonality of et for an invader bracken canopy within a degraded montane grassland following 23 months of observation it was found that the invader bracken canopy follows a similar seasonal trend compared to that of the natural grassland vegetation cover of the region the highest et occurred during late spring and early summer when both r n and soil water availability are at their highest autumn was identified as the period most sensitive to rainfall amount and timing as late annual rainfall during autumn decreases et while higher summer rainfall with lower autumn rainfall promotes et winter is the period when the largest difference between a natural grassland and invaded bracken would influence the water balance as the bracken canopy winter et is still substantial compared to a dormant grassland while summer differences are not as large no soil water stress was considered present with the rate of et being sensitive to available energy flux and seasonal solar radiation variability a longer period of observation is therefore recommended to further understand the sensitivities of et to changes in rainfall amount and timing as well as to provide a better representation of spring annual rainfall within this region is highly variable and is an important consideration to keep in mind when assessing the seasonal et in terms of observation the surface renewal dissipation theory method was shown to be a suitable alternative to the more expensive ec system for long term observations of et which will aid in improving this understanding and provide a valuable dataset on land cover change with the important ukhahlamba drakensberg mountain range the benefit of using the srdt method for long term measurement was realised when a fire damaged all the equipment a full ec system would have been a much greater loss than the srdt system which was able to be replaced within a few months the understanding gained on the et of a bracken canopy should be taken forward and used to further the understanding of the implications of an invasion by bracken on the water balance of the high altitude fire adapted grassland catchments and what it means for water supply generated from the region author statement the authors would like to thank the reviewers and the editor for their time taken to review this paper the comments raised were agreed with and were valuable adding constructively to the paper this paper is of regional interest and thus think it would be appropriate for a regional study journal such as the journal of hydrology regional studies the novelty is the addition to literature on bracken evapotranspiration and the seasonality found and how it differs to the regional grassland the surface renewal method also provides a useful alternative for the region and the

theory uses high frequency unshielded fine wire air temperature measurements for the optimal estimation of h these high frequency air temperature measurements are taken at a frequency of up to 10 hz 10 samples per second mengistu and savage 2010a 2010b rosa et al 2013 hu et al 2018 the sr methodology is based on the theory that an exchange of fluxes occurs when a parcel of air makes contact with the surface of a canopy castellví and snyder 2009b the observation of the high frequency air temperature measurements allows for the estimation of the exchange of fluxes that is occurring between the canopy and the air parcel paw u et al 1995 spano et al 2000 this is possible through the identification of ramps within the high frequency air temperature measurements paw u et al 1995 snyder et al 1996 the ramp events appear differently for stable and unstable conditions during unstable conditions the canopy will have a higher temperature than the parcel of air making contact paw u et al 1995 snyder et al 1996 hu et al 2018 the contact period between the parcel of air and canopy under unstable conditions will appear as a sudden rapid decrease in air temperature above the canopy as the air parcel arrives followed by a slow increase in air temperature as the exchange of fluxes occurs paw u et al 1995 hu et al 2018 creating the appearance of a ramp like structure in the temperature data spano et al 2000 fig a1 1 one of the exchange of fluxes is that of h which is calculated using the ramp event paw u et al 1995 following this process due to continuity the air parcel will return to the atmosphere following the completion of flux exchanges being replaced by another air parcel paw u et al 1995 snyder et al 1996 this continues resulting in several ramp events within the high frequency air temperature data ramp events fig a1 1 consist of an initial phase known as the quiescent period s which occurs where no air temperature change takes place and is the period following the arrival of a new air parcel before any heating or exchange of fluxes develops paw u et al 1995 castellví 2004 following this and indicating the start of flux exchange a ramp period l occurs which is when the air temperature increases in unstable conditions or decreases in stable conditions where the canopy is cooler than the air parcel savage 2017 the second sr 2 third sr 3 and fifth order sr 5 of the air temperature structure function are used to determine the l and the amplitude of the ramp period a van atta 1977 savage 2017 these three components s l and a in combination with the density

from which the h calculated for each ramp event during that period summed to provide the h for that period paw u et al 1995 the original surface renewal 1 sr1 approach uses this methodology of high frequency air temperature measurements along with structure function theory to determine h paw u et al 1995 snyder et al 1996 this determines what is referred to as an uncorrected h estimate which requires correction using an α value spano et al 2000 mengistu and savage 2010b the α is used to correct for the uneven heating of the air parcel occurring below the point of measurement by the fine wire thermocouple spano et al 2000 mengistu and savage 2010b hu et al 2018 the α value is determined from the slope of the regression forced through zero of h estimated by sr1 and h measured by eddy

8020,study region cathedral peak research catchments ukhahlamba drakensberg mountain range south africa study focus the focus was to determine the seasonal pattern of evapotranspiration et over a bracken canopy which is a product of degradation within the montane grasslands of the ukhahlamba drakensberg mountains surface renewal sr was investigated as a viable alternative to eddy covariance for long term estimation of et within a remote high rainfall montane landscape the sr dissipation method was used to observe et over the bracken canopy for 23 months across two consecutive years with variable seasonal rainfall timing and amounts besides et rainfall and energy flux components were observed new hydrological insights for the region the sr dissipation method was shown to be adequate for the long term estimation of evapotranspiration over a bracken canopy within a remote high summer rainfall montane landscape the bracken canopy was found to have a distinct seasonal cycle autumn was most sensitive to rainfall amount and timing as late annual rainfall during autumn decreases bracken et compared to higher summer rainfall followed by a lower autumn rainfall comparing the evapotranspiration of bracken from this study to the evapotranspiration of natural grassland in previous studies the largest difference in evapotranspiration between the canopies occurs in winter keywords bracken energy balance land cover change mountainous region 1 introduction following years of overgrazing and poor land management in areas of the northern drakensberg strategic water source area swsa south africa parts of the landscape have become heavily degraded hoffman and todd 2000 grab and knight 2018 the degradation manifests as reduced ground cover changes in species composition invasion of non native species and erosion of high carbon rich soils asmal 1995 bangamwabo 2009 everson et al 2011 grellier et al 2013 a common invader associated with the degradation of the montane grasslands within the drakensberg escarpment is pterdium aquilnim grab and knight 2018 which is an aggressive and dominating weed mcglone et al 2005 commonly referred to as bracken there is a heavy dependence on the natural resource base of this landscape at national regional and local scales as a result the livelihoods of the local population are closely linked to the natural resources and ecosystem integrity thus the need for sustainable and equitable management of land water and soil is crucial however the influence of degradation on the water balance of these high altitude fire adapted montane grassland areas is not well understood one of the contributing reasons is a lack of hydroclimatic data available for high altitude fire adapted mountainous regions particularly in developing countries a key component of the hydrological cycle that is altered by the change in land cover due to degradation is evapotranspiration et li et al 2017 et is also the process which links the energy and water balances castellví 2011 since et is comprised of evaporation and transpiration pozníková et al 2018 mbangiwa et al 2019 both are altered when a land cover change occurs net radiation r n air temperature humidity wind speed and canopy conductance influence cause the variability of et while the closeness of actual et to potential et is determined by precipitation and soil water huizhi and jianwu 2012 how et is altered by land degradation in montane grasslands areas is not well understood and the most effective method to achieve this is through in situ observations williams et al 2012 south africa is a developing country where infrastructure for observation and long term datasets are scarce risk of theft of equipment and damage by animals or fires is high in the remote fire adapted montane grasslands of the northern drakensberg escarpment brown and bezuidenhout 2020 combined with extreme topographical characteristics of the drakensberg escarpment these risks added restrictions on the equipment that can be placed at a monitoring site therefore the need to identify and validate a viable and adequate method for the estimation of et within such a summer rainfall landscape is required to be able to contribute to the knowledge on seasonal et over degraded montane grasslands the most common and robust method used for the measurement of et is the eddy covariance ec method snyder et al 2008 castellví and snyder 2009a kelley and higgins 2018 cui and chui 2019 morán et al 2020 the ec approach does however come with several limitations such as a strict fetch requirement a need for a homogeneous canopy and relatively flat terrain castellví et al 2002 snyder et al 2008 haymann et al 2019 as well as energy balance closure discrepancies linquist et al 2015 the ec methodology and sensors are also complex and expensive snyder et al 2008 castellví and snyder 2009a poblete echeverría et al 2014 morán et al 2020 the complexity of the method combined with the expense has limited the application of the method in resource constrained countries and situations rosa et al 2013 hu et al 2018 suvočarev et al 2020 these factors have driven evapotranspiration research towards alternatives to ec with fewer limitations and a simpler methodology over the recent decades an example of an alternative method for et estimation is that of surface renewal sr snyder et al 2008 the sr method uses high frequency air temperature measurements and the structure function theory van atta 1977 to estimate h from which le may be calculated as a residual of the shortened energy balance the ability of sr to estimate h and to estimate it well is an important aspect of the method as h is a parameter for the sr method snyder et al 2008 morán et al 2020 furthermore the sr method also consists of a simpler methodology to achieve et estimations with less strict fetch and siting requirements snyder et al 2015 and utilises fewer sensors than the ec method drexler et al 2004 castellví et al 2006 snyder et al 2008 kelley and higgins 2018 using the shortened surface energy balance le can be estimated as a residual once net radiation r n and soil heat flux g are accounted for snyder et al 1996 spano et al 2000 as a result accurate measurement of r n is critical for accurate et estimation using sr hu et al 2018 the sr method has been shown to be a viable method over both homogeneous and heterogeneous canopies mengistu and savage 2010b suvočarev et al 2014 sr is potentially a more viable option for the long term monitoring of et within developing countries where long term datasets are scarce kelley and higgins 2018 the sr method is based on the theory presented in the appendix an exchange of fluxes occurs when a parcel of air makes contact with the canopy top mengistu and savage 2010b these exchanges are identified in the high frequency air temperature measurements as ramp events mengistu and savage 2010b see appendix ramp events paragraph the original sr approach sr1 method follows this approach for the estimation of h which is considered uncorrected due to the understanding that since it does not account for the uneven heating of the air parcel castellví et al 2002 2016 an α value is then calculated through calibration which is carried out by concurrent sr1 measurements of h and an independent measure of h at the same site the α is determined as the slope of the regression between the uncorrected h of sr1 and the independent measure of h which is often ec poblete echeverría et al 2014 shapland et al 2014 the α value is applied to the uncorrected h h ucsr1 to calculate the corrected h h sr1 estimated by sr1 the calibration of the sr1 method is only required once or twice per season for a canopy that does not significantly change in height or density and can be applied to sites with similar vegetation structure and measurement height snyder et al 2008 currently a significant limitation of sr1 is the requirement for a calibration period with an independent measure of h drexler et al 2004 castellví and snyder 2009b mengistu and savage 2010b poblete echeverría et al 2014 however alternative sr approaches have been developed that make the requirement for calibration unnecessary the alternative sr approach the sr dissipation theory srdt method of castellví and snyder 2009b see appendix srdt paragraph follows the same theory as sr1 but uses the standard deviation of air temperature σ t mengistu and savage 2010b and the determination of zero plane displacement d castellví and snyder 2009b to determine an α value with no additional sensors comparisons between ec and sr have been documented for natural vegetation types such as grasslands snyder et al 1996 spano et al 1997 castellví and snyder 2009b 2010 savage 2014 and wetlands zapata and martínez cob 2001 drexler et al 2004 clulow et al 2012 over grassland the sr1 method has been shown to compare favourably with ec measurements of h snyder et al 1996 spano et al 1997 as has the srdt method which provided a good estimation for unstable conditions and thus bodes well for the estimation of et castellví and snyder 2009b globally observation of seasonal et over grassland burba and verma 2005 li et al 2005 mielnick et al 2005 zhang et al 2007 wieser et al 2008 krishnan et al 2012 da silva et al 2017 han et al 2018 rubert et al 2018 yue et al 2019 has been widely documented in literature as well as for degraded grasslands due to land abandonment rosset et al 2001 or overgrazing and intensive farming which leads to increased bare soil coverage liu et al 2008 huizhi and jianwu 2012 coners et al 2016 feng and liu 2016 reichert et al 2017 interestingly li et al 2012 found et over a degraded grassland during the growing season was sensitive to r n in comparison with a good condition grassland et of the degraded grassland was shown to be lower in the growing season due to less vegetation cover and higher in the non growing season rosset et al 2001 found that the overall difference in et of a managed and abandoned grassland was small but larger differences were found during early and late stages of canopy development as compared to the small differences when both canopies were more active liu et al 2008 and liu and feng 2012 found degraded grasslands to have an et near to total precipitation for the observation period while reichert et al 2017 found et to be about 30 of precipitation indicating that et is potentially related to a difference in climate variables at the site in consideration the dominant invader of the drakensberg montane grasslands bracken has received attention in literature where it too is a common invader in cultivated landscapes in mexico schnieder 2004 douterlungne et al 2010 berget et al 2015 and found in areas of human disturbance in new zealand mcglone et al 2005 the focus of such literature is on the removal and reduction in the spread of bracken but literature on understanding the hydrological implications of bracken invasion is lacking the only known study by springer et al 2006 investigated the et of a bracken fern and graminoid understory in a semi arid climate using temporal change in volumetric water content to draw conclusions regarding et given this background the objective of the paper was to determine the seasonal pattern of et for a bracken canopy in a degraded montane grassland including the influence of seasonal variations in rainfall on the et the focus is on the seasonal et of the bracken canopy which is the land cover often associated with degradation within the montane grasslands of the ukhahlamba drakensberg mountain range to achieve this sr with a focus on which sr method sr1 or srdt was evaluated as a viable alternative to ec for the long term estimation of et for the bracken canopy there is a dearth of information on seasonal bracken et which is addressed through this research besides clulow et al 2012 the use of sr within south africa and internationally for long term et estimates of natural vegetation is rare 2 materials and methods 2 1 research site the cathedral peak research catchments 28 58 32

separate catchments which were used historically to investigate the impacts of different land management treatments on streamflow nanni 1956 this current study was undertaken in catchment iii ciii of

catchment in 1981 which destroyed the p patula rehabilitation of the original grassland was attempted by planting the catchment to eragrositis curvula and an infrequent burning regime informed by experts was implemented toucher et al 2016 the rehabilitation was unsuccessful and the catchment has transitioned towards a degraded state with severe erosion on the upper steep slopes the degraded state of the catchment has led to the invasion by bracken which now dominates the catchment during the observation period an arson fire occurred on the 19th july 2019 which burnt out the entire catchment the soil was left exposed resulting in further erosion and complete repeated sedimentation of the weir at the outlet of the catchment although the bracken re established itself in the two months that followed the fire there was no litter layer below the bracken canopy and erosion continued prior to the arson fire the catchment had not been burnt for five years the pre fire vegetation was denser and had a litter layer contrasting with the post fire canopy the bracken changed seasonally with a dense green canopy in summer and senescence in winter resulting in a sparse canopy cover

panel ec100 campbell the electronics panel was then coupled to a campbell datalogger cr3000 the campbell easyflux dl program was used for ec data collection and processing of the h component of the shortened energy balance measured during the summer and winter campaigns rainfall was measured by a long term tipping bucket rain gauge te525 texas electronics texas united states of america 0 254 mm tip installed with the rim 1 2 m above the ground and located in close proximity to the tripod 160 m 2 3 estimation of energy fluxes following the estimation of h h srdt by the srdt method detailed in the introduction le can be calculated as the residual castellví 2004 hu et al 2018 of the shortened surface energy balance 1 r n g h le where r n is net radiation the soil heat flux g is calculated by accounting for that measured at a determined depth z and then determining the soil heat storage s above that depth by measuring the change in soil temperature δt s over time t and the calculated heat capacity of moist soil c s following the sampling of the bulk density of the soil at the site campbell scientific 2018 2 s t s c s z t following the calculation of le et can be estimated by accounting for the latent heat of vaporisation of water hu et al 2018 2 4 calculation of et o and k c the crop coefficient k c is a method used to understand the productivity of the vegetation which is estimated by comparing the estimate of the grass reference evapotranspiration et o with the estimated et et srdt from the srdt method 3 k c et srdt et o although the kc method is not commonly applied to determine natural vegetation productivity it has been successfully applied using et derived from the surface renewal method over natural vegetation types by drexler et al 2008 and clulow et al 2012 as well as being stated to be applicable to natural vegetation by allen 2003 and pereira et al 2015 the kc values estimated in eq 3 within this study are non standard as they are considered for varied environmental conditions and not standard conditions as outlined in fao 56 allen et al 1998 the fao penman monteith method which makes use of weather station data to provide an estimate of the et o and is a representation of the evaporative demand of the atmosphere at a given time was used allen et al 1998 2 5 data analysis a summer and winter campaign with ec and sr systems used concurrently was conducted to calibrate and determine α values required to calibrate the sr1 method and evaluate the performance of the sr method s ability to estimate h and subsequently et compared to the ec method only unstable atmospheric conditions were considered as these correspond to the times when most et occurs the summer campaign was conducted over eight days from 12 12 2019 19 12 2019 and the winter campaign conducted over nine days from 28 07 2020 05 08 2020 the estimation of h h sr1 by the sr1 method was achieved by processing the 10 hz high frequency air temperature measurements from the fine wire thermocouples and collected by the cr1000 datalogger from the primary fine wire thermocouple the secondary fine wire was used as a back up should the primary fine wire break during both the summer and winter campaigns no fine wire breakages were experienced following data download the calculated 30 minute second s r 2 third s r 3 and fifth order s r 5 air temperature structure functions were inserted into a formulated sr excel spreadsheet for the sr1 savage 2017 and srdt savage 2014 methods estimations of h ucsr1 were conducted for both time lags of 0 4 and 0 8 s the magnitude of the time lags is determined by the datalogger capabilities and are applied to the high frequency temperature measurements to determine the second third and fifth orders of structure function theory in real time van atta 1977 savage 2017 see appendix ramp events paragraph for the sr1 method an α value was calculated for both 0 4 and 0 8 s lags and applied to the 30 min h ucsr1 for both lags to provide 30 min h sr1 the h estimations for each lag were then averaged to provide a final 30 min h sr1 and h srdt as this method of averaging the different lags produced the lowest standard error when compared to h ec for the estimation of h h ec by the ec method data were processed by the cr3000 datalogger using the easyflux dl program from campbell scientific which is designed for open path ec systems the easyflux dl program provided corrected 30 min h ec values as well as data quality grades and the number of samples taken for each 30 min period a data quality grade is a rating from 0 to 9 calculated based on a series of criteria developed by foken et al 2012 these values are assigned following analysis of measurement characteristics with an example being wind flow distortion this is when measurements recorded under a wind direction where the sensor is downwind of the mast or apparatus negatively impacting the precision of the measurement will be allocated a poorer quality rating using these variables 30 min periods where a data quality grade of 9 or above were assigned foken et al 2012 and a sample size of 30 or less were removed from the comparison the remaining 30 min h ec values were used in the comparison with h sr1 and h srdt following the comparison of h for all methods le le srdt using the srdt method was estimated as a residual of the shortened energy balance equation from which et et srdt was then estimated for the srdt method only stability conditions were considered separately with unstable conditions defined as periods when r n was positive r n 0 w m 2 and the occurrence of a positive sr ramp amplitude see appendix ramp events paragraph corresponds to a negative third order air temperature structure function under both lags sr 3 0 as stated in savage 2014 for the srdt method canopy height measurements were taken during each campaign for the calculation of zero plane displacement height d which was estimated at 2 3 of canopy height the canopy height for the summer campaign was 0 55 m and 0 40 m for the winter campaign following the analysis of the summer and winter campaigns for the measurement of the seasonal et srdt the srdt method appendix srdt paragraph was used for the full observation period which began on the 13th november 2018 and concluded on the 31st october 2020 for the seasonal analysis summer december january february autumn march april may winter june july august and spring september october november were considered 2 6 patching missing data due to the occurrence of the fire on the 19th july 2019 and the malfunctioning of equipment during may and june 2020 patching of the data during these periods was conducted to provide an indication of et srdt and shortened energy balance partitioning the patched data for the period following the fire does not provide an indication of et srdt following a fire but rather et srdt for non fire conditions following the fire no data at the site were recorded until the 31st october 2019 while during the period of equipment malfunction r n and g were still observed daily et srdt for both periods were patched using meteorological data available from the nearby 2 km mike s pass meteorological station using the available meteorological data daily et o was calculated using the fao penman monteith method equation 4 and multiplied by the k c values eq 3 calculated during either the previous or following year for that month the shortened energy balance partitioning was patched for the fire period by finding the relationship between the solar radiation observed at the mike s pass meteorological station and for ciii the r n observed by the sr system the relationship was then applied to the solar radiation data to determine the r n for ciii during the periods when it was not observed the g component was considered a representative percentage of daily r n as was found for a representative month for both periods the le component was determined from the patched daily et srdt and the h srdt component was calculated as the residual of the shortened energy balance eq 1 having determined the remaining three components 3 results 3 1 determination of α for calibration of the sr1 method the initial step required before the methods could be compared was the calibration of the sr1 method using ec an α value was calculated from the slope of the linear regression between the h ucsr1 x and h ec y for stable and unstable conditions only the unstable α value was reported as et occurs predominantly when conditions are unstable and the performance of the method for unstable conditions is of interest an α was calculated for unstable conditions table 1 for both the 0 4 and 0 8 s lags and for summer and winter respectively 3 2 comparison between ec sr1 and srdt methods following the calibration of the sr1 method and calculating h sr1 a comparison between the h ec h sr1 and h srdt was conducted using linear regressions fig 3 for both the summer slope 0 86 intercept 20 13 w m 2 r2 0 75 and rmse 39 56 w m 2 and winter campaigns slope 0 83 intercept 40 31 w m 2 r2 0 81 and rmse 41 84 w m 2 h sr1 was lower compared to h ec the estimation of h srdt showed a good relationship with h ec in the summer campaign slope 1 03 intercept 15 02 w m 2 r2 0 79 and rmse 38 77 w m 2 and a slight underestimation in the winter campaign slope 0 91 intercept 37 08 w m 2 r2 0 84 and rmse 41 80 w m 2 h srdt showed a closer relationship to h ec for both campaigns with h sr1 and h srdt being closer to h ec during summer than in winter based on these comparisons of the two sr methods the srdt method showed the more statistically significant relationship with the ec method for the estimation of h due to this finding the assumption was made that the srdt method will accurately estimate long term h which can be used for the estimation of the long term et the srdt method was therefore the method chosen for the seasonal analysis of et over the bracken canopy more importantly though the srdt method does not require ec measurements with the parameter estimated see appendix srdt paragraph 3 3 assessment of seasonality of et based on hsrdt the change in the relationship of the shortened energy balance components between seasons is an important part of understanding the changes in et between seasons as expected r n was high during summer fig 4 with late spring november 2019 experiencing the highest average daily r n per month during the observation period a decline in r n occurred from summer through to autumn and into winter where the lowest daily average r n per month was experienced when average daily r n was high le srdt was the dominant component accounting for on average 77 of r n in summer due to a reduced average daily r n decreased and conditions became drier through autumn into winter the le srdt component decreased and the h srdt component increased while the g component remained low year round in relation to the average daily r n but was as slightly higher in summer autumn and winter 7 and lower in spring 5 during winter h srdt and le srdt were similar accounting for an average 41 and 51 of r n respectively following the first rainfalls in early spring le srdt increased again as h srdt decreased it is clear fig 4 that during summer the majority of r n g was partitioned into le srdt while in winter r n g was evenly partitioned between h srdt and le srdt over an observation period of 23 months of which et srdt was estimated for 17 months and patched for 6 months a strong seasonal pattern in et fig 5 as indicated by the changes in the shortened energy balance over the same period was evident the fire created a break in the observed et srdt data record due to the loss of the sr equipment the rain gauge was able to be replaced instantaneously after the fire as the sr system was initially installed in the middle of november 2018 and the replacement of the sr system following the fire was completed at the beginning of november 2019 two distinct periods in the data set occurred for comparison purposes between the two sites only data from 1 december was used the first period starting on the 1st december 2018 to the 18th july 2018 7 6 months and is referred to as the pre fire period the second period starting on the 1st december 2019 and ending on the 18th july 2020 7 6 months is referred to as the post fire period the pre fire period fell within the drier 2018 2019 hydrological year with 763 mm of rainfall occurring in the pre fire period while the post fire period experienced 1 115 mm of rainfall with 42 of that falling during february 2020 fig 5 a further standout difference in rainfall between the two periods was that the pre fire autumn period mar may received 62 mm more rainfall than the post fire autumn period despite the post fire period being overall much wetter the highest monthly observed total et srdt of 146 mm which included gap filled data occurred in november 2019 fig 5 the summer months of december january and february showed similar monthly total et srdt across both periods despite a difference in rainfall of 416 mm between the two summers of observation the seasonal trends highlighted at the monthly scale are clearly evident when using a 30 day moving average fig 6 across the observation period there is a strong seasonal trend in daily et srdt as well as higher inter daily variability in summer and autumn compared to spring and winter the 30 day moving average et srdt peaks in late spring early summer and although variable day to day a gradual decline occurs through summer fig 6 despite continued rainfall through autumn daily et srdt continues to decline possibly in response to the decline in r n the k c was calculated at a daily scale and averaged to provide a monthly k c fig 6 a k c value provides an indication of the et activity of the canopy as well as potential insight into water stress and climate limitations the highest k c value was found during summer with a maximum at approximately 0 75 when it can be presumed that the activity of the canopy is highest and water and r n are readily available as the observed et was closest to the potential et spring was characterised by a comparatively high k c value with a steep increase following winter again indicative that the two seasons when the canopy is the most active despite a higher average daily et srdt measured during spring than in summer the k c indicates that the canopy is still not meeting the potential et as it comes close to in summer possibly suggesting r n and water availability as limiting factors in spring this is observed in the patched october 2019 values with the highest monthly et srdt following a wetter september increasing water availability in october leading to a higher et o autumn sees a steep decline in k c where observed et srdt is much lower than the potential et possibly due to the end of the rainfall season and declining r n as expected k c in winter has the lowest values when resources are the least available to the canopy the average daily et per month reveals further details of seasonality from daily et srdt averages were calculated as representatives of each month the highest average daily et srdt 4 86 mm occurred in november 2019 the second highest was for december 2019 4 35 mm the lowest average daily et srdt was found for june 2019 1 70 mm and june 2020 1 17 mm for days when rainfall occurred daily et srdt was expected to be reduced due to stomatal closure and reduced r n to investigate this average daily et srdt was calculated only including dry days which were days where no rainfall event occurred daily rainfall 2 mm the highest average dry daily et et dd occurred in december 2019 6 13 mm in general the et dd in summer months exceeded spring autumn and winter months unlike the aforementioned average daily et the periods which saw the greatest change in average daily et srdt when considering only dry days vs all days were the months during the transition from summer to autumn viz february and march a maximum daily et srdt of 8 09 mm was observed in december 2019 and a minimum of 0 40 mm in june 2020 a 30 day moving average of daily et srdt for the pre and post fire periods were compared alongside the cumulative daily rainfall fig 7 the monthly total et srdt of december 2018 and december 2019 had a difference of only 1 64 mm during early summer january and february the et srdt response of the pre and post fire canopies were similar with a difference either way due to periods of rainfall which resulted in lower et srdt as shown in fig 7 the accumulated r n follows a similar pattern to that of the accumulated et srdt for the middle of april and the middle of autumn a divergence in both accumulated et srdt and accumulated r n occurred during the autumn period in march the post fire canopy et srdt was 7 4 mm more than the pre fire canopy which increased to 13 3 mm more in april the other months never showed a difference greater than 3 mm rainfall in both periods ceased around the end of april over the comparison period there was a difference of 22 2 mm in et with the post fire canopy et srdt being higher the pre fire period received 763 mm of rainfall while the post fire period had received 1 115 mm of rainfall the post fire canopy also experienced 36 71 mj m 2 more r n over the month than the pre fire canopy thus over the comparison period the post fire canopy experienced more r n and rainfall and a higher et srdt of the rainfall et accounted for 91 during the pre fire period and 65 during the post fire period 4 discussion to be able to analyse and understand the seasonal et of a bracken canopy a suitable long term method for the observation of et needed to be identified that falls within the requirements of a remote fire adapted high altitude grassland monitoring network as mentioned previously there are few published studies on the et of invader bracken canopies eg springer et al 2006 the sr method provides a simpler alternative to the ec method for the long term estimations of et but has limited validation over natural vegetation types and within mountainous terrain from the summer and winter campaigns the performance of the sr1 and the independent srdt methods for the estimation of h was good as shown by the close relationships found with the benchmark ec method the relationship between the sr methods and the ec method was closer in summer than winter with the srdt closest to the ec method in summer slope 1 03 intercept 15 02 w m 2 r2 0 79 and rmse 38 77 w m 2 prefaced on the good relationship found between the srdt method and the ec method for the estimation of h using the remaining shortened energy balance components et estimations were assumed to follow the same relationship between the methods the srdt method was therefore applied for the estimation of et over the bracken canopy within the cathedral peak research catchments and will continue to be utilised into the future for long term observation of et at the site conducted by the south african environmental observation network saeon the et srdt showed the invader bracken to have a strongly seasonal et the bracken canopy structure was highly variable between seasons fig 2 from a dense summer canopy which begins to brown in autumn following senescence and completely dies off in winter the response in spring is slow with initial spots of greening in october following the start of the rainfall season the seasonal cycle of the bracken canopy was found to be similar to that of the montane grasslands of the region everson et al 2001 during summer water and energy are considered readily available during summer r n g was partitioned mainly into le fig 4 as expected due to the wetter soil conditions following summer rainfall during winter when conditions were drier the dominance of le was reduced and h and le were similar as h and le are equally proportioned this could be an indication that despite drier conditions and a lack of rainfall in winter there is still no severe water stress as le accounts for up 50 of the available energy flux across all seasons le accounted for 74 of r n g which is considerable compared to that for a grassland for example over a mixed grassland community in a humid region following 18 months of observation savage et al 2004 found le to account for just under 50 of r n g over a grassland the final energy balance component g was found to be small under the bracken canopy across all seasons this could be representative of the dense canopy cover characteristic of the bracken canopy especially in summer as well as indicating a higher soil water retention the g component was found to be similar in summer autumn and winter and slightly reduced in spring the small differences in soil heat flux between the seasons could be indicative in part of a high soil water holding capacity explaining the lack of severe water stress during the drier months the dense nature of the bracken canopy differentiates this form of degradation from other types of degradation degradation within a grassland is often considered to be a loss of grassland canopy cover and results in an increase in bare soil in terms of this study degradation is considered to be the loss of natural grassland canopy by the invasion of bracken canopy the change in canopy structure and characteristics results in a change in et the findings from this study suggest a similar seasonal et cycle between the grassland and bracken canopies but a higher year round et from the bracken canopy over the cathedral peak ciii bracken canopy the highest et occurred during the hot and wet periods of summer and spring the highest average daily et srdt 4 9 mm and highest monthly total et srdt 145 mm occurred towards the end of spring nov 2019 the highest daily et srdt 8 1 mm occurred in december 2019 with daily et during the hot and wet summer periods regularly exceeding 5 mm the only other known comparable study on the et of a bracken canopy was conducted by springer et al 2006 in the semi arid hart prairie united states of america springer et al 2006 used volumetric water content to estimate et of a bracken fern and graminoid understory springer et al 2006 observed only the growing season and periods when monsoon rainfall did not occur due to limitations of the method when precipitation occurred the canopy studied by springer et al 2006 consisted of two dominating vegetation types bracken and kentucky bluegrass poa pratensis which needs to be considered when drawing comparisons between the findings of springer et al 2006 and the complete bracken dominated canopy of this study the study by springer et al 2006 also took place over three dry years with annual rainfalls all under the site map during the drier growing period the average daily et was 4 5 mm in the slightly dry year 3 7 mm in the moderately dry year and 1 9 mm in the extremely dry year springer et al 2006 this is comparable to the spring period before the summer rainfall in cathedral peak where the daily et srdt was 4 mm fig 6 in cathedral peak towards the start of summer rainfall daily average et srdt peaked but did not reach the post monsoon growing period level average daily et of 7 0 mm in the extremely dry year 7 1 mm in the moderately dry year and 7 9 mm in the slightly dry year found by springer et al 2006 this however could be comparable to the daily high of 8 1 mm measured at cathedral peak during december 2019 which was following a wet period with a rainfall of 156 mm in two weeks springer et al 2006 found the bracken canopy to be sensitive to drought with evaporation being the larger component of et than transpiration the study site of springer et al 2006 is much drier being semi arid and suggests that at the lower end of water availability bracken is sensitive to water stress which may not be the case in cathedral peak due to its location in a high rainfall area within the northern drakensberg grasslands in a neighbouring research catchment everson 2001 observed the natural grassland seasonal et everson 2001 found the grassland et to be high during the wet and hot summer and spring seasons and negligible during the dry cold winter seasons a similar seasonal trend to that of the bracken canopy shown in this study however the bracken summer maximum daily et srdt exceeded the maximum daily et 7 mm measured for the grassland by everson 2001 the range of daily et observed for the bracken and grassland were found to be similar during the wet season with a bracken average daily et srdt of 4 mm during the winter dry period everson 2001 found the grassland daily et to never exceed 1 mm while the bracken average daily et srdt was 2 mm with a maximum daily et srdt of over 3 mm the average of the monthly totals for et srdt in june 2019 2020 and july 2020 was 53 mm during which the average monthly rainfall was 1 5 mm for those three months based on the comparison with the winter dry season findings of everson 2001 it could be expected that a transition from grassland to degraded state invaded by bracken would have the greatest impact on the water balance of a catchment during the winter dry season it was suggested that the bracken canopy is not soil moisture limited based on the observation of equal cumulated et srdt at the end of summer for the pre and post fire periods despite a difference of 416 mm in rainfall this is further justified by the finding of everson 2001 that at an annual scale changes in et of the neighbouring grassland were not substantial despite a rainfall variability of 300 mm over a four year period indicating no soil moisture stress was occurring within the grassland suggesting no soil moisture stress occurs within both the bracken and grassland canopy is one perspective the two observation periods split by the fire provided a valuable comparison where despite a large difference in rainfall between the two periods the et srdt was similar at the end of summer following summer autumn was the season during which the largest difference in et srdt 20 mm was measured between the two periods the post fire period was the wetter year with 42 of the rainfall during february the autumn of the pre fire drier period experienced 61 mm more rainfall than the post fire period despite this the post fire period showed a higher total et for autumn 20 mm more than the pre fire period a potential explanation for this is that the above average february rainfall resulted in a higher soil water content during the following autumn which outweighed the 61 mm deficit in rainfall thus autumn et could be considered sensitive to the timing and amount of summer rainfall the role of r n also needs to be considered the pre fire summer period received 29 23 mj m 2 more r n than the post fire summer whereas the pre fire autumn received 71 90 mj m 2 less than the post fire autumn despite the difference in available energy flux during summer the post fire and pre fire summer et srdt totals were equal whereas the larger difference in available energy flux resulted in a lower pre fire et srdt regardless of the wetter pre fire autumn the higher rainfall occurrence is likely associated with a reduced r n due to more cloud cover similarly everson 2001 concluded for the neighbouring grassland catchment that the higher et in the drier years was attributable to the higher solar radiation due to reduced cloud cover over the year the importance of this observation is that a later autumn rainfall had a larger impact on the available energy flux than an earlier summer rainfall due to the lower solar radiation levels during autumn than summer therefore compared to an earlier and larger summer rainfall a later rainfall reduces r n and summer soil water content for the first time an understanding of the seasonal changes of bracken et allows for inferences on the influence of this form of degradation on the water balance of these high altitude fire adapted montane grasslands catchments and a base of information from which further studies can be undertaken it was found that the seasonal cycle of the bracken et was similar to that of the fire adapted grassland however the et was much greater especially in winter implying an influence on the water balance particularly during winter during the dry period a larger proportion of the available water will be used by bracken for et possibly leading to a reduction in streamflow which should be investigated further a loss of grassland within these montane areas could therefore have considerable effects on winter low flows and water resources during the dry season with the high summer rainfalls the hot wet season is likely less affected however the timing of the wet season rainfall influences the autumn et of the bracken canopy with higher rainfall during summer resulting in higher autumn et while higher autumn rainfall results in a lower autumn et therefore a wet summer followed by a drier autumn could result in a higher autumn et which may translate through to the water balance further influencing the dry season flows the influence of the changes in et found in this study need to be further examined including how they will affect the water balance and water supply and to what extent degradation followed by invasion by bracken of the high altitude fire adapted montane grasslands will have an effect on water supply from this region 5 conclusions with the lack of published literature on the et of a bracken canopy this research provides unique dataset on the seasonality of et for an invader bracken canopy within a degraded montane grassland following 23 months of observation it was found that the invader bracken canopy follows a similar seasonal trend compared to that of the natural grassland vegetation cover of the region the highest et occurred during late spring and early summer when both r n and soil water availability are at their highest autumn was identified as the period most sensitive to rainfall amount and timing as late annual rainfall during autumn decreases et while higher summer rainfall with lower autumn rainfall promotes et winter is the period when the largest difference between a natural grassland and invaded bracken would influence the water balance as the bracken canopy winter et is still substantial compared to a dormant grassland while summer differences are not as large no soil water stress was considered present with the rate of et being sensitive to available energy flux and seasonal solar radiation variability a longer period of observation is therefore recommended to further understand the sensitivities of et to changes in rainfall amount and timing as well as to provide a better representation of spring annual rainfall within this region is highly variable and is an important consideration to keep in mind when assessing the seasonal et in terms of observation the surface renewal dissipation theory method was shown to be a suitable alternative to the more expensive ec system for long term observations of et which will aid in improving this understanding and provide a valuable dataset on land cover change with the important ukhahlamba drakensberg mountain range the benefit of using the srdt method for long term measurement was realised when a fire damaged all the equipment a full ec system would have been a much greater loss than the srdt system which was able to be replaced within a few months the understanding gained on the et of a bracken canopy should be taken forward and used to further the understanding of the implications of an invasion by bracken on the water balance of the high altitude fire adapted grassland catchments and what it means for water supply generated from the region author statement the authors would like to thank the reviewers and the editor for their time taken to review this paper the comments raised were agreed with and were valuable adding constructively to the paper this paper is of regional interest and thus think it would be appropriate for a regional study journal such as the journal of hydrology regional studies the novelty is the addition to literature on bracken evapotranspiration and the seasonality found and how it differs to the regional grassland the surface renewal method also provides a useful alternative for the region and the

theory uses high frequency unshielded fine wire air temperature measurements for the optimal estimation of h these high frequency air temperature measurements are taken at a frequency of up to 10 hz 10 samples per second mengistu and savage 2010a 2010b rosa et al 2013 hu et al 2018 the sr methodology is based on the theory that an exchange of fluxes occurs when a parcel of air makes contact with the surface of a canopy castellví and snyder 2009b the observation of the high frequency air temperature measurements allows for the estimation of the exchange of fluxes that is occurring between the canopy and the air parcel paw u et al 1995 spano et al 2000 this is possible through the identification of ramps within the high frequency air temperature measurements paw u et al 1995 snyder et al 1996 the ramp events appear differently for stable and unstable conditions during unstable conditions the canopy will have a higher temperature than the parcel of air making contact paw u et al 1995 snyder et al 1996 hu et al 2018 the contact period between the parcel of air and canopy under unstable conditions will appear as a sudden rapid decrease in air temperature above the canopy as the air parcel arrives followed by a slow increase in air temperature as the exchange of fluxes occurs paw u et al 1995 hu et al 2018 creating the appearance of a ramp like structure in the temperature data spano et al 2000 fig a1 1 one of the exchange of fluxes is that of h which is calculated using the ramp event paw u et al 1995 following this process due to continuity the air parcel will return to the atmosphere following the completion of flux exchanges being replaced by another air parcel paw u et al 1995 snyder et al 1996 this continues resulting in several ramp events within the high frequency air temperature data ramp events fig a1 1 consist of an initial phase known as the quiescent period s which occurs where no air temperature change takes place and is the period following the arrival of a new air parcel before any heating or exchange of fluxes develops paw u et al 1995 castellví 2004 following this and indicating the start of flux exchange a ramp period l occurs which is when the air temperature increases in unstable conditions or decreases in stable conditions where the canopy is cooler than the air parcel savage 2017 the second sr 2 third sr 3 and fifth order sr 5 of the air temperature structure function are used to determine the l and the amplitude of the ramp period a van atta 1977 savage 2017 these three components s l and a in combination with the density

from which the h calculated for each ramp event during that period summed to provide the h for that period paw u et al 1995 the original surface renewal 1 sr1 approach uses this methodology of high frequency air temperature measurements along with structure function theory to determine h paw u et al 1995 snyder et al 1996 this determines what is referred to as an uncorrected h estimate which

8021,study region two streams catchment kwazulu natal midlands south africa study focus the impacts of acacia mearnsii plantations on hydrological processes including groundwater is investigated using the two streams experimental catchment as a case study site integrated hydrological hydrogeological hydrochemical and environmental isotope methods were adopted groundwater recharge is estimated using the chloride mass balance cmb method and baseflow is separated using digital filters and δ18o isotope approaches the direct and indirect impacts of the tree stands on groundwater including on recharge groundwater level and baseflow are assessed new hydrological insights for the region systematic analyses of all the hydrological data show that direct groundwater uptake by tree roots at the two streams catchment would not be possible due to limiting root depths however there is clear evidence on the impacts of the tree stands on groundwater levels and baseflow at the study site thus in instances where the regional groundwater is not available for direct abstraction by tree roots trees can have considerable impacts on groundwater by extracting water from the unsaturated zone reducing recharge to aquifers without having direct access to the groundwater proper the impact of acacia mearnsii plantations on groundwater which are observed in terms of reductions in groundwater recharge and consequent reduction in groundwater levels and baseflow starts to be observed on average six years after planting graphical abstract ga1 keywords baseflow separation chloride mass balance environmental isotopes groundwater recharge hydrochemistry unsaturated zone 1 introduction acacia mearnsii trees are originally from australia and were brought to south africa for timber and paper making de beer 1986 stirton 1987 they survive south african conditions by developing adaptation strategies such as deep root systems that can access alternative sources of water de wit et al 2001 a review study conducted by le maitre et al 1999 concluded that woody plantations can develop deep root systems which are capable of extracting large volumes of groundwater from depths of up to 10 m many hydrological studies from across the world bosch and hewlett 1982 hibbert 1967 holmes and sinclair 1986 zhang et al 1999 have demonstrated that woody plantations commonly use more water than grasses and non irrigated agricultural crops in south africa the impacts of forest plantations on water resources are thought to be predominantly due to transpiration and increased interception losses scott and lesch 1997 most of the studies undertaken on the impacts of trees on groundwater resources in south africa have been conducted in the zululand coastal plain everson et al 2019 kelbe et al 1995 ndlovu and demlie 2020 ramjeawon et al 2020 smithers et al 2017 these studies highlighted the impact of vegetation on groundwater recharge through water extraction from the unsaturated zone thereby reducing the proportion of rainfall that eventually recharges groundwater and on groundwater storage due to direct abstractions from shallow groundwater smithers et al 2017 indicated that 35 of the total decrease in the level of lake sibayi was a result of forest plantations impacting groundwater storage surrounding the lake furthermore everson et al 2019 showed that the removal of deep rooted alien forest plantations from the vasi area located in the maputaland coastal plain of south africa will result in a 2 m increase in the groundwater level the two streams catchment located in the kwazulu natal midlands of south africa has been used as an experimental catchment for over a decade to investigate effects of acacia mearnsii tree stands on hydrological processes these studies have focused mainly on evapotranspiration and soil hydrological processes and concluded that the potential evapotranspiration rates exceeded rainfall by 46 burger 1999 clulow et al 2011 everson et al 2014 jarmain and everson 2002 however little attention was given into the characterization of the hydrogeology of the catchment and understanding the impacts of deep rooted acacia mearnsii plantations on the groundwater system at an international level baldocchi and xu 2007 reported that quercus douglasii plantations in mediterranean climate of california usa and europe were able to survive extended periods without water and suggested that tree roots were accessing subsurface water and depleting soil water reserves from the deep soil profile which raised concerns about the effects of deep rooted plantations on groundwater the net groundwater loss from aquifers through direct uptake by tree roots in secondary aquifer systems has not yet been well established the impacts of deep rooted tree plantations on groundwater resources need to be understood and quantified so as to have improved understanding of the beneficial or adverse effects on groundwater supplies and groundwater dependent ecosystems rainfall recharge under acacia mearnsii plantations and site specific factors including aquifer characteristics and linkages and preferential flow paths which are crucial to understand the hydrogeological characteristics of the two streams catchment remain poorly understood therefore the two streams catchment provides an opportunity to investigate the effects of deep rooted tree plantations on secondary aquifer systems in the south african context and elsewhere in the world thus this research aims to investigate the hydrological conditions in terms of aquifer physical hydrochemical and environmental isotope characteristics preferential flow paths baseflow and groundwater recharge which are interpreted to understand the impacts of acacia mearnsii plantations on the groundwater system using the two streams catchment as a case study 2 study area 2 1 location and climate the two streams research catchment is located in seven oaks district approximately 70 km northeast of pietermaritzburg in kwazulu natal province south africa fig 1 the research catchment covers an area of about one km2 it is located in parts of the midlands mist belt grassland bioregion dominated by forb rich tall sour themeda triandra grasslands of which only a few patches remain due to invasion of aristida junciformis everson et al 2014 climatically the study area lies in the warm sub tropical climate of south africa where summer is hot humid and the main rainy season while winter is cold and dry the mean annual precipitation map is about 778 mm year and the long term monthly minimum and maximum temperatures are 4 50 c july and 31 70 c february respectively the topography is generally hilly with a rolling landscape and dips towards the south east giving rise to a surface drainage from northwest to south east the catchment area is positioned between 1110 m above mean sea level amsl and 1060 m amsl altitudes the catchment is drained by two small streams which are the basis on which the two streams catchment is named 2 2 geological and hydrogeological setting granites and gneisses form the basement rocks in eastern south africa similarly the study area is underlain by basement granite rocks of the natal metamorphic province these basement rocks are overlain unconformably by the natal group sandstones which in turn are overlain unconformably by the dwyka group and ecca group rocks of the karoo supergroup dolerite intrusions in the form of dykes and sills are present in the area along with faults and fractures are associated mainly with gondwana breakup fig 2 none of the natal group and dwyka group were encountered during the drilling of the five monitoring boreholes across the study area however the basement granite in the study site is overlain unconformably by the pietermaritzburg formation of the ecca group sediments the pietermaritzburg formation in the study area is a dark grey weathered shale with lateral changes in layer thickness decreasing towards the toe of the hillslope the base of this layer is located at approximately 43 m below ground level bgl up gradient and 25 m bgl down gradient and has an approximate thickness of 22 m the weathered shale layer is in turn overlain by red brown clayey material with thickness ranging between 24 m at the crest 15 m mid slope and decreases towards zero at the toe of the hillslope the soil forms in the study site are red sandy and yellow apedal freely draining soils derived mainly from the ecca group rocks and dolerite intrusions clulow et al 2011 the thick soil layer encountered in the crest and mid slope of the catchment represent the deep weathering of the bedrock surface which is a dominant factor governing subsurface water flow paths in the catchment hydrogeologically the study area is characterized by weathered and fractured aquifers where groundwater occurs within the weathered horizons fractures fissures and joints faults fractures joints and dykes play primary roles in the storage and transmission of groundwater in the region the generalized borehole yields hydraulic conductivities and storativity of aquifers around the study area range between 0 5 and 2 l s 0 4 and 7 7 m day and 0 0005 and 0 005 respectively dwaf 1998 the groundwater quality in the region is generally good with field ec values seldom exceeding 700 μs cm 3 materials and methods groundwater levels were monitored from august 2006 to june 2017 in groundwater monitoring boreholes and piezometers using solinist dip meter model 101 and solinist water level loggers model 3001 streamflow was monitored from a 457 2 mm 900 v notch weir using a streamflow recorder for the period from january 2006 to december 2017 hydrometeorological parameters including rainfall were measured from two rainfall stations located within the catchment for the same period as the stream flow monitoring these measurements were undertaken to analyze the hydrological and hydrogeological response of the catchment the spatial distribution of all water monitoring stations in the study area are presented in table 1 and fig 3 the groundwater level and elevation data were used to construct the groundwater level map and determine the groundwater flow directions electrical resistivity tomography ert surveys were conducted with a 2 d terrameter abem sasi100 the data were inverted using the 2 d inversion software res2inv which makes use of the smoothness constrained least squares method and automatically determines a 2 d resistivity model of the subsurface loke 2000 the ert inversion results were compared with borehole logs and after which interpretations were made to characterize the lithology and hydrogeological conditions of the study site a constant discharge rate cdr pumping test was conducted on the central monitoring borehole 2stbh1 using a submersible pump so as to validate the estimated aquifer hydraulic parameters data collected from various sources the drawdown during the pumping test was measured in the pumped and nearby observation boreholes using dip meters and data loggers groundwater recharge was estimated using chloride mass balance cmb method total streamflow monitored from 2006 to 2017 was separated into direct runoff and baseflow components using the web based hydrograph analysis tool lim et al 2005 since many local studies hughes et al 2003 smakhtin and watkins 1997 smakhtin 2001 proposed and applied a wide range of filter parameter values ranging from 0 925 to 0 997 for south african rivers the baseflow filter parameter of 0 98 a 0 98 and bfimax 0 25 as proposed by eckhardt 2005 were used for baseflow separation in this study the filter parameter was selected based on local hydrological and hydrogeological conditions including the fact that the stream under consideration is perennial and groundwater occurs in a hard rock secondary aquifer additionally stable environmental isotope 2h was used to separate the measured stream discharge hydrograph into water stored in the catchment prior to the rainfall event and the water brought by the rainfall event where the respective contributions were calculated using the mass balance eqs 1 3 ladouche et al 2001 1 qt qg qr 2 qt δt qg δg qr δr 3 qg qt δt δr δg δr where qg is baseflow m3 d qt is total stream flow m3 d qr is surface runoff δt is isotopic composition of stream flow vsmow δr is isotopic composition of rainfall vsmow and δg is isotopic composition of groundwater vsmow the groundwater and stream samples were taken once a month and the rainfall samples are a composite sample of the month s daily rainfall the following assumptions were taken into consideration during baseflow separation using environmental stable isotope techniques the isotope content of the event and the pre event water are significantly different the event water maintains a constant isotope signature in space and time or any variations can be accounted for the isotopic signature of the pre event water is constant in space and time or any variations can be accounted for contributions from the vadose zone must be similar to that of groundwater contributions from surface water storage are negligible the water balance for the two streams catchment was calculated from 2007 to 2017 based on rainfall evapotranspiration and streamflow including baseflow using the water balance eq 4 assuming that the groundwater contributing catchment is the same as surface water contributing catchment rainfall streamflow and the actual evapotranspiration data were obtained from the centre for water resources research cwrr university of kwazulu natal pietermaritzburg the overall change in storage was calculated as the residual of the water balance equation 4 inflow outflow change in storage eq 4 is further expressed in terms of the most important water balance vaiables as shown in eq 5 as follows 5 p et sr gr δs where p is precipitation et is actual evapotranspiration sr is direct runoff gr is groundwater contribution in the form of baseflow and δs is the change in storage water samples for hydrochemical and environmental isotope analyses were collected from the boreholes shallow piezometers stream and an automated rainfall sampler on a monthly basis over a one year period from february 2014 to january 2015 following standard methods of water sampling reported in weaver et al 2007 portable multi parameter probes hanna combo hi 98121 and 98312 models were used to measure on site ph temperature t ec total dissolved solids tds and oxidation reduction potential orp total alkalinity carbonate and bicarbonate contents were determined on site by titration samples for hydrochemical analyses were filtered on site through a 0 45 µm filter and major cations samples were acidified using nitric acid hno3 to a ph of 2 as a form of preservation environmental isotope samples that were taken directly from each water point were not treated all the water samples were kept in a cooler box to avoid any evaporation and transported to the respective laboratories major cation samples were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes techniques following standard procedures at the school of chemistry university of kwazulu natal pietermaritzburg whilst major anion samples were analysed using a thermo scientific gallery discrete analyzer following standard procedures at the soil science laboratory university of kwazulu natal pietermaritzburg environmental isotope samples 18o and d were analysed using the isotope laser spectrometer los gatos research dlt 100 liquid water isotope analyzer following standard procedures at the centre for water resources research cwrr university of kwazulu natal pietermaritzburg the local meteoric water line lmwl and the global meteoric water line gmwl were used to compare and interpret the environmental stable isotope data 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrogeological characteristics of the research catchment the results of the ert survey along the transects shown in fig 3 are presented in fig 4 the ert results are interpreted based on the premise that the resistivity of a formation largely depends on the moisture content the physical and chemical properties of the water saturating the various pore spaces in the formation lower resistivity would indicate that the formation is partially or totally saturated or the formation is conductive material such as clay accordingly the two dimensional 2d resistivity sections presented in fig 4a b indicate the following the shallow contrast of resistivity distribution varying between 100 ωm and 1000 ωm observed along transect 2st001indicate lateral variations of water content distribution from moist to dry material the thickness of this layer with laterally variable moisture content along the section ranges from 24 m at the crest to 15 m mid slope and decreases to nearly zero towards the toe of the slope these resistivity values were validated with the borehole log of 2stbh3 fig 5 and the geoelectric layer is interpreted as the top brown clayey material the second geo electrical section constructed based on measurements along transect 2st002 consists of two conducive materials with resistivity values ranging between 1 ωm and 20 ωm and between 20 ωm and 100 ωm interpreted to be a weathered horizon although the presence and depth of a perched water table cannot be identified from the resistivity section the observed low resistivity values suggest that the layer is partially saturated the weathered material shows a lateral change in layer thickness from up gradient layer base of about 44 m bgl and decreases towards the toe of the hillslope to the down gradient base of about 25 m bgl the borehole log in fig 5 indicates that this layer corresponds to a grey fine grained shale which is a water bearing formation where water seepages were observed at 31 m bgl and 41 m bgl during drilling of the borehole the borehole logs further indicate that the water strike observed at 41 m bgl with a compressor yield of 0 5 l s relates to the contact zone between shale and basement granite rock the conductive weathered shale layer in both geo electrical sections is underlain by high resistivity layer 1000 ωm that occurs from 45 m bgl to 77 m bgl according to the borehole log fig 5 this layer correlates to the basement granite thus the results of the ert survey and the borehole logs revealed that the studied research catchment is underlain by three geological formations these are from top to bottom a clayey material that has an approximate thickness of 24 m and characterized by lateral variations in moisture content b a saturated weathered shale material having a thickness of approximately 22 m and c deep basement granitic rock based on the ert results and borehole logs two hydrostratigraphic units have been identified these are an upper thin unconfined aquifer occurring at the interface between the residual clayey material and the weathered shale bedrock and the main regional weathered and fractured granitic basement aquifer occurring in a semi confined condition the top weathering profile clay material shows lateral variations in water content distribution and contains pockets of water bearing material forming a perched aquifer condition groundwater level analysis of eight boreholes within and around the study area indicates a general groundwater flow in a south easterly direction which tends to follow the surface topographic gradient fig 6 groundwater in the study area flows laterally through the weathered unconfined aquifer and discharges down gradient into the stream and also vertically through fractures to recharge the underlying regional semi confined aquifer pumping tests undertaken during this study revealed that the regional aquifer is characterized by a transmissivity t that ranges from 0 15 to 0 48 m2 day hydraulic conductivity k of 0 04 m day and a storage coefficient of 0 03 which is much higher than the average aquifers storage coefficient reported for the region dwaf 1998 the average annual rainfall groundwater recharge estimated using the chloride mass balance cmb method is 32 mm 4 1 of map this recharge estimate is similar to recharge estimated for the region in the framework of the national groundwater resources assessment project phase two graii dwaf 2006 4 2 hydrochemical characteristics the analysis results of the hydrochemical data is presented in fig 7 and in the electronic supplementary material esm the results of data analyses indicate that both groundwater and surface water samples are characterized by low electrical conductivity ec that ranges from 17 ms m to 64 ms cm with mean median and standard deviation values of 28 5 ms m 24 ms m and 10 8 ms m respectively indicating low salinity the monthly ec measurements show that both stream and groundwater respond in a similar way to rainfall input with a general increasing ec trend in the annual data fig 7 additionally the low groundwater ec suggests rapid direct aquifer recharge and minimum residence time within both the unsaturated zone and the aquifer which in turn indicates local groundwater circulation rather than from regional contribution commensurate with the size of the catchment the rapid groundwater ec response after rainfall indicates the existence of preferential flow paths that contribute significant amount of recharge to groundwater furthermore surface and groundwater samples have similar major ion chemical compositions including na k cl hco3 and so4 2 the order of the relative abundances of the major anions and cations are hco3 so4 2 cl and ca2 mg2 na k respectively these observations indicate interaction between the stream and groundwater and active rainfall recharge taking place in the catchment calcium ca2 is the most abundant cation and bicarbonate hco3 is the most abundant anion the high concentration of hco3 may be originating from the dissolution of carbonate minerals within the unsaturated zone root respiration or organic material decomposition in the rooting zone freeze and cherry 1979 dry and wet season water samples show similar hydrochemical characteristics the piper trilinear plot of hydrochemical data fig 8 shows three hydrochemical facies the hydrochemical facies identified in fig 8 in the two streams catchment are described as follows facies 1 this hydrochemical facies is characterized by calcium and bicarbonate hco3 ions as the most dominant ions giving rise to a ca hco3 type water this is characteristic of freshly recharged groundwater that has equilibrated with co2 and soluble carbonate minerals under open system conditions in the soil zone the dissolution of carbonate releases ca2 into solution producing ca hco3 water type as a final product most groundwater samples falling in this zone are characterized by low mineralization as indicated by low ec and relative enrichment in bicarbonate attributed to recently recharged groundwater from rainfall facies 2 this facies has predominantly high concentration of calcium and chloride ions giving rise to a ca cl hydrochemical water type and most stream samples fall into this category this facies provides an indication of water samples from an active discharge zone with a short residence time where chloride is contributed from rainfall and shallow soil zones accumulated by evaporative processes facies 3 this hydrochemical facies indicate a mixed zone where no dominant water types can be identified from either the anions or cations some stream and groundwater samples fall into this zone indicating a strong inter relationship between surface and groundwater in the study area 4 3 environmental isotope characteristics the results of the stable environmental isotopes deuterium and 18o analysis for rainfall stream and groundwater during the wet and dry seasons are presented on the δ2h δ 18o plot in fig 9 and in the esm the isotope signatures of rainfall stream and groundwater during the wet season are similar and clustered together along the lmwl fig 9a indicating that the main source of stream and groundwater during the wet season is rainfall the isotopic composition of stream water is controlled by the mixing rates of surface runoff interflow and baseflow the clustering of groundwater isotope around the mean rainfall signature suggests that groundwater recharge from rainfall seems to take place rapidly possibly via preferred pathways without undergoing significant evaporation since the fact that the majority of the isotope composition of rainfall stream and groundwater samples plot in the same zone it can be concluded that recent rainfall is the source of groundwater and main contributor of water to the stream along with baseflow during the wet season during the dry season rainfall isotope signatures are scattered along the lmwl fig 9b indicating that the rainfall moisture source has undergone some degree of isotopic modification or the source of moisture is local moisture feedback processes the stream and groundwater samples are clustered together suggesting that during dry season the main contributor of water flowing in the stream is entirely groundwater discharge 4 4 groundwater contribution to total stream flow baseflow the groundwater contribution to the flow of the stream in the study catchment is quantified using the web based hydrograph analysis tool what and stable isotope techniques where the results of the two approaches of baseflow separation are compared table 2 shows the 12 years 2007 2017 continuous streamflow data separated into direct runoff and baseflow using the what digital filter baseflow separation method it is well documented that digital filter based baseflow separation is sensitive to the chosen filter parameter eckhardt 2012 considering that the chosen filter parameter is representative to the catchment the results show that the mean annual runoff in the catchment is about 20387 m3 of which 14768 m3 72 is attributed to baseflow contribution the years with the highest mean annual runoff are 2006 2007 and 2008 and correspondingly the baseflow contributions are also the highest in these years in subsequently years i e from 2009 both total runoff and groundwater contribution to baseflow have decreased since noticeable rainfall reduction and temperature increase were not noted during the study period except between 2014 and 2016 these results appear to indicate that ten 10 year old acacia mearnsii plantations have the capacity to reduce baseflow contribution to streamflow significantly which in turn reduces streamflow however the 2014 2016 dry spells in the region has also impacted the decrease in the stream discharge in these years to further understand the hydrological processes in detail continuous daily streamflow data between 29 february 2012 and 30 june 2014 were scrutinized and analysed fig 10 this period is selected due to the fact that both streamflow and stable isotope data of rainfall stream and groundwater were available the un validated baseflow analysis from a single parameter digital filter method fig 10 provided an estimated direct runoff volume of 528 m3 yr and baseflow contribution of 688 8 m3 yr which is 43 and 57 respectively of the total streamflow volume of 1217 m3 yr precipitation on the stream channel is assumed to be negligible due to the small size of the stream the results of δ2h isotope based baseflow separated from the total daily stream discharge data is shown in table 3 since the δ2h isotope based simple two component hydrograph separation has many inherent limitations as a result of the variabilities in the isotopic signature of groundwater the storm and rainfall clark and fritz 1997 turner and barnes 1998 the results need to be applied cautiously for instance some baseflow values in table 3 are greater than the daily total stream flow which is not possible such type of limitations and erroneous results emanate from a disconnect between the assumptions and the actual isotopic measurements or both therefore the estimated baseflow needs to be considered mainly for hydrological process understanding and trend observations than for accurate quantitative analysis of baseflow and storm flow nevertheless table 3 shows that the total stream flow is dominated by pre event water or groundwater contributions than direct runoff similar observations have been summarized by turner and barnes 1998 based on a review of the application of the method in a number of studies furthermore the baseflow value calculated using the isotope approach for the two streams catchment is much higher than the baseflow contribution calculated using what table 3 regardless of the inherent uncertainties in the results of both methods it appear to suggest that the isotope based baseflow most likely includes the interflow component of the discharge hydrograph of the stream which is a dominant component of stream flow in small forested catchments with moderately steep slope and deep vadose zone table 3 similar observations were reported in berman et al 2009 where that some forested catchments with baseflow index above 50 indicates over estimation of baseflow contribution conceptually the isotope based baseflow estimates from the current study suggest that rainfall infiltrates through the vadose zone and flows as interflow and part of which discharges into the stream and part of it percolates to recharge the shallow aquifer which eventually discharges as baseflow these two components namely the interflow and the shallow groundwater contribution are lumped together as baseflow 4 5 catchment water balance the concept of water balance provides a framework for studying the hydrological behavior of the catchment and assumes that all water entering the catchment is equal to the water leaving it plus or minus any change in storage brassington 2006 the 12 year annual water balance results of the two streams catchment are presented in table 4 total precipitation p is the input parameter while total evapotranspiration et direct runoff dr and groundwater contribution to baseflow gbf including the interflow component are output parameters a positive value indicates an increase in water storage while negative value indicates storage decline the changes in water storage for the study catchment table 4 show a continuous reduction with the exception of the years 2009 and 2012 responding to varying amount of water losses through evapotranspiration direct runoff and groundwater discharge as baseflow as well as a reduction in annual precipitation annual storage changes are all negative over the entire 10 year period except for years 2009 and 2012 this is expected since year 2012 recorded the highest rainfall over the 10 year period the years with highest declines in storage were 2010 2014 and 2015 respectively these declines are expected as these years were relatively dry years with their annual average rainfall lower than the 10 year average of 748 mm whilst evapotranspiration continued to exceed rainfall inputs during these years the rate of direct runoff and baseflow were the highest in the year 2007 with values of 63 2 mm a and 41 9 mm a respectively this is expected as trees were newly planted planted in august 2006 and were not expected to have significant impact on baseflow baseflow decreased in subsequent years these results suggest that acacia mearnsii trees display a significant impact in the water balance of the catchment mainly by reducing baseflow and transpire significant amount of water into the atmosphere 4 6 impacts of acacia mearnsii trees on groundwater the impacts of plantations on groundwater systems are usually inferred from changes in soil moisture groundwater levels and stream discharges the key findings of plantation impacts in groundwater are that after the removal of forests wetter soil moisture contents and higher groundwater levels are expected due to reduced evapotranspiration rates le maitre et al 1999 peck and williamson 1987 smerdon et al 2009 whilst afforestation or replantation results in reduced recharge lower groundwater levels decline in baseflow and consequent reduction in streamflow the results of investigation of the impacts of acacia mearnsii tree stand on the secondary groundwater system at the two streams experimental catchment using data spanning over a 10 year period 2007 2017 is presented based on the potential for direct groundwater uptake by roots impacts on groundwater levels changes in streamflow and consequently impacts on baseflow 4 6 1 direct groundwater uptake the primary factor affecting the pattern of water extraction by plants from the soil is rooting depth roots would penetrate as deep into the soil as required to reach available water unless restricted by soil characteristics that prevent rooting or by permanent water table however penetration will be restricted by soil or regolith characteristics that prevent rooting or by permanent water table cannon 1949 nepstad et al 1994 stone and comerford 1994 stone and kalisz 1991 depending on soil characteristics the lateral rooting systems of the tree can often exceed the equivalent height of the tree in order to maximise water uptake sherry 1971 the acacia mearnsii roots can reach the depths of 3 35 m and even greater than 53 m was observed in one recorded case scott and le maitre 1998 in the studied catchment roots were found up to a depth of 5 m during drilling in october 2012 six years after planting everson et al 2014 based on a constant root depth growth rate of 5 m in 6 years as observed at the two streams catchment by 2017 roots would be approximately 10 m deep clay material can support a capillary fringe of up to 1 5 m brunel et al 1995 therefore considering the potential root depth of 10 m and maximum capillary fringe of 1 5 m direct groundwater uptake by acacia mearnsii tree roots would be possible for up to 11 5 m deep the drilling geophysical investigations and subsequent groundwater level monitoring indicate that the depth to the upper unconfined aquifer range between 15 m and 24 m bgl and the deep semi confined weathered and fractured granitic aquifer occurs at 43 m bgl the regional groundwater level monitored from 2006 and 2017 in four boreholes within the study area range between 19 m bgl and 48 m bgl given the possible direct groundwater uptake by tree roots of up to 11 5 m the unconfined and semi confined aquifers would not be available for extraction by tree roots in the study area the only possible available water for extraction by trees is the perched aquifers or pockets of water lenses and moisture that occur within the unsaturated zone 4 6 2 impact on groundwater level and recharge the acacia mearnsii stands in the catchment were planted in august 2006 groundwater levels in boreholes showed a clearly defined seasonal and interannual groundwater level fluctuations during the first few years of planting however as trees continue to grow groundwater levels in boreholes continued to fluctuate and by 2017 all failed to rise to original water levels observed during the first few years after planting the hourly interval groundwater levels monitored using data loggers in boreholes 2stbh1 2stbh3 2stbh4 and 2stbh5 for the period from mid september 2011 to april 2017 dropped by about 3 m 9 8 m 9 5 m and 1 1 m respectively fig 11 the high groundwater level decline in boreholes 2stbh3 and 2stbh4 appears to be attributed to their position at the water divide of the local groundwater flow regime which are the most affected when overall groundwater storage is declined though other derivers including below average precipitation may have played a role the decline in groundwater level is also in agreement with the calculated water balance of the catchment table 4 where a general decline in catchment water storage was observed between 2007 and 2017 these results are to some extent attributed to the fact that acacia mearnsii stands have a significant impact on groundwater levels by extracting water from within the unsaturated zone to meet demands thus reducing water available for recharging the aquifer similar observation was reported in bosch 1979 where afforestation caused reduction in baseflow and groundwater levels commencing some six to eight years after planting additionally kok 1976 reported that groundwater recharge was reduced from the expected 10 of map under grassland to zero after 5 8 years of planting trees due to water extraction through increased transpiration from the unsaturated zone thus these results imply that where there are deep soils deeply fractured or decomposed rock acacia mearnsii trees can have a huge impact on groundwater storage by dropping groundwater levels by extracting water from the unsaturated zone reducing water available for groundwater recharge without necessarily having direct access to the groundwater proper 4 6 3 impacts on baseflow baseflow is an important component of streamflow which comes from groundwater storage including shallow subsurface storage baseflow separation of total streamflow indicated that about 57 of total streamflow in the studied catchment is attributed to baseflow the baseflow in the catchment decreased drastically between 2006 and 2010 as shown in fig 12 though there was a variation in the amount of rainfall this period coincides with the first five years of afforestation of the catchment with acacia mearnsii trees the increase in baseflow between 2011 and 2013 appears to be in response to increase in rainfall however it again start to decline and leveling off between 2014 and 2017 again perhaps due to the combined impact of the 2014 2016 dry spell and the acacia mearnsii trees this result is once again in agreement with the study conducted by bosch 1979 which reported that afforestation causes reduction in baseflow commencing some six to eight years after planting and leveling off at around 50 thus acacia mearnsii trees affect baseflow by extracting water from within the unsaturated zone which then reduces the amount of water available to recharge groundwater and consequently reducing baseflow and total streamflow 4 7 hydrological conceptual model for the two streams catchment the geological geophysical hydrological hydrogeological hydrochemical and environmental isotope data are integrated and interpreted to develop a conceptual hydrogeological model for the two stream catchment study site fig 13 the conceptual model helps to visualize understand and explain the most important hydrological processes taking place across the study catchment the conceptual model is constructed based on original data generated from aquifer tests information collected during field observations undertaken during the course of this study and complemented by data from previous studies 5 conclusions hydrological processes and the impacts of acacia mearnsii plantations on groundwater within the two streams experimental catchment located in the kwazulu natal midlands of south africa have been investigated through a combined hydrological hydrogeological hydrochemical and environmental isotope methods the three geological units identified from surface geological borehole logs and geophysical data are grouped into two hydrostratigraphic units of an upper thin unconfined aquifer occurring along the weathered shale and a lower weathered and fractured semi confined granitic aquifer the regional aquifer is characterized by a transmissivity that ranges from 0 15 to 0 48 m2 day and a hydraulic conductivity of 0 04 m day which make it a poorly productive aquifer the groundwater flow direction follows the topographic gradient the study catchment receives an average annual groundwater recharge of 32 mm or 4 of map hydrochemical data indicates that both groundwater and stream samples have similar mean specific electrical conductivity ec of 285 μs cm and three main groundwater hydrochemical facies are identified these are ca hco3 water type characterized by shallow low mineralized and with a relatively high concentration of hco3 attributed to an active and flushed groundwater system ca cl water type which is a characteristic of water from active discharge zone and mixed water type where no dominant cations and anions are identified the δ2h and δ18o isotopic composition of all water samples plot mainly along the lmwl and gmwl indicating direct recharge from rainfall without extensive evaporation during or prior to recharge monthly seasonal stable isotope data of groundwater and stream samples indicate that groundwater is the main contributor of streamflow during the dry season the results of investigation of the impacts of acacia mearnsii tree stand on the secondary aquifer system within the studied catchment showed that direct groundwater uptake by tree roots from the saturated zone at two streams would not be possible due to limiting rooting depth thus in instances where the regional groundwater table is not available for direct abstraction by tree roots acacia mearnsii trees can have considerable impact on groundwater through extracting water from within the unsaturated zone reducing the proportion of rainfall that reaches the aquifers and eventually discharge to the stream as baseflow without necessarily having direct access to the groundwater proper the reduction in the observed groundwater level baseflow and groundwater storage may not be attributed to a single driver

8021,study region two streams catchment kwazulu natal midlands south africa study focus the impacts of acacia mearnsii plantations on hydrological processes including groundwater is investigated using the two streams experimental catchment as a case study site integrated hydrological hydrogeological hydrochemical and environmental isotope methods were adopted groundwater recharge is estimated using the chloride mass balance cmb method and baseflow is separated using digital filters and δ18o isotope approaches the direct and indirect impacts of the tree stands on groundwater including on recharge groundwater level and baseflow are assessed new hydrological insights for the region systematic analyses of all the hydrological data show that direct groundwater uptake by tree roots at the two streams catchment would not be possible due to limiting root depths however there is clear evidence on the impacts of the tree stands on groundwater levels and baseflow at the study site thus in instances where the regional groundwater is not available for direct abstraction by tree roots trees can have considerable impacts on groundwater by extracting water from the unsaturated zone reducing recharge to aquifers without having direct access to the groundwater proper the impact of acacia mearnsii plantations on groundwater which are observed in terms of reductions in groundwater recharge

environmental isotopes groundwater recharge hydrochemistry unsaturated zone 1 introduction acacia mearnsii trees are originally from australia and were brought to south africa for timber and paper making de beer 1986 stirton 1987 they survive south african conditions by developing adaptation strategies such as deep root systems that can access alternative sources of water de wit et al 2001 a review study conducted by le maitre et al 1999 concluded that woody plantations can develop deep root systems which are capable of extracting large volumes of groundwater from depths of up to 10 m many hydrological studies from across the world bosch and hewlett 1982 hibbert 1967 holmes and sinclair 1986 zhang et al 1999 have demonstrated that woody plantations commonly use more water than grasses and non irrigated agricultural crops in south africa the impacts of forest plantations on water resources are thought to be predominantly due to transpiration and increased interception losses scott and lesch 1997 most of the studies undertaken on the impacts of trees on groundwater resources in south africa have been conducted in the zululand coastal plain everson et al 2019 kelbe et al 1995 ndlovu and demlie 2020 ramjeawon et al 2020 smithers et al 2017 these studies highlighted the impact of vegetation on groundwater recharge through water extraction from the unsaturated zone thereby reducing the proportion of rainfall that eventually recharges groundwater and on groundwater storage due to direct abstractions from shallow groundwater smithers et al 2017 indicated that 35 of the total decrease in the level of lake sibayi was a result of forest plantations impacting groundwater storage surrounding the lake furthermore everson et al 2019 showed that the removal of deep rooted alien forest plantations from the vasi area located in the maputaland coastal plain of south africa will result in a 2 m increase in the groundwater level the two streams catchment located in the kwazulu natal midlands of south africa has been used as an experimental catchment for over a decade to investigate effects of acacia mearnsii tree stands on hydrological processes these studies have focused mainly on evapotranspiration and soil hydrological processes and concluded that the potential evapotranspiration rates exceeded rainfall by 46 burger 1999 clulow et al 2011 everson et al 2014 jarmain and everson 2002 however little attention was given into the characterization of the hydrogeology of the catchment and understanding the impacts of deep rooted acacia mearnsii plantations on the groundwater system at an international level baldocchi and xu 2007 reported that quercus douglasii plantations in mediterranean climate of california usa and europe were able to survive extended periods without water and suggested that tree roots were accessing subsurface water and depleting soil water reserves from the deep soil profile which raised concerns about the effects of deep rooted plantations on groundwater the net groundwater loss from aquifers through direct uptake by tree roots in secondary aquifer systems has not yet been well established the impacts of deep rooted tree plantations on groundwater resources need to be understood and quantified so as to have improved understanding of the beneficial or adverse effects on groundwater supplies and groundwater dependent ecosystems rainfall recharge under acacia mearnsii plantations and site specific factors including aquifer characteristics and linkages and preferential flow paths which are crucial to understand the hydrogeological characteristics of the two streams catchment remain poorly understood therefore the two streams catchment provides an opportunity to investigate the effects of deep rooted tree plantations on secondary aquifer systems in the south african context and elsewhere in the world thus this research aims to investigate the hydrological conditions in terms of aquifer physical hydrochemical and environmental isotope characteristics preferential flow paths baseflow and groundwater recharge which are interpreted to understand the impacts of acacia mearnsii plantations on the groundwater system using the two streams catchment as a case study 2 study area 2 1 location and climate the two streams research catchment is located in seven oaks district approximately 70 km northeast of pietermaritzburg in kwazulu natal province south africa fig 1 the research catchment covers an area of about one km2 it is located in parts of the midlands mist belt grassland bioregion dominated by forb rich tall sour themeda triandra grasslands of which only a few patches remain due to invasion of aristida junciformis everson et al 2014 climatically the study area lies in the warm sub tropical climate of south africa where summer is hot humid and the main rainy season while winter is cold and dry the mean annual precipitation map is about 778 mm year and the long term monthly minimum and maximum temperatures are 4 50 c july and 31 70 c february respectively the topography is generally hilly with a rolling landscape and dips towards the south east giving rise to a surface drainage from northwest to south east the catchment area is positioned between 1110 m above mean sea level amsl and 1060 m amsl altitudes the catchment is drained by two small streams which are the basis on which the two streams catchment is named 2 2 geological and hydrogeological setting granites and gneisses form the basement rocks in eastern south africa similarly the study area is underlain by basement granite rocks of the natal metamorphic province these basement rocks are overlain unconformably by the natal group sandstones which in turn are overlain unconformably by the dwyka group and ecca group rocks of the karoo supergroup dolerite intrusions in the form of dykes and sills are present in the area along with faults and fractures are associated mainly with gondwana breakup fig 2 none of the natal group and dwyka group were encountered during the drilling of the five monitoring boreholes across the study area however the basement granite in the study site is overlain unconformably by the pietermaritzburg formation of the ecca group sediments the pietermaritzburg formation in the study area is a dark grey weathered shale with lateral changes in layer thickness decreasing towards the toe of the hillslope the base of this layer is located at approximately 43 m below ground level bgl up gradient and 25 m bgl down gradient and has an approximate thickness of 22 m the weathered shale layer is in turn overlain by red brown clayey material with thickness ranging between 24 m at the crest 15 m mid slope and decreases towards zero at the toe of the hillslope the soil forms in the study site are red sandy and yellow apedal freely draining soils derived mainly from the ecca group rocks and dolerite intrusions clulow et al 2011 the thick soil layer encountered in the crest and mid slope of the catchment represent the deep weathering of the bedrock surface which is a dominant factor governing subsurface water flow paths in the catchment hydrogeologically the study area is characterized by weathered and fractured aquifers where groundwater occurs within the weathered horizons fractures fissures and joints faults fractures joints and dykes play primary roles in the storage and transmission of groundwater in the region the generalized borehole yields hydraulic conductivities and storativity of aquifers around the study area range between 0 5 and 2 l s 0 4 and 7 7 m day and 0 0005 and 0 005 respectively dwaf 1998 the groundwater quality in the region is generally good with field ec values seldom exceeding 700 μs cm 3 materials and methods groundwater levels were monitored from august 2006 to june 2017 in groundwater monitoring boreholes and piezometers using solinist dip meter model 101 and solinist water level loggers model 3001 streamflow was monitored from a 457 2 mm 900 v notch weir using a streamflow recorder for the period from january 2006 to december 2017 hydrometeorological parameters including rainfall were measured from two rainfall stations located within the catchment for the same period as the stream flow monitoring these measurements were undertaken to analyze the hydrological and hydrogeological response of the catchment the spatial distribution of all water monitoring stations in the study area are presented in table 1 and fig 3 the groundwater level and elevation data were used to construct the groundwater level map and determine the groundwater flow directions electrical resistivity tomography ert surveys were conducted with a 2 d terrameter abem sasi100 the data were inverted using the 2 d inversion software res2inv which makes use of the smoothness constrained least squares method and automatically determines a 2 d resistivity model of the subsurface loke 2000 the ert inversion results were compared with borehole logs and after which interpretations were made to characterize the lithology and hydrogeological conditions of the study site a constant discharge rate cdr pumping test was conducted on the central monitoring borehole 2stbh1 using a submersible pump so as to validate the estimated aquifer hydraulic parameters data collected from various sources the drawdown during the pumping test was measured in the pumped and nearby observation boreholes using dip meters and data loggers groundwater recharge was estimated using chloride mass balance cmb method total streamflow monitored from 2006 to 2017 was separated into direct runoff and baseflow components using the web based hydrograph analysis tool lim et al 2005 since many local studies hughes et al 2003 smakhtin and watkins 1997 smakhtin 2001 proposed and applied a wide range of filter parameter values ranging from 0 925 to 0 997 for south african rivers the baseflow filter parameter of 0 98 a 0 98 and bfimax 0 25 as proposed by eckhardt 2005 were used for baseflow separation in this study the filter parameter was selected based on local hydrological and hydrogeological conditions including the fact that the stream under consideration is perennial and groundwater occurs in a hard rock secondary aquifer additionally stable environmental isotope 2h was used to separate the measured stream discharge hydrograph into water stored in the catchment prior to the rainfall event and the water brought by the rainfall event where the respective contributions were calculated using the mass balance eqs 1 3 ladouche et al 2001 1 qt qg qr 2 qt δt qg δg qr δr 3 qg qt δt δr δg δr where qg is baseflow m3 d qt is total stream flow m3 d qr is surface runoff δt is isotopic composition of stream flow vsmow δr is isotopic composition of rainfall vsmow and δg is isotopic composition of groundwater vsmow the groundwater and stream samples were taken once a month and the rainfall samples are a composite sample of the month s daily rainfall the following assumptions were taken into consideration during baseflow separation using environmental stable isotope techniques the isotope content of the event and the pre event water are significantly different the event water maintains a constant isotope signature in space and time or any variations can be accounted for the isotopic signature of the pre event water is constant in space and time or any variations can be accounted for contributions from the vadose zone must be similar to that of groundwater contributions from surface water storage are negligible the water balance for the two streams catchment was calculated from 2007 to 2017 based on rainfall evapotranspiration and streamflow including baseflow using the water balance eq 4 assuming that the groundwater contributing catchment is the same as surface water contributing catchment rainfall streamflow and the actual evapotranspiration data were obtained from the centre for water resources research cwrr university of kwazulu natal pietermaritzburg the overall change in storage was calculated as the residual of the water balance equation 4 inflow outflow change in storage eq 4 is further expressed in terms of the most important water balance vaiables as shown in eq 5 as follows 5 p et sr gr δs where p is precipitation et is actual evapotranspiration sr is direct runoff gr is groundwater contribution in the form of baseflow and δs is the change in storage water samples for hydrochemical and environmental isotope analyses were collected from the boreholes shallow piezometers stream and an automated rainfall sampler on a monthly basis over a one year period from february 2014 to january 2015 following standard methods of water sampling reported in weaver et al 2007 portable multi parameter probes hanna combo hi 98121 and 98312 models were used to measure on site ph temperature t ec total dissolved solids tds and oxidation reduction potential orp total alkalinity carbonate and bicarbonate contents were determined on site by titration samples for hydrochemical analyses were filtered on site through a 0 45 µm filter and major cations samples were acidified using nitric acid hno3 to a ph of 2 as a form of preservation environmental isotope samples that were taken directly from each water point were not treated all the water samples were kept in a cooler box to avoid any evaporation and transported to the respective laboratories major cation samples were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes techniques following standard procedures at the school of chemistry university of kwazulu natal pietermaritzburg whilst major anion samples were analysed using a thermo scientific gallery discrete analyzer following standard procedures at the soil science laboratory university of kwazulu natal pietermaritzburg environmental isotope samples 18o and d were analysed using the isotope laser spectrometer los gatos research dlt 100 liquid water isotope analyzer following standard procedures at the centre for water resources research cwrr university of kwazulu natal pietermaritzburg the local meteoric water line lmwl and the global meteoric water line gmwl were used to compare and interpret the environmental stable isotope data 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrogeological characteristics of the research catchment the results of the ert survey along the transects shown in fig 3 are presented in fig 4 the ert results are interpreted based on the premise that the resistivity of a formation largely depends on the moisture content the physical and chemical properties of the water saturating the various pore spaces in the formation lower resistivity would indicate that the formation is partially or totally saturated or the formation is conductive material such as clay accordingly the two dimensional 2d resistivity sections presented in fig 4a b indicate the following the shallow contrast of resistivity distribution varying between 100 ωm and 1000 ωm observed along transect 2st001indicate lateral variations of water content distribution from moist to dry material the thickness of this layer with laterally variable moisture content along the section ranges from 24 m at the crest to 15 m mid slope and decreases to nearly zero towards the toe of the slope these resistivity values were validated with the borehole log of 2stbh3 fig 5 and the geoelectric layer is interpreted as the top brown clayey material the second geo electrical section constructed based on measurements along transect 2st002 consists of two conducive materials with resistivity values ranging between 1 ωm and 20 ωm and between 20 ωm and 100 ωm interpreted to be a weathered horizon although the presence and depth of a perched water table cannot be identified from the resistivity section the observed low resistivity values suggest that the layer is partially saturated the weathered material shows a lateral change in layer thickness from up gradient layer base of about 44 m bgl and decreases towards the toe of the hillslope to the down gradient base of about 25 m bgl the borehole log in fig 5 indicates that this layer corresponds to a grey fine grained shale which is a water bearing formation where water seepages were observed at 31 m bgl and 41 m bgl during drilling of the borehole the borehole logs further indicate that the water strike observed at 41 m bgl with a compressor yield of 0 5 l s relates to the contact zone between shale and basement granite rock the conductive weathered shale layer in both geo electrical sections is underlain by high resistivity layer 1000 ωm that occurs from 45 m bgl to 77 m bgl according to the borehole log fig 5 this layer correlates to the basement granite thus the results of the ert survey and the borehole logs revealed that the studied research catchment is underlain by three geological formations these are from top to bottom a clayey material that has an approximate thickness of 24 m and characterized by lateral variations in moisture content b a saturated weathered shale material having a thickness of approximately 22 m and c deep basement granitic rock based on the ert results and borehole logs two hydrostratigraphic units have been identified these are an upper thin unconfined aquifer occurring at the interface between the residual clayey material and the weathered shale bedrock and the main regional weathered and fractured granitic basement aquifer occurring in a semi confined condition the top weathering profile clay material shows lateral variations in water content distribution and contains pockets of water bearing material forming a perched aquifer condition groundwater level analysis of eight boreholes within and around the study area indicates a general groundwater flow in a south easterly direction which tends to follow the surface topographic gradient fig 6 groundwater in the study area flows laterally through the weathered unconfined aquifer and discharges down gradient into the stream and also vertically through fractures to recharge the underlying regional semi confined aquifer pumping tests undertaken during this study revealed that the regional aquifer is characterized by a transmissivity t that ranges from 0 15 to 0 48 m2 day hydraulic conductivity k of 0 04 m day and a storage coefficient of 0 03 which is much higher than the average aquifers storage coefficient reported for the region dwaf 1998 the average annual rainfall groundwater recharge estimated using the chloride mass balance cmb method is 32 mm 4 1 of map this recharge estimate is similar to recharge estimated for the region in the framework of the national groundwater resources assessment project phase two graii dwaf 2006 4 2 hydrochemical characteristics the analysis results of the hydrochemical data is presented in fig 7 and in the electronic supplementary material esm the results of data analyses indicate that both groundwater and surface water samples are characterized by low electrical conductivity ec that ranges from 17 ms m to 64 ms cm with mean median and standard deviation values of 28 5 ms m 24 ms m and 10 8 ms m respectively indicating low salinity the monthly ec measurements show that both stream and groundwater respond in a similar way to rainfall input with a general increasing ec trend in the annual data fig 7 additionally the low groundwater ec suggests rapid direct aquifer recharge and minimum residence time within both the unsaturated zone and the aquifer which in turn indicates local groundwater circulation rather than from regional contribution commensurate with the size of the catchment the rapid groundwater ec response after rainfall indicates the existence of preferential flow paths that contribute significant amount of recharge to groundwater furthermore surface and groundwater samples have similar major ion chemical compositions including na k cl hco3 and so4 2 the order of the relative abundances of the major anions and cations are hco3 so4 2 cl and ca2 mg2 na k respectively these observations indicate interaction between the stream and groundwater and active rainfall recharge taking place in the catchment calcium ca2 is the most abundant cation and bicarbonate hco3 is the most abundant anion the high concentration of hco3 may be originating from the dissolution of carbonate minerals within the unsaturated zone root respiration or organic material decomposition in the rooting zone freeze and cherry 1979 dry and wet season water samples show similar hydrochemical characteristics the piper trilinear plot of hydrochemical data fig 8 shows three hydrochemical facies the hydrochemical facies identified in fig 8 in the two streams catchment are described as follows facies 1 this hydrochemical facies is characterized by calcium and bicarbonate hco3 ions as the most dominant ions giving rise to a ca hco3 type water this is characteristic of freshly recharged groundwater that has equilibrated with co2 and soluble carbonate minerals under open system conditions in the soil zone the dissolution of carbonate releases ca2 into solution producing ca hco3 water type as a final product most groundwater samples falling in this zone are characterized by low mineralization as indicated by low ec and relative enrichment in bicarbonate attributed to recently recharged groundwater from rainfall facies 2 this facies has predominantly high concentration of calcium and chloride ions giving rise to a ca cl hydrochemical water type and most stream samples fall into this category this facies provides an indication of water samples from an active discharge zone with a short residence time where chloride is contributed from rainfall and shallow soil zones accumulated by evaporative processes facies 3 this hydrochemical facies indicate a mixed zone where no dominant water types can be identified from either the anions or cations some stream and groundwater samples fall into this zone indicating a strong inter relationship between surface and groundwater in the study area 4 3 environmental isotope characteristics the results of the stable environmental isotopes deuterium and 18o analysis for rainfall stream and groundwater during the wet and dry seasons are presented on the δ2h δ 18o plot in fig 9 and in the esm the isotope signatures of rainfall stream and groundwater during the wet season are similar and clustered together along the lmwl fig 9a indicating that the main source of stream and groundwater during the wet season is rainfall the isotopic composition of stream water is controlled by the mixing rates of surface runoff interflow and baseflow the clustering of groundwater isotope around the mean rainfall signature suggests that groundwater recharge from rainfall seems to take place rapidly possibly via preferred pathways without undergoing significant evaporation since the fact that the majority of the isotope composition of rainfall stream and groundwater samples plot in the same zone it can be concluded that recent rainfall is the source of groundwater and main contributor of water to the stream along with baseflow during the wet season during the dry season rainfall isotope signatures are scattered along the lmwl fig 9b indicating that the rainfall moisture source has undergone some degree of isotopic modification or the source of moisture is local moisture feedback processes the stream and groundwater samples are clustered together suggesting that during dry season the main contributor of water flowing in the stream is entirely groundwater discharge 4 4 groundwater contribution to total stream flow baseflow the groundwater contribution to the flow of the stream in the study catchment is quantified using the web based hydrograph analysis tool what and stable isotope techniques where the results of the two approaches of baseflow separation are compared table 2 shows the 12 years 2007 2017 continuous streamflow data separated into direct runoff and baseflow using the what digital filter baseflow separation method it is well documented that digital filter based baseflow separation is sensitive to the chosen filter parameter eckhardt 2012 considering that the chosen filter parameter is representative to the catchment the results show that the mean annual runoff in the catchment is about 20387 m3 of which 14768 m3 72 is attributed to baseflow contribution the years with the highest mean annual runoff are 2006 2007 and 2008 and correspondingly the baseflow contributions are also the highest in these years in subsequently years i e from 2009 both total runoff and groundwater contribution to baseflow have decreased since noticeable rainfall reduction and temperature increase were not noted during the study period except between 2014 and 2016 these results appear to indicate that ten 10 year old acacia mearnsii plantations have the capacity to reduce baseflow contribution to streamflow significantly which in turn reduces streamflow however the 2014 2016 dry spells in the region has also impacted the decrease in the stream discharge in these years to further understand the hydrological processes in detail continuous daily streamflow data between 29 february 2012 and 30 june 2014 were scrutinized and analysed fig 10 this period is selected due to the fact that both streamflow and stable isotope data of rainfall stream and groundwater were available the un validated baseflow analysis from a single parameter digital filter method fig 10 provided an estimated direct runoff volume of 528 m3 yr and baseflow contribution of 688 8 m3 yr which is 43 and 57 respectively of the total streamflow volume of 1217 m3 yr precipitation on the stream channel is assumed to be negligible due to the small size of the stream the results of δ2h isotope based baseflow separated from the total daily stream discharge data is shown in table 3 since the δ2h isotope based simple two component hydrograph separation has many inherent limitations as a result of the variabilities in the isotopic signature of groundwater the storm and rainfall clark and fritz 1997 turner and barnes 1998 the results need to be applied cautiously for instance some baseflow values in table 3 are greater than the daily total stream flow which is not possible such type of limitations and erroneous results emanate from a disconnect between the assumptions and the actual isotopic measurements or both therefore the estimated baseflow needs to be considered mainly for hydrological process understanding and trend observations than for accurate quantitative analysis of baseflow and storm flow nevertheless table 3 shows that the total stream flow is dominated by pre event water or groundwater contributions than direct runoff similar observations have been summarized by turner and barnes 1998 based on a review of the application of the method in a number of studies furthermore the baseflow value calculated using the isotope approach for the two streams catchment is much higher than the baseflow contribution calculated using what table 3 regardless of the inherent uncertainties in the results of both methods it appear to suggest that the isotope based baseflow most likely includes the interflow component of the discharge hydrograph of the stream which is a dominant component of stream flow in small forested catchments with moderately steep slope and deep vadose zone table 3 similar observations were reported in berman et al 2009 where that some forested catchments with baseflow index above 50 indicates over estimation of baseflow contribution conceptually the isotope based baseflow estimates from the current study suggest that rainfall infiltrates through the vadose zone and flows as interflow and part of which discharges into the stream and part of it percolates to recharge the shallow aquifer which eventually discharges as baseflow these two components namely the interflow and the shallow groundwater contribution are lumped together as baseflow 4 5 catchment water balance the concept of water balance provides a framework for studying the hydrological behavior of the catchment and assumes that all water entering the catchment is equal to the water leaving it plus or minus any change in storage brassington 2006 the 12 year annual water balance results of the two streams catchment are presented in table 4 total precipitation p is the input parameter while total evapotranspiration et direct runoff dr and groundwater contribution to baseflow gbf including the interflow component are output parameters a positive value indicates an increase in water storage while negative value indicates storage decline the changes in water storage for the study catchment table 4 show a continuous reduction with the exception of the years 2009 and 2012 responding to varying amount of water losses through evapotranspiration direct runoff and groundwater discharge as baseflow as well as a reduction in annual precipitation annual storage changes are all negative over the entire 10 year period except for years 2009 and 2012 this is expected since year 2012 recorded the highest rainfall over the 10 year period the years with highest declines in storage were 2010 2014 and 2015 respectively these declines are expected as these years were relatively dry years with their annual average rainfall lower than the 10 year average of 748 mm whilst evapotranspiration continued to exceed rainfall inputs during these years the rate of direct runoff and baseflow were the highest in the year 2007 with values of 63 2 mm a and 41 9 mm a respectively this is expected as trees were newly planted planted in august 2006 and were not expected to have significant impact on baseflow baseflow decreased in subsequent years these results suggest that acacia mearnsii trees display a significant impact in the water balance of the catchment mainly by reducing baseflow and transpire significant amount of water into the atmosphere 4 6 impacts of acacia mearnsii trees on groundwater the impacts of plantations on groundwater systems are usually inferred from changes in soil moisture groundwater levels and stream discharges the key findings of plantation impacts in groundwater are that after the removal of forests wetter soil moisture contents and higher groundwater levels are expected due to reduced evapotranspiration rates le maitre et al 1999 peck and williamson 1987 smerdon et al 2009 whilst afforestation or replantation results in reduced recharge lower groundwater levels decline in baseflow and consequent reduction in streamflow the results of investigation of the impacts of acacia mearnsii tree stand on the secondary groundwater system at the two streams experimental catchment using data spanning over a 10 year period 2007 2017 is presented based on the potential for direct groundwater uptake by roots impacts on groundwater levels changes in streamflow and consequently impacts on baseflow 4 6 1 direct groundwater uptake the primary factor affecting the pattern of water extraction by plants from the soil is rooting depth roots would penetrate as deep into the soil as required to reach available water unless restricted by soil characteristics that prevent rooting or by permanent water table however penetration will be restricted by soil or regolith characteristics that prevent rooting or by permanent water table cannon 1949 nepstad et al 1994 stone and comerford 1994 stone and kalisz 1991 depending on soil characteristics the lateral rooting systems of the tree can often exceed the equivalent height of the tree in order to maximise water uptake sherry 1971 the acacia mearnsii roots can reach the depths of 3 35 m and even greater than 53 m was observed in one recorded case scott and le maitre 1998 in the studied catchment roots were found up to a depth of 5 m during drilling in october 2012 six years after planting everson et al 2014 based on a constant root depth growth rate of 5 m in 6 years as observed at the two streams catchment by 2017 roots would be approximately 10 m deep clay material can support a capillary fringe of up to 1 5 m brunel et al 1995 therefore considering the potential root depth of 10 m and maximum capillary fringe of 1 5 m direct groundwater uptake by acacia mearnsii tree roots would be possible for up to 11 5 m deep the drilling geophysical investigations and subsequent groundwater level monitoring indicate that the depth to the upper unconfined aquifer range between 15 m and 24 m bgl and the deep semi confined weathered and fractured granitic aquifer occurs at 43 m bgl the regional groundwater level monitored from 2006 and 2017 in four boreholes within the study area range between 19 m bgl and 48 m bgl given the possible direct groundwater uptake by tree roots of up to 11 5 m the unconfined and semi confined aquifers would not be available for extraction by tree roots in the study area the only possible available water for extraction by trees is the perched aquifers or pockets of water lenses and moisture that occur within the unsaturated zone 4 6 2 impact on groundwater level and recharge the acacia mearnsii stands in the catchment were planted in august 2006 groundwater levels in boreholes showed a clearly defined seasonal and interannual groundwater level fluctuations during the first few years of planting however as trees continue to grow groundwater levels in boreholes continued to fluctuate and by 2017 all failed to rise to original water levels observed during the first few years after planting the hourly interval groundwater levels monitored using data loggers in boreholes 2stbh1 2stbh3 2stbh4 and 2stbh5 for the period from mid september 2011 to april 2017 dropped by about 3 m 9 8 m 9 5 m and 1 1 m respectively fig 11 the high groundwater level decline in boreholes 2stbh3 and 2stbh4 appears to be attributed to their position at the water divide of the local groundwater flow regime which are the most affected when overall groundwater storage is declined though other derivers including below average precipitation may have played a role the decline in groundwater level is also in agreement with the calculated water balance of the catchment table 4 where a general decline in catchment water storage was observed between 2007 and 2017 these results are to some extent attributed to the fact that acacia mearnsii stands have a significant impact on groundwater levels by extracting water from within the unsaturated zone to meet demands thus reducing water available for recharging the aquifer similar observation was reported in bosch 1979 where afforestation caused reduction in baseflow and groundwater levels commencing some six to eight years after planting additionally kok 1976 reported that groundwater recharge was reduced from the expected 10 of map under grassland to zero after 5 8 years of planting trees due to water extraction through increased transpiration from the unsaturated zone thus these results imply that where there are deep soils deeply fractured or decomposed rock acacia mearnsii trees can have a huge impact on groundwater storage by dropping groundwater levels by extracting water from the unsaturated zone reducing water available for groundwater recharge without necessarily having direct access to the groundwater proper 4 6 3 impacts on baseflow baseflow is an important component of streamflow which comes from groundwater storage including shallow subsurface storage baseflow separation of total streamflow indicated that about 57 of total streamflow in the studied catchment is attributed to baseflow the baseflow in the catchment decreased drastically between 2006 and 2010 as shown in fig 12 though there was a variation in the amount of rainfall this period coincides with the first five years of afforestation of the catchment with acacia mearnsii trees the increase in baseflow between 2011 and 2013 appears to be in response to increase in rainfall however it again start to decline and leveling off between 2014 and 2017 again perhaps due to the combined impact of the 2014 2016 dry spell and the acacia mearnsii trees this result is once again in agreement with the study conducted by bosch 1979 which reported that afforestation causes reduction in baseflow commencing some six to eight years after planting and leveling off at around 50 thus acacia mearnsii trees affect baseflow by extracting water from within the unsaturated zone which then reduces the amount of water available to recharge groundwater and consequently reducing baseflow and total streamflow 4 7 hydrological conceptual model for the two streams catchment the geological geophysical hydrological hydrogeological hydrochemical and environmental isotope data are integrated and interpreted to develop a conceptual hydrogeological model for the two stream catchment study site fig 13 the conceptual model helps to visualize understand and explain the most important hydrological processes taking place across the study catchment the conceptual model is constructed based on original data generated from aquifer tests information collected during field observations undertaken during the course of this study and complemented by data from previous studies 5 conclusions hydrological processes and the impacts of acacia mearnsii plantations on groundwater within the two streams experimental catchment located in the kwazulu natal midlands of south africa have been investigated through a combined hydrological hydrogeological hydrochemical and environmental isotope methods the three geological units identified from surface geological borehole logs and geophysical data are grouped into two hydrostratigraphic units of an upper thin unconfined aquifer occurring along the weathered shale and a lower weathered and fractured semi confined granitic aquifer the regional aquifer is characterized by a transmissivity that ranges from 0 15 to 0 48 m2 day and a hydraulic conductivity of 0 04 m day which make it a poorly productive aquifer the groundwater flow direction follows the topographic gradient the study catchment receives an average annual groundwater recharge of 32 mm or 4 of map hydrochemical data indicates that both groundwater and stream samples have similar mean specific electrical conductivity ec of 285 μs cm and three main groundwater hydrochemical facies are identified these are ca hco3 water type characterized by shallow low mineralized and with a relatively high concentration of hco3 attributed to an active and flushed groundwater system ca cl water type which is a characteristic of water from active discharge zone and mixed water type where no dominant cations and anions are identified the δ2h and δ18o isotopic composition of all water samples plot mainly along the lmwl and gmwl indicating direct recharge from rainfall without extensive evaporation during or prior to recharge monthly seasonal stable isotope data of groundwater and stream samples indicate that groundwater is the main contributor of streamflow during the dry season the results of investigation of the impacts of acacia mearnsii tree stand on the secondary aquifer system within the studied catchment showed that direct groundwater uptake by tree roots from the saturated zone at two streams would not be possible due to limiting rooting depth thus in instances where the regional groundwater table is not available for direct abstraction by tree roots acacia mearnsii trees can have considerable impact on groundwater through extracting water from within the unsaturated zone reducing the proportion of rainfall that reaches the aquifers and eventually discharge to the stream as baseflow without necessarily having direct access to the groundwater proper the reduction in the observed groundwater level baseflow and groundwater storage may not be attributed to a single driver such as acacia mearnsii trees but operating in tandem with climatic factors such as rainfall reduction declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

8022,study region denmark study focus groundwater surface water interaction gsi occurs when groundwater discharges into surface water or surface water seeps into the groundwater understanding gsi aids in understanding the quality and quantity of water and the ecosystem s health assisting water resource management and the protection of land and aquatic environment this paper presents a classification mapping routine to classify the danish stream network into an established gsi typology framework we mapped three classes for gsi contact types connected clayey connected sandy and disconnected and three classes for riparian flow paths diffuse and or overland direct and artificial drainage new hydrological insights for the region results revealed that about 85 of denmark s streams are connected to groundwater with approximately equal portions in sandy and clayey subsoil areas also about 87 of these streams exchange water with groundwater either as the only flow path or combined with other flow paths furthermore 41 and 19 of stream sections receive riparian flow water through artificial drainage and diffuse overland flow paths as the dominant flow path or combined these numbers correspond to denmark s land use which is approximately 60 agricultural restricting runoff potential and half of which is artificially drained we anticipate that the maps will assist policymakers in controlling water and pollutant transfer from the uplands to streams to attain good environmental status for surface and groundwater bodies keywords groundwater surface water interaction classification geographic information system mapping 1 introduction surface water and groundwater systems interact globally as surface water recharge the groundwater or groundwater exfiltrate onto the soil surface or discharge through the stream bed as return flow this can lead to contamination or improvement of both the water and conditions for lifeforms that dwell in these ecosystems understanding groundwater surface water interaction gsi is important for maintaining good quality and quantity of water and the ecosystem s health thereby providing information for water resource management and land and environmental protection it is essential for developing a sound policy and better water resources management khan and khan 2019 the european union s water framework directive wfd and groundwater directive gwd mandate that groundwater threshold values for life inhabiting ecosystems and the surface water bodies associated with those terrestrial areas must be monitored to ensure their protection dahl and hinsby 2013 a fundamental motivation behind the wfd is to advance sustainable water utilization while ensuring and improving the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem water requirements despite the significance of gsi there is no well defined groundwater dependent terrestrial ecosystem in the wfd however the word covers the region where the water table is close to the ground surface this term encompasses riparian areas also known as river valley bottoms and wetlands dahl et al 2007 different gsi frameworks covering critical factors such as hydrological biogeochemical and biological processes have been developed conant et al 2019 tóth 1963 characterized groundwater as flow systems within a drainage basin controlled by geomorphology he recognized three flow system scales for unconfined groundwater firstly a local groundwater flow system occurs at a geologically high area where the flow of the local groundwater system has its recharge however it discharges in adjacent geologically low areas secondly an intermediate flow system may comprise geologically high or low areas in the same basin although its recharge and discharge regions may not occupy the highest and lowest areas respectively thirdly a regional groundwater flow system occurs if the groundwater flow recharge area is located at a water divide and discharges at the lowest part of the basin tóth 1963 heath 1982 suggested a classification of groundwater systems into two levels the first level arranges and identifies the components of the system consisting of unconfined aquifers confining layers and confined aquifers the second level the regional aquifer is categorized further this categorization helps to understand further the complexity of the regional groundwater system and patterns for regional discharge a danish study reviewed these former studies to create a multi scale typology based on eco hydrological concepts dahl et al 2007 it suggested three classification scales landscape type riparian hydrogeological type and flow path type classified on an arbitrary catchment scale of 5 km stream length a river reach scale of 1 5 km and a local scale 10 1000 m respectively the landscape type classification characterizes groundwater flow systems as a regional frame that controls the discharge sequences and flow processes the groundwater flow system is a diverse 3d system regional geomorphology and hydrogeological setting are the classification criteria used in this system the typology distinguishes between four landscape types single dominant unconfined aquifer two interconnected aquifers of equal importance a three unit system consisting of an unconfined aquifer a confining layer and a confined aquifer and a complexly interbedded sequence of aquifers and confining layers with no dominant aquifer dahl et al 2007 the intermediate classification in dahl et al 2007 is the riparian hydrogeological type which classifies the hydrogeological setting beside the riparian area this scale helps to identify the interchange between the groundwater body and riparian area aquifer the hydrogeological settings are characterized by the contact type and groundwater body type fig 1 the groundwater body types include local and regional groundwater bodies the typology then identifies five contact types describing the physical connection within a groundwater body and a riparian area aquifer the contact types are arranged in a sequence from no contact to complete contact they identify the ability of groundwater to enter the riparian area aquifer the five contact types fig 1 describing the physical connection are 1 disconnected an impregnable confining layer present within a groundwater body and a riparian area aquifer which does not allow the groundwater and the riparian area aquifer to interchange 2 confined a low impregnable confining layer within a groundwater body and a riparian area aquifer allowing a little interchange of groundwater and the riparian area aquifer 3 lateral a riparian area aquifer is in contact with a groundwater body at the adjacent slope of a hill to the riparian area aquifer groundwater and the riparian area aquifer interchanges at the slope of the hill 4 bottom a riparian area aquifer enters the body of groundwater at its base and 5 unconfined from all three sides a riparian area aquifer enters the body of unconfined groundwater the riparian flow path type controls the flow path through the riparian area aquifer to the stream based on the flow path distribution in riparian areas depending on the type of flow matrix preferential overland channel or pipe and time of contact between riparian deposits containing minerogenic and organic materials and water there are four categorized dominating flow paths for transferring water to the stream from riparian areas these flow paths control the ability of a riparian area to keep up the high water quality of its adjoining stream these flow paths are given in fig 2 1 diffuse flow q1 water runs slowly through the aquifer of a riparian area in this flow path resulting in prolonged riparian deposits and water contact in diffuse flow the riparian aquifer may refill or infiltrate laterally or upwards through seepage faces or drains by the groundwater this groundwater may stay for weeks or years in the riparian aquifer till the time it flows into the stream or it may flow back to the riparian surface as a return flow 2 overland flow q2 there is a short contact time between the water and riparian deposits in overland flow from endings of drains hillslope water might interact with the riparian area or get flooded by the stream also water in the form of springs might get to the riparian surface by preferential flow typically staying for a few hours to several days 3 direct flow q3 via stream bed the direct flow path interchanges the groundwater underneath the riparian area aquifer with the help of the primary groundwater body the water might or might not have contact with the riparian deposit for a few days 4 drainage flow q4 the water in this flow path is transferred via drainage pipes or open ditches passing through the riparian area aquifer directly moving it in the stream this flow takes place in hours to days in this work we aim at presenting a classification mapping routine to classify the stream network based on the gsi typology of dahl et al 2007 we carry out a danish national mapping classification at the riparian hydrogeological type and the riparian flow path type levels we simplify the mapping of the riparian hydrogeological types into three classes connected clayey connected sandy and disconnected fig 1 on the same note we group the diffuse and overland flow into one class 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area denmark is located in northern europe and has an area of about 43 000 km2 the country is generally flat and has a mean elevation 31 m above sea level m a s l with the highest point at 172 m a s l several small to large streams exist the largest being the gudenå skjern å and storå at 149 96 and 100 km length respectively fig 3 shows denmark s location within europe and displays its digital elevation model dem showing its elevations we later demonstrate our methodology using the gudenå catchment representing a moraine landscape the most extensive landscape in denmark occupying an area of about 30 000 km2 2 2 data we used various danish national maps in the form of geographic information system gis files the first dataset is a dem of denmark as shown in fig 3 it is lidar processed raster data measured and analyzed by the danish agency for data supply and efficiency the highest available spatial resolution is 40 cm and can be retrieved freely www sdfe dk accessed on 2 april 2018 for our purpose we resampled this data to a spatial resolution of 10 m we did this to decrease processing times and reduce data noise typically found in high resolution raster derived lidar datasets the second dataset consists of a stream network polyline feature layer about 27 000 km long created and available at the department of ecoscience aarhus university the third dataset is a polygon feature layer containing the extent of the river valley bottom of denmark sechu et al 2021 fig 4a shows the stream network line overlaid on the river valley bottom boundary the data is available at the department of agroecology aarhus university the fourth dataset is subsoil clay percentage it is a raster dataset with a 30 4 m resolution it shows the predicted clay contents of the soil at depth intervals of 0 30 cm 30 60 cm 60 100 cm and 100 200 cm adhikari et al 2013 we combined the depth intervals 60 100 cm and 100 200 cm to better represent the subsoil for this study fig 4b soil data from the same study is also available as usda texture classes which we also use in the current study fig 4e the fifth dataset is a polygon feature layer consisting of groundwater aquifers extracted from the danish national water resources model henriksen et al 2003 troldborg et al 2014 commonly known as the dk model this layer contains multiple polygons overlapping each other and a specific attribute that depicts geological horizons that determine which polygon overlays the other the sixth dataset is also a dk model derived raster dataset with a spatial resolution of 500 m containing the depth to phreatic surface fig 4c shows the groundwater aquifer boundaries and depth to the phreatic surface both of which are extracts of the dk model the seventh dataset is raster data with a 30 4 m resolution showing the probability of coming across artificial drainage in danish agricultural areas predicted with a machine learning model ensemble møller et al 2018 drainage activities started in denmark around 1848 and were primarily funded by the government over two periods the work in the second part of the 19th century was concentrated in eastern denmark s loamy moraines moreover from the 1930s through the 1970s most of the drainage work occurred in wetland areas in the country s western region breuning madsen 2010 hansen et al 2005 we furthermore complemented this dataset with a recent analysis on drainage in peat areas greve et al 2021 fig 4d shows the map of the probability of artificial drainage and drainage classification in peat areas the eighth and last dataset is the corine land cover dataset clc fig 4f it is a feature layer containing 44 classes of land use heymann et al 1994 we use the latest 2012 version of this dataset 3 methodology 3 1 groundwater surface water contact classification we created a model to classify the contact between the stream network and groundwater aquifers using gis techniques with arcgis pro desktop esri arcgis 2019 and arc hydro tools djokic et al 2011 arc hydro tools can be used with the arcgis software packages to handle hydrological data efficiently and ease water resources modeling we created the model with modelbuilder a visual programming language used in constructing geoprocessing workflows within the arcgis software the following methodological description refers to tools within arcgis combined with a schematic diagram in fig 5 and step by step visualization maps in fig 6 the model first splits the stream network using groundwater aquifers step a in fig 5 the dk model is built from the geological horizons that make up the groundwater aquifers these geological horizons depict which groundwater aquifer overlays the other with quaternary sand layers in the top of the layer sequence followed by pre quaternary sand and chalk limestone layers in depth according to how they overlay each other our model sorts these polygons accordingly i e starting from the topmost aquifer to the bottom it uses the sort tool found in data management tools it then selects and extracts the topmost aquifers and uses those to split the stream network using the identity tool found in analysis tools the model then delineates stream network catchments using dendritic terrain processing with imposed drainage line and wall tool found within arc hydro tools with the dem and the split stream network polyline as inputs step b in fig 5 this operation delineates stream reach catchments through a series of bundled arc hydro tools by imposing flow direction on the input dem using the input stream network the process is known as stream burning and is used to force water to flow in the direction of known streams furthermore using the river valley bottom polygon and the delineated stream catchment polygons as input the model extracts river valleys within the delineated catchments step c in fig 5 we use the tool spatial join within analysis tools for this operation the resulting river valley bottom within the delineated catchments depicts the riparian area that drains into a specific stream section next the model estimates the dominant subsoil type for the river valleys within the stream catchments step d in fig 5 it does this using the subsoil clay percentage layer and the previously extracted river valleys within catchments we do this to add the surrounding majority subsoil type the model combines the subsoil depth as a weighted mean using their respective thicknesses eq 1 the model then divides the subsoil clay content into two classes using the spatial analyst s con tool the model classifies subsoils with more than 10 clay as clayey and subsoils with less than 10 as sandy it furthermore uses the raster calculator tool within spatial analyst tools which assigns 1 for clayey and 2 for sandy the model then converts the result into a polygon using the summarize within tool it summarizes the two subsoil classes within the river valley resulting in representing the majority subsoil class in river valleys attached to streams the subsoil clay percentage based on depth weighting at 60 100 cm and 100 200 cm was calculated as a weighted average based on the thickness of the two depth intervals using the following equation 1 subsoil clay 40 clay 60 100 cm 100 clay 100 200 cm 100 40 additionally the model interpolates the depth to the groundwater using the split stream section polylines and the groundwater phreatic surface raster step e in fig 5 this step calculates the mean depth to the groundwater for each stream segment by interpolating the phreatic surface raster layer using 3d analyst s add surface information tool which can extract raster values to polylines through bilinear interpolation the final step is the classification step f in fig 5 wherein the model uses the dominant subsoil within each stream segment layer and the interpolated groundwater depth if the depth to the groundwater is greater than 3 m then the stream segment is classified as disconnected fig 1 likewise if the depth is less than or equal to 3 m and the subsoil is clayey it is connected clayey if the depth is less than or equal to 3 m and the subsoil is sandy it is connected sandy fig 1 the depth was based on the danish groundwater model s underlying geological model henriksen et al 2003 which had a minimum depth of 3 m that was determined to be the smallest size that incorporated aquifers therefore the hydraulic contact between the stream and groundwater was considered probable if the distance is less than 3 m troldborg et al 2014 if none of these conditions are fulfilled then we label it as no data no data is a scenario where there is missing data at a particular stream section 3 2 mapping classification of riparian flow paths we further mapped the flow paths within the riparian areas due to the complexity mapping scale and available spatial data we grouped the diffuse and overland flow paths into one class the classified flow paths are then diffuse overland or both q1 q2 direct q3 and drainage q4 fig 2 starting with the q1 q2 class we used a parameter curve number a dimensionless parameter describing a basin s overland flow response eqs 2 and 3 the soil conservation service scs initially developed it for conditions prevalent in the united states but has since been adapted to environments in other parts of the world soil conservation service 1964 1972 it combines the land use thereby depicting the surface cover of the drainage basin and couples this with hydrological soil groups that depict the infiltration rate during overland flow the curve number method uses soil data classified according to the usda nomenclature we therefore used maps of the usda texture classes fig 7a next we reclassified the corine land cover data into simplified agricultural forest residential and water classes from the nomenclature used in corine data table 1 as seen in fig 7b we then finally calculated a curve number raster using hec geohms a hydrology tool used within arcgis hec geohms includes a generate cn grid tool that inputs a dem a combination of soil and land use and a lookup table the output is a curve number raster fig 7c a global study by jaafar et al 2019 revealed that curve number thresholds of 62 78 and 90 represent conditions of dry average and wet in a runoff event it also found that curve numbers in the 75 85 range represent a medium to high runoff potential using this as a guide we thresholded our curve numbers as 30 62 62 74 and 75 100 taking the upper band as high overland flow potential we classified all streams passing through river valleys with these curve numbers as q1 q2 fig 7d 2 s 100 cn 10 3 i a 0 2 s where s potential maximum retention after runoff begins cn scs curve number i a initial abstraction or the quantity of water available before discharge such as infiltration or rainfall interception by vegetation we then classified the direct class q3 we used a baseflow raster layer also extracted from the dk model for this purpose we first interpolated baseflow within the stream sections using 3d analyst s add surface information tool the operation extracts the baseflow for each stream section we apply a simple classification to determine which stream sections have a baseflow of less than zero zero or greater than zero fig 8a sections with baseflow greater than zero sustain baseflow meaning the stream stretch receive discharging groundwater throughout the year negative baseflow numbers indicate that stream water is lost through the stream bed to the groundwater aquifer baseflow equals zero at stretches of the river network where no exchange of groundwater and surface water occurs we subsequently classify these stream sections as direct flow paths q3 fig 8b we then move on to classify the flow path drainage q4 we use the probability of artificially drainage raster layer for this purpose based on the probability we defined two classes møller et al 2018 drained areas 50 probability and undrained areas 50 probability fig 9a we therefore use a threshold of 50 to classify stream sections with a dominating riparian flow path artificial drainage as q4 fig 9b 4 results and discussion 4 1 groundwater surface water contact map of denmark we ran our model and classified the gsi contact for denmark s streams fig 10 shows the classification for the gudenå catchment which is the largest catchment in denmark the map shows the three classes connected clayey connected sandy and disconnected 3 m depth to phreatic surface for the stream polyline feature the class no data indicates stream sections with missing data this occurs when either the subsoil or data were missing at that particular stream stretch common areas that this occurs mainly include lakes the map also presents the subsoil classification into clayey and sandy areas table 2 presents a summary of the gsi contact classification for all streams in denmark it reveals that about 85 of the combined length of danish streams are connected to the groundwater with an almost equal distribution of clayey 44 and sandy 41 subsoils this emphasizes that most danish streams are groundwater fed a look at the gudenå catchment gsi contact distribution fig 10 reveals that most of the connected stream stretches lie in the main stream flow path downstream of branches while the disconnected stream stretches are further upstream of the branches we expected this since the upstream stretches lie higher in elevation where groundwater depths are likely to be more significant than the main flow line leading downstream 4 2 flow path classification map of denmark we also present the classified flow path within riparian areas to streams with the gudenå drainage basin fig 11 we color code all stream sections with the three classifications i e diffuse and or overland q1 2 direct q3 and drainage q4 and sections that have combinations of these flow paths results reveal that most of the main stream flow path is fed by direct flow paths q3 like with the gsi contact classification the main stream path is usually located in the lowest part of the terrain and is the most probable candidate for a direct exchange with the groundwater our study reveals that 43 of all danish stream sections are fed by direct flow paths alone table 3 if sections with combined flow paths are included 87 of stream stretches have direct flow paths i e 43 for q3 alone 9 27 and 8 for the combinations q1 2 q3 q3 q4 q1 2 q3 q4 respectively we expected this since most danish lowland areas have a very shallow water table and streams are mostly groundwater fed jørgensen and stockmarr 2009 stream stretches fed by drainage alone account for about 5 of streams in denmark and 41 of all stream stretches have contributions at least partly from artificial drainage table 3 we attribute this to the fact that about half of denmark s agricultural land is artificially drained møller et al 2018 olesen 2009 there are very few areas with diffuse and or overland riparian flow paths q1 2 alone 1 but these flow paths are present in 19 of stream sections when sections with combined flow paths are accounted for table 3 about 60 of denmark is agricultural land statistics denmark 2021 unlike artificial areas such as pavements agricultural areas have a lower runoff potential leading to a lower contribution than the direct flow class cronshey 1986 in order to get an impression of how precisely the new model predicts the distribution of flow paths we can take a look at how detailed field experiments can characterize flow paths several pilot field studies have focused on characterizing flow paths and determining the relative proportions of fluxes along the flow paths in the riparian stream system it has been possible to measure these fluxes in a few danish stream cases and establish a water balance for skjern stream andersen 2004 haller stream langhoff et al 2006 holtum stream steiness et al 2019 and fensholt stream petersen et al 2020 in most cases however flow paths were indirectly identified and quantified by modeling at voldby creek hoffmann et al 2006 kidmose et al 2010 lindenborg stream johansen et al 2011 holtum stream jensen and engesgaard 2011 karan et al 2013 and odense stream kolbjørn jensen et al 2017 these studies indicate that direct seepage through the stream bed can be almost negligible to almost 100 going from a clay to a sandy geological setting man made structures such as drains cutoff drains at the hillslope and ditches frederiksen et al 2018 hoffmann et al 2012 petersen et al 2020 steiness et al 2019 and abandoned irrigation canals langhoff et al 2006 have been shown to be other important transport pathways direct seepage through the streambed can be very heterogeneous due to high spatial variability in hydraulic conductivity and gradients has been shown in holtum stream karan et al 2014 poulsen et al 2015 sebok et al 2015 risby stream milosevic et al 2012 and grindsted stream cremeans et al 2018 in other words there are numerous examples of danish field studies that have identified and quantified three of the four flow paths proposed in the gsi typology direct flow overland flow and drainage flow the diffusive flow path is the only one where no field studies that have been conducted this does not mean that it does not exist in nature but it means that when the classification mapping routine presented here only identifies up to 1 of the watercourse sections dominated by diffusive flow along with overland flow it is in accordance with the obtained field results there are some limitations to this method however an example is that about 7 of the results fall under the no data class table 3 the reason for this is that there is missing data within some layers this is specifically true for the artificial drainage maps fig 4d the missing data leads to an incomplete picture of the analysis and could be an area of improvement in future mapping campaigns another limitation is the spatial resolution of some of the maps the dk model maps are currently only available at a spatial resolution of 500 m which is relatively coarse for analyses like these the geological model that makes up the danish groundwater model is constructed as a multi layered model set up in 500 m grids as well for each geological layer the horizontal uncertainty was estimated to be 500 m and the vertical to be 3 m troldborg et al 2014 therefore the uncertainty of the classification is 500 m on the horizontal scale and 3 m vertically the vertical uncertainty is least in flat landscapes with minimal river valley topography and river valleys with larger topography 3 m will have larger vertical uncertainty care should therefore be taken when interpreting the results furthermore it is challenging to isolate contributions from individual flow paths in areas with multiple flow paths therefore our study should serve as a screening tool for localized detailed studies that have the capacity for collecting measurements 4 3 novelty of the work typologies and conceptual classification systems for upland hydrological connectivity and deep shallow or bypassing flow paths have been proposed to characterize groundwater stream interaction and potential n removal in riparian lowlands dahl et al 2007 hill 1996 jencso et al 2009 noij et al 2012 vidon and hill 2004 the gsi typology in denmark by dahl et al 2007 was based on older classification systems for danish watercourses that did not take geology geomorphology and groundwater into account hasholt 1999 mernild and hasholt 2003 as the mapping routine described in this paper largely follows the gsi typology it includes a link between geomorphology and groundwater no previous studies have used geospatial data at the national level and the work provides information on gsi for much larger areas than previously seen 4 4 perspectives the proposed classification mapping routine is justified only by danish field studies but we expect that the developed gis tools can be utilized in geologic and geomorphologic regions with glacial deposits similar to the danish setting anywhere in the world another critical precondition is that good geospatial data must exist at the national level or in large regions unfortunately sparse datasets do not provide the information required for classifying the gsi contact and flow paths due to the arbitrary scales proposed by the underlying gsi typology i e a river reach scale of 1 5 km and a local scale 10 1000 m respectively dahl et al 2007 therefore increasing the sparsity of data only increases the uncertainty of the resulting maps 5 conclusions according to an established typology by dahl et al 2007 we created a model to map and classify the groundwater surface water gsi contact and mapped riparian flow paths to streams it is an essential first step towards understanding the spatial distribution of gsi in denmark we use arcgis s modelbuilder to create a model workflow for classifying the gsi contact we then use varying gis techniques to classify stream sections into different flow paths that water takes as it transports the riparian area the gsi contact classification revealed that most danish streams are in contact with groundwater and most of these are located in the main stream flow path leading to the downstream of a catchment riparian flow path classifications revealed that the most common flow path is direct groundwater exchange with the stream and artificial drainage diffuse and or overland flow paths within riparian areas were not significant when they appeared in stream sections alone but could be part of combined flow paths in a riparian catchment this is a cause for concern since drainage flow paths transmit water directly to the stream without the potential for n removal through the riparian area many field and modeling studies have identified flow paths in nature but this is the first time a national spatial mapping has been conducted we expect that the generated maps will aid policy support as a screening decision support tool in managing water and contaminant transport from the uplands to streams to achieve a good environmental status of surface and groundwater bodies funding this work was funded by the graduate school of technical sciences aarhus university credit

8022,study region denmark study focus groundwater surface water interaction gsi occurs when groundwater discharges into surface water or surface water seeps into the groundwater understanding gsi aids in understanding the quality and quantity of water and the ecosystem s health assisting water resource management and the protection of land and aquatic environment this paper presents a classification mapping routine to classify the danish stream network into an established gsi typology framework we mapped three classes for gsi contact types connected clayey connected sandy and disconnected and three classes for riparian flow paths diffuse and or overland direct and artificial drainage new hydrological insights for the region results revealed that about 85 of denmark s streams are connected to groundwater with approximately equal portions in sandy and clayey subsoil areas also about 87 of these streams exchange water with groundwater either as the only flow path or combined with other flow paths furthermore 41 and 19 of stream sections receive riparian flow water through artificial drainage and diffuse overland flow paths as the dominant flow path or combined these numbers correspond to denmark s land use which is approximately 60 agricultural restricting runoff potential and half of which is artificially drained we anticipate that the maps will assist policymakers in controlling water and pollutant transfer from the uplands to streams to attain good environmental status for surface and groundwater bodies keywords groundwater surface water interaction classification geographic information system mapping 1 introduction surface water and groundwater systems interact globally as surface water recharge the groundwater or groundwater exfiltrate onto the soil surface or discharge through the stream bed as return flow this can lead to contamination or improvement of both the water and conditions for lifeforms that dwell in these ecosystems understanding groundwater surface water interaction gsi is important for maintaining good quality and quantity of water and the ecosystem s health thereby providing information for water resource management and land and environmental protection it is essential for developing a sound policy and better water resources management khan and khan 2019 the european union s water framework directive wfd and groundwater directive gwd mandate that groundwater threshold values for life inhabiting ecosystems and the surface water bodies associated with those terrestrial areas must be monitored to ensure their protection dahl and hinsby 2013 a fundamental motivation behind the wfd is to advance sustainable water utilization while ensuring and improving the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem water requirements despite the significance of gsi there is no well defined groundwater dependent terrestrial ecosystem in the wfd however the word covers the region where the water table is close to the ground surface this term encompasses riparian areas also known as river valley bottoms and wetlands dahl et al 2007 different gsi frameworks covering critical factors such as hydrological biogeochemical and biological processes have been developed conant et al 2019 tóth 1963 characterized groundwater as flow systems within a drainage basin controlled by geomorphology he recognized three flow system scales for unconfined groundwater firstly a local groundwater flow system occurs at a geologically high area where the flow of the local groundwater system has its recharge however it discharges in adjacent geologically low areas secondly an intermediate flow system may comprise geologically high or low areas in the same basin although its recharge and discharge regions may not occupy the highest and lowest areas respectively thirdly a regional groundwater flow system occurs if the groundwater flow recharge area is located at a water divide and discharges at the lowest part of the basin tóth 1963 heath 1982 suggested a classification of groundwater systems into two levels the first level arranges and identifies the components of the system consisting of unconfined aquifers confining layers and confined aquifers the second level the regional aquifer is categorized further this categorization helps to understand further the complexity of the regional groundwater system and patterns for regional discharge a danish study reviewed these former studies to create a multi scale typology based on eco hydrological concepts dahl et al 2007 it suggested three classification scales landscape type riparian hydrogeological type and flow path type classified on an arbitrary catchment scale of 5 km stream length a river reach scale of 1 5 km and a local scale 10 1000 m respectively the landscape type classification characterizes groundwater flow systems as a regional frame that controls the discharge sequences and flow processes the groundwater flow system is a diverse 3d system regional geomorphology and hydrogeological setting are the classification criteria used in this system the typology distinguishes between four landscape types single dominant unconfined aquifer two interconnected aquifers of equal importance a three unit system consisting of an unconfined aquifer a confining layer and a confined aquifer and a complexly interbedded sequence of aquifers and confining layers with no dominant aquifer dahl et al 2007 the intermediate classification in dahl et al 2007 is the riparian hydrogeological type which classifies the hydrogeological setting beside the riparian area this scale helps to identify the interchange between the groundwater body and riparian area aquifer the hydrogeological settings are characterized by the contact type and groundwater body type fig 1 the groundwater body types include local and regional groundwater bodies the typology then identifies five contact types describing the physical connection within a groundwater body and a riparian area aquifer the contact types are arranged in a sequence from no contact to complete contact they identify the ability of groundwater to enter the riparian area aquifer the five contact types fig 1 describing the physical connection are 1 disconnected an impregnable confining layer present within a groundwater body and a riparian area aquifer which does not allow the groundwater and the riparian area aquifer to interchange 2 confined a low impregnable confining layer within a groundwater body and a riparian area aquifer allowing a little interchange of groundwater and the riparian area aquifer 3 lateral a riparian area aquifer is in contact with a groundwater body at the adjacent slope of a hill to the riparian area aquifer groundwater and the riparian area aquifer interchanges at the slope of the hill 4 bottom a riparian area aquifer enters the body of groundwater at its base and 5 unconfined from all three sides a riparian area aquifer enters the body of unconfined groundwater the riparian flow path type controls the flow path through the riparian area aquifer to the stream based on the flow path distribution in riparian areas depending on the type of flow matrix preferential overland channel or pipe and time of contact between riparian deposits containing minerogenic and organic materials and water there are four categorized dominating flow paths for transferring water to the stream from riparian areas these flow paths control the ability of a riparian area to keep up the high water quality of its adjoining stream these flow paths are given in fig 2 1 diffuse flow q1 water runs slowly through the aquifer of a riparian area in this flow path resulting in prolonged riparian deposits and water contact in diffuse flow the riparian aquifer may refill or infiltrate laterally or upwards through seepage faces or drains by the groundwater this groundwater may stay for weeks or years in the riparian aquifer till the time it flows into the stream or it may flow back to the riparian surface as a return flow 2 overland flow q2 there is a short contact time between the water and riparian deposits in overland flow from endings of drains hillslope water might interact with the riparian area or get flooded by the stream also water in the form of springs might get to the riparian surface by preferential flow typically staying for a few hours to several days 3 direct flow q3 via stream bed the direct flow path interchanges the groundwater underneath the riparian area aquifer with the help of the primary groundwater body the water might or might not have contact with the riparian deposit for a few days 4 drainage flow q4 the water in this flow path is transferred via drainage pipes or open ditches passing through the riparian area aquifer directly moving it in the stream this flow takes place in hours to days in this work we aim at presenting a classification mapping routine to classify the stream network based on the gsi typology of dahl et al 2007 we carry out a danish national mapping classification at the riparian hydrogeological type and the riparian flow path type levels we simplify the mapping of the riparian hydrogeological types into three classes connected clayey connected sandy and disconnected fig 1 on the same note we group the diffuse and overland flow into one class 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area denmark is located in northern europe and has an area of about 43 000 km2 the country is generally flat and has a mean elevation 31 m above sea level m a s l with the highest point at 172 m a s l several small to large streams exist the largest being the gudenå skjern å and storå at 149 96 and 100 km length respectively fig 3 shows denmark s location within europe and displays its digital elevation model dem showing its elevations we later demonstrate our methodology using the gudenå catchment representing a moraine landscape the most extensive landscape in denmark occupying an area of about 30 000 km2 2 2 data we used various danish national maps in the form of geographic information system gis files the first dataset is a dem of denmark as shown in fig 3 it is lidar processed raster data measured and analyzed by the danish agency for data supply and efficiency the highest available spatial resolution is 40 cm and can be retrieved freely www sdfe dk accessed on 2 april 2018 for our purpose we resampled this data to a spatial resolution of 10 m we did this to decrease processing times and reduce data noise typically found in high resolution raster derived lidar datasets the second dataset consists of a stream network polyline feature layer about 27 000 km long created and available at the department of ecoscience aarhus university the third dataset is a polygon feature layer containing the extent of the river valley bottom of denmark sechu et al 2021 fig 4a shows the stream network line overlaid on the river valley bottom boundary the data is available at the department of agroecology aarhus university the fourth dataset is subsoil clay percentage it is a raster dataset with a 30 4 m resolution it shows the predicted clay contents of the soil at depth intervals of 0 30 cm 30 60 cm 60 100 cm and 100 200 cm adhikari et al 2013 we combined the depth intervals 60 100 cm and 100 200 cm to better represent the subsoil for this study fig 4b soil data from the same study is also available as usda texture classes which we also use in the current study fig 4e the fifth dataset is a polygon feature layer consisting of groundwater aquifers extracted from the danish national water resources model henriksen et al 2003 troldborg et al 2014 commonly known as the dk model this layer contains multiple polygons overlapping each other and a specific attribute that depicts geological horizons that determine which polygon overlays the other the sixth dataset is also a dk model derived raster dataset with a spatial resolution of 500 m containing the depth to phreatic surface fig 4c shows the groundwater aquifer boundaries and depth to the phreatic surface both of which are extracts of the dk model the seventh dataset is raster data with a 30 4 m resolution showing the probability of coming across artificial drainage in danish agricultural areas predicted with a machine learning model ensemble møller et al 2018 drainage activities started in denmark around 1848 and were primarily funded by the government over two periods the work in the second part of the 19th century was concentrated in eastern denmark s loamy moraines moreover from the 1930s through the 1970s most of the drainage work occurred in wetland areas in the country s western region breuning madsen 2010 hansen et al 2005 we furthermore complemented this dataset with a recent analysis on drainage in peat areas greve et al 2021 fig 4d shows the map of the probability of artificial drainage and drainage classification in peat areas the eighth and last dataset is the corine land cover dataset clc fig 4f it is a feature layer containing 44 classes of land use heymann et al 1994 we use the latest 2012 version of this dataset 3 methodology 3 1 groundwater surface water contact classification we created a model to classify the contact between the stream network and groundwater aquifers using gis techniques with arcgis pro desktop esri arcgis 2019 and arc hydro tools djokic et al 2011 arc hydro tools can be used with the arcgis software packages to handle hydrological data efficiently and ease water resources modeling we created the model with modelbuilder a visual programming language used in constructing geoprocessing workflows within the arcgis software the following methodological description refers to tools within arcgis combined with a schematic diagram in fig 5 and step by step visualization maps in fig 6 the model first splits the stream network using groundwater aquifers step a in fig 5 the dk model is built from the geological horizons that make up the groundwater aquifers these geological horizons depict which groundwater aquifer overlays the other with quaternary sand layers in the top of the layer sequence followed by pre quaternary sand and chalk limestone layers in depth according to how they overlay each other our model sorts these polygons accordingly i e starting from the topmost aquifer to the bottom it uses the sort tool found in data management tools it then selects and extracts the topmost aquifers and uses those to split the stream network using the identity tool found in analysis tools the model then delineates stream network catchments using dendritic terrain processing with imposed drainage line and wall tool found within arc hydro tools with the dem and the split stream network polyline as inputs step b in fig 5 this operation delineates stream reach catchments through a series of bundled arc hydro tools by imposing flow direction on the input dem using the input stream network the process is known as stream burning and is used to force water to flow in the direction of known streams furthermore using the river valley bottom polygon and the delineated stream catchment polygons as input the model extracts river valleys within the delineated catchments step c in fig 5 we use the tool spatial join within analysis tools for this operation the resulting river valley bottom within the delineated catchments depicts the riparian area that drains into a specific stream section next the model estimates the dominant subsoil type for the river valleys within the stream catchments step d in fig 5 it does this using the subsoil clay percentage layer and the previously extracted river valleys within catchments we do this to add the surrounding majority subsoil type the model combines the subsoil depth as a weighted mean using their respective thicknesses eq 1 the model then divides the subsoil clay content into two classes using the spatial analyst s con tool the model classifies subsoils with more than 10 clay as clayey and subsoils with less than 10 as sandy it furthermore uses the raster calculator tool within spatial analyst tools which assigns 1 for clayey and 2 for sandy the model then converts the result into a polygon using the summarize within tool it summarizes the two subsoil classes within the river valley resulting in representing the majority subsoil class in river valleys attached to streams the subsoil clay percentage based on depth weighting at 60 100 cm and 100 200 cm was calculated as a weighted average based on the thickness of the two depth intervals using the following equation 1 subsoil clay 40 clay 60 100 cm 100 clay 100 200 cm 100 40 additionally the model interpolates the depth to the groundwater using the split stream section polylines and the groundwater phreatic surface raster step e in fig 5 this step calculates the mean depth to the groundwater for each stream segment by interpolating the phreatic surface raster layer using 3d analyst s add surface information tool which can extract raster values to polylines through bilinear interpolation the final step is the classification step f in fig 5 wherein the model uses the dominant subsoil within each stream segment layer and the interpolated groundwater depth if the depth to the groundwater is greater than 3 m then the stream segment is classified as disconnected fig 1 likewise if the depth is less than or equal to 3 m and the subsoil is clayey it is connected clayey if the depth is less than or equal to 3 m and the subsoil is sandy it is connected sandy fig 1 the depth was based on the danish groundwater model s underlying geological model henriksen et al 2003 which had a minimum depth of 3 m that was determined to be the smallest size that incorporated aquifers therefore the hydraulic contact between the stream and groundwater was considered probable if the distance is less than 3 m troldborg et al 2014 if none of these conditions are fulfilled then we label it as no data no data is a scenario where there is missing data at a particular stream section 3 2 mapping classification of riparian flow paths we further mapped the flow paths within the riparian areas due to the complexity mapping scale and available spatial data we grouped the diffuse and overland flow paths into one class the classified flow paths are then diffuse overland or both q1 q2 direct q3 and drainage q4 fig 2 starting with the q1 q2 class we used a parameter curve number a dimensionless parameter describing a basin s overland flow response eqs 2 and 3 the soil conservation service scs initially developed it for conditions prevalent in the united states but has since been adapted to environments in other parts of the world soil conservation service 1964 1972 it combines the land use thereby depicting the surface cover of the drainage basin and couples this with hydrological soil groups that depict the infiltration rate during overland flow the curve number method uses soil data classified according to the usda nomenclature we therefore used maps of the usda texture classes fig 7a next we reclassified the corine land cover data into simplified agricultural forest residential and water classes from the nomenclature used in corine data table 1 as seen in fig 7b we then finally calculated a curve number raster using hec geohms a hydrology tool used within arcgis hec geohms includes a generate cn grid tool that inputs a dem a combination of soil and land use and a lookup table the output is a curve number raster fig 7c a global study by jaafar et al 2019 revealed that curve number thresholds of 62 78 and 90 represent conditions of dry average and wet in a runoff event it also found that curve numbers in the 75 85 range represent a medium to high runoff potential using this as a guide we thresholded our curve numbers as 30 62 62 74 and 75 100 taking the upper band as high overland flow potential we classified all streams passing through river valleys with these curve numbers as q1 q2 fig 7d 2 s 100 cn 10 3 i a 0 2 s where s potential maximum retention after runoff begins cn scs curve number i a initial abstraction or the quantity of water available before discharge such as infiltration or rainfall interception by vegetation we then classified the direct class q3 we used a baseflow raster layer also extracted from the dk model for this purpose we first interpolated baseflow within the stream sections using 3d analyst s add surface information tool the operation extracts the baseflow for each stream section we apply a simple classification to determine which stream sections have a baseflow of less than zero zero or greater than zero fig 8a sections with baseflow greater than zero sustain baseflow meaning the stream stretch receive discharging groundwater throughout the year negative baseflow numbers indicate that stream water is lost through the stream bed to the groundwater aquifer baseflow equals zero at stretches of the river network where no exchange of groundwater and surface water occurs we subsequently classify these stream sections as direct flow paths q3 fig 8b we then move on to classify the flow path drainage q4 we use the probability of artificially drainage raster layer for this purpose based on the probability we defined two classes møller et al 2018 drained areas 50 probability and undrained areas 50 probability fig 9a we therefore use a threshold of 50 to classify stream sections with a dominating riparian flow path artificial drainage as q4 fig 9b 4 results and discussion 4 1 groundwater surface water contact map of denmark we ran our model and classified the gsi contact for denmark s streams fig 10 shows the classification for the gudenå catchment which is the largest catchment in denmark the map shows the three classes connected clayey connected sandy and disconnected 3 m depth to phreatic surface for the stream polyline feature the class no data indicates stream sections with missing data this occurs when either the subsoil or data were missing at that particular stream stretch common areas that this occurs mainly include lakes the map also presents the subsoil classification into clayey and sandy areas table 2 presents a summary of the gsi contact classification for all streams in denmark it reveals that about 85 of the combined length of danish streams are connected to the groundwater with an almost equal distribution of clayey 44 and sandy 41 subsoils this emphasizes that most danish streams are groundwater fed a look at the gudenå catchment gsi contact distribution fig 10 reveals that most of the connected stream stretches lie in the main stream flow path downstream of branches while the disconnected stream stretches are further upstream of the branches we expected this since the upstream stretches lie higher in elevation where groundwater depths are likely to be more significant than the main flow line leading downstream 4 2 flow path classification map of denmark we also present the classified flow path within riparian areas to streams with the gudenå drainage basin fig 11 we color code all stream sections with the three classifications i e diffuse and or overland q1 2 direct q3 and drainage q4 and sections that have combinations of these flow paths results reveal that most of the main stream flow path is fed by direct flow paths q3 like with the gsi contact classification the main stream path is usually located in the lowest part of the terrain and is the most probable candidate for a direct exchange with the groundwater our study reveals that 43 of all danish stream sections are fed by direct flow paths alone table 3 if sections with combined flow paths are included 87 of stream stretches have direct flow paths i e 43 for q3 alone 9 27 and 8 for the combinations q1 2 q3 q3 q4 q1 2 q3 q4 respectively we expected this since most danish lowland areas have a very shallow water table and streams are mostly groundwater fed jørgensen and stockmarr 2009 stream stretches fed by drainage alone account for about 5 of streams in denmark and 41 of all stream stretches have contributions at least partly from artificial drainage table 3 we attribute this to the fact that about half of denmark s agricultural land is artificially drained møller et al 2018 olesen 2009 there are very few areas with diffuse and or overland riparian flow paths q1 2 alone 1 but these flow paths are present in 19 of stream sections when sections with combined flow paths are accounted for table 3 about 60 of denmark is agricultural land statistics denmark 2021 unlike artificial areas such as pavements agricultural areas have a lower runoff potential leading to a lower contribution than the direct flow class cronshey 1986 in order to get an impression of how precisely the new model predicts the distribution of flow paths we can take a look at how detailed field experiments can characterize flow paths several pilot field studies have focused on characterizing flow paths and determining the relative proportions of fluxes along the flow paths in the riparian stream system it has been possible to measure these fluxes in a few danish stream cases and establish a water balance for skjern stream andersen 2004 haller stream langhoff et al 2006 holtum stream steiness et al 2019 and fensholt stream petersen et al 2020 in most cases however flow paths were indirectly identified and quantified by modeling at voldby creek hoffmann et al 2006 kidmose et al 2010 lindenborg stream johansen et al 2011 holtum stream jensen and engesgaard 2011 karan et al 2013 and odense stream kolbjørn jensen et al 2017 these studies indicate that direct seepage through the stream bed can be almost negligible to almost 100 going from a clay to a sandy geological setting man made structures such as drains cutoff drains at the hillslope and ditches frederiksen et al 2018 hoffmann et al 2012 petersen et al 2020 steiness et al 2019 and abandoned irrigation canals langhoff et al 2006 have been shown to be other important transport pathways direct seepage through the streambed can be very heterogeneous due to high spatial variability in hydraulic conductivity and gradients has been shown in holtum stream karan et al 2014 poulsen et al 2015 sebok et al 2015 risby stream milosevic et al 2012 and grindsted stream cremeans et al 2018 in other words there are numerous examples of danish field studies that have identified and quantified three of the four flow paths proposed in the gsi typology direct flow overland flow and drainage flow the diffusive flow path is the only one where no field studies that have been conducted this does not mean that it does not exist in nature but it means that when the classification mapping routine presented here only identifies up to 1 of the watercourse sections dominated by diffusive flow along with overland flow it is in accordance with the obtained field results there are some limitations to this method however an example is that about 7 of the results fall under the no data class table 3 the reason for this is that there is missing data within some layers this is specifically true for the artificial drainage maps fig 4d the missing data leads to an incomplete picture of the analysis and could be an area of improvement in future mapping campaigns another limitation is the spatial resolution of some of the maps the dk model maps are currently only available at a spatial resolution of 500 m which is relatively coarse for analyses like these the geological model that makes up the danish groundwater model is constructed as a multi layered model set up in 500 m grids as well for each geological layer the horizontal uncertainty was estimated to be 500 m and the vertical to be 3 m troldborg et al 2014 therefore the uncertainty of the classification is 500 m on the horizontal scale and 3 m vertically the vertical uncertainty is least in flat landscapes with minimal river valley topography and river valleys with larger topography 3 m will have larger vertical uncertainty care should therefore be taken when interpreting the results furthermore it is challenging to isolate contributions from individual flow paths in areas with multiple flow paths therefore our study should serve as a screening tool for localized detailed studies that have the capacity for collecting measurements 4 3 novelty of the work typologies and conceptual classification systems for upland hydrological connectivity and deep shallow or bypassing flow paths have been proposed to characterize groundwater stream interaction and potential n removal in riparian lowlands dahl et al 2007 hill 1996 jencso et al 2009 noij et al 2012 vidon and hill 2004 the gsi typology in denmark by dahl et al 2007 was based on older classification systems for danish watercourses that did not take geology geomorphology and groundwater into account hasholt 1999 mernild and hasholt 2003 as the mapping routine described in this paper largely follows the gsi typology it includes a link between geomorphology and groundwater no previous studies have used geospatial data at the national level and the work provides information on gsi for much larger areas than previously seen 4 4 perspectives the proposed classification mapping routine is justified only by danish field studies but we expect that the developed gis tools can be utilized in geologic and geomorphologic regions with glacial deposits similar to the danish setting anywhere in the world another critical precondition is that good geospatial data must exist at the national level or in large regions unfortunately sparse datasets do not provide the information required for classifying the gsi contact and flow paths due to the arbitrary scales proposed by the underlying gsi typology i e a river reach scale of 1 5 km and a local scale 10 1000 m respectively dahl et al 2007 therefore increasing the sparsity of data only increases the uncertainty of the resulting maps 5 conclusions according to an established typology by dahl et al 2007 we created a model to map and classify the groundwater surface water gsi contact and mapped riparian flow paths to streams it is an essential first step towards understanding the spatial distribution of gsi in denmark we use arcgis s modelbuilder to create a model workflow for classifying the gsi contact we then use varying gis techniques to classify stream sections into different flow paths that water takes as it transports the riparian area the gsi contact classification revealed that most danish streams are in contact with groundwater and most of these are located in the main stream flow path leading to the downstream of a catchment riparian flow path classifications revealed that the most common flow path is direct groundwater exchange with the stream and artificial drainage diffuse and or overland flow paths within riparian areas were not significant when they appeared in stream sections alone but could be part of combined flow paths in a riparian catchment this is a cause for concern since drainage flow paths transmit water directly to the stream without the potential for n removal through the riparian area many field and modeling studies have identified flow paths in nature but this is the first time a national spatial mapping has been conducted we expect that the generated maps will aid policy support as a screening decision support tool in managing water and contaminant transport from the uplands to streams to achieve a good environmental status of surface and groundwater bodies funding this work was funded by the graduate school of technical sciences aarhus university credit

8023,study region the upper brahmaputra river china study focus the long term water level and storage variations of the upper brahmaputra river ubr are not yet clear due to the low accessibility of gauged data in high altitude and harsh environments the main objective of this study is to facilitate investigations of long term river water level and storage variations over the ubr here we developed a hypsometric method to reconstruct temporally resolved long term river water level observations based on remote sensing derived accumulative water inundation area information and short term altimetric water level data at 24 virtual stations vss of the ubr we further analyzed the intra annual and inter annual variations of the water level storage changes of the studied river reaches new hydrological insights the results reveal that the reconstructed water levels of the ubr are quite consistent with the water levels from the hydroweb with an average r2 of 0 79 and the reconstructed water levels are generally consistent with the variation of the gauged runoff the ascending amplitudes of the annual water level cycle of vss were observed from upstream to downstream of the ubr varying from 0 58 m to 6 92 m additionally we find that the seasonal change in river water storage approximately accounted for one tenth of the net mass seasonal amplitude of the ubr basin as revealed from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data keywords river water level storage variations the upper brahmaputra river satellite altimetry tibetan plateau 1 introduction with the increasing demand for water resources there are growing concerns about monitoring hydrologic and morphodynamic change characteristics of rivers huang et al 2018a this is also of vital significance to understand hydrologic processes under the scenario of climate change asadzadeh jarihani et al 2013 chen et al 2021 zhu et al 2020 traditionally the water level is monitored by gauging stations along river reaches and estuary mouth which is a critical variable for assessing local water variability however in situ water level observations are mostly unavailable in remote areas with logistical difficulties of accessibility or because of the political reasons on transboundary rivers calmant and seyler 2006 yuan et al 2017 a typical example is the tibetan plateau tp the source region of many major transboundary rivers of asia e g the brahmaputra river the salween which remains poorly gauged without open data sharing policies this leads to a very limited understanding of water level variations in the upper reaches of the rivers both on inter annual and inter annual time scales satellite remote sensing has offered an unprecedented way of obtaining freely accessible water level information particularly in remote and unpopulated regions sulistioadi et al 2015 sun et al 2012 satellite altimetry was initially developed to obtain ocean to satellite altitudes by radar instruments including those on envisat and jason in recent years with the increasing demand for continental surface water monitoring the altimetry data have been explored to detect variations of inland water bodies van dijk et al 2016 using t p satellite data birkett 1998 successfully extracted the water level of global rivers with a width of more than 1 km and the root mean square error rmse could be accurate to 0 11 m frappart et al 2006 reported that the envisat satellite exhibits a strong capability for estimating water levels of large rivers in the amazon basin with an rmse of 0 30 m in the amazon basin santos da silva et al 2010 also found river water level observations from the envisat and ers 2 reached an accuracy of 0 40 m many other studies also demonstrated that water level data from more recently launched satellites such as cryosat 2 and sentinel 3 can reach the accuracy on a few tens of centimeters and are successfully applied for monitoring rivers and lakes cheng et al 2010 paris et al 2016b song et al 2015 tourian et al 2016 at present the number of altimetric observations from different satellite missions has increased considerably the hydroweb database crétaux and birkett 2006 produced by the laboratoire d etudes en géophysique et océanographie spatiales legos provides free accessibility to the most comprehensive water level database of rivers and lakes by compiling multi sensor satellite observations however these observations are highly variable in spatial and temporal coverage and resolution limiting their applications in regional inland water monitoring and modeling for example observations from recent satellite altimeters such as sentinel 3 and icesat 2 show higher spatial coverage and finer footprint but longer revisit time interval over 30 days and shorter temporal coverage since 2016 2018 compared to the jason missions repeated observations at 10 days since 2002 thus extending and densifying the water level time series from recent satellite altimetry missions is necessary for investigating the long term changes of rivers a feasible way of achieving this is to explore the long term optical images from satellites sensors such as landsat that record earth surface conditions dated back to the early 1970 s the archived optical imagery has been successfully applied to monitor long term evolutions of inundation area mostly focusing on lakes and reservoirs for example zhang et al 2017 and song et al 2013 used the hypsometric method to derive time series of water levels based on water inundation areas retrieved from

most significant and sensitive regions of global climate change impacts immerzeel et al 2010 song et al 2013 yao et al 2012 zhan et al 2020 zhang et al 2011 it is the birthplace of many large rivers brahmaputra river salween river mekong river yangtze river and indus river the studied river reach the ubr is the main upstream reach of the yarlung zangbo river fig 1 the ubr with a total length of about 2050 km is not only one of the highest rivers in the world but also belongs to one of the most important international rivers villadsen et al 2015a the mainstream traverses the southern part of the tp with a drainage area of 242 000 km2 the terrain of the ubr descends from west to east the region is characterized by complex hydrological processes such as melting of snow and ice diverse river characteristics braided reach width ranging from less than 100 m upstream to more than 1 km downstream over a mean altitude of over 3000 m a s l papa et al 2015 the climatic conditions of the ubr basin are mainly dominated by the geographical location and topographic characteristics of the plateau the precipitation in the western part of the basin is low with an average annual precipitation of less than 100 mm while that in the eastern part is plentiful with an average annual precipitation of more than 900 mm the precipitation in the whole basin shows an overall ascending trend from west to east kebede et al 2020 wang et al 2021 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 glad for extracting monthly river area of the ubr during 2000 2020 in this study we investigated the intra annual and inter annual surface water dynamics of the ubr over the past 20 years using the global land analysis and discovery glad data the glad data available at https www glad umd edu dataset global surface water dynamics was created by pickens et al 2020 based on landsat 5 7 and 8 imagery with a spatial resolution of 30 m in the dataset per pixel in every image was classified into the land water cloud shadow haze snow and ice and water using a classification tree model potapov et al 2015 2 2 2 river water level data from satellite altimetry and gauging stations hydroweb http hydroweb theia land fr a data center crétaux et al 2011 established by the laboratoire d etudes en géophysique et océanographie spatiales legos provides time series of water levels in large rivers lakes reservoirs and wetlands worldwide which is generated by merging multi mission satellite altimetric observations crétaux et al 2008 introduced a comprehensive processing method to minimize the potential deviation of radar instruments among different satellites which can enhance the accuracy and spatial coverage of water level data observed from multiple satellites up to early november 2020 the number of river virtual stations vss provided by hydroweb has increased significantly from 1733 to 11 336 there is a total of 35 virtual stations vss along the mainstream of ubr in this study to robustly reconstruct the water levels of the ubr since 2000 we excluded a few vss only with altimetry measurements spanning a few months or in extremely adjacent distance we eventually obtained time series of water level data at 24 vss on the studied river channels from the hydroweb database including jason 2 3 and sentinel 3a data table 1 we reprocessed the temporally uneven sampled water level data to monthly averages by averaging multiple observations in each month besides we collected the monthly records of river water discharge data covering the period 2000 2010 at lazi 29 12 n 87 58 e yangcun 29 32 n 89 71 e and nuxia 29 46 n 94 65 e gauging stations for the ubr 2000 2010 and the monthly records of water level at the shentan gauging station in the yellow river basin 2016 2018 from the hydrologic data yearbook materials these gauged data were used for cross evaluating the reconstructed water level by our proposed approach 2 2 3 other auxiliary data 2 2 3 1 sentinel 2 optical images sentinel 2 satellite was launched by the european space agency caesar et al 2015 which provides a valuable means to monitor the dynamic changes of surface water more accurately sentinel 2 satellite carries a multi spectral instrument msi with the blue green red nir bands at a high spatial resolution of 10 m divided into 2 a and 2b satellites which were launched on june 23 2015 and march 7 2017 respectively binary satellite observations complement each other and the revisit period for land monitoring is about five days in this research we used the sentinel 2 multi spectral imagery to retrieve the higher precision river water area results for cross evaluating the ubr water inundation area reconstructed from the glad data 2 2 3 2 grace and grace fo gravimetry data the grace satellites were launched in march 2002 and terminated in june 2017 it can be used to map the temporal variation of the earth s global gravity field with a spatial resolution of 400 km grace fo was successfully launched in may 2018 to continue the scientific observation mission of grace gravity satellites the time varying gravity signals observed in the grace data may come from the changes in mass redistribution e g terrestrial water mass variations therefore the time series of the gravity field can reflect the comprehensive changes of various forms in tws e g groundwater soil moisture and permafrost surface water ice and snow and biomass grace data are available from three institutions geo forschungs zentrum potsdam gfz center for space research at university of texas austin csr and jet propulsion laboratory jpl each using disparate methods and parameters to produce the monthly grace dataset the current solutions for data processing are the release 06 gravity field solutions rl06 in this study we averaged the three sources of spherical harmonic solutions to minimize the uncertainties associated with data processing to better compare the relationship between the river water storage variations and tws changes the equivalent water thickness averaged sh cm was converted into mass change grace shc gt by using the same equal area projection as we note a few occurrences of missing data in the dataset we linearly interpolated the data gaps based on the data of adjacent months and excluded the year 2018 records in the final time series 2003 2020 3 methods 3 1 reconstructing time series of water inundation areas of the ubr glad provides high accuracy long temporal coverage and continuous maps of global surface water and its monthly water history mwh data includes the monthly composite result of water body extractions from all available landsat images acquired from 2000 to 2020 however due to remote sensing sensor failures e g the failure of landsat 7 slc image collection strategies e g landsat 5 without satellite based recording equipment and long term commercial operation and observation conditions e g cloud occlusion the results of river extraction are incomplete in some months in the mwh data ju and roy 2008 these incomplete areas would seriously affect the integrity and continuity of the river water level results reconstructed based on the raw water area data thus these obviously incomplete river areas must be checked visually and quality controlled by manual editing after the automated extraction from the glad mwh data in this study we consider a straightforward method li et al 2021 by using river boundary water frequency wf threshold segmentation to supplement the incomplete river water area in this method the wf map of the ubr was first calculated using the glad surface water cover during the whole study period the wf was equal to the number of times a pixel was classified as a water body divided by the length of the mapped water series which can be calculated by using the following formula 1 wf wdc voc where wdc water detection count represents the number of the water body pixels located in the corresponding time and voc valid observation count represents the number of effective observations of the pixel in the corresponding time river beds with the lower elevation are earlier inundated thus with higher inundation frequency fassoni andrade et al 2020 changes in water frequency from the river center to the riverbank can be represented by the wf duration curve which is defined as the wf cumulative probability in decreasing order as shown in fig 2 the water body with a higher frequency is presented in darker blue and that with a lower frequency is shown in lighter blue pixels are classified as water only when their wfs are equal to or greater than the river boundary wf according to the spatial dependence principle anselin and getis 1992 adjacent pixels are more related to each other with gradually varying wf so the variation in the main river channel can be synthesized by the wf in each pixel of the ubr the incomplete river region was repaired by determining the water boundary inundation frequency of the remaining river areas more specifically the incomplete pixels were supplemented by determining the wf values greater than or equal to the minimum water frequency of the river boundary in the current month finally the complete ubr water area was reconstructed with the help of the wf map errors in water cover classification using the wf map segmentation might result in an overestimation of small water bodies that were wrongly extracted hence we determined the 5 percentile segmentation in the histogram of the incomplete water frequency raster image to reduce the mapping noise influence the implementation of the river boundary wf threshold segmentation has an essential prerequisite which requires that the remaining wf map includes the river boundary pixels thus we made a careful month by month inspection on all of the reconstructed river inundation areas and manually edited the seriously incomplete segments by referring to the temporally adjacent inundation areas 3 2 reconstructing monthly river water level records during 2000 2020 based on the complete monthly river extents between 2000 and 2020 the hypsometric curves the relationship between inundation area and water level at each of the near vs river reach can be established as reported in a previous study alsdorf 2003 the accuracy of the estimated water level based on the hypsometric curve method decreases with respect to the increasing lengths of corresponding river reach when exceeding a certain optimized length threshold through a series of tests in the study area the river area extents at the 5 km length segment around the vss are relatively optimal for establishing the hypsometric curves based on the monthly mean water level and area data for each 5 km river segment around the vss in the near synchronous time window the river hypsometry curves were constructed for all the vss see table 2 then we used the hypsometric curves in combination with the time series of monthly mean river area to reconstruct long term continues time series of monthly water level estimates for the period of 2000 2020 at the 24 vss in order to evaluate the reconstructed river water levels we compared the time series of water level with the hydroweb based water level data for six vss that have relatively longer period of altimetry measurements besides the two years 2019 and 2020 in section 4 1 and with the gauge based discharge data for three vss near the hydrological stations lazi yangcun and nuxia in section 5 3 3 reconstructing time series of river water storage variations during 2000 2020 due to the high elevation and narrow river widths of the ubr the water level and storage changes in different reaches vary significantly based on the locations of the 24 vss in the ubr the river was totally divided into 24 reaches with high fitting relationships between the water level and the area combined with the river hydraulic characteristics such as river width the slope of the water surface and shape frasson et al 2019 by using the time series of area and water level changes corresponding to vss we employed the pyramid truncated and pyramidal product estimation method to further estimate the change of water storage in each reach luo et al 2019 we simplified the channel section to the common trapezoid abileah et al 2011 in this study the river water storage in january 2000 was used as the baseline and the time series of storage change in the following months till december 2020 was calculated by comparing with this baseline on the basis of the above mentioned procedure the river storage changes in the ubr can be estimated using the following formula yao et al 2018 2 v 1 3 h 2 h 1 a 1 a 2 a 1 a 2 where v is the river water storage variation from elevation h 1 and area a 1 to elevation h 2 and area a 2 finally we sum up the water storage changes of each river reach to obtain the whole ubr storage change 4 results and analyses 4 1 cross evaluation of the reconstructed inundation area and water level of the ubr in order to evaluate the accuracy of the reconstructed river water inundation area the river areas were mapped by visual interpretation from the higher resolution sentinel 2 imagery monthly composite data for march july and october 2019 as the evaluation reference data fig 3 shows the reconstructed ubr water area with the river boundary frequency threshold segmentation method kappa coefficient producer accuracy pa user accuracy ua and overall accuracy oa parameters were used to quantitatively evaluate the results as shown in table 3 the pa and ua of water classification in drought and flood seasons were above 82 and the kappa coefficients of the three results were above 84 it suggests that the reconstructed river water inundation areas can be used for constructing the hypsometric curves with acceptable accuracy statistics about the hypsometric curves of the relationship between river water level and area at the 24 virtual stations are show in table 2 there is a high correlation between the inundation area and near synchronous water level for all the 24 vss cases with an average r2 of 0 84 it indicates that the hypsometric curve can provide a robust reconstruction of long time series of water levels for these vss in the ubr in the absence of gauged water level data in the study area we cross evaluated the reconstructed river water levels based on the hydroweb data at six vss vs10 vs14 vs16 vs20 vs23 and vs24 with relatively longer water level measurements the six vss reaches include straight and braided rivers with different widths as shown in fig 4 two metrics namely the correlation coefficients and rmse of calibration were used to evaluate the performance of reconstructed levels in this study beeton 2002 chai and draxler 2014 the r2 values at the six vss ranges from 0 68 to 0 91 and the mean rmse values are approximately 0 79 m our reconstruction results at four virtual stations vs10 vs16 vs23 and vs24 are highly consistent with that of the hydroweb data whereas at vs16 and vs23 large bias could exist in parts of the time series for example the two water level time series at vs16 displayed large disparities with the largest bias of 0 98 m in october 2018 a similar phenomenon was observed at vs23 with the largest bias of 3 30 m in january 2017 such significant biases may be associated with the complex geomorphologic and geometric features of the river reaches which induce larger uncertainties in river area mapping and satellite altimetry measurements particularly the vs16 and vs23 are braided reaches with wide and shallow water bodies located in a mountainous region with extremely steep terrains overall the reconstructed water levels are of good quality for most vss over the entire stretch of ubr while uncertainties can be large for narrow river reaches coupled with complex braided rivers 4 2 analysis of spatio temporal variation characteristics of river inundation areas our reconstructed complete monthly time series of the ubr water inundation area facilitates the analysis of the long term changes over the years 2000 2020 as shown in fig 5 overall the interannual water area changes displayed a first decreasing then increasing and final decreasing patterns the minimum annual water area was 563 44 km2 observed in 2009 and the maximum was 848 77 km2 observed in 2018 the river water areas showed evident seasonal variations the magnitude of which were diverse in different reaches of the ubr the annual averages of upstream midstream and downstream areas were about 170 89 km2 436 07 km2 and 73 68 km2 respectively in the flood season june to august the multi year averages of upstream midstream and downstream areas are about 240 85 km2 646 79 km2 and 93 52 km2 while in the dry season december to february next year the multi year averaged water area are 121 95 km2 288 84 km2 and 58 16 km2 respectively 4 3 analysis of the long time series of reconstructed river water levels fig 6 presents the time series of the reconstructed water levels for 24 vss in the ubr from 2000 to 2020 the results show that the river water levels peak in july or august the water level began to decline significantly in september accelerated downward from october through december and reached the minimum around january the water levels for the 24 vss in the ubr have a well defined seasonal cycle driven primarily by snowmelt since the late spring and high rainfalls in summer these seasonal level changes for different river reaches have amplitudes from 2 m to as much as 10 m each year in both the wet and dry seasons the magnitudes of water level fluctuations in the ubr have changed considerably since 2000 overall the seasonal amplitudes of water level for the 24 vss increased from upstream to downstream varying from 0 58 m to 6 92 m the ubr midstream has the most severe wind and sand disasters garzanti et al 2010 thus the widely distributed river island broad floodplains and flowing sand dunes may partially contribute to the relatively insignificant water level rise amplitudes for a few reaches in the midstream the water level changes are also probably affected by the convergence of the tributary discharge for example the influences on v14 and v15 from the lhasa river besides with the growing population and increasing anthropogenic activities the human water use may affect the water level fluctuations and variability 4 4 analysis of the time series of river water storage variation fig 7 a shows the grace derived interannual and intra annual tws changes in the brahmaputra basin in phase with the ubr water storage the monthly tws in the brahmaputra basin showed significant seasonal fluctuations with relatively higher level in summer and autumn the seasonal variation of the ubr river channel water storage was further compared with the annual amplitude of the grace derived basin wide tws to analyze the river contribution proportion fig 7 b shows the difference between these two seasonal cycles results suggest that the ubr has a contribution of approximately 9 43 to the basin wide tws changes in terms of inter annual changes the tws showed a significant downward trend during the past two decades in comparison the water storage in the river presents a slightly rising trend with obviously seasonal fluctuations the maximum and minimum water storage were observed in august 2016 and january 2002 respectively the grace based decreasing signal of tws changes could be mainly contributed by the substantial mass loss due to glacier melting brun et al 2017 shean et al 2020 5 discussion on the uncertainty and applicability of the long term river water level reconstruction due to the logistical difficulties of in situ surveying in the ubr there are only a few gauging stations distributed in the midstream and downstream of the ubr we collected the monthly discharge data of three stations the variations of river water level and discharge are usually considered to be temporally synchronized as reported in previous studies fischer et al 2017 frappart et al 2015 mohammed et al 2017 therefore we compared the reconstructed water levels of vs9 vs16 and vs23 with the runoff observations at nearby gauging stations lazi yangcun and nuxia as shown in fig 8 the results show that the intra annual and inter annual variations of reconstructed water levels generally agree with discharge observations at nearby gauging stations however the level of consistency between the reconstructed water level and gauged discharge data varies among the three vss higher consistency is observed at vs9 vs lazi with the correlation coefficient of 0 66 and vs16 vs yangcun 0 71 than that of vs23 vs nuxia 0 62 by referring to the river hydrographic and morphologic characteristics of the three stations the complex braided river channel and the mainstream convergence with the nyang qu one of the five primary tributaries of the ubr discharges could partially contribute to the poor performance of the vs23 result besides the satellite altimetry measurement uncertainties and the inherent discrepancy between water level and discharge estimates may also affect the evaluation result in order to demonstrate the applicability of our proposed approach in other poorly gauged river basins we extracted the monthly time series of river inundation area and established the hypsometric curve for the period january 2019 to december 2020 for reconstructing the monthly water levels 2016 2018 for one river reach with a gauging station the shentan station in the upper yellow river as shown in fig 9 both the reconstructed and hydroweb based river water level time series keep in good agreement in depicting the interannual fluctuations with the gauge based data for example the three time series consistently indicate the relatively low levels in 2016 and 2017 and the higher level in 2018 in comparison the reconstructed water level even has higher consistency with the gauge observations than the hydroweb data with a correlation coefficient of about 0 85 the reason probably lies in that our statistical reconstruction method based on the hypsometric curve can avoid the noise of direct altimetry measurements caused by the observational conditions or data processing algorithms e g altimetry waveform retracking overall our proposed method shows high potential in extending current river water level observations in the ungauged or poorly gauged rivers in remote areas 6 conclusions in this study we reconstructed the long term water area and level estimates of a poorly gauged river in the tp by a simple remote sensing based method the approach firstly derived river inundation area in the ubr between 2000 and 2020 then filled the missing part of water extent using the percentile cut method of water frequency histogram at river boundary subsequently by combining the satellite based water level observations at virtual stations the hypsometric curves on the area level relationship were established to extend the river water level series of the vss in the ubr results showed that the reconstructed water levels of vss in the ubr are in good agreement with the hydroweb water level changes with an average r2 of 0 79 the reconstructed water levels near the lazi yangcun and nuxia gauging stations were also cross evaluated in good agreement with the gauged discharge data furthermore the joint utilization of reconstructed water level and inundation area information to determine river water storage variations offers useful information about river hydrologic dynamics the changes in river water storage approximately account for one tenth of the net terrestrial water storage of the basin in conclusion the joint use of multi source remote sensing data will facilitate more densely and meticulous detection of long term river hydrologic changes in time and space the catchment scale monitoring of river water level and storage results provide scientific and technological bases in data scarce areas especially and are likely to benefit other ungauged or poorly gauged rivers in the tp and surrounding mountains credit

8023,study region the upper brahmaputra river china study focus the long term water level and storage variations of the upper brahmaputra river ubr are not yet clear due to the low accessibility of gauged data in high altitude and harsh environments the main objective of this study is to facilitate investigations of long term river water level and storage variations over the ubr here we developed a hypsometric method to reconstruct temporally resolved long term river water level observations based on remote sensing derived accumulative water inundation area information and short term altimetric water level data at 24 virtual stations vss of the ubr we further analyzed the intra annual and inter annual variations of the water level storage changes of the studied river reaches new hydrological insights the results reveal that the reconstructed water levels of the ubr are quite consistent with the water levels from the hydroweb with an average r2 of 0 79 and the reconstructed water levels are generally consistent with the variation of the gauged runoff the ascending amplitudes of the annual water level cycle of vss were observed from upstream to downstream of the ubr varying from 0 58 m to 6 92 m additionally we find that the seasonal change in river water storage approximately accounted for one tenth of the net mass seasonal amplitude of the ubr basin as revealed from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data keywords river water level storage variations the upper brahmaputra river satellite altimetry tibetan plateau 1 introduction with the increasing demand for water resources there are growing concerns about monitoring hydrologic and morphodynamic change characteristics of rivers huang et al 2018a this is also of vital significance to understand hydrologic processes under the scenario of climate change asadzadeh jarihani et al 2013 chen et al 2021 zhu et al 2020 traditionally the water level is monitored by gauging stations along river reaches and estuary mouth which is a critical variable for assessing local water variability however in situ water level observations are mostly unavailable in remote areas with logistical difficulties of accessibility or because of the political reasons on transboundary rivers calmant and seyler 2006 yuan et al 2017 a typical example is the tibetan plateau tp the source region of many major transboundary rivers of asia e g the brahmaputra river the salween which remains poorly gauged without open data sharing policies this leads to a very limited understanding of water level variations in the upper reaches of the rivers both on inter annual and inter annual time scales satellite remote sensing has offered an unprecedented way of obtaining freely accessible water level information particularly in remote and unpopulated regions sulistioadi et al 2015 sun et al 2012 satellite altimetry was initially developed to obtain ocean to satellite altitudes by radar instruments including those on envisat and jason in recent years with the increasing demand for continental surface water monitoring the altimetry data have been explored to detect variations of inland water bodies van dijk et al 2016 using t p satellite data birkett 1998 successfully extracted the water level of global rivers with a width of more than 1 km and the root mean square error rmse could be accurate to 0 11 m frappart et al 2006 reported that the envisat satellite exhibits a strong capability for estimating water levels of large rivers in the amazon basin with an rmse of 0 30 m in the amazon basin santos da silva et al 2010 also found river water level observations from the envisat and ers 2 reached an accuracy of 0 40 m many other studies also demonstrated that water level data from more recently launched satellites such as cryosat 2 and sentinel 3 can reach the accuracy on a few tens of centimeters and are successfully applied for monitoring rivers and lakes cheng et al 2010 paris et al 2016b song et al 2015 tourian et al 2016 at present the number of altimetric observations from different satellite missions has increased considerably the hydroweb database crétaux and birkett 2006 produced by the laboratoire d etudes en géophysique et océanographie spatiales legos provides free accessibility to the most comprehensive water level database of rivers and lakes by compiling multi sensor satellite observations however these observations are highly variable in spatial and temporal coverage and resolution limiting their applications in regional inland water monitoring and modeling for example observations from recent satellite altimeters such as sentinel 3 and icesat 2 show higher spatial coverage and finer footprint but longer revisit time interval over 30 days and shorter temporal coverage since 2016 2018 compared to the jason missions repeated observations at 10 days since 2002 thus extending and densifying the water level time series from recent satellite altimetry missions is necessary for investigating the long term changes of rivers a feasible way of achieving this is to explore the long term optical images from satellites sensors such as landsat that record earth surface conditions dated back to the early 1970 s the archived optical imagery has been successfully applied to monitor long term evolutions of inundation area mostly focusing on lakes and reservoirs for example zhang et al 2017 and song et al 2013 used the hypsometric method to derive time series of water levels based on water inundation areas retrieved from landsat archives for the lakes in the tibetan plateau tp li et al 2019 developed an optical water level extraction method which served as an ideal reference for merging multi source satellite optical and altimetry observations and generated a dense and continuous data set of lake water level changes of the tp for the brahmaputra river in the tp many earlier efforts huang et al 2018b papa et al 2010 villadsen et al 2015b have been paid to derive water levels or discharges using different altimetry missions e g ers 2 envisat saral altika cryosat 2 jason 2 3 and sentinel 3a these studies mainly generated short term water level or discharge information of several reaches of the brahmaputra river yet while a full picture about the brahmaputra river with complicated topography and morphodynamic characteristics of cramped river widths is still unclear the main goals of the present study are therefore designed 1 to reconstruct the long term time series of water level changes of the upper brahmaputra river ubr in the past 20 years and 2 to further estimate water storage variations of the ubr with a comparative analysis with the terrestrial water storage tws change derived from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 introduces the study area and data used for the river morphodynamic

hydrological characteristics of the poorly gauged river in response to climate change and variability in the tp 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the tp known as asian water tower is one of the

less than 100 mm while that in the eastern part is plentiful with an average annual precipitation of more than 900 mm the precipitation in the whole basin shows an overall ascending trend from west to

water dynamics of the ubr over the past 20 years using the global land analysis and discovery glad data the glad data available at https www glad umd edu dataset global surface water dynamics was created by pickens et al 2020 based on landsat 5 7 and 8 imagery with a spatial resolution of 30 m in the dataset per pixel in every image was classified into the land water cloud shadow haze snow and ice and water using a classification tree model potapov et al 2015 2 2 2 river water level data from satellite altimetry and gauging stations hydroweb http hydroweb theia land fr a data center crétaux et al 2011 established by the laboratoire d etudes en géophysique et océanographie spatiales legos provides time series of water levels in large rivers lakes reservoirs and wetlands worldwide which is generated by merging multi mission satellite altimetric observations crétaux et al 2008 introduced a comprehensive processing method to minimize the potential deviation of radar instruments among different satellites which can enhance the accuracy and spatial coverage of water level data observed from multiple satellites up to early november 2020 the number of river virtual stations vss provided by hydroweb has increased significantly from 1733 to 11 336 there is a total of 35 virtual stations vss along the mainstream of ubr in this study to robustly reconstruct the water levels of the ubr since 2000 we excluded a few vss only with altimetry measurements spanning a few months or in extremely adjacent distance we eventually obtained time series of water level data at 24 vss on the studied river channels from the hydroweb database including jason 2 3 and sentinel 3a data table 1 we reprocessed the temporally uneven sampled water level data to monthly averages by averaging multiple observations in each month besides we collected the monthly records of river water discharge data covering the period 2000 2010 at lazi 29 12 n 87 58 e yangcun 29 32 n 89 71 e and nuxia 29 46 n 94 65 e gauging stations for the ubr 2000 2010 and the monthly records of water level at the shentan gauging station in the yellow river basin 2016 2018 from the hydrologic data yearbook materials these gauged data were used for cross evaluating the reconstructed water level by our proposed approach 2 2 3 other auxiliary data 2 2 3 1 sentinel 2 optical images sentinel 2 satellite was launched by the european space agency caesar et al 2015 which provides a valuable means to monitor the dynamic changes of surface water more accurately sentinel 2 satellite carries a multi spectral instrument msi with the blue green red nir bands at a high spatial resolution of 10 m divided into 2 a and 2b satellites which were launched on june 23 2015 and march 7 2017 respectively binary satellite observations complement each other and the revisit period for land monitoring is about five days in this research we used the sentinel 2 multi spectral imagery to retrieve the higher precision river water area results for cross evaluating the ubr water inundation area reconstructed from the glad data 2 2 3 2 grace and grace fo gravimetry data the grace satellites were launched in march 2002 and terminated in june 2017 it can be used to map the temporal variation of the earth s global gravity field with a spatial resolution of 400 km grace fo was successfully launched in may 2018 to continue the scientific observation mission of grace gravity satellites the time varying gravity signals observed in the grace data may come from the changes in mass redistribution e g terrestrial water mass variations therefore the time series of the gravity field can reflect the comprehensive changes of various forms in tws e g groundwater soil moisture and permafrost surface water ice and snow and biomass grace data are available from three institutions geo forschungs zentrum potsdam gfz center for space research at university of texas austin csr and jet propulsion laboratory jpl each using disparate methods and parameters to produce the monthly grace dataset the current solutions for data processing are the release 06 gravity field solutions rl06 in this study we averaged the three sources of spherical harmonic solutions to minimize the uncertainties associated with data processing to better compare the relationship between the river water storage variations and tws changes the equivalent water thickness averaged sh cm was converted into mass change grace shc gt by using the same equal area projection as we note a few occurrences of missing data in the dataset we linearly interpolated the data gaps based on the data of adjacent months and excluded the year 2018 records in the final time series 2003 2020 3 methods 3 1 reconstructing time series of water inundation areas of the ubr glad provides high accuracy long temporal coverage and continuous maps of global surface water and its monthly water history mwh data includes the monthly composite result of water body extractions from all available landsat images acquired from 2000 to 2020 however due to remote sensing sensor failures e g the failure of landsat 7 slc image collection strategies e g landsat 5 without satellite based recording equipment and long term commercial operation and observation conditions e g cloud occlusion the results of river extraction are incomplete in some months in the mwh data ju and roy 2008 these incomplete areas would seriously affect the integrity and continuity of the river water level results reconstructed based on the raw water area data thus these obviously incomplete river areas must be checked visually and quality controlled by manual editing after the automated extraction from the glad mwh data in this study we consider a straightforward method li et al 2021 by using river boundary water frequency wf threshold segmentation to supplement the incomplete river water area in this method the wf map of the ubr was first calculated using the glad surface water cover during the whole study period the wf was equal to the number of times a pixel was classified as a water body divided by the length of the mapped water series which can be calculated by using the following formula 1 wf wdc voc where wdc water detection count represents the number of the water body pixels located in the corresponding time and voc valid observation count represents the number of effective observations of the pixel in the corresponding time river beds with the lower elevation are earlier inundated thus with higher inundation frequency fassoni andrade et al 2020 changes in water frequency from the river center to the riverbank can be represented by the wf duration curve which is defined as the wf cumulative probability in decreasing order as shown in fig 2 the water body with a higher frequency is presented in darker blue and that with a lower frequency is shown in lighter blue pixels are classified as water only when their wfs are equal to or greater than the river boundary wf according to the spatial dependence principle anselin and getis 1992 adjacent pixels are more related to each other with gradually varying wf so the variation in the main river channel can be synthesized by the wf in each pixel of the ubr the incomplete river region was repaired by determining the water boundary inundation frequency of the remaining river areas more specifically the incomplete pixels were supplemented by determining the wf values greater than or equal to the minimum water frequency of the river boundary in the current month finally the complete ubr water area was reconstructed with the help of the wf map errors in water cover classification using the wf map segmentation might result in an overestimation of small water bodies that were wrongly extracted hence we determined the 5 percentile segmentation in the histogram of the incomplete water frequency raster image to reduce the mapping noise influence the implementation of the river boundary wf threshold segmentation has an essential prerequisite which requires that the remaining wf map includes the river boundary pixels thus we made a careful month by month inspection on all of the reconstructed river inundation areas and manually edited the seriously incomplete segments by referring to the temporally adjacent inundation areas 3 2 reconstructing monthly river water level records during 2000 2020 based on the complete monthly river extents between 2000 and 2020 the hypsometric curves the relationship between inundation area and water level at each of the near vs river reach can be established as reported in a previous study alsdorf 2003 the accuracy of the estimated water level based on the hypsometric curve method decreases with respect to the increasing lengths of corresponding river reach when exceeding a certain optimized length threshold through a series of tests in the study area the river area extents at the 5 km length segment around the vss are relatively optimal for establishing the hypsometric curves based on the monthly mean water level and area data for each 5 km river segment around the vss in the near synchronous time window the river hypsometry curves were constructed for all the vss see table 2 then we used the hypsometric curves in combination with the time series of monthly mean river area to reconstruct long term continues time series of monthly water level estimates for the period of 2000 2020 at the 24 vss in order to evaluate the reconstructed river water levels we compared the time series of water level with the hydroweb based water level data for six vss that have relatively longer period of altimetry measurements besides the two years 2019 and 2020 in section 4 1 and with the gauge based discharge data for three vss near the hydrological stations lazi yangcun and nuxia in section 5 3 3 reconstructing time series of river water storage variations during 2000 2020 due to the high elevation and narrow river widths of the ubr the water level and storage changes in different reaches vary significantly based on the locations of the 24 vss in the ubr the river was totally divided into 24 reaches with high fitting relationships between the water level and the area combined with the river hydraulic characteristics such as river width the slope of the water surface and shape frasson et al 2019 by using the time series of area and water level changes corresponding to vss we employed the pyramid truncated and pyramidal product estimation method to further estimate the change of water storage in each reach luo et al 2019 we simplified the channel section to the common trapezoid abileah et al 2011 in this study the river water storage in january 2000 was used as the baseline and the time series of storage change in the following months till december 2020 was calculated by comparing with this baseline on the basis of the above mentioned procedure the river storage changes in the ubr can be estimated using the following formula yao et al 2018 2 v 1 3 h 2 h 1 a 1 a 2 a 1 a 2 where v is the river water storage variation from elevation h 1 and area a 1 to elevation h 2 and area a 2 finally we sum up the water storage changes of each river reach to obtain the whole ubr storage change 4 results and analyses 4 1 cross evaluation of the reconstructed inundation area and water level of the ubr in order to evaluate the accuracy of the reconstructed river water inundation area the river areas were mapped by visual interpretation from the higher resolution sentinel 2 imagery monthly composite data for march july and october 2019 as the evaluation reference data fig 3 shows the reconstructed ubr water area with the river boundary frequency threshold segmentation method kappa coefficient producer accuracy pa user accuracy ua and overall accuracy oa parameters were used to quantitatively evaluate the results as shown in table 3 the pa and ua of water classification in drought and flood seasons were above 82 and the kappa coefficients of the three results were above 84 it suggests that the reconstructed river water inundation areas can be used for constructing the hypsometric curves with acceptable accuracy statistics about the hypsometric curves of the relationship between river water level and area at the 24 virtual stations are show in table 2 there is a high correlation between the inundation area and near synchronous water level for all the 24 vss cases with an average r2 of 0 84 it indicates that the hypsometric curve can provide a robust reconstruction of long time series of water levels for these vss in the ubr in the absence of gauged water level data in the study area we cross evaluated the reconstructed river water levels based on the hydroweb data at six vss vs10 vs14 vs16 vs20 vs23 and vs24 with relatively longer water level measurements the six vss reaches include straight and braided rivers with different widths as shown in fig 4 two metrics namely the correlation coefficients and rmse of calibration were used to evaluate the performance of reconstructed levels in this study beeton 2002 chai and draxler 2014 the r2 values at the six vss ranges from 0 68 to 0 91 and the mean rmse values are approximately 0 79 m our reconstruction results at four virtual stations vs10 vs16 vs23 and vs24 are highly consistent with that of the hydroweb data whereas at vs16 and vs23 large bias could exist in parts of the time series for example the two water level time series at vs16 displayed large disparities with the largest bias of 0 98 m in october 2018 a similar phenomenon was observed at vs23 with the largest bias of 3 30 m in january 2017 such significant biases may be associated with the complex geomorphologic and geometric features of the river reaches which induce larger uncertainties in river area mapping and satellite altimetry measurements particularly the vs16 and vs23 are braided reaches with wide and shallow water bodies located in a mountainous region with extremely steep terrains overall the reconstructed water levels are of good quality for most vss over the entire stretch of ubr while uncertainties can be large for narrow river reaches coupled with complex braided rivers 4 2 analysis of spatio temporal variation characteristics of river inundation areas our reconstructed complete monthly time series of the ubr water inundation area facilitates the analysis of the long term changes over the years 2000 2020 as shown in fig 5 overall the interannual water area changes displayed a first decreasing then increasing and final decreasing patterns the minimum annual water area was 563 44 km2 observed in 2009 and the maximum was 848 77 km2 observed in 2018 the river water areas showed evident seasonal variations the magnitude of which were diverse in different reaches of the ubr the annual averages of upstream midstream and downstream areas were about 170 89 km2 436 07 km2 and 73 68 km2 respectively in the flood season june to august the multi year averages of upstream midstream and downstream areas are about 240 85 km2 646 79 km2 and 93 52 km2 while in the dry season december to february next year the multi year averaged water area are 121 95 km2 288 84 km2 and 58 16 km2 respectively 4 3 analysis of the long time series of reconstructed river water levels fig 6 presents the time series of the reconstructed water levels for 24 vss in the ubr from 2000 to 2020 the results show that the river water levels peak in july or august the water level began to decline significantly in september accelerated downward from october through december and reached the minimum around january the water levels for the 24 vss in the ubr have a well defined seasonal cycle driven primarily by snowmelt since the late spring and high rainfalls in summer these seasonal level changes for different river reaches have amplitudes from 2 m to as much as 10 m each year in both the wet and dry seasons the magnitudes of water level fluctuations in the ubr have changed considerably since 2000 overall the seasonal amplitudes of water level for the 24 vss increased from upstream to downstream varying from 0 58 m to 6 92 m the ubr midstream has the most severe wind and sand disasters garzanti et al 2010 thus the widely distributed river island broad floodplains and flowing sand dunes may partially contribute to the relatively insignificant water level rise amplitudes for a few reaches in the midstream the water level changes are also probably affected by the convergence of the tributary discharge for example the influences on v14 and v15 from the lhasa river besides with the growing population and increasing anthropogenic activities the human water use may affect the water level fluctuations and variability 4 4 analysis of the time series of river water storage variation fig 7 a shows the grace derived interannual and intra annual tws changes in the brahmaputra basin in phase with the ubr water storage the monthly tws in the brahmaputra basin showed significant seasonal fluctuations with relatively higher level in summer and autumn the seasonal variation of the ubr river channel water storage was further compared with the annual amplitude of the grace derived basin wide tws to analyze the river contribution proportion fig 7 b shows the difference between these two seasonal cycles results suggest that the ubr has a contribution of approximately 9 43 to the basin wide tws changes in terms of inter annual changes the tws showed a significant downward trend during the past two decades in comparison the water storage in the river presents a slightly rising trend with obviously seasonal fluctuations the maximum and minimum water storage were observed in august 2016 and january 2002 respectively the grace based decreasing signal of tws changes could be mainly contributed by the substantial mass loss due to glacier melting brun et al 2017 shean et al 2020 5 discussion on the uncertainty and applicability of the long term river water level reconstruction due to the logistical difficulties of in situ surveying in the ubr there are only a few gauging stations distributed in the midstream and downstream of the ubr we collected the monthly discharge data of three stations the variations of river water level and discharge are usually considered to be temporally synchronized as reported in previous studies fischer et al 2017 frappart et al 2015 mohammed et al 2017 therefore we compared the reconstructed water levels of vs9 vs16 and vs23 with the runoff observations at nearby gauging stations lazi yangcun and nuxia as shown in fig 8 the results show that the intra annual and inter annual variations of reconstructed water levels generally agree with discharge observations at nearby gauging stations however the level of consistency between the reconstructed water level and gauged discharge data varies among the three vss higher consistency is observed at vs9 vs lazi with the correlation coefficient of 0 66 and vs16 vs yangcun 0 71 than that of vs23 vs nuxia 0 62 by referring to the river hydrographic and morphologic characteristics of the three stations the complex braided river channel and the mainstream convergence with the nyang qu one of the five primary tributaries of the ubr discharges could partially contribute to the poor performance of the vs23 result besides the satellite altimetry measurement uncertainties and the inherent discrepancy between water level and discharge estimates may also affect the evaluation result in order to demonstrate the applicability of our proposed approach in other poorly gauged river basins we extracted the monthly time series of river inundation area and established the hypsometric curve for the period january 2019 to december 2020 for reconstructing the monthly water levels 2016 2018 for one river reach with a gauging station the shentan station in the upper yellow river as shown in fig 9 both the reconstructed and hydroweb based river water level time series keep in good agreement in depicting the interannual fluctuations with the gauge based data for example the three time series consistently indicate the relatively low levels in 2016 and 2017 and the higher level in 2018 in comparison the reconstructed water level even has higher consistency with the gauge observations than the hydroweb data with a correlation coefficient of about 0 85 the reason probably lies in that our statistical reconstruction method based on the hypsometric curve can avoid the noise of direct altimetry measurements caused by the observational conditions or data processing algorithms e g altimetry waveform retracking overall our proposed method shows high potential in extending current river water level observations in the ungauged or poorly gauged rivers in remote areas 6 conclusions in this study we reconstructed the long term water area and level estimates of a poorly gauged river in the tp by a simple remote sensing based method the approach firstly derived river inundation area in the ubr between 2000 and 2020 then filled the missing part of water extent using the percentile cut method of water frequency histogram at river boundary subsequently by combining the satellite based water level observations at virtual stations the hypsometric curves on the area level relationship were established to extend the river water level series of the vss in the ubr results showed that the reconstructed water levels of vss in the ubr are in good agreement with the hydroweb water level changes with an average r2 of 0 79 the reconstructed water levels near the lazi yangcun and nuxia gauging stations were also cross evaluated in good agreement with the gauged discharge data furthermore the joint utilization of reconstructed water level and inundation area information to determine river water storage variations offers useful information about river hydrologic dynamics the changes in river water storage approximately account for one tenth of the net terrestrial water storage of the basin in conclusion the joint use of multi source remote sensing data will facilitate more densely and meticulous detection of long term river hydrologic changes in time and space the catchment scale monitoring of river water level and storage results provide scientific and technological bases in data scarce areas especially and are likely to benefit other ungauged or poorly gauged rivers in the tp and surrounding mountains credit

8024,study region this research paper focuses on the application of slug test on south african fractured rock aquifers and the applicability of the test to provide potential aquifer hydraulics the region of the study was petrusburg which is situated in the free state province south africa study focus the aim of the study was to develop a methodology to relate slug tests to a potential yield estimation therefore investigating and reviewing the applicability and accuracy of the slug test methodology in south africa applied on fractured rock aquifers as established in 1995 vivier et al 1995 the aim was achieved by reviewing the methodology applied for slug tests that are related to potential yield estimations vivier et al 1995 identifying the limitations of slug tests investigating the possibility to update the potential yield estimation method of 1995 and by investigating the possibility to relate slug tests by implementing two dimensional modelling to potential yield and transmissivity estimations new hydrological insight in the region it was determined that slug tests can no longer be used to relate the recovery time for 90 of the initial static water level s to the potential yield l s as an exact value but can rather be seen as an estimation tool to determine what potential yield in terms of ranges the investigation revealed that the use of simple homogenous models can be used to determine the possible transmissivity for slug tests and relate that transmissivity to a potential yield l s note that this is not an absolute and is subject to limitations keywords slug test potential yield transmissivity limitations and modelling 1 introduction one of the main objectives of a groundwater investigation is the determination of the potential long term yield of the borehole it might be prudent to briefly discuss different terms describing the volume of water from a borehole 1 1 blow yield this is the volume of water that is flowing from a borehole during the development component of the drilling phase it is by no means any indication of the long term sustainability of the borehole the development component of the drilling phase it is by no means any indication of the long term sustainability of the borehole 1 2 potential yield an estimated yield for a long term period but does not take boundary conditions into account 1 3 sustainable yield can be described as the long term yield that is sustainable and takes boundary conditions into account the potential yield is mainly dependant on the availability of groundwater that can be assessed by means of estimating physical parameters of the geological strata such as storage coefficient s value and transmissivity t value and the hydraulic gradient across the area rudolph et al 1991 different methods have been used for determining these parameters such as numerical modelling slug tests and pumping tests botha et al 1996 large scale pumping tests are one of the most effective and representative methods in the determination of these hydraulic parameters however large scale pumping tests have limitations such as being expensive and time consuming rudolph et al 1991 hvorslev 1951 was the first person to introduce the term slug tests in the field in hydrogeology where the method consisted out of the instantaneous lowering or raising of the water level in the borehole under investigation the recovery of the water level was recorded as a function of time and used for interpretations the slug test according to kruseman and de ridder 1991 is a common preliminary test for fractured rock aquifers that mainly aid in the estimation of potential yield the slug test method referred to by van tonder et al 2001 in this paper consists of a solid cylinder body that is submerged into the borehole which causes a displacement of water due to an increase of pressure in the borehole vivier et al 1995 the recession time for the water to recover to at least 90 of the initial water level is then measured for estimation purposes van tonder et al 2001 the data from this method was analysed in 1995 by vivier et al 1995 to establish a relationship of the recession time s taken to reach 90 recovery and the potential yield l s van tonder et al 2001 stated that in practice the slug test cannot be used for accurate estimations of the potential yield and should never be recommended to substitute for a pumping but can rather be a decision making tool to determine whether further tests should be done on the borehole under investigation rudolph et al 1991 ferris and knowies 1962 stated that due to the fact that slug tests are very short of nature the results are representative of a small volume of water bearing structures close to the borehole and are not representative of the entire aquifer this proves that the term sustainable yield cannot be related to slug tests as no boundary conditions can be identified by implementing slug tests the reason why slug test are such common preliminary tests are due to the simplicity of the prescribed method the fact that the equipment used for the test is relatively cheap and are less time consuming than large scale pumping tests vivier et al 1995 slug tests can assist in the determination of the pumping rates for the different steps of a step drawdown test and in the selection of the size of the pump to be used during the investigation vivier et al 1995 the aim of the article is to develop a methodology to relate slug tests to a more accurate potential yield based on scientific pumping test data and not in blow yield data as revealed from previous studies therefore investigating and reviewing the applicability and accuracy of the slug test methodology in south africa applied on fractured rock aquifers the objectives to reach the aforementioned aim are to review the methodology applied for slug tests that are related to potential yield estimations vivier et al 1995 identifying the limitations of slug tests investigating the possibility to update the yield estimation methodology of 1995 vivier et al 1995 and to investigate the possibility to relate slug tests by implementing two dimensional modelling to potential yield and transmissivity estimations 2 the slug test as previously stated a slug test is suggested as a preliminary test for high yielding boreholes to indicate the potential yield in terms of decision making instead of accurate predictions and can be applied to low yielding boreholes van tonder et al 2001 the high yielding boreholes are often associated with fractures whereas low yielding boreholes are associated with microfractures or primary porosity vivier et al 1995 the slug tests are most commonly applied to low yielding boreholes that are not ideal to perform large scale pumping tests on vivier et al 1995 the method used for the correlation between the recession time s of the water level to 90 recovery and the potential yield l s had a correlation coefficient of 0 93 which is 93 accuracy vivier et al 1995 but it was stated that the slug test has limitations in terms of the test not being able to identify boundary conditions such as impermeable boundaries that are a fair distance away from the borehole and therefore can lead to inaccurate predictions usually the slug test overestimates the potential yield of the borehole due to boundary conditions vivier et al 1995 this relationship established between the recession time seconds and the potential yield l s estimations was formulated by vivier et al 1995 using 32 boreholes as formulated in eq 1 van tonder et al 2001 the method outlines three main controlling factors as identified by vivier et al 1995 that limits the applicability of the method fixed borehole diameter of 165 mm prescribed volume of the slug and the recession time recorded for the slug test has to be acquired from the 90 recovery of the static water level 1 q 117155 08 t 0 824 therefore if these controlling factors are not met the method is no longer applicable to the borehole under investigation which indicates that the graph for the method fig 1 is no longer valid and should be recalibrated vivier et al 1995 vivier et al 1995 stated that problems were encountered during the slug tests data collection that could decrease the accuracy of the method problems such as the diameters of the boreholes not all being fixed at 165 mm and the fact that some of these boreholes were skew 2 1 the potential problem with the application of slug tests the limitations outlined in the previous section could be the reason why present day potential yield estimations do not accurately correlate with the yield obtained from pumping tests and calls into question the results obtained from slug tests additional limitations that should be outlined are that the volume and diameter of the slug used in 1995 were never recorded as well as the fact that according to dr vivier who is a co author of this paper the pumping tests performed in 1995 were not done therefore the yields of the 32 boreholes were never obtained through pumping tests but are blow yields obtained from the drilling contractor in case studies done it was found that when analysing the slug tests with the relationship obtained in 1995 that the yield determined through slug tests do not correlate to the yield of the borehole under investigation therefore the yield would be underestimated or overestimated by the relationship established in 1995 and would lead to inaccurate decisions being made 2 2 recommended solution for the application of slug tests when accounting for these limitations stated above the slug test analysis methodology could possibly be used for accurate predictions of the potential yield and possibly for the determination of aquifer parameters modelling software will be used to investigate the possibility to model slug tests to aid in the determination of parameters and potential yields 3 methodology 3 1 slug test data collection slug test data were obtained for 32 boreholes that were tested by students from the institute for groundwater studies igs prior to the slug tests a hydrocensus was performed for the collection of information on the boreholes the slug tests were all performed through the procedure of a solid cylinder body tied to a length of rope placed within a borehole with a fixed diameter of 165 mm the cylinder body displaces water where after the recession time was recorded for the water level to recover to 90 of the static water level dataloggers were used to ensure that all that measurements were recorded regarding the water level especially in cases of high yielding boreholes that recover quickly vivier et al 1995 these dataloggers recorded the water level at ½ second intervals slug test data was collected from the following sites in south africa as seen in fig 2 geluksdeel groothoek dam hillside knellpoort mariasdal noga s post paradys petrusburg rakhoi sediba springfontein thubisi and twee fontein the data obtained from the slug tests were analysed by using the sta example de lange 2019 where the time taken to reach 90 recovery and the water levels were recorded as seen in fig 3 3 2 constant discharge test data collection constant discharge tests were performed for a minimum period of 8 h to determine the potential yield van tonder et al 2013 the fc program for aquifer test analysis van tonder et al 2013 was implemented to analyse the pumping tests of the 32 boreholes under investigation as seen in table 1 a new relationship was established by using the potential yield from the pumping tests and the recession time for 90 recovery from the slug tests where a best fit line was developed by using regression statistics to best define the relationship between these two variables this led to the comparison of the new relationship to that obtained from vivier et al 1995 to investigate the correlation between the data 3 3 slug test simulation to obtain a new relationship by using finite element simulation system for subsurface flow and transport processes feflow dhi 1979 2019 as a modelling software the possibility of simulating a slug test was tested and compared with that of real field data obtained from petrusburg the original data collected from slug tests and constant discharge tests were used to simulate the exact same behaviour for the boreholes under investigation by using feflow the model output provided estimated parameters such as the s value storativity and the t value transmissivity these estimated t values were then calibrated with the original data collected from the field to establish a relationship rudolph et al 1991 stated that care should always be taken when evaluating and interpreting the s value since the error factor is quite broad even more so in fracture rock aquifers most of analytical solutions used to determine the aquifer parameters are designed for homogenous aquifers which indicates that in fractured porous media aquifers the movement of groundwater in various directions cannot be accounted for in these analytical solutions and may lead to inaccurate s value estimations botha et al 1996 this confirms the reasoning for not using the s value for the purpose of this study 4 feflow model 4 1 conceptual model for slug tests for the purpose of the study a simple two dimensional homogenous porous media aquifer model was designed in feflow the reason why a two dimensional model was created instead of a 3 dimensional model which is more representative of the movement of groundwater is to simplify the model for the computing requirements this is done by eliminating the direction of groundwater movement that is negligible botha et al 1996 the model has an extent of 2 5 km by 2 5 km with local refinements around the borehole to increase the accuracy of the values obtained from the model output as seen in fig 4 kindly note that due to the simplicity of the model a constant head boundary that represented the static water level was used to disregard the influence of boundary conditions the slug tests were modelled by rising the hydraulic head at the same level as the original slug tests data obtained from real field conditions which is above the static water level as seen in fig 5 4 2 slug test model calibration the simulation of the slug tests is carried out by applying the exact same time from the data logger to reach 90 recovery using the static water level as the constant head boundary value and the borehole head as initial hydraulic head value for the borehole under investigation the simulation output provides a series of hydraulic heads at the exact same time steps as the data recorded from the slug test preformed in the field as seen in fig 6 these hydraulic head values are used for calibration to test the accuracy of the model to provide similar hydraulic head values as the original data collected in the field as seen in fig 7 through the calibration of the slug test model the t values are changed to fit the modeled slug test hydraulic head values to the slug test hydraulic head values observed from the data logger this is done statistically through using the rmse as seen in table 2 root mean square error percentage which should be 10 for acceptable calibration 5 for good calibration by using the calibration method discussed above the process was applied to 8 boreholes in petrusburg on which slug tests and constant discharge pumping tests were performed the study area is characterized by typical karoo fractured rock aquifers which consist of sandstone shale mudstone and siltstone these lithologies have relatively low permeabilities which in turn leads to low yielding boreholes in general usher et al 2006 5 analysis of data as previously mentioned the results from the slug test model calibration provided estimated t values that best fitted the original slug test data obtained in the field according to the standard set for the rmse percentage the constant discharge pumping test data that was analysed using the fc program for aquifer test analysis van tonder et al 2013 to determine the estimated t values for these 8 boreholes under investigation used the following methods of analysis recovery t value theis late t value cooper jacob late t value and fc program early t value and late t value this led to the comparison of the estimated t values from the slug test model and the t values determined from the constant discharge pumping tests 6 results and discussion 6 1 new slug test relationship the data collected from 1995 vivier et al 1995 and the new data were combined to establish a new relationship between the recession time for 90 recovery s and the potential yield l s by comparing the data with one another it was found that no concrete relationship could be established since the data collected for the yield in 1995 was done by using blow yields therefore only the new data of the slug tests on the 32 boreholes could be used the slug test data analysed for 90 recovery of the initial static water level was compared to the yield determined from the fc program for aquifer test analysis van tonder et al 2013 to establish the new relationship as seen in fig 8 the relationship between these two variables recession time seconds and potential yield l s can be expressed by the equation below 2 where the r2 was determined as 0 4112 2 q 7 392 t 0 469 qmin potential yield minimum and qmax potential yield maximum were established to indicate the ranges where the relationship is valid as seen in fig 8 qmin and qmax were determined by taking the relationship established in eq 2 and adjusting the equation to fit the data as best as possible as seen in table 3 at variable 1 and variable 2 it is important to note that the relationship has been established on a log log scale as seen in fig 8 from the newly established relationship it can be concluded that the correlation of the recovery time s and the potential yield l s do not have a good correlation with a r2 of 0 4112 this indicates that the use of recovery time s of slug tests can no longer be used for the determination of the potential yield l s however the relationship can still be used as a decision making tool to test the borehole under investigation this relationship can only be applied by making use of ranges and not exact values as was used in 1995 vivier et al 1995 refer to table 4 6 2 the use of slug tests to determine the t value by comparing the estimated t value determined by modelling software feflow with the various t values from the fc program for aquifer test analysis van tonder et al 2013 the following tables were created table 5 table 6 the purpose of table 5 and table 6 is to compare the t value from the slug test model nm cal t with the t value from the fc program for aquifer test analysis van tonder et al 2013 according to rudolph et al 1991 the cooper et al 1967 model should be the superior method to any other method to analyse slug tests late time data is more reliable when using pumping test data which implies that the late time data is the focus of this study rudolph et al 1991 according to woodford and chevallier 2002 to analyse slug tests the only method to be applied is the cooper method and not the hvorslev or bouwer and rice method since the two latter methods provide a hydraulic conductivity which is scale dependent whereas the cooper method supplies a more accurate t value therefore the cooper jacob late t value is the value to be used as the final estimated t value table 7 from table 7 it can be determined that there is a correlation between the t values estimated from the slug test model and the t values determined through pumping tests analysis cooper jacob method according to kruseman and de ridder 1991 as the t value increases so does the estimated potential yield therefore when correlating the t value determined through pumping test data with the potential yield by using correlation statistics a linear relationship exists with a correlation of 98 and a r2 of 0 9672 97 as seen in fig 9 when correlating the t value determined through the slug test model and the t value determined from pumping test analysis a linear relationship was established with a r2 of 0 9526 95 and the correlation using correlation statistics is 98 as seen in fig 10 this indicates that when the t value of the slug test model and t value determined through pumping tests analysis which has a very good correlation with the potential yield have a good correlation it can be predicted that the t value of the slug test model will have a good correlation with the potential yield the relationship between the t value determined through the slug test model and the potential yield has a very good statistical correlation of 96 and a r2 of 0 927 93 this linear relationship can be seen in fig 11 this relationship between the t value determined through the slug test model and the potential yield can therefore be used for the estimation of the potential yield of a borehole under investigation for the purpose of visual representation digital data was generated and included in the analysis as seen in table 8 and fig 12 therefore fig 12 can be used to determine the yield from data collected in the field from a slug test simulated in a simple homogenous porous media aquifer and calibrated to estimate a t value which is then read off the linear graph using the linear relationship between the two variables this simple homogenous model is only a representation of a possible real field condition and therefore can only be a tool to estimate the potential yield and is therefore not an absolute thus the t value can be used if no information about the borehole is known and an estimated potential yield is needed for an indication on what to expect from the borehole given the limitations of the application of this method if this is not the case the method will still provide an approximation of the t value of the borehole under investigation and should be assessed with the necessary caution 7 conclusion slug tests remain preliminary tests to determine the hydraulic conductivity and to determine whether it is necessary to perform a pumping test on the borehole under investigation and should never be recommended as substitute to a pumping test since a slug test only tests a small volume surrounding the borehole kruseman and de ridder 1991 slug tests in south africa have been used to determine a first estimate of the potential yield of the borehole although the method has been problematic and providing non reliable potential yield values van tonder et al 2001 in conclusion it was determined that slug tests can no longer be used to relate the recovery time for 90 of the initial static water level s to the potential yield l s as an exact value but can rather be seen as an estimation tool to determine what potential yield can be in terms of ranges botha et al 1996 the investigation revealed that the use of simple homogenous models can be used to determine the possible t value for slug tests limitations are always included and relate that t value to a potential yield for 8 h l s it was stated by kruseman and de ridder 1991 that authors ramey moench and hsieh found that the t values estimated from slug tests were accurate to the t values determined from pumping tests analysis 8 recommendations the knowledge of slug test and the application of these tests in south africa can be expanded by investigating what values a heterogenous complex fractured rock aquifer model will produce since no aquifer is perfectly homogenous and simple kruseman and de ridder 1991 when this heterogenous complex model which accounts for fracture flow is designed then the t value can be much more representative if the fracture thickness is known and this will provide a more accurate t value estimation than the homogenous model the new non absolute relationship between the recovery time and the potential yield can be expanded to include more slug test data preferably high

8024,study region this research paper focuses on the application of slug test on south african fractured rock aquifers and the applicability of the test to provide potential aquifer hydraulics the region of the study was petrusburg which is situated in the free state province south africa study focus the aim of the study was to develop a methodology to relate slug tests to a potential yield estimation therefore investigating and reviewing the applicability and accuracy of the slug test methodology in south africa applied on fractured rock aquifers as established in 1995 vivier et al 1995 the aim was achieved by reviewing the methodology applied for slug tests that are related to potential yield estimations vivier et al 1995 identifying the limitations of slug tests investigating the possibility to update the potential yield estimation method of 1995 and by investigating the possibility to relate slug tests by implementing two dimensional modelling to potential yield and transmissivity estimations new hydrological insight in the region it was determined that slug tests can no longer be used to relate the recovery time for 90 of the initial static water level s to the potential yield l s as an exact value but can rather be seen as an estimation tool to determine what potential yield in terms of ranges the investigation revealed that the use of simple homogenous models can be used to determine the possible transmissivity for slug tests and relate that transmissivity to a potential yield l s note that this is not an absolute and is subject to limitations keywords slug test potential yield transmissivity limitations and modelling 1 introduction one of the main objectives of a groundwater investigation is the determination of the potential long term yield of the borehole it might be prudent to briefly discuss different terms describing the volume of water from a borehole 1 1 blow yield this is the volume of water that is flowing from a borehole during the development component of the drilling phase it is by no means any indication of the long term sustainability of the borehole the development component of the drilling phase it is by no means any indication of the long term sustainability of the borehole 1 2 potential yield an estimated yield for a long term period but does not take boundary conditions into account 1 3 sustainable yield can be described as the long term yield that is sustainable and takes boundary conditions into account the potential yield is mainly dependant on the availability of groundwater that can be assessed by means of estimating physical parameters of the geological strata such as storage coefficient s value and transmissivity t value and the hydraulic gradient across the area rudolph et al 1991 different methods have been used for determining these parameters such as numerical modelling slug tests and pumping tests botha et al 1996 large scale pumping tests are one of the most effective and representative methods in the determination of these hydraulic parameters however large scale pumping tests have limitations such as being expensive and time consuming rudolph et al 1991 hvorslev 1951 was the first person to introduce the term slug tests in the field in hydrogeology where the method consisted out of the instantaneous lowering or raising of the water level in the borehole under investigation the recovery of the water level was recorded as a function of time and used for interpretations the slug test according to kruseman and de ridder 1991 is a common preliminary test for fractured rock aquifers that mainly aid in the estimation of potential yield the slug test method referred to by van tonder et al 2001 in this paper consists of a solid cylinder body that is submerged into the borehole which causes a displacement of water due to an increase of pressure in the borehole vivier et al 1995 the recession time for the water to recover to at least 90 of the initial water level is then measured for estimation purposes van tonder et al 2001 the data from this method was analysed in 1995 by vivier et al 1995 to establish a relationship of the recession time s taken to reach 90 recovery and the potential yield l s van tonder et al 2001 stated that in practice the slug test cannot be used for accurate estimations of the potential yield and should never be recommended to substitute for a pumping but can rather be a decision making tool to determine whether further tests should be done on the borehole under investigation rudolph et al 1991 ferris and knowies 1962 stated that due to the fact that slug tests are very short of nature the results are representative of a small volume of water bearing structures close to the borehole and are not representative of the entire aquifer this proves that the term sustainable yield cannot be related to slug tests as no boundary conditions can be identified by implementing slug tests the reason why slug test are such common preliminary tests are due to the simplicity of the prescribed method the fact that the equipment used for the test is relatively cheap and are less time consuming than large scale pumping tests vivier et al 1995 slug tests can assist in the determination of the pumping rates for the different steps of a step drawdown test and in the selection of the size of the pump to be used during the investigation vivier et al 1995 the aim of the article is to develop a methodology to relate slug tests to a more accurate potential yield based on scientific pumping test data and not in blow yield data as revealed from previous studies therefore investigating and reviewing the applicability and accuracy of the slug test methodology in south africa applied on fractured rock aquifers the objectives to reach the aforementioned aim are to review the methodology applied for slug tests that are related to potential yield estimations vivier et al 1995 identifying the limitations of slug tests investigating the possibility to update the yield estimation methodology of 1995 vivier et al 1995 and to investigate the possibility to relate slug tests by implementing two dimensional modelling to potential yield and transmissivity estimations 2 the slug test as previously stated a slug test is suggested as a preliminary test for high yielding boreholes to indicate the potential yield in terms of decision making instead of accurate predictions and can be applied to low yielding boreholes van tonder et al 2001 the high yielding boreholes are often associated with fractures whereas low yielding boreholes are associated with microfractures or primary porosity vivier et al 1995 the slug tests are most commonly applied to low yielding boreholes that are not ideal to perform large scale pumping tests on vivier et al 1995 the method used for the correlation between the recession time s of the water level to 90 recovery and the potential yield l s had a correlation coefficient of 0 93 which is 93 accuracy vivier et al 1995 but it was stated that the slug test has limitations in terms of the test not being able to identify boundary conditions such as impermeable boundaries that are a fair distance away from the borehole and therefore can lead to inaccurate predictions usually the slug test overestimates the potential yield of the borehole due to boundary conditions vivier et al 1995 this relationship established between the recession time seconds and the potential yield l s estimations was formulated by vivier et al 1995 using 32 boreholes as formulated in eq 1 van tonder et al 2001 the method outlines three main controlling factors as identified by vivier et al 1995 that limits the applicability of the method fixed borehole diameter of 165 mm prescribed volume of the slug and the recession time recorded for the slug test has to be acquired from the 90 recovery of the static water level 1 q 117155 08 t 0 824 therefore if these controlling factors are not met the method is no longer applicable to the borehole under investigation which indicates that the graph for the method fig 1 is no longer valid and should be recalibrated vivier et al 1995 vivier et al 1995 stated that problems were encountered during the slug tests data collection that could decrease the accuracy of the method problems such as the diameters of the boreholes not all being fixed at 165 mm and the fact that some of these boreholes were skew 2 1 the potential problem with the application of slug tests the limitations outlined in the previous section could be the reason why present day potential yield estimations do not accurately correlate with the yield obtained from pumping tests and calls into question the results obtained from slug tests additional limitations that should be outlined are that the volume and diameter of the slug used in 1995 were never recorded as well as the fact that according to dr vivier who is a co author of this paper the pumping tests performed in 1995 were not done therefore the yields of the 32 boreholes were never obtained through pumping tests but are blow yields obtained from the drilling contractor in case studies done it was found that when analysing the slug tests with the relationship obtained in 1995 that the yield determined through slug tests do not correlate to the yield of the borehole under investigation therefore the yield would be underestimated or overestimated by the relationship established in 1995 and would lead to inaccurate decisions being made 2 2 recommended solution for the application of slug tests when accounting for these limitations stated above the slug test analysis methodology could possibly be used for accurate predictions of the potential yield and possibly for the determination of aquifer parameters modelling software will be used to investigate the possibility to model slug tests to aid in the determination of parameters and potential yields 3 methodology 3 1 slug test data collection slug test data were obtained for 32 boreholes that were tested by students from the institute for groundwater studies igs prior to the slug tests a hydrocensus was performed for the collection of information on the boreholes the slug tests were all performed through the procedure of a solid cylinder body tied to a length of rope placed within a borehole with a fixed diameter of 165 mm the cylinder body displaces water where after the recession time was recorded for the water level to recover to 90 of the static water level dataloggers were used to ensure that all that measurements were recorded regarding the water level especially in cases of high yielding boreholes that recover quickly vivier et al 1995 these dataloggers recorded the water level at ½ second intervals slug test data was collected from the following sites in south africa as seen in fig 2 geluksdeel groothoek dam hillside knellpoort mariasdal noga s post paradys petrusburg rakhoi sediba springfontein thubisi and twee fontein the data obtained from the slug tests were analysed by using the sta example de lange 2019 where the time taken to reach 90 recovery and the water levels were recorded as seen in fig 3 3 2 constant discharge test data collection constant discharge tests were performed for a minimum period of 8 h to determine the potential yield van tonder et al 2013 the fc program for aquifer test analysis van tonder et al 2013 was implemented to analyse the pumping tests of the 32 boreholes under investigation as seen in table 1 a new relationship was established by using the potential yield from the pumping tests and the recession time for 90 recovery from the slug tests where a best fit line was developed by using regression statistics to best define the relationship between these two variables this led to the comparison of the new relationship to that obtained from vivier et al 1995 to investigate the correlation between the data 3 3 slug test simulation to obtain a new relationship by using finite element simulation system for subsurface flow and transport processes feflow dhi 1979 2019 as a modelling software the possibility of simulating a slug test was tested and compared with that of real field data obtained from petrusburg the original data collected from slug tests and constant discharge tests were used to simulate the exact same behaviour for the boreholes under investigation by using feflow the model output provided estimated parameters such as the s value storativity and the t value transmissivity these estimated t values were then calibrated with the original data collected from the field to establish a relationship rudolph et al 1991 stated that care should always be taken when evaluating and interpreting the s value since the error factor is quite broad even more so in fracture rock aquifers most of analytical solutions used to determine the aquifer parameters are designed for homogenous aquifers which indicates that in fractured porous media aquifers the movement of groundwater in various directions cannot be accounted for in these analytical solutions and may lead to inaccurate s value estimations botha et al 1996 this confirms the reasoning for not using the s value for the purpose of this study 4 feflow model 4 1 conceptual model for slug tests for the purpose of the study a simple two dimensional homogenous porous media aquifer model was designed in feflow the reason why a two dimensional model was created instead of a 3 dimensional model which is more representative of the movement of groundwater is to simplify the model for the computing requirements this is done by eliminating the direction of groundwater movement that is negligible botha et al 1996 the model has an extent of 2 5 km by 2 5 km with local refinements around the borehole to increase the accuracy of the values obtained from the model output as seen in fig 4 kindly note that due to the simplicity of the model a constant head boundary that represented the static water level was used to disregard the influence of boundary conditions the slug tests were modelled by rising the hydraulic head at the same level as the original slug tests data obtained from real field conditions which is above the static water level as seen in fig 5 4 2 slug test model calibration the simulation of the slug tests is carried out by applying the exact same time from the data logger to reach 90 recovery using the static water level as the constant head boundary value and the borehole head as initial hydraulic head value for the borehole under investigation the simulation output provides a series of hydraulic heads at the exact same time steps as the data recorded from the slug test preformed in

as seen in fig 7 through the calibration of the slug test model the t values are changed to fit the modeled slug test hydraulic head values to the slug test hydraulic head values observed from the data logger this is done statistically through using the rmse as seen in table 2 root mean square error percentage which should be 10 for acceptable calibration 5 for good calibration by using the calibration method discussed above the process was applied to 8 boreholes in petrusburg on which slug tests and constant discharge pumping tests were performed the study area is characterized by typical karoo fractured rock aquifers which consist of sandstone shale mudstone and siltstone these lithologies have relatively low permeabilities which in turn leads to low yielding boreholes in general usher et al 2006 5 analysis of data as previously mentioned the results from the slug test model calibration provided estimated t values that best fitted the original slug test data obtained in the field according to the standard set for the rmse percentage the constant discharge pumping test data that was analysed using the fc program for aquifer test analysis van tonder et al 2013 to determine the estimated t values for these 8 boreholes under investigation used the following methods of analysis recovery t value theis late t value cooper jacob late t value and fc program early t value and late t value this led to the comparison of the estimated t values from the slug test model and the t values determined from the constant discharge pumping tests 6 results and discussion 6 1 new slug test relationship the data collected from 1995 vivier et al 1995 and the new data were combined to establish a new relationship between the recession time for 90 recovery s and the potential yield l s by comparing the data with one another it was found that no concrete relationship could be established since the data collected for the yield in 1995 was done by using blow yields therefore only the new data of the slug tests on the 32 boreholes could be used the slug test data analysed for 90 recovery of the initial static water level was compared to the yield determined from the fc program for aquifer test analysis van tonder et al 2013 to establish the new relationship as seen in fig 8 the relationship between these two variables recession time seconds and potential yield l s can be expressed by the equation below 2 where the r2 was determined as 0 4112 2 q 7 392 t 0 469 qmin potential yield minimum and qmax potential yield maximum were established to indicate the ranges where the relationship is valid as seen in fig 8 qmin and qmax were determined by taking the relationship established in eq 2 and adjusting the equation to fit the data as best as possible as seen in table 3 at variable 1 and variable 2 it is important to note that the relationship has been established on a log log scale as seen in fig 8 from the newly established relationship it can be concluded that the correlation of the recovery time s and the potential yield l s do not have a good correlation with a r2 of 0 4112 this indicates that the use of recovery time s of slug tests can no longer be

determined by modelling software feflow with the various t values from the fc program for aquifer test analysis van tonder et al 2013 the following tables were created table 5 table 6 the purpose of table 5 and table 6 is to compare the t value from the slug test model nm cal t with the t value from the fc program for aquifer test analysis van tonder et al 2013 according to rudolph et al 1991 the cooper et al 1967 model should be the superior method to any other method to analyse slug tests late time data is more reliable when using pumping test data which implies that the late time data is

between the t value determined through the slug test model and the potential yield can therefore be used for the estimation of the potential yield of a borehole under investigation for the purpose of
